<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In addition to the selection list that was distributed this morning there is a supplementary list, which is available in the Room. It shows the provisional selection of amendments up to the end of schedule 22.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I wish to clarify what I said this morning when we were discussing amendments Nos. 198, 199 and 235. I said correctly that concerns about venture capital backing were considered during the consultation period, but that no practical suggestions had emerged. I am not disputing the accuracy of the record of our proceedings, but I may then have mistakenly said that such matters had not been raised during consultation. I should have said that an answer had not been found during the consultation process. The official way in which to put the record straight is to do so now.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the Minister rightly said, she has now corrected the record and I thank her for doing so.

<H4><center>Schedule 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Enterprise management incentives</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day], No. 216, in page 325, line 32, leave out ``ceasing to meet'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`not meeting for a period of more than six months'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 217, in page 325, leave out lines 43 to 45.

<P>
No. 221, in page 325, leave out lines 46 and 47.

<P>
No. 218, in page 326, leave out from line 29 to line 7 on page 327.

<P>
No. 222, in page 327, leave out lines 8 to 25.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I welcome you to the Chair, Dr. Clark. The essence of the argument that I was making earlier was that disqualification is extremely draconian for those who have enterprise management incentive options and that no harm will be done by allowing a sensible grace period of six months to correct something that may have caused inadvertent disqualification. We consider that the immediate draconian disqualification if there are changes in the share capital structure will also cause trouble. We understand the tax avoidance motives behind the provisions, but such matters could be dealt with severely. Amendment No. 216 is the most important amendment in the group. It provides the period of grace.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I wish to confirm that there is a 40-day period of grace under the Bill, which is also the subject of the next amendment. The relaxation provision under the amendment goes too far. It would allow companies to undertake non-qualifying activities, including no activity at all-for a longer time than qualifying activities, in fact. For example, companies would be able to carry on qualifying activity for a month and a non-qualifying activity for six months and so on. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> A more serious point will arise when we discuss the next amendment, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 224, in page 328, line 28, leave out ``40 days'' and insert ``six months''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 225, in page 329, line 29, leave out ``40 days'' and insert ``six months''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The provision in the Bill removes EMI benefits from those that have been awarded options when a disqualifying event takes place and the option is not exercised within 40 days of the event. We accept the need for a removal of benefit for a disqualifying event, albeit with sensible and adequate notice and subject to a discussion of what those events should be. However, 40 days is not an appropriate or sufficient period. Market practice incentive schemes invariably allow up to six months for an option to be exercised. An individual might be overseas on business for a period of three or four weeks and unjustly robbed as a result of the 40-day period. Using the more standard six-month period for existing options would not offer tax avoidance opportunities or cost the Revenue a material sum of money. That too brief period represents a practical flaw in the schedule, imposes a much tighter and potentially tricky deadline, and should be amended to reflect well-established market practice.

<P>
Amendment No. 224 relates to income tax and amendment No. 225 to capital gains tax. We urge the Government to accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> EMI is a generous tax relief and needs to be carefully targeted. I return to a theme of this morning, as the hon. Gentleman returns to one of his themes. The EMI has been designed to help the higher-risk trading companies that are most in need of support in recruiting and retaining key people. If a company ceases to qualify, it no longer needs to use EMI options, so the special tax relief should cease. The option holder may have no control over the company's ceasing to qualify and I accept that, in such circumstances, it would be unfair for him to lose out on tax relief immediately, which is why the legislation allows him time to decide whether to exercise his option and retain the relief.

<P>
The 40-day period allows a reasonable time for the option to be exercised, without allowing the benefit of those reliefs to continue after the company or option holder ceases to qualify. I see no reason for extending the period to six months, as it would only serve to give the benefit of a generious tax relief when it is not warranted. The hon. Gentleman's example of someone who is away on holiday for two or three weeks-

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Or business.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Or on business. If a key member of staff were away for that period of time, I would imagine that he or she might be contacted and would then have 40 days in which do decide. That is a practical limit, and I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Exercising an option requires not only signing bits of paper but organising the money to subscribe. That is not something done lightly on the telephone from a business marketing trip in south-east Asia, for example. The Economic Secretary is being disingenuous in suggesting that it is something that can be easily done when one is abroad on business.

<P>
It would not be difficult to lengthen the period to one that would avoid unfairness. As it stands, there will be cases of great injustice that will become headline news. The Government will find out that all the bits of wire and pitfalls that lace what is in principle an excellent scheme will discredit it, and discredit the Government in the process.

<P>
We shall vote in favour of the amendment. It is a necessary and practical change. Like the significant venture capital committee that I have organised, I am surprised that the Government have proposed a good scheme but have seen fit to have thus laced it with all sorts of nasties.

Schedule 14 agreed to.

<P>
Clause 62 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>The corporate venturing scheme</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 227, in page 33, line 26, and end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`2A. A company (``the new shareholder'') may be an investing company, and shares (``the sale shares'') acquired by it may be relevant shares in relation to it, where the new shareholder purchases those shares from another company (``the old shareholder'') and

<P>
(a) immediately prior to that purchase the old shareholder was an investing company in relation to the sale shares;

<P>
(b) the purchase takes place during the period of restriction which relates to the sale shares; and

<P>
(c) the purchase has the consent of the company which, immediately prior to the purchase, was the issuing company in relation to the sale shares;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purposes of this Schedule the new shareholder shall be deemed to have subscribed for the sale shares, and the sale shares shall be deemed to have been issued, on the date that the new shareholder purchased them; and nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the withdrawal of any relief granted to the old shareholder under any other provision of this Schedule.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This schedule sets out all the rules and regulations relating to the new corporate venturing investment scheme introduced by clause 62. We have already touched on several of those regulations, which echo the regulations for the enterprise investment scheme and the enterprise management incentive scheme, which we have already debated. Those that remain are separate points.

<P>
Amendment No. 227 focuses on the form in which corporate venturing investors may invest. The Bill will create an unnecessary constriction by confining the form to subscriptions. An investor will not be able to take over a holding from an existing investor who wanted or needed for his own financial reasons to leave the scheme. In such circumstances, it would surely be mechanically much simpler to allow the new shareholder to buy the existing shares than to force him to subscribe to new shares and give the issuing company a headache over what to do about the existing shares in issue.

<P>
It has been argued that there would be no relief as the issuing company had received no benefit, but it would have received a benefit. It would have acquired a new, willing shareholder and its consent would be needed for the sale. No ready opening for tax avoidance would be created by our proposal, as the old shareholder would have relief withdrawn, and the new shareholder's period of shareholding would start from scratch from the date of acquisition.

<P>
Again, we have a broad principle. Are these bona fide measures to get enterprise going, or are they spin tied up with string to stop people from acting in a common-sense fashion?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am distressed to hear the lines that the hon. Gentleman is peddling on the subject. He heard me state our reasons frequently this morning. We intend not only to promote enterprise, although we are much in favour of enterprise generally, but specifically to promote enterprise in higher-risk small trading companies. He has repeatedly ignored the fact that that is the focus of the Government's efforts, and has ignored the problems with the business expansion scheme that I detailed this morning. They suggest the situation that can arise if there are not suitable, tightly focused criteria for the support given in such a context.

<P>
The purpose of CVS is to incentivise companies to provide finance for small, higher-risk trading companies with which they develop mutually beneficial commercial relationships. The principal incentive-an upfront relief from corporation tax-is available only when money is invested at full risk in a small company. That is why we required the investing company to subscribe for shares in the investee company.

<P>
The amendment would allow investment relief to be obtained by a company that purchases the shares from the investing company. The small company would derive no benefit under that transaction. The first investing company's equity interest in the company would be severed. That is completely contrary to the principles of the scheme. Corporate venturing is about one company developing an interest in another. We would not promote that if it were to facilitate a form of corporate pass the parcel, which is what the amendment would effectively do.

<P>
Furthermore, the amendment is fundamentally flawed. It could defeat the anti-avoidance rules, which withdraw investment relief when the investing company receives value from the issuing company. If an investing company lost its relief in that way, it would simply need to sell its shares to another member of the group, which would then get the relief back again. It is not difficult to see that that would enable relief to be given for intra-group transfers in circumstances where the original investment was returned to the original investing company.

<P>
I regret the fact that I have no hesitation in recommending that we reject this ill-conceived amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We do not agree that there is an opening for tax avoidance under our proposals. As soon as the original investor had sold, the relief would be withdrawn and lost.

<P>
The fundamental issue is that the Government have defined risk taking too narrowly. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) pointed out, the objectives of the schemes should surely be to create the opportunity for companies that have the ability to grow, to contribute to gross national product and to increase jobs. The objectives should be broader than the narrow risk-taking focus.

<P>
We will not press the amendment to a Division. There are ways around the problem, but it makes matters more complex. When companies are incentivised to invest under CVS, which we hope that they will be, they will want a practical regime. If they find that it is too complex tax-wise, it will not be the incentive that it is intended to be.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman intends to withdraw the amendment, as the cost of the provision could be substantial. He argued that an extension would be more effective. We believe that it would be less effective, a view that is based partly on the experience of what happened under the Conservative Government's business expansion scheme. We would not be spreading the light over a larger field, but moving it to a different corner of the field-a corner in which there is less risk because that is where the money will end up. We oppose measures to widen the scheme and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the amendment would lead not to a larger, more effective policy, but to a much less effective policy than that under the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I cannot resist responding to the Minister's last comment. She referred earlier to areas where it was easy to make money. Surely there is a spectrum of risk-reward in businesses. There are certain circumstances in which the risk is higher and the potential reward is higher, and vice versa. That is the nature of all forms of investment, listed or unlisted. There are no areas in which it is easy to make money and there never have been any. Such a phrase has normally meant areas of high risk-reward. If a business is lucky, it makes a lot of money. If it is not, it loses a lot of money.

<P>
The Economic Secretary seems to be saying that the intention behind the proposals is to concentrate money in areas of high risk-reward. That has some logic to it, but that was what was wrong with the BES. It concentrated money in areas of high risk-reward, which at the time meant property, from which a lot of trouble resulted. The spectrum of business areas that have potential for the future extends beyond those that are regarded as areas of high risk-reward; it goes wider than that.

<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 233, in page 340, line 31, after ``sub-paragraph (3)'' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and sub-paragraph (3a) below'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 234, in page 340, line 43, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The unquoted status requirement is not treated as not being met if at the time that the relevant shares are issued there is an intention or aspiration for any of the issuing company's shares, debentures or other securities listed or dealt in as mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of sub-paragraph (1) but this intention or aspiration has not been formed into a definite plan or arrangements which would involve such listing or dealing taking place before the expiry of the qualification period in relation to the relevant shares in question.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yet again, Dr. Clark! It is perhaps a truism that all unlisted companies are looking to float in the medium term and, more to the point, that every investor in an unlisted company might have been invited to invest on the basis that the issuing company, if it succeeds, will float after the expiry of the CVS qualification period. Where otherwise would be the exit? It could be by private sale, but the most likely and appropriate exit is normally a flotation.

<P>
Under the Bill, an offer on the basis of ``invest for three years and we will float after five years'' could disqualify the relief, unless it is made explicit that it does not. Unfortunately, the Inland Revenue is known for its unhelpful interpretation of whether an arrangement is in place and what it is an arrangement for. The amendments are, to some extent, probing amendments. We want confirmation that disqualification would not arise if, as we would expect, corporate investors were invited to invest on the stated expectation that the eventual out would be a flotation.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> One of the measures that focuses the relief through CVS on investments that are genuinely risky is the requirement that the investee company is unquoted when the investment is made, in order to prevent a ready market in the shares.

<P>
Our original intention had been to mirror the corresponding EIS provision and require the company to be unquoted throughout the qualification period. However, when we issued the draft Bill for consultation, fair representations were made that that requirement could act harshly in the case of a company that prospered following the investment and decided to request a stock market listing. We have therefore relaxed the requirement.

<P>
The rules that we have introduced in the Bill will not cause relief to be withdrawn if the company ceases to be unquoted after the relevant shares have been issued, provided no arrangements are in place at the issue date for any of its shares or securities to become listed. That will not prevent the company's directors from having the intention or aspiration to request a listing at some stage in future, but it will mean that an investing company will not be able to guarantee that it will have an exit via a stock market for its investment once the qualification period has come to an end.

<P>
The amendments would enable such a guarantee to be given, as they would permit investments to qualify for relief in circumstances in which the issuing company has made arrangements for its shares to become listed after the end of that period. That would result in tax relief being given when the risk has been significantly reduced, which would not represent good value to the Exchequer. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree and will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I said earlier, to a large extent, this is a probing amendment. The Economic Secretary has nearly given me the answer that I sought. However, in practice, when solicited, corporate investors will ask what the exit is, and the promoters of the unlisted company will almost certainly say that it is their aspiration and intention, if everything is going well, to list in five or six years' time. The amendment relates to what under the present wording could disqualify the investment but which is not the interpretation that has been given to those words.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Such aspirations will be acceptable. However, it will not be acceptable to have a definite plan that the day after the arrangements are made the company will be floated.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 236, in page 341, line 29, leave out ``an individual'' and insert

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Bill confines the CVS to unquoted companies in which 20 per cent. of the shares is held by individuals who are not employees or family members of employees-although, interestingly, it would not catch brothers and sisters, which may be a defect. How many will be caught? If 20 per cent. must be in the hands of outsiders, we should at least specify them and include corporate holders other than start-up funds, banks and trustees of employee trusts. Independence would still be ensured if the dependent-subsidiary amendment were carried.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The CVS is aimed at encouraging corporate venturing investment in small, independently owned companies. The ``individual owners'' requirement will help target such companies by excluding consortium companies that are owned entirely by companies and companies that are owned entirely by corporate investors, financial institutions and venture capital funds. The requirement will also help secure the independence of the issuing company from the investing company by requiring that at least 20 per cent. of the issuing company's ordinary share capital is owned by individuals who are not directors or employees of the investing company.

<P>
Even if amendment No. 236 were drafted in a way that made it clear which connections were prohibited-which it is not-it would frustrate that aim, because the meaning of ``person'' for the purposes of the Bill includes companies. We cannot, therefore, agree to the amendment.

<P>
We believe that the individuals holding shares will typically be the directors and founders of the investee company and their associates. In some companies, shares will be held on trust for the benefit of the employees, and we have no interest in placing such companies at a disadvantage in attracting investment through the CVS.

<P>
We had originally proposed that the minimum investment in ordinary shares of the issuing company by individuals who are independent of the investing company should be 30 per cent. The reduction to 20 per cent. is partly aimed at meeting concerns about shares held in trusts. We believe that 20 per cent. is reasonable-it will meet out objectives to target truly entrepreneurial companies, such as high-tech start-ups. It should be easy for such companies to exceed 20 per cent.

<P>
We do not, therefore, accept amendment No. 237, which, in any event, is seriously defective. It would allow the individual owner's requirement to be met if 80 per cent. of the shares in the issuing company were held by companies and the remaining 20 per cent. were held by a director of the investing company who happens to be a trustee of an employee benefit trust. That would entirely defeat the purpose of the requirement, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will appreciate. I hope that I will persuade him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am especially concerned about employee benefit trusts which, like employee ownership, the Opposition and the Government want to encourage. There is no better time to do that, in terms of the potential benefits to employees, than when a business is small.

<P>
I think that I heard the Economic Secretary say that the Bill should be interpreted to include employee benefit trusts. If so, I should be happy to withdraw the amendment. Will she clarify that?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No, I do not think that I said that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point, therefore, stands. Without including employee benefit trusts, the arrangements are defective. That is an unnecessary hassle in the arrangements. Are the Government willing to consider the matter?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not feel moved to consider the point at this juncture. If the hon. Gentleman writes to me on the matter, I shall consider whatever he sets out in his letter and respond accordingly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It is with sadness that I see the Treasury advisers nodding their heads. We would want to press the issue of employee benefit trusts to a vote. They should have been included and consideration should have been given to the matter.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(but not including any person who has control of the issuing company in circumstances where shares in that company remain eligible for relief pursuant to this Schedule)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If an issuing company has a single and insignificant subsidiary at any time during the investment period, it ceases to be eligible. Does the Treasury really want that provision to act as a constraint on the relief? It will hamper the issuing company's commercial freedom to develop. Our amendment-admittedly rough and ready-suggets an alternative. There are many situations in which modest and high-risk companies have subsidiaries.

<P>
Amendment No. 239 is a technical amendment. Section 840 control is look-through control. The line of control can be traced through a company to its shareholders and, if the shareholders are companies, the control can be carried to their shareholders in turn. Under the Bill, it would be possible for an individual to have control of the issuing company if he is, for example, a business angel or the brother of the sole director. Through that control, he has control of the subsidiaries and the issuing company, and thereby, immediately disqualifies the issuing company.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> We recognise the need for flexibility, so the rules require that subsidiaries should be only three-quarters owned by the parent or by another subsidiary. That provides a fair balance between the need for flexibility and our objective of targeting independent groups. I am not persuaded of the need for the amendments, especially amendment No. 238, which would make it easier to sidestep the rule all together by creating dormant companies. Nor do I see the need to add to the rules as proposed by amendment No. 239. The current rule prevents companies and others outside the group from controlling any of the subsidiaries. It gives the right result. A similar rule in EIS and VCT legislation has caused no difficulties. I reminded the hon. Gentleman about that, because it may have slipped his mind. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yes, I am sure that that had slipped my mind, but it is the job of the Committee to focus on the Bill and make it as good as possible.

<P>
I do not propose to press the amendment to a Division. The second amendment merits further consideration by the Government. It is not a political issue, but concerns a technical matter that the Government may not have intended to include in the Bill. To be candid, the Minister's point that a three-quarter owned subsidiary is permitted but a wholly-owned subsidiary is not, is complete nonsense. We await the Government to face the criticisms that may be made as a result of the restrictions. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 253, in page 345, leave out lines 44 and 45.

<P>
My simple question is why should preparing to carry on a trade not be treated as carrying on a trade? For better or worse, the amendment was promoted expressly by members of the Chartered Institute of Taxation.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment would allow companies that are preparing to carry on research and development activity to qualify under CVS. Small companies using the scheme must be carrying on a qualifying trade, be preparing to carry on such a trade or carrying on research and development from which it is intended to derive a qualifying trade. There is already special provision for research and development. That special rule is also a feature of EIS and VCT. Experience of those schemes shows that, even at an early stage, companies can demonstrate that they are carrying on research and development. The amendment is not necessary to bring such companies within the scope of the scheme, which may have been the hon. Gentleman's intention.

<P>
The rules for research and development, and for companies preparing to carry on a qualifying trade, already allow companies that are a step away from carrying on the sorts of high-risk trading activities that we are targeting to qualify under the scheme. To go further and bring in companies preparing to carry on research and development from which it was intended to derive a qualifying trade would introduce a more tenuous test. It could be open to abuse, as the nature of the activity could be nebulous. That creates difficulties for all sides.

<P>
We do not believe that the amendment is necessary. It could introduce a weakness into the scheme that might be exploited and would create uncertainty, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It seems to me that high-tech businesses are likely to raise money from such corporate angels, for whom their research and development activities will cost a lot of money. Therefore, at the time of raising that money, there will be preparations to carry on research and development. The Government may intend that the Revenue will turn a blind eye, and that it will be good enough if it has been suggested that staff contracts are lined up and so forth. Although it sounds rather too much, on the assumption that one would have to raise money before it could be implemented on research and development, one would be preparing while raising the money.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I reiterate what I said before, as it meets the hon. Gentleman's concerns. The rules already allow companies to qualify if they are a step away from carrying on the sort of high-risk trading activities that we are targeting. That is one step away; two steps would be a problem.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am satisfied with the step away and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 258, in page 350, line 44, after ``dividends'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but not including a case where dividends are not paid and the relevant shares may convert to shares of another class after the expiry of a period of time, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, at a rate which reflects the non-payment of dividends)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 259, in page 350, line 46, after ``redeemed'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(but not including conversion into another class of share in the issuing company, at whatever rate)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point of amendment No. 258 is to propose that it could be commercial to roll up dividends within some form of mezzanine debt. Do the Government want to prevent that, as such shares could easily qualify as ordinary shares within the meaning of the Taxes Act 1988? The general subject is flexibility of capital structure.

<P>
We would have thought that CVSs could apply to some form of convertible share related to results. Amendment No. 259 is a probing amendment to check that that would not sabotage the relief.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The CVS rules that determine the types of shares eligible for investment relief are modelled closely on those that have been used for the EIS and venture capital trusts.

<P>
Companies can issue shares that carry varying degrees of risk, and the common thread running through all the schemes is that relief is available only when the investor's money is at full risk. That is why the CVS requirements specify that, throughout the qualification period, the shares should not carry any redemption rights, any preferential rights to dividends or to the company's assets on a winding-up.

<P>
Amendment No. 258 would permit the shares to carry a preferential right to dividends in circumstances where they were not paid directly, but were ultimately received indirectly by way of an enhanced share conversion. That is not acceptable. It would provide the means for risk-targeting rules to be circumvented, so I have no hesitation in suggesting that it be rejected.

<P>
Amendment No. 259 is based on a misconception. The straightforward conversion of shares from one class to another when no payment is made does not entail the redemption of the original shares. Shares that carry converson rights will therefore not fail to meet the CVS requirements solely on account of that fact. There is no case for the amendment, as it would add nothing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I think that I am satisfied, especially on amendment No. 259. My question was, if the securities issued were a form of convertible share related to results, would they fall within what the Economic Secretary described in terms of not disqualifying relief?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, they would.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(other than a requirement incorporated in the articles of association of the issuing company that there be a transfer, reversion or forfeiture of shares in any given situation or a right of pre-emption on the occasion of any proposed transfer of shares, where such requirement is not incorporated for the purposes of enabling the investing company to receive value from the issuing company)'.<P>

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(but not including insurance relating to the provision of services as an employee or director to the issuing company or any company within its group by an individual who happens also to be an investor in the issuing company)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I should have thought that the Economic Secretary might already have encountered the fact that the boilerplate provisions in many standard company articles would disqualify the vast majority of companies. The amendment is designed to avoid that problem. I am sure that the Government do not intend that everyone should rewrite their standard articles to qualify.

<P>
Amendment No. 261 addresses a similar problem, which was also identified by the Chartered Institute of Taxation. Under the Bill, ``keyman insurance'' would disqualify the issuing company. If only from the point of view of an investor, not to mention the future of the company, I should have thought that it was desirable to encourage such insurance.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendments relate to the CVS provision dealing with arrangements offering pre-arranged exits and protection from normal commercial risk. They seek to prevent the operation of the provision in circumstances where normal commercial arrangements and agreements are being made.

<P>
Although each situation must depend on the particular facts, the requirements described by amendment No. 261 are, in normal commercial circumstances unlikely to fall within the categories of ``issuing arrangement'' caught by the provisions. Specific exclusion in that situation is not therefore required.

<P>
Amendment No. 262 refers to ``keyman insurance''. I assure Opposition Members that such insurance is already excluded from the scope of the anti-avoidance provision by virtue of the existing let-out for normal commercial arrangements.

<P>
I should add that the application of that anti-avoidance provision is one of the rules considered in giving advance clearance to an issuing company. An opportunity therefore exists for the company to establish with certainty whether the provision will apply before it issues any shares.

<P>
Therefore, neither of the amendments is necessary. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I believe that the Economic Secretary said that ``keyman insurance'' would not disqualify. On amendment No. 260, I simply asked whether the standard boilerplate provisions in most company articles could be disregarded for the purposes of qualification for relief. I am not sure whether the Economic Secretary's reply addressed that point.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has nothing to worry about in relation to those concerns.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 160, in page 354, leave out lines 8 to 10.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 161, in page 354, line 12, after ``Revenue'', insert:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that if the Revenue shall not have responded to a request for the grant of authority within 30 days then such grant shall be deemed to have been made'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My apologies, Dr. Clark; you are stuck with me for a while yet.

<P>
Amendment No. 160 was originally tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), and my name was added to it. It removes the requirement for companies to provide the Revenue with compliance statements before compliance certificates are issued. Amendment No. 161 effectively obliges the Revenue to issue the certificate within 30 days. If it has not done so, it shall be deemed to have been issued. There is no reason why the Revenue should not have to approve within a sensible period, and if 30 days is deemed too short, the period should still be defined.

<P>
In essence, amendment No. 160 is in the spirit of self-assessment of much of the rest of the Bill. It is strange that, in many other areas, the Government have refused the principle of Revenue pre-clearance, whereas, in this instance, they have insisted on it.

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): May I ask the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs whether, if he does not reply to constituents' letters within 30 days, they can assume that he agrees with whatever they wrote to ask him about?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I must boast that during three years as a Member of Parliament I have always replied, within three days, to every letter. My 30 years of commercial experience taught me never to go to bed until the day's work is done.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I will not trouble you with an account of my dealings with constituency correspondence, Dr. Clark.

<P>
Amendment No. 160 removes the requirement that an issuing company must provide the Inland Revenue with a compliance statement as part of the process enabling an investing company to claim investment relief, for which it needs a compliance certificate. Although the amendment appears to simplify, on closer inspection it achieves little.

<P>
The requirement for the Inland Revenue to authorise the compliance certificate will remain. That is necessary because the investing company must be confident that its claim to investment relief is correct. That company can be sure about the conditions of the scheme that it must meet, but it cannot verify that the conditions to be met by the issuing company, and by the shares for which it has subscribed, are satisfied. Those matters are outside the investing company's control, and the Inland Revenue cannot discuss them with it.

<P>
Our proposed solution is for the issuing company to let the Inland Revenue know what it has done, and, on the basis of that, for the Inland Revenue to authorise the issue of the certificate. The investing company can then be sure that the relevant conditions have been met. The information to allow that authorisation is needed in every case, and that is what the schedule provides for. However, that is the condition that the amendment seeks to remove. If it were removed, there would be no real benefit to the issuing company. The Inland Revenue must still authorise the issue of the compliance certificate, and it needs information to do so. The issuing company would therefore need to provide the information whether or not it was described as a compliance statement. Otherwise, the process would break down, and the investing company would be unable to claim relief. The hon. Gentleman cannot be advocating such a result. I therefore hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment No. 161 imposes a 30-day limit on the period within which the Inland Revenue must respond to the issuing company, whether by post or other means. I do not believe that such a change is necessary. Time limits for decisions on tax are of the greatest value when parties seek clearance in advance of transactions. Such transactions have their own timetables in which tax is only one element. That is why the advance clearance procedure for issuing companies provided by the schedule is subject to time limits.

<P>
We are discussing the claiming of investment relief after the transaction has occurred. The claim is one of many elements that will make up the investing company's tax returns. When the Revenue is considering the issuing company's compliance statement, the investing company may not be able to submit its return, as in most cases the accounting period in which the shares are issued will not yet have finished. Even when the accounting period is over, the company may wish to make full use of the time allowed to make its return. It is no more or less important to deal with that aspect of an investing company's affairs than with other issues affecting the issuing company's liability. Whereas we expect the issuing company to obtain advance clearance in most cases-a voluntary process that the company may or may not want to undergo-nothing material has changed. Little or no additional information will be needed.

<P>
The Inland Revenue agrees targets for dealing with correspondence, which will include the matters that we are discussing. The aim for 2000-01 is to reply fully to 80 per cent. of post within 15 working days. That is an improvement on last year's target of 28 calendar days. There is every reason to believe that companies will generally receive a service at least as good as that sought by the amendment. On that basis it is unnecessary, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I should like to add one point because it was not clear from what my hon. Friend said that he and I are in absolute agreement. It may strike the Economic Secretary that I am being unusually friendly to her, but sometimes one must sacrifice politics for the sake of truth. We unreservedly welcome the insertion of the advance clearance into the proposal. We would offer the Economic Secretary and her colleagues a string of unreserved welcomes if they were to introduce the same concept into a broad range of tax affairs. Much would be gained by the economy, although admittedly at the expense of time and effort by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise officials, if advance clearance became a normal process. I admit that the crooks will not seek it, but the honest people who do the right thing and often face genuine uncertainties and large ex post bills would benefit hugely from as quick and simple a system as the one introduced by the measure. We welcome it and look forward to seeing it in many other areas of tax legislation.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I note the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm for the measure, and hope that his hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) understood my point that it was entirely voluntary. He seemed to suggest that it might be otherwise. I welcome the support for the truth from the spokesman on the Opposition Front Bench.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am content with the Economic Secretary's response and I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The receipt of new shares as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above shall be treated as a subscription for relevant shares with a qualification period which commences on the day on which they are received, for any consideration given for them'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 262 simply makes it clear which part of the schedule has priority. Amendment No. 265 is also a clarification. Under the schedule, will an acceptable reorganisation cause a loss of relief? The amendment would make it clear that that was the case. Amendments Nos. 266 and 267 relate to rights issues. Why do the Government propose that those issues should be excluded? Would it not be possible to start running a new investment period?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> This is an interesting set of amendments. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman says that he seeks clarification because their purpose is occasionally unclear and they appear to be mutually contradictory. In fact, they might be thought ill conceived or even otiose.

<P>
Amendment No. 262 would provide for there to be no automatic withdrawal of investment relief when shares are disposed of in certain circumstances during the qualification period. Part IX of the schedule, which deals with company reorganisations, provides for the disposal of the shares to be treated as not being a disposal for the purposes of the scheme. The amendment is unnecessary because the provision that it aims to amend bites only when there is a disposal of shares for the purposes of schedule 15, and in the cases in question there is no such disposal.

<P>
Amendment No. 265 would provide for there to be no disposal or receipt of value by the investing company for CVS purposes when there is a reorganisation of the investee's company share capital. It is reasonable that any gain or loss should be crystallised when shares to which relief is attributable are fully or partly disposed of under such a reorganisation. The investment relief should accordingly be reduced or withdrawn if the disposal takes place during the qualification period.

<P>
The rationale for providing investment relief is to encourage investing companies to maintain their high-risk investments for at least three years. That aim would not be served if we overlooked an exchange of the original shares for qualifying corporate bonds, for example. That is by far the most common form of reorganisation entailing the disposal of original shares. Similarly, there is no reason why, for the purposes of the value received provisions, we should ignore a payment that is made to an investing company in consequence of a reorganisation of share capital, perhaps in recognition of rights carried by the shares. Those provisions withdraw or reduce investment relief when the investing company receives value back from the investee company before the end of the qualification period. Their purpose is to prevent relief from being given in circumstances when money just goes round in a circle. There is no cogent reason to adopt the change set out in the amendment.

<P>
The effect of amendment No. 266 is to treat shares comprised in rights issues and issues of non-corresponding bonus shares as the same asset as the original shares. That is not acceptable. The purpose of the special CVS rules that apply when there is a reorganisation of an investee company's share capital is to ensure that shares to which relief is attributable are tracked effectively. That is necessary because gains on such shares can qualify under CVS for deferral relief and losses can qualify for loss relief.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is obviously important that opportunities are not created for potential deferrable gains to be enhanced by the simple expedient of pumping value out of certain shares or securities in the company by means of a reorganisation into shares to which investment relief is attributable. Similarly, we want to stop movement in the opposite direction to prevent losses from being accumulated in such shares.

<P>
Amendment No. 267 is misconceived. First, it erases the provision that prevents gains from being deferred when relief shares are exchanged for qualifying corporate bonds. I have already explained why that would run counter to the scheme. Secondly, it provides for shares comprised in a rights issue to be eligible for investment relief. However, there is no need for such a provision. If shares are subscribed for in cash, whether they are acquired via a rights issue or otherwise, investment relief can be obtained if the other conditions of the scheme are met. It will probably not come as a surprise to the hon. Gentleman that I cannot support the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I did not at all understand the Minister's response, particularly to amendment No. 265. It is a probing point to obtain confirmation that what we call acceptable reorganisation, which is defined in part IX of the schedule, does not cause loss of relief and is not an unacceptable reorganisation. We assume that that is the meaning of an acceptable reorganisation under paragraph 80.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not believe that that is the meaning of the provision, but if it would be helpful to the hon. Gentleman, I shall write to him about it in more detail.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister. If other issues arise, I shall take them up in writing with her. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 263, in page 357, line 4, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) For the avoidance of doubt the following events shall not of themselves be regarded as a receipt of value from the issuing company:

<P>
(a) the listing or dealing in shares as mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 16(1) above;

<P>
(b) the conversion of relevant shares into shares of another class, at whatever rate, in accordance with the rights attaching to them.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear what will be caught. The amendment would exclude flotations and conversions.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of the event of a company's shares becoming listed on the stock exchange being construable as a receipt of value from the company for CVS purposes. Likewise, if the relevant shares are converted into other shares, that event will not in itself constitute a receipt of value. The question of whether the value is received or whether part-disposal of the relevant shares gives rise to the reduction or withdrawal of investment relief will be determined by the precise terms of the transaction.

<P>
I am not prepared to be drawn into a detailed technical discussion of the various possibilities involved. However, it might help if I were to reaffirm that, as I mentioned in discussing amendment No. 259, we do not regard the straightforward conversion of shares into shares of a different class as a redemption of the original shares. Therefore the CVS rules that treat the repayment, redemption or repurchase of shares as constituting a receipt of value will not bite on the conversion. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that helpful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I believe that the Economic Secretary confirmed my point that under the Bill as drafted such quotations and conversions will not be caught. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> For a company that has invested under the CVS to retain its investment relief, it must hold the shares to which it subscribed throughout the qualification period. One way for a company to sidestep that requirement would be to grant put or call options. The Bill therefore contains an anti-avoidance rule that provides for investment relief to be withdrawn when an option is granted.

<P>
The amendment would preserve relief when an option is granted in connection with the obtaining of a stock market listing for the company in which the investment was made. The increased risk of the scheme being misused and the additional length and complexity of the anti-avoidance rule that would result from allowing for special cases make weakening the rule unattractive. However, the amendment seems especially inappropriate. A successful stock market flotation provides a ready exit for the investing company once the qualification period has ended, making the use of options unnecessary. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that helpful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The latter point is helpful. The wording of the amendment may be rather obscure, but the focus of my question was whether vendor placing arrangements would cause the CVS to fall foul.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall couple my correspondence to the hon. Gentleman with a response to that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 268, in page 379, leave out lines 14 to 17.

<P>
Our understanding is that under the Bill as drafted, if the company issues the shares before the Inland Revenue issues a clearance certificate, the Revenue can discontinue the claim for that certificate, which seems unnecessary. There may be good commercial reasons why the company cannot wait while the Revenue gets its act together, so the amendment addresses those circumstances through deletion. It may be unnecessary if my first presumption is unintended.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary. The provision that it amends allows a small company that wants to make use of CVS to obtain advance clearance from Inland Revenue, which ensures that the shares that it proposes to issue will meet the requirements of the scheme. It is intended to give the company reassurance before it goes ahead and issues the shares. The provision for advance clearance has been welcomed in the consultation on the scheme.

<P>
If the shares are issued before Inland Revenue completes consideration of the small company's application, as in the hon. Gentleman's case, the legislation allows the Revenue to cease further work on the application. That is sensible because a clearance at that stage would not fulfil its basic purpose. I understand that there may be a reason why matters suddenly progress and take a particular course. It does not mean that the small company cannot check that it has met the requirements of the scheme, because the company will issue a compliance statement to the Revenue stating that, in its view, the requirements of the scheme are met in respect of the shares and of the company. If the Revenue agrees, it will authorise the company to issue a compliance notice to that effect to any investing company, so that the relevant tax relief can be claimed. There is no need for the Revenue to complete the advance clearance.


<P>
Now that I have explained the position, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. It is possible for work to be carried forward. The Revenue could continue with its work. The provision is to make life simpler for everyone, and the amendment would not help to promote that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for her response, which satisfies me that my concern will be dealt with. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 269, in page 382, leave out lines 16 to 23.

<P>
Paragraph 101 gives the Treasury unilateral powers to vary primary legislation-surely not what this House would deem to be appropriate. The amendment would delete it. If our understanding is incorrect, will the Minister be kind enough to explain it?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The regulation-making power that the amendment seeks to remove is modest. It allows for changes to the non-financial activities requirement, which excludes financial companies from taking advantage of the scheme as investors; for changes to the trading activities requirement, which excludes lower-risk trading companies from benefiting as investee companies; and for changes to the figures used in the gross assets test defining which companies count as small for this purpose.

<P>
The power confers greater flexibility in making changes in those areas without having to wait for a Finance Bill. For example, if we found that tax-relieved funds under the scheme were being channelled into low-risk trading activities that were within the scope of the scheme because of a weakness in the trading activities requirements, we could amend that requirement quickly before any real damage was done.

<P>
The power is quite circumscribed and there is no question of using it to make fundamental changes to the structure or overall objectives of the scheme, or to change its rules retrospectively. Similar powers are provided for EIS and VCT. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am certainly not happy about unilateral powers to vary primary legislation. I was unaware that the same powers already applied to EIS. I appreciate the reasons given by the Minister and we shall not press the issue to a Division. Nevertheless, the Committee should realise that an important precedent is being established. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
There are already several meanings and bases for calculation of the term ``market value'' in the legislation. Would it not make sense to consolidate them where possible with the definition most frequently used and easily understood? The definition in the provision arguably overvalues assets by ignoring charges secured on them.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The definition of market value used in schedule 15 was chosen because it is the same as that used in the enterprise investment scheme. As a matter of policy, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. We try to keep the detailed rules of venture capital schemes in line as far as possible. As a practical matter, that is helpful for investors in all three schemes who may invest in the same company. I am advised that replacing the definition used for capital gains purposes would not give the taxpayers concerned any additional advantages.

<P>
If the amendment were accepted, the definition of market value for the purposes of the CVS would be different from that used for the EIS. That is undesirable. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that and withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I take the latter point, but the subject of putting everything on the same basis is perhaps worth the Treasury's bearing in mind in future. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

It has been proposed in relation to VCTs that to permit mergers may be beneficial to the underlying businesses in which they are invested. The same is true of companies qualifying under the EIS. The amendment seeks to provide for a merger in such circumstances, and in doing so slightly anticipates the next part of the Bill. It would be foolish to allow an incentive for enterprise to restrict the healthy development of a business. That would not be such a big problem in the initial period, as is also true for the initial period of VCTs. As the volume of EIS companies and VCTs develops, there will be a natural tendency and need for mergers.

<P>
The sequence of the Bill is unfortunate, as I think that we shall have a slightly fuller response from the Government on the issue of mergers and VCTs.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The amendment would introduce into the EIS a regulation-making power to provide for share exchange similar to that being introduced for VCTs by paragraph 8. I accept that in principle an EIS investor's tax relief could be lost as a result of the share exchange, as could a VCT investor's relief. However, that is less likely to occur for EIS in practice as its conditions will now have to be met for only three years, whereas the conditions that apply to VCT have to be met at all times.

<P>
Providing for the consequences of an EIS investor receiving new shares in exhange for an existing investment would be more complex and would not simply be a case of duplicating the solution provided for VCTs with some minor adjustment as the amendment seeks to do.

<P>
With EIS, because of the interaction between income tax relief and capital gains tax relief, additional consequential and probably complex changes would be needed to capital gains tax legislation and the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, and further safeguards may have to be introduced. The amendment is defective in that respect. Indeed, it is inadequate even for income tax relief. It would not produce the result that the hon. Gentleman had intended. The VCT provisions were introduced in response to representations from the VCT industry that share exchanges were becoming a particular problem for them. We have not received similar representations in relation to EIS, so we try to keep the rules of the venture capital schemes in line as far as it is posible and sensible to do so.

<P>
If we are provided with evidence of situations in which share-for-share exchanges within the three-year period cause problems for EIS investors, we would be willing to consider parallel provisions for EIS. However, the legislation involved would be longer and much more complex than that for VCTs. Some criticism has already been made of the complexity of EIS. We need to be convinced that there was a significant problem with share exchanges under EIS and that the size of the problem justified introducing the necessary legislation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands our position and accepts why we are reluctant to go down the path that he is advocating.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for her response and I accept that the reduction to three years is an alternative solution for investors. If an EIS company merges purely for technical reasons, my only worry is that it might be disqualified on an on-going basis as an EIS. If that were the case, I see the need for a simple technical solution to the problem. However, perhaps the subject is too complex to discuss in Committee. I agree with the provision as it stands from the perspective of the investor, but it would clearly be undesirable if a company lost its ability to qualify as an EIS purely on technical grounds rather than because of its size, what it is doing and so on. Perhaps the Minister can say whether that is or is not the case.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is a matter of whether there is a problem. No representations on that score have been made. Ultimately, it is a matter of balancing the complexity of what we would have to do and the complications that that would build into the scheme for everyone against the possible disbenefits to a few if we were not to take such action. As I said, we must consider that there was a significant problem before we were prepared to tackle it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 289, in page 395, line 11, leave out ``issued'' and insert ``acquired.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The two amendments would enable VCTs to merge without disqualifying the resultant VCT. They address not the specific position of the shareholder, but that of the VCT. I believe that Government amendment No. 287, which we shall discuss next, takes a more superior approach to achieve the same result. If that is the case, I should regard it as satisfactory.

<P>
I shall run through the technicalities. The VCT field has been going for more than five years and there are commercial pressures for consolidation. The amendment would facilitate that by providing a look-through for the acquiring VCT. The shares and the target VCT would be ignored and the underlying acquired investments would be deemed to have been made by the acquirer. Otherwise, the takeover would cause loss of VCT status for the acquirer and prevent consolidation. The amendment would protect shareholding investors in a failing VCT by providing carry-over of the original investment into the new VCT without loss of status. Otherwise, personal tax effects would be disproportionate and there would be a disproportionate influence on decisions about whether VCTs should be taken over. Clearly, it is in the interests of unquoted failing companies to have financially sound investors.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I would just like to clarify the position regarding Government amendment No. 287, which should help the hon. Gentleman. That amendment deals with exchanges of shares held in investee small higher-risk trading companies in the companies themselves, whereas his amendments deal with exchange of shares in VCTs. They are not different versions of the same amendment. He raised the issue in correspondence with my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary in April, and my hon. Friend the Paymaster General responded last month-it is an all-star cast.

<P>
I accept that the VCT legislation currently makes no provision for these circumstances and that it would be difficult for one VCT to take over another without putting at risk its approved status and the tax relief of investors in both VCTs. That is because VCTs must have at least 70 per cent. of their funds in qualifying holdings and those of the VCT that was taken over would not count as qualifying holdings in the hands of the acquiring VCT.

<P>
The issue has not been raised with us before; nor has it been raised with the Inland Revenue in its regular meetings with representatives of the venture capital industry. I shall ask the Inland Revenue to discuss it with the industry and to report back to Treasury Ministers. We will need to be convinced that amalgamations of VCTs are desirable in principle and that the circumstances in which amalgamations would help to further the objectives of the scheme and be in the interests of investors are likely to occur frequently enough to justify making legislative provision for them. Opposition Members have criticised the length of the Finance Bill, but they do not hesitate to add to it.

<P>
I assume that amendment No. 289 is intended to ensure that when a takeover occurs, the three-year period for which investors must hold shares to qualify for income tax relief will not be interrupted. As drafted, however, it would apply to any VCT share acquired second hand, even though such acquisitions do not attract income tax relief. In the light of those remarks, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am aware that three firms of lawyers, which I could name, approached the Inland Revenue on this issue over the past year. The matter has been raised extensively with me by venture capitalists over the past six months. The reason is that VCTs are maturing. When they were first started, no one envisaged any changes: everyone accepted that they had to sit on them for five years and see what happened. Some have done well, others less well. Natural market pressures highlight the need to consolidate and tidy up, especially in the case of the less successful ones. We now need legislation to facilitate that tidying up.

<P>
I had hoped that the Government were trying to find their own solution. The technical problem that the Economic Secretary explained is simple, and amendment No. 288 would easily deal with it. I therefore cannot envisage any objection to accepting it, and would want to press it to a Division.

<P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am suprised by the hon. Gentleman's response. I have offered to discuss the matter, and we are open to such discussions. I am merely relaying out best understanding of whether we have received any representations. It is of course possible that they have ended up somewhere surprising, but officials dealing with the matter are not aware of having received any representations from the industry. We should be interested in having a dialogue with anyone who wanted one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary. As the issue had been raised with me, I raised it well in advance of our consideration of the Bill. Merely for the sake of clarity, is she saying that, subject to further discussions between the Treasury and members of the industry, the Government are in principle willing to consider such measures to tackle the problem, or merely that they are happy to discuss the matter?

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall clarify one point for the hon. Gentleman. We have received no representations from the industry. We are aware of one inquiry-not three-from a solicitor who does not seem directly to represent the industry.

<P>
We are open to discussions. Obviously, I cannot prejudice the outcome of those discussions, and it would not be reasonable for the hon. Gentleman to try to tie me down to so doing in Committee at this stage. We are genuinely offering to discuss the matter. It is entirely for the hon. Gentleman to decide whether to press the amendment, but I have made that offer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I do not want to offend the Economic Secretary, who has shown good will, and I shall, after all, agree to withdraw the amendment on the basis of discussion. However, anyone standing back and commercially considering the matter would conclude that the problem will arise, Merely to wait until the industry is screaming because a great pile of VCTs needs to be sorted out seems to me to be the wrong strategy. The Treasury should anticipate such problems.

<P>
The amendment would not provide tax relief. No trickery or avoidance would be involved. It is designed simply to tidy up the natural development of what has happened since VCTs started. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
Paragraph 8 of the schedule provides for regulations to ensure that in certain circumstances shares received by a VCT in exchange for an existing qualifying shareholding will continue to be treated as a qualifying holding under the scheme. However, as currently drafted, the paragraph is too narrowly drawn. It would not allow the regulations to provide for the value ascribed to the new shares, and, in some cases, the original shares, in the VCT's qualifying holding to be the same after the share exchange as it was before the exchange. The amendment remedies that deficiency.

<P>
Under current VCT rules, when a VCT receives shares and securities in exchange for an existing qualifying shareholding, for example as a result of a share reorganisation, sale or demerger, the new shares will not constitute a qualifying shareholding because they cannot meet all the qualifying conditions. That could jeopardise the VCT's approved status and the tax relief of its investors, as the VCT must have at least 70 per cent. of its funds invested in the qualifying holdings.

<P>
In addition, no investment by the VCT in any one company can represent more than 15 per cent. by value of the VCT's total investments. The value for these purposes is the acquisition value, which is generally the cost of the shares. Following a share exchange, a new acquisition rule must be applied, which may result in the value of the new shares breaching the 15 per cent. condition. That would, again, risk the loss of the VCT's approved status and of the relief for investors. Paragraph 8 is not sufficiently widely drafted to allow the regulations to cover the devaluation point, so I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We appreciate that the Government have proposed the amendment on this issue, although we are disappointed that it does not cover the previous issue too. Nevertheless, we are pleased to see it.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 277, in page 45, line 18, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) In sub-paragraph (2)(b) of paragraph 2 of Schedule A1 to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (period for which an asset is held and relevant period of ownership) for ``ten'' substitute ``four''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clauses 65 and 66 cover the territory of the new taper relief. We perceive two principle flaws in the provisions and have also identified two unintended wrong effects.

<P>
The first problem is that the Bill does not sort out what happens as regards mixed periods of qualifying and non-qualifying ownership for those ownerships that start before 6 April 2000. That could lead to some unfair anomalies. The second big issue is caused by the fact that the moment an individual ceases to be an employee, he ceases to qualify automatically for the business asset relief. Not only could that penalise employees who move from job to job before selling their shares, but it could be misused in terms of signals from management to suggest that someone might quit.

<P>
The Bill creates a ridiculous situation. An employee could hold shares for 10 years, retire on Monday, sell the shares on Tuesday and face a capital gains tax rate of 24 per cent. on a large gain, but a colleague who holds shares for four years, sells them on Monday and retires on Tuesday would have a 10 per cent. CGT bill. That is a live issue of which I trust the Economic Secretary is aware, as there have been learned articles on the subject in the media written by senior accountants. The provision also penalises those who die in service, as personal representatives are excluded from the employment qualification. As an additional general point, it is difficult for employees to calculate their CGT maximum taper on non-business assets unless they qualify under the other categories. That anomaly could favour higher-paid executives.

<P>
The issue of an employee ceasing to qualify the moment he leaves employment raises employment law issues. What happens if the employee is unfairly dismissed? Could he claim damages for his lost CGT exposure?

<P>
We seek to deal with the first anomaly in clause 65, which sets out the split between the qualifying holding periods for business and non-business tapers. Four years are required for maximum business taper, 10 years for maximum non-business taper. However, when an asset falls into both categories, the total period of ownership is considered and the gain apportioned over the previous 10 years of ownership. An asset could be held for seven years as a non-business asset followed by three years as a business asset, but only 30 per cent. of the gain might fall for business asset relief of 50 per cent. We propose to align both the four-year periods to the maximum taper and change to a four-year holding period test. We are happy to compromise over the 80/60 levels, because that takes the maximum for business taper relief, which is 40 per cent. for 10 years, retains the lack of taper over the first three years, and draws a straight line between the two. Amendment No. 277 is part of the same proposal. The percentage chargeable gains table is included in the amendment paper.

<P>
The Government might have an alternative approach to the problem, but they cannot sit back and refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem. As matters stand, there is potential for gross unfairness. The issue has been well aired by the accounting profession. I hope that the Government see first to accept our amendment and, if not, that they will respond with a solution, one that they have not yet tabled.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I welcome you to the committee, Dr. Clark, as this is the first time that I have been in the Committee with you as Chairman. Unfortunately, I have had to serve on other Committees as well.

<P>
Those of us who laboured on the 1998 Finance Bill warned the Government that the arrangements that they then introduced, exchanging capital gains tax retirement relief for the new taper system, were unduly complex. Clause 65 and, to an extent, clause 66 as well, contain welcome simplifications. However, tax legislation should be as fair and simple as possible.

<P>
The Committee will recall that the pre-1998 retirement relief arrangements for capital gains tax meant that, subject to fulfilment of the conditions, chargeable gains of 250,000 or less were exempt from tax. We are not being churlish, but it is important to remind the Government that they could easily have retained that exemption for the smaller business man or woman.

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Paymaster General shakes her head and, if she catches your eye, Dr. Clark, she will no doubt have a chance to justify that decision. The person with chargeable gains of 10,000, for example, was included in the tax in 1998; in the meantime, the person with gains of 10 million saved about 3.5 million-worth of tax. The values upheld by that system seemed slightly askew. The disposal of the business assets on retirement of the small business man and woman invariably funded a pension or provided a small amount of security or investment for that retirement. I do not understand why the Government have not taken the opportunity to put people with small gains in the same position as they would have occupied before 1998.

<P>
In my view, amendment No. 276 is entirely sensible. It simplifies the capital gains tax regime for non-business assets and is therefore worth supporting. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs has referred to anomalies in clauses 65 and 66. No doubt, we will go on to discuss the fact that relief can be lost on leaving a firm, and that newly acquired assets may be favoured over those that have been held for a longer period. Nevertheless, I look forward to hearing what the Economic Secretary has to say in response to my comments and those of other hon. Members.

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs shakes his head, but I have been given a costing of 700 million in 2001-02 and similar figures for the following years.

<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): Can the Economic Secretary tell the Committee what rate of disposal of assets and what assumptions were used to justify that figure?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not have those calculations in front of me. However, all hon. Members must consider how they would fund the gap in the Budget if the amendment were passed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary is asking us-or will be asking us-to accept an argument predicated on the validity of the figure that she quoted. She owes us an explanation of how the number was derived. Will the Economic Secretary try to furnish the Committee with the detail that I requested?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I echo the point made by my right hon. Friend. The estimates that I have seen are wildly less than the figure quoted by the Economic Secretary. The debate is not about the potential cost, but about how to address the underlying problem. If the hon. Lady's ploy is simply to say that the proposed solution would cost too much and nothing can be done, she misses the point. What we want to hear from the government is how to deal with the problem.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I allowed Mr. Flight to continue, but I remind hon. Members that it is not permissible to have two successive interventions. Otherwise, the Committee becomes too much like Question Time. After one intervention, the hon. Member on whom another hon. Member intervenes should be allowed to respond. I am sure that Miss Johnson will attempt to respond to both interventions.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I challenge the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs to tell the Committee what figure he has been given to the cost. At least I have told the Committee the figure that I have been given. I shall not recite a series of arithmetic for the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), but I am happy to explain the problems that we have identified, which do not arise only from the huge cost of the amendment.

The amendment would increase the rewards from passive holdings of investments, which would cost substantial sums and would not result in an equivalent boost to productivity. Owners of shares in listed companies and in non-trading companies would be the biggest, but not the only, beneficiaries of such costly largesse. For example, the amendment would reduce the capital gains tax liabilities on second homes and properties let for non-business use. That might encourage speculative property trading and overstimulate the housing market, which would have implications for interest rates. The amendment would even retain, for non-business assets, the bonus or headstart year that is being removed for business assets acquired before 17 March 1997. By increasing and speeding up the return to non-business assets, the amendment would reduce the differential incentives that the Government want to provide for business investment. The amendment would reduce the flow of finance to business use.

<P>
By contrast, the Government's priority, reflected in the Budget changes, is to focus on support for business investment and employee share ownership. The clause contains a real incentive to invest in business assets for the medium and longer term. That should boost the United Kingdom's productivity and growth. The amendment would counter that and reward passive investment in non-business assets and short-term holdings. It is for those reasons, as much as for that of cost, that I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
I refer now to amendment No. 277. There is no necessary connection between the length of tapers and the length of the relevant period of ownership. If we undertook time apportionment really thoroughly, we would consider the whole time that an asset had been owned since 6 April 1998. That would be fair, but it could place a large compliance burden on people and companies, so the shorter relevant period of ownership was chosen to keep down costs. Ten years is a reasonable compromise: four years or shorter period would be too short to obtain a fair picture of an asset's history, which is why a 10-year period was selected.

<P>
Some people would lose out from the shorter period proposed under amendment No. 277. Let us suppose that an asset had been held for 10 years before disposal, and that it was a business asset for the first five years and a non-business asset for the last five years. Under a 10-year relevant period of ownership, 42{**AF**}1/2{**XA**} per cent. of the gain would be charged to tax, because the taxpayer would obtain some benefit for the time that the asset had been a business asset. Under a four-year relevant period of ownership, there would be no such benefit, so the full non-business rate would apply and 60 per cent. of the gain would be charged. That would not be fair and it might not have been the result that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs had in mind when he tabled the amendment. For those reasons, I invite the Committee to reject amendment No. 277 as well.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am dissatisfied with the response that the Treasury has produced for the Minister, because it does not deal with the problem. The amendments may not be perfect, but I tabled them as a potential solution to a serious problem that has been widely aired. The way in which the Government intend to implement the new taper arrangements will have a grossly unfair effect on people who have held business assets for different periods. An asset could be held for seven years as a non-business asset and three years as a business asset. The tax that one would have to pay under the formula would be unreasonable.

<P>
An individual may have held shares in the company for which he has worked for a long time, but only picks up the business asset definition at the same time as someone else acquires similar shares. If both lots of shares were disposed of at the same time, the first chap will end up paying a lot more tax than the second chap. That is nonsense. No serious Government would propose such arrangements. The problem has been well aired: how do the Government intend to solve it? They can shoot holes in our proposals; that is fair and valid, but it is no good their not coming up with a solution. As it stands, the provision is unjust.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> This matter will require considerable probing. My hon. Friend said that the matter has been aired extensively, therefore some of the problems must have landed on Economic Secretary's desk. When she replies to the latest contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, will she tell us what representations from which organisations she has read and why she disagrees with my hon. Friend's line of argument? He said that the anomalies are unfair. The Economic Secretary's body language shows that she does not agree.

<P>
I have never supported the taper idea and will not do so because it is barmy and an utter waste of time. However, it is the capital gains tax course on which the Government have embarked. The Government have presumably designed it to encourage initial investment by the people described by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, and that is the part of the provision on which they should focus. They should not be concentrating on the after-effects, which my hon. Friend also described in detail.

<P>
The Economic Secretary has failed to make a case for the taper on the grounds of economic effectiveness. Her remarks do not show that there has been an improvement in the productivity effect, as it has been called. I do not know that I would recognise such an effect if it hit me, but, no doubt, she will tell us more about it. She might also quantify the productivity effect that these proposals have had. However, the Government may not have a clue about that, given that the hon. Lady said that she could not express a view about an asset unless it had been in operation for 10 years. I conclude that the Government are proceeding in a gigantic fog, if they cannot make their mind up on anything until 10 years have elapsed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that the Economic Secretary will deal with the case of people who acquired their shares before 17 March 1998 and those who acquired them on or after 6 April 2000. The latter are greatly advantaged by the new regime and the former greatly disadvantaged, which is absolute madness. I hope that she will also address the problem of the small gains individual, to which I have referred.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I think that Opposition Members are losing sight of the import of clause 65 and the amendments to it. We will discuss apportionment, especially across 6 April 2000, under the amendments to clause 66, not under the amendments that we are currently discussing. The subject of our debate is the shortening of the taper. The period for the business asset taper is being reduced to four years, reducing the taxable gain from 100 per cent. to 25 per cent., which represents a great gain for business after the changes made in the Budget. There has been widespread consultation on the measure, which has been widely welcomed, although Opposition Members want to disregard that fact.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde has asked about the costings for amendment No. 276. Costing is normally based on projected asset values and disposals, which is the same basis as is used for costing other figures in the Red Book. Indeed, the general approach is set out in the Red Book on page 153.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Capital gains tax is notoriously expensive to collect. Does the Economic Secretary not agree that amendment No. 276 would give relief earlier, but that the rates of tax subject to it would remain the same? Simplification should be built in to the calculations as well.

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Simplification is always built in when it is practical to do so.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised a point about the fairness of the provision in relation to the periods for which people hold the shares and pay tax and the amount of tax that they pay. Someone who makes a gain on disposable shares held for 10 years as a non-business asset will pay more tax than someone who holds the shares in the same companies as business assets for four years and realises the gain. Someone who holds an asset as a non-business asset for part of the relevant period of ownership and holds it for the remainder as a business asset pays tax at a lower effective rate than if there were no business status, but at a higher rate than if the asset were a business asset throughout the holding period.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I crave your indulgence, Dr. Clark, as I want to cover some of the ground in clause 66 that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Miss Johnson, I will give you some leeway, but I hope that it will be taken into account when we come to clause 66. The point made by you and others must be borne in mind when we come to clause 66, or I shall rule comments out of order.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Dr. Clark. The force of the hon. Gentleman's argument was that it is unfair that a person who will acquire business assets on or after 6 April 2000 will pay a lower rate of tax than a person whose assets were converted to business assets on that date, and that backdating the measure is the answer. However, the circumstances of the two taxpayers are different. The taper system is designed to reflect not only the length of the holding period, but whether an asset is business or non-business. That is perfectly reasonable.

<P>
Taxpayers are much better off than they would have been, thanks to the Budget changes. The purpose of the changes is to affect future behaviour. The person who has the shares on 6 April 2000 and the person who buys them on or after that date will be better off if they hold on to their shares. Backdating would be wrong in policy terms, as rewriting the past would give no incentive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I understood that, when the assets were converted to business assets, an individual could wait until about 2010 for the full relief, whereas the person who acquired the assets after April 2000 would get the full relief after four years.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> On 6 April 2010, apportionment will be no longer necessary due to Budget changes on disposal of an asset that changed its status on 6 April. [Hon. Members: ``That is what he has just said.''] Yes, but this is because the relevant period of ownership considers only the previous 10 years-[
Interruption.] Hon. Members are trying to change that, but that is the provision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I think that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) stated what the Economic Secretary said, although he put it in English. He sought guidance as to why the Government had adopted their position.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I thought that I was explaining exactly that. Among other things, I have explained why the backdating is wrong in policy terms. Hon. Members seem reluctant to deal with the fact that backdating cannot be an incentive for anything. The policy of what is a business asset has only changed for the future. It has not changed retrospectively in relation to the past. Backdating would be an expensive measure. The effects will reduce over time and disappear after 6 April 2010. That seems utterly logical and fair.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I shall spell out the point that the Government do not seem to have taken on board. Let us take the case of an individual who has held shares in his company for five years until April, and go forward nine years and compare him to someone who acquired shares on Budget day at the end of the four-year period. What has happened to the gain in the value of those shares? Even for the four-year period from this Budget, the first chap, who has loyally held his shares for nine years, will pay a higher rate of tax on the gain during the four-year period than the second chap. That is grossly unfair.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde and I have tried to make the simple point that it could be acceptable if the Government's formula was such that, for the four years from April, the two chaps were in the same position. That would not be backdating, and we could accept it because the new relief starts only at the beginning of April. No one is proposing that it should necessarily be backdated to the point at which everyone bought shares in their companies. However, to specify a formula that will result in a higher tax rate for the following four years for the person who has held shares the longer is simply barking mad.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> There is a difference between a business and a non-business taper, and there are reasons for that difference. In principle, the relevant period of ownership should be the total period of ownership, not merely the four years or the 10 years, which was adopted as a compromise for compliance purposes. I cannot understand why Opposition Members have difficulty with that notion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> It might help the Economic Secretary and her officials to consider a simple election. If Mr. Bloggs, who has held his shares for a long period, can be deemed to have sold and reacquired those shares in April 2000, the four-year period could run and he would not be disadvantaged as he will be under the Bill as drafted. It is a preposterous arrangement that now subsists in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> To compare the case of a person who acquired an asset when it was not a business asset but was later converted to one with that of a person who has held the asset as a business asset throughout is to compare apples and pears. I am sorry if the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs believes that that is barking mad. It is not. It is barking mad to compare the two. Apportionment is right in principle because it treats both alike by enabling them to receive business asset taper relief for the time that they held the shares as a qualifying business asset. I therefore do not agree that the clause is unfair. It is perfectly fair to give business asset taper relief to those who qualify for such relief for the time that they qualify and not for the time that they do not. It is a genuine benefit for everyone who holds and continues to hold business assets.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I may be able to help. The intention is not to advantage the person who acquired the asset before March 1998 but to put him in the shoes of the person who acquired the asset after 6 April of this year. It is to stop prejudice, not give advantage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Miss Johnson, will you give way?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I was not proposing to do so, but I shall if it helps you, Dr. Clark.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am so sorry. I was not sure whether hon. Members were making interventions or speeches. I assume that they were making speeches.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I do no wish to prolong the agony too long, My right hon. Friend's proposal was clear and sensible. To some extent, it may be open to people who would be otherwise prejudiced to sell their shares in a company on Budget day and rebuy. However, such people would fall foul of the bed-and-breakfast rule and crystallise a capital gain, which would be rather unfair. Moreover, it may not be possible to sell the shares, as they may be unlisted and no market may exist for them.

<P>
The Economic Secretary does not seem to have understood our point. The person who already holds assets that qualify as business assets is both morally and in every other way no different from the person who acquires the business asset. We are simply saying that for the four-year period their tax treatment must be the same. Perhaps the Government have not realised that the way in which the formula that they have adopted works will result in completely different tax treatments of the two over the following four years.

<P>
The Economic Secretary will find that among companies that have followed the good practice of allowing their employees to own shares there is outrage and screaming now that people understand the proposals. To tax-prejudice long-serving people as against the new has to be barking.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend said that he did not want to prolong the agony, but I am sure that I agree in the case of this topic. It is right that Ministers should feel a little agony, given the absurdity of this tax proposal. The points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon are very powerful. The Economic Secretary responded by saying that my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman want to introduce retrospective legislation, which is absolutely not so. Their point is simple: it concerns two people who hold assets that qualify under the rules applying from 6 April 2000. The person who buys such an asset on 6 or 7 April 2000 is in a worse position than the person who buys such an asset before 6 April 2000-

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Better position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sorry; a better position. The point made by my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman is that equity within the tax system requires that two people who are in the same set of circumstances should be treated in the same way by the Inland Revenue. If the Committee cannot establish that principle, I am all in favour of a little agony. Taxpayers outside this Committee regard that as one of the most basic principles, which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee should accept.

<P>
We are all against retrospective legislation; that is not in dispute. Nor do we believe that a huge cost is associated with the amendment. Will the Economic Secretary tell us why the Government believe that an individual who bought an asset after 6 April 2000 should pay less tax than one who bought a similar asset on 4 April 2000? Why do the Government think that that is fair?

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Would it help the Economic Secretary to write to the Committee once she has considered the matter and the solution that I proposed? A straightforward election could be made, within a certain period, by the person who had held the asset for some years. The person could therefore be deemed to have held the asset as from 6 April 2000.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Both parties in the scenario envisaged receive the business asset relief after 6 April 2000-[Hon. Members: ``At a different rate''.] They both receive the business asset relief. The period before 6 April 2000 is regarded differently in relation to the holding of the non-business asset.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> May I just finish the explanation? Hon. Members have been experiencing agonies; I do not know why they wish to prolong these agonies, but I noticed that they were keen on them.

<P>
One person has held a non-business asset, and part of that person's gain relates to the period during which he held that asset. The gain from 6 April 2000 is treated in the same way for both people in the scenario outlined.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> In am sorry; we cannot proceed on the basis that the two sets of circumstances are treated in the same way. It is simply not true. The Economic Secretary was on safe ground when she said that both benefited from business relief; that is perfectly true. The problem is that the benefit from business relief is felt by the two taxpayers on a different time scale and at a different rate. Will the Economic Secretary consider again whether those two groups of taxpayers should not continue to receive business relief at the same rate? If an individual had bought the asset in 1998, he would be two years into his 10-year taper. Why should he therefore have to wait a further eight years, when someone who buys a similar asset in 2000 would have to wait only four years? We all understand that the individual benefits from the relief, but he would benefit at a different rate if he had held the asset longer. That is unfair.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> During proceedings on the Finance Bill that I took through Standing Committee under a Conservative Government, I described the anomalies and difficulties arising from tapered capital gains tax arrangements. At the time, the Labour party said that, if an asset was held for a long period, that would be good and that a particular taper arrangement should reflect that. It has now changed its mind. We have the bizarre situation in which the Government have put that proposal into the ``bad'' class and the former sinners who looked to hold assets for a short period are now being put into the ``good'' class.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary shakes her head, but as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon said, with commendable clarity, the Government have done a U-turn, which shows the stupidity of tapered arrangements. I cannot understand why the Government cannot give parity of treatment to the two classes of asset holdings. The Economic Secretary tried to escape the probings of my right hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman by arguing about business assets and non-business assets, but that was not their argument. They were discussing parity and equity of treatment of similar assets. I hope that she can explain the anomaly that she has created under the clause as opposed to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not know whether I shall succeed, but I shall try to explain what is causing the difficulty. I have listened to fascinating exchanges, but they seem to be at cross purposes. My right hon. and hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon may genuinely be labouring under a misapprehension. If so, it would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could explain the character of that misapprehension. However, the hon. Lady could be labouring under a misapprehension. Someone certainly is, because the clause will have an effect that none of us wants.

<P>
The problem to which we are alluding arises out of the concatenation-[Hon. Members: ``Ah.''] Two things are going on at once-the clause and the apportionment rules. What Opposition Members regard as a problem arises because of the apportionment rules interacting with the schedule. If a gain mainly occurs during the period when the schedule would have applied-during the latter four years of the period-but because of the apportionment rules is apportioned to a period when there was less relief, the person would do worse than someone whose whole gain occurred during the four years and had no apportionment coming to him. The Economic Secretary has not explained why we are wrong. If she does so, we would be happy. Will she turn her mind to that matter? Are we right to say that the apportionment rules will have the effect that I have described? If we are not, why are we wrong?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The non-business gain made by the person holding the share in 1998 should remain non-business. That is right, because it was non-business. The gain from 2000 will be on the business taper. The 10-year limit means that if the assets are held beyond 2010, the non-business part will fall out of account. [Hon. Members: ``Agreed.''] Good, smashing. It would be grossly unfair to the person whose asset had changed from business to non-business status if we ignored that change of status under our generous provisions. The normal rule is that, for the period in which one qualifies for business asset relief, one receives business asset relief, and, for the period in which one does not qualify for that relief, one receives non-business asset relief.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Why cannot the time run from 6 April 2000 in respect of the prior-held asset, so that an individual with such an asset is treated the same as the individual whose asset was acquired on or after that date?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Both people in that scenario receive the benefit of the new business asset taper relief. They both receive it for the part of the gain that is treated as business. In the case in which only part of the gain is treated as a business asset, and was a business asset for only part of the time, it can only be treated as such.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I will try again to illustrate the problem with a simple example. Let us imagine that in the five years up to the Budget day there was no gain on the shares, and that in the four years after Budget day there was a gain of 100 per cent. The person who acquired the shares on Budget day would receive the full business relief on the gain, but the person who had held the shares for five years before that day would receive only four ninths of it. Although both people held shares when the gain was occurring and during the period which they qualified for the business relief, they would receive different treatment.

<P>
One solution to that problem would be to give business relief to those who hold shares in their company on the value of those shares on Budget day. That would remove the anomaly. Otherwise, as in the example that I have given, one person receives only four ninths of the benefit that the other receives.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is advocating that there should be an election, just as the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon did.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am saying that there should be not an uplift but an election. One would not be able to avoid the tax, because there would be no uplift when one made the election, but one would be treated as holding a different form of asset as on 6 April 2000, which is what the legislation proposes anyway.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Assets change between business and non-business assets for many reasons, as all hon. Members will accept. Some change as a result of legislative change, some as a result of the circumstances of the taxpayer or the company in which the shares are invested. It is not for the Government to insulate people from changes in circumstances.

<P>
The fact that capital gains tax payers hold what they know to be non-business assets should be reflected in the eventual disposal. An election would be expensive, costing about 80 million in 2005-06.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Are the Government saying that we must have an avowedly unjust tax system because of the cost projected for 2005-06? They have obviously considered the matter to be able to produce that figure for the Committee. The point is surely given added weight by the Economic Secretary's own words. She told the Committee that those taxpayers holding non-business assets should expect that holding to be taxed as a non-business asset during the time in which it was one. We agree with that. However, a new definition has been made and a new set of terms provided for business assets and their tax treatment. We cannot understand why those who hold what are now defined as business assets for a long period should be taxed at a higher rate than those who have held them for a short period.

<P>
We agree with the Economic Secretary's principle that people should not be entitled to retrospective benefits when the rules change, but surely the taxpayer who has held the asset for some time should be allowed to benefit from the more advantageous tax treatment being provided for those who purchase the asset from April 2000 onwards? She half elucidated that principle, so we are asking her to follow it through. We do not think that that a possible bill of 80 million in 2005-especially as the figure may not be correct-is a reason to turn the logic for introducing the taper on its head. The Government want to tax long holdings at a lower rate than that at which they tax short holdings, so it is totally absurd that the effect of the provisions is to tax longer holdings at a higher rate than shorter holdings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In my irenic spirit, let me again suggest a way through the problem. We have understood that the Economic Secretary is not saying that we are wrong about the effects, as she has admitted the effect that we described. She is saying something perfectly respectable for a Treasury Minister, which is that to make the provision fair she would have to give away a significant chunk-I think that she said 80 million-of revenue. We understand that the Treasury has good reason to try to raise revenue. Present on our Benches are ex-Treasury Ministers who understand that well.

<P>
If that is the effect, the schedule, with its 87.5 per cent. gain chargeable in the first year and so forth, would need to be changed to incorporate some number-I am in no position to say what it is-in order to recoup the 80 million loss of Exchequer revenue that would occur as a result of making the system fair. We could all accept that the schedule could be adjusted, through election or some such system, to introduce fairness and to recoup the loss. That would be no problem.

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that I do not sound ontologically challenged in asking whether the hon. Gentleman agrees that the cost will diminish completely by 2010, and that from 2004 to 2010 it will be minimal? Even if there is a cost, I am surprised that it is so great.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree that the cost is surprisingly large. It will diminish significantly. The present value cannot be great, so the adjustment in the schedule that we require to recoup it must be small. That is precisely the genesis of my suggestion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I note the time, so I suggest that we withdraw the amendment and that the subject should be considered on Report, as it is an important point of principle.
