						</b> A consensus of view was just about to break out in

mundane and predictable matters in hand.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>
					<a name="07062714000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would increase the
total amount that the ombudsman could decide was an appropriate remedy
in financial terms from &#163;20,000, which is the figure in the
Bill, to &#163;100,000. I hope that the Minister, refreshed by her
three hours in other places, will be as positive on this amendment as
she was earlier. The temperature is slightly warmer, and the
Minister&#146;s perfume is still reaching this side of the room,
where it is very much appreciated. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Her
colleagues may not appreciate it, but we do. We hope that she will feel
generous in any event and because of our keenness to see her back in
her place.</div>
					<a name="07062714000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figure
in the amendment was not plucked out of the air, nor was it chosen just
for the purpose of having a debate. I have a very clear view that if we
limited the upper amount that the ombudsman could award for
everything&#151;it is the inclusive, total amount, the aggregate
amount, as clause 138 goes on to describe&#151;to &#163;20,000,
that would be too low in many circumstances. If the Office for Legal
Complaints is to be effective and seen to be effective&#151;if
justice is to be done and seen to be done&#151;consumers need to know
that they can have decent redress for high-value
claims.</div>
					<a name="07062714000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
various examples, but I shall give two obvious ones. Let us say that
something went terribly wrong in a personal injury action that someone
had taken; the solicitor had completely messed it up. It is well within
the realms of contemplation that &#163;20,000 would be an entirely
inadequate remedy. If someone&#146;s conveyancing was completely
messed up, it is very possible that the damage suffered would be worth
more than
&#163;20,000.</div>
					<a name="07062714000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not clear why the figure of &#163;20,000 was chosen. The Law
Society&#146;s current limit is &#163;15,000, but other ombudsman
schemes have significantly higher figures. Again, I have drawn on the
best parallel that we all have, which is the financial ombudsman
scheme, for which the redress limit is &#163;100,000. There should be
a comparable starting
point.</div>
					<a name="07062714000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
non-statutory regimes such as the ombudsman scheme for estate agents.
Incidentally, it is probably good to know that there is one. I was not
previously aware of it, but I can imagine people being angry with
estate agents, too, and feeling that they have been misled by them on
occasions. Even that non-statutory scheme has a maximum redress limit
that is higher than that proposed in the Bill&#151;I think that it is
&#163;25,000.</div>
					<a name="07062714000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will tell the Committee, if I do not, that clause 139 allows a
variation in the redress limit, on the recommendation either of the
consumer panel or of the OLC. In my honest view, that is to allow,
quite properly, for relatively small adjustments to take account of
inflation or other things. It is not intended to allow for a
significant change. Similar provisions have been made in other
legislation to allow for flexibility, but not for a fundamental change
of starting point.</div>
					<a name="07062714000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
propose that we start at a realistic level. If we do not, there will
soon be pressure to change it. It is better to set it too high and to
allow it to be the upper level from the beginning. Otherwise, there is
a severe danger that people will say that the legislation is a lot of
sound and fury signifying not very much when it comes to delivery. We
might get an apology or an admission of failure, but in a day and age
when, on Lewisham or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>Borough high street, house prices do not start at &#163;20,000 or even
&#163;100,000, but at &#163;200,000 or &#163;250,000 for a
one-bedroomed flat, we need to compensate complainants at a realistic
2007 level for their financial loss.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000449"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> In speaking to amendment No. 265, I am working on
the reverse principle of the one that I used as a trade union official.
The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey suggested a limit of
&#163;100,000; I thought that I would be modest and say
&#163;50,000, on the basis that the Minister, given some options,
might wish to accept the lower amount.</div>
					<a name="07062714000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey made some serious points. I can give an
example from my experience of a situation in which the &#163;20,000
limit would be have been unacceptable and would have failed to deliver
justice to one of my constituents. I raised it on Second Reading. I
shall refer to the constituent as Mrs. X, because I do not
think that she wants her name in the public domain. She was a
miner&#146;s widow from Stanley, in my constituency, who had the
misfortune to be involved with a solicitors&#146; firm in Newcastle
called Mark Gilbert Morse. She was making a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease claim for her late husband. She is an elderly
lady&#151;she is in her 70s&#151;who does not understand the law or
the way that lawyers work, and she rightly expected the solicitors to
act in her best interest.</div>
					<a name="07062714000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year, the Department of
Trade and Industry made an offer to Mark Gilbert Morse to settle the
claim for &#163;42,000. Without Mrs. X&#146;s knowledge
and without contacting her, the solicitors rejected that offer on her
behalf and said that they would like a higher figure. There was great
shock six months later, when the Department of Trade and Industry came
forward with its next offer, which was only &#163;22,000. She
contacted me at that point. I must give credit to the Legal Complaints
Service, which investigated the complaint and shamed Mark Gilbert Morse
into paying the &#163;20,000 difference between the higher and the
lower offers, so she got the original sum of &#163;42,000.
</div>
					<a name="07062714000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Bill, the
original figure would have been &#163;20,000. People may argue that
there are other means open to individuals such as Mrs. X,
who could go to litigation, but there is no way in which she could
afford that process or would risk the possibility that she might not
get the higher figure. The figure as it
stands&#151;&#163;20,000&#151;is too modest in the case that I
cite.</div>
					<a name="07062714000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mining
compensation cases have thrown up many cases in which solicitors have
clearly not only given bad advice, but have not always dealt with the
cases so the clients have had second best advice. I am worried about
how many people have had the same experience as Mrs. X, but
whose cases have not come to
light.</div>
					<a name="07062714000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figure in
the provision is modest and, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey said, the financial services ombudsman can award
&#163;100,000. I was not aware that there was an ombudsman for estate
agents, but he can award &#163;25,000. If we do not initially put a
high enough figure in the Bill&#151;I know that clause 139 allows the
Legal Services Board to increase the amount&#151;the resistance of
the legal profession&#146;s vested interests will prevent any great
increase in the compensation figure. The Minister has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>said throughout the progress of the Bill that it should be about the
rights of consumers, and the best way of protecting those rights is to
set the figure at a high enough level to protect their interests. I
would not hold out a great deal of hope that it will rise substantially
over a period.</div>
					<a name="07062714000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
broader issue of compensation, something that has frustrated many of my
constituents and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw is
the prevarication by some solicitors in trying to settle cases, and the
threats that they make. It never ceases to amaze me that in mining
compensation cases, which involve poor and vulnerable individuals,
arrogant solicitors do not seem to care how many threats they
issue&#151;for example, that if clients do not pay up or agree to a
certain course of action, they may be held legally liable, even when
they may not in fact be held liable for further costs. It is important
to get the figure right now for consumers&#146; protection. If the
Minister does not concede that today, it should be considered on
Report.</div>
					<a name="07062714000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
intend to speak to amendment No. 266, so I ask the Minister seriously
to consider increasing the figure substantially
today.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07062714000450"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): The point to
recognise, particularly when dealing with claims against solicitors, is
that if the claim is not made through the ombudsman process, another
firm of solicitors must generally be employed. This area of regulation
is complicated because there are all sorts of
difficulties.</div>
					<a name="07062714000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
cite a couple of cases in which a firm of solicitors let down their
clients but monetary compensation was not the whole story. One of my
constituents, who suffered from mental illness, was imprisoned because
the court believed that he wanted a hospital order. He ended up being
imprisoned because the solicitor failed to notice certain things in the
paperwork. Oddly enough, I managed to draft an appeal, and the good
news is that it will be heard. The difficulty was that the solicitors
had clearly failed to do their job properly, and when they were asked
for the paperwork they did not respond in a timely manner. One
difficulty with appeals is that they generally have to be made within
21 days, and it causes great problems if people sit on the paperwork.
If they do so for more than 21 days, it is a greater problem.</div>
					<a name="07062714000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">In another example that I have
been looking at recently, it seems that some children were taken into
care and adopted because correspondence went to the wrong address. The
firm of solicitors involved is failing to respond to me, so I have
written to the Law Society to ask it to
intervene.</div>
					<a name="07062714000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such
cases, there is no easy way of quantifying the loss, but in cases where
someone will arguably have &#163;1 million or &#163;10
million&#151;I was an expert witness in a case involving more than
&#163;250 million&#151;people can afford to go somewhere and
control the whole process. However, when it involves &#163;25,000,
someone could easily lose out. If we consider that somebody may have
lost five years of their life in jail because of the incompetence of a
firm of solicitors in not doing some basic things, it is clear that the
system is quite difficult as it stands. Therefore the limit of
&#163;20,000 is far too low and my hon. Friend&#146;s probing
amendment&#151;I presume that it is a probing amendment&#151;is
very good.</div>

						<a name="07062714000451"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Mann</b> (Bassetlaw) (Lab): I support the principle of
increasing the figure to &#163;20,000, but I am not particularly
inclined to support the Liberal Democrat proposal because there needs
to be a balance between regulatory financial remuneration and other
actions that can be taken. It is important to recognise the need for
balance.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figure of &#163;20,000 is a modest increase on the current limits for
solicitors, but is too low because it would not catch those people who
have lost out financially and do not want to trust another solicitor to
engage in civil action to sue for financial remedy. Indeed, the amounts
of money fall between what it is viable for a solicitor to present to a
client in terms of likely incentive gain, because &#163;100,000 would
seem well worth fighting for through the courts if there was a loss. If
it is a much smaller amount, people are much less likely to consider it
worth fighting for. A balance must be drawn somewhere, but the figure
of &#163;20,000 is too low.</div>
					<a name="07062714000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am dealing
with a number of ongoing cases in which the amount of financial loss
that can be quantified, aside from any compensatory loss, is between
&#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000. Those cases are in a range of
different areas&#151;they are not all about industrial
disease&#151;but they are the exception and in the majority of cases
the figure is much lower. The limit should incorporate the potential
exceptions to the rule precisely because that would provide the full
parameters and should not create any expectation of an upward drift
overall. There is no logic in suggesting that there would be an upward
drift. What the upper quartile of potential claims might be is
important.</div>
					<a name="07062714000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that &#163;20,000 is not sustainable and that the figure needs to be
higher. I am attracted to the suggestion of &#163;50,000 made by my
hon. Friend the Member for North Durham, but if the Minister proposes
something more realistic that might also be acceptable. However,
&#163;20,000 is too low because there are too many cases in which the
individual would win, but would lose out financially. That is why the
figure needs to be increased somewhat to a more realistic
amount.</div>

						</b> From the hon. Gentleman&#146;s experience of the
sort of cases that he has shared with us, can he tell us about examples
where, in his assessment, there was the highest loss relative in what
someone was able to
obtain?</div>

						</b> The highest loss that I have dealt with without
having to go through regulation was &#163;31,500. That was the actual
financial loss. I have a significant number of ongoing cases in which I
estimate the loss will average around &#163;25,000. Therefore, in
that context, there is a significant difference between &#163;20,000
and &#163;25,000, and &#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000. Such losses
are significant, especially when they are the result of poor
representation of whatever form. People&#146;s health might be
affected, so the money is not only compensation for a wrong, but a
remedy that is calculated to take account of
necessity.</div>
					<a name="07062714000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Industrial
compensation payments is the best example of what happens when lazy
solicitors manage not to put 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>in claims. It might not be deliberate; a solicitor might not have said
&#147;I won&#146;t put in for that because I don&#146;t get paid
much and I&#146;m not bothered&#148;. The laziness is of systems
and approaches whereby solicitors manage to tick boxes, but fail to ask
additional questions. The miners compensation scheme compensates people
for things that they will not be able to do in future because of their
industrial disease and amounts are calculated precisely. Financial
compensation is required for things that need to be done&#151;it is
not a charitable donation or a sum in principle; it is for practical
purposes.</div>
					<a name="07062714000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">A maximum
of &#163;30,000 would do in the cases that I know of, but there might
be cases that would require a higher figure. A maximum of
&#163;20,000 would leave too many cases in which a person could win,
but would have the trauma of taking civil action and of going to
another solicitor. That is not sensible, both practically and with
regard to the profession&#146;s
reputation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000454"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I hear the figures. The hon. Gentleman is aware
that there are two sorts of loss: a direct financial loss of wages,
income, salary and pension; and a loss of the damages that compensate
for injury such as the loss of the use of a limb. Is he saying that, in
his experience, the total of the prospective claims would only be of
the order of &#163;30,000-plus? I know of cases in which the
combination of loss of income plus damages would be considerably higher
than
&#163;30,000.</div>

any rule.</div>
					<a name="07062714000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more
endemic problem is when the obvious part of the claim is put in, but
the less obvious parts are not. The more I investigate, the more that
that type of case appears to be endemic in the system. The average
necessary amount&#151;the figure will vary&#151;is around
&#163;20,000 or &#163;25,000. Therefore, the figure of
&#163;20,000 is somewhat low, but there is no logic in setting the
figure too low. The figure of &#163;20,000 has been set by updating
the current figure. That is rational, but it does not fully incorporate
what will, by definition, be exceptional cases of actual loss, rather
than compensatory loss for less quantifiable things. It would be
prudent and sensible to increase the maximum amount&#151;both sides
of the Committee will feel that.</div>

								The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):
						</b> Let me explain the rationale behind the
&#163;20,000 limit. It is based on the current maximum of redress in
the Law Society, which was recently increased to &#163;15,000. The
Bar Council figure remains &#163;5,000. Taking into account the fact
that, on average, the awards made by both the Law Society and the Bar
Council are somewhere between &#163;400 and &#163;500, the
Government decided to increase the limit from &#163;15,000 to
&#163;20,000 to take account of the time between now and when the OLC
will be up and running. For the moment, that is an appropriate figure,
but that does not mean that it cannot be increased in the future. That
is why the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey mentioned
clause 139, which allows for the Lord Chancellor, by order, to increase
the limit if the board, the OLC or the consumer panel recommend it at
any time. It is perfectly possible, for example, for the consumer panel
on day one to make a recommendation that the limit be
increased.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>
					<a name="07062714000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make it absolutely
clear that this rise is not just about dealing with inflation. It is
also about allowing the board and the other interested bodies to
increase the amount substantially if they thought that that was the
right thing to do. It is on that basis that I ask the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey to withdraw his amendment.</div>
					<a name="07062714000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be some comfort to the
hon. Gentlemen to know that I have no personal attachment to the figure
of &#163;20,000. I hear the arguments that all parts of the Committee
are making. A figure of &#163;100,000 would be going way too high to
begin with and if we look at some other ombudsman&#146;s schemes, we
see that their upper limits are slightly higher than &#163;20,000. It
may be worth considering the average figure of some of those
schemes.</div>
					<a name="07062714000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also add
that a series of groups gave evidence to the pre-legislative scrutiny
Committee and almost all were in favour of a figure above
&#163;20,000, and I heard their arguments. Interestingly, the one
group that was not in favour was the Legal Aid Practitioners Group,
which said that it could not really imagine a situation in which the
redress would be of that scale, or far beyond it. However, that is not
the argument on which I am basing this limit.</div>
					<a name="07062714000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I am not personally
attached to the figure of &#163;20,000. I would be happy to look at
it again and to consider, across the board, other schemes to see
whether another figure is more appropriate. However, it is important
not to get too carried away, so that the consumer panel and the board
itself can respond with a figure that they think is appropriate at the
time; this measure is obviously not going to come into effect for a
little while yet. Having argued in this Committee about the flexibility
that we must give to the board, and so on, I do not want in any way to
undermine that flexibility now. However, I would ask the hon. Gentleman
to withdraw his amendment on the basis that I will look again at how
this figure of &#163;20,000 compares with the upper figures of other
ombudsman&#146;s schemes.</div>

apologise if she did and I missed it. Does she accept that the
Financial Ombudsman Service has a &#163;100,000 upper limit, which is
the only absolutely comparable, or very nearly comparable, scheme? Does

that upper limit of &#163;100,000 and there is quite a good argument
as to why that scheme has that upper limit. However, I would like to
see how many cases have got anywhere close to that &#163;100,000
limit and consider where the awards are being given. That might help us
to come to a better conclusion at a later
stage.</div>

Rather than us all trailing through the FSA&#146;s ombudsman&#146;s

to produce that information, that would be really helpful.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>
					<a name="07062714000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that, even if we get
those figures, they will not be absolutely comparable, because we are
talking about two different types of organisations and two different
types of issues. However, I am very clear that we need a higher limit.
I hear the Minister saying that she is not wedded to the current limit.
She has heard voices from her own party arguing, from different
perspectives, for a limit higher than &#163;20,000. I sense that a
higher limit would be where the centre of gravity of the debate
is.</div>

the complainant nor the respondent, in relation to a complaint, may
institute or continue legal proceedings in respect of a matter which
was the subject of a complaint, after the time when a determination by
an ombudsman of the complaint becomes binding and final in accordance
with this section.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, you cannot take legal action once you have been to the
ombudsman and the ombudsman has decided. The amendment would prevent
people from taking legal action while the ombudsman was considering a
complaint as well as when it had finished doing so. I hope that the
reason for that is obvious: it seems ridiculous to allow a legal
process when at no separate court expense or report obligations the
ombudsman is considering the matter. Let us keep to one process. The
amendment would be a bar on two processes taking place at the same
time. I hope that that is sensible and that the Minister will accept
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000461"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> When I first looked at the amendment I wondered
why a lawyer would bother to sue their client if they did not think
that they would be successful. It would be a much more expensive
process to pursue hopeless legal proceedings than to endure the
ombudsman&#146;s determination. I wondered whether it was therefore a
situation that would never
arise.</div>
					<a name="07062714000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether it does
or not, I cannot accept the amendment because it would have
undesirable, although I am sure unintended, consequences. The reason
for the provision in clause 140(11) is to achieve finality of
determinations under the ombudsman scheme. An additional provision such
as the amendment proposes would go considerably further and raise
questions about the Bill&#146;s compliance with the Human Rights Act
1998.</div>
					<a name="07062714000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
could prevent a lawyer from taking legal action or require them to put
on hold ongoing legal proceedings in the interests of a process that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>might not produce a binding determination, as the complainant might not
accept the outcome. That barring of access to a determination of civil
rights and obligations does not seem appropriate to the end that is
sought in the amendments, particularly given the unlikeliness of a
lawyer pursuing unfounded claims through the courts, with all the
attendant costs, simply to avoid an ombudsman&#146;s
determination.</div>
					<a name="07062714000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If
a client was to refuse to pay legal fees, then it is clearly only right
that the lawyer is able to recover those through the courts. If they
could be stopped simply by the client making complaint to the OLC, that
could undermine the court process and prevent the lawyer from seeking
just restitution, which is obviously not a tenable position in which to
put someone. The OLC could end up getting unnecessary complaints from
those simply wishing to slow down or stop legal proceedings, which
would clearly be a waste of the ombudsman&#146;s time. We do not want
to go down that
road.</div>
					<a name="07062714000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me explain
how the Bill works with an unscrupulous lawyer trying to avoid or delay
the complaints scheme by initiating legal proceedings, which is the
other side of the same coin. Whether legal proceedings were begun
before or after the complaint was made to the ombudsman scheme, the
ombudsman would still be able to deal with the complaint. Whether it
would be appropriate to do so in a particular case would be at the
ombudsman&#146;s discretion. However, rest assured that I consider it
of vital importance for unscrupulous lawyers not to think that they can
avoid a complaint by starting legal proceedings. They must realise that
the ombudsman scheme is able to deal with all
complaints.</div>
					<a name="07062714000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill,
as drafted, gives suitable and sufficient protection. It already
prevents the respondent from initiating or continuing legal proceedings
once the determination has been accepted by the complainant. The
intention here is to ensure that the determination is treated as a
resolution of the matter in dispute, which I hope will provide
respondents and complainants with the all-important certainty without
which timely resolution of complaints and the informality of the system
would be lost. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his
amendment</div>

Council and the Bar Standards Board.</div>
					<a name="07062714000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As I said on
Second Reading and have said throughout the Bill&#146;s existence,
any form of delegation will undermine the principle of a single
independent complaints handling body and will not in any circumstances
restore consumer confidence in complaints handling. The clause has no
place in a Bill that is about putting the consumer first. It must be
removed, along with any amendments that refer back to
it.</div>
					<a name="07062714000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know that
the clause comes from the Bar, which made no secret about the fact that
it wants to continue to handle complaints about barristers. It will
argue&#151;I have its briefing for this debate&#151;that it has an
excellent record of complaints handling compared to the Law Society, or
that complaints about barristers are much more complicated and no one
other than the Bar can deal with them effectively. It will argue that
complaints about barristers are almost inevitably intertwined with
elements of substandard service and misconduct, which should be
investigated by the same body, and that having two bodies to
investigate a complaint will lead to inconsistent decisions. It will
argue those points; we may well hear them argued today. It has argued
them before, but the arguments&#151;although they are
barristers&#151;simply do not stand up to
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07062714000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Bar will say that the legal services ombudsman gives it a clean bill of
health, but if we dig a little deeper into the ombudsman&#146;s
2005-06 annual report, we can see that the picture is not quite as
black and white as the Bar would like us to believe. On page 48, we see
that the Bar Council dealt with 560 complaints and that 183
complainants were unhappy with how their complaint had been handled.
That is almost a third of all those who took their complaint to the Bar
hoping that it would be dealt with in a consumer-focused way, went away
disappointed and had to go to the legal services ombudsman to have
their case dealt
with.</div>
					<a name="07062714000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the same
time, the Law Society handled 18,299 complaints, a huge number.
However, just under 10 per cent. of all complaints against solicitors
went to the legal services ombudsman for review. That does not in any
way suggest that the Law Society is doing a magnificent job. It is
appalling to have 18,000 complaints. But if we are to argue that the
Bar is better and more professional in dealing with complaints than the
Law Society, let us ensure that we are arguing about the same issues
and that we look at the figures objectively.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>
					<a name="07062714000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						From the data,
we see that the legal services ombudsman considered 3.9 per cent. of
complaints about barristers to have been dealt with unsatisfactorily,
compared with 3.1 per cent. of complaints about solicitors. There is
next to no difference. There is no indication that the Bar is
qualitatively and substantially better at handling complaints than
solicitors; in fact, those figures suggest that it is the other way
around.</div>
					<a name="07062714000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
must be removed. It will absolutely and completely undermine not just
the Bill but consumers&#146; confidence in the Bill and the legal

Bar complains about the fact that a number of Law Society

it says that the OLC will be a rebadged LCS. Quite frankly, if we left
the Bar&#146;s complaints system out of the OLC, it would have a
point. If the OLC dealt only with complaints about solicitors, we might
as well have simply rebadged the LCS, and that is most certainly not
our intention.</div>

leads for the Opposition that I made a plea&#151;indeed, stronger
than that, a request&#151;that no mention be made of extraneous
matters that have occurred this day.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000468"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I must apologise; I must have been doodling on
my note pad when you issued that stricture at the start of the sitting,
Sir Nicholas.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>
					<a name="07062714000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I declare an interest, because
although I do not practise, I am a barrister. So far, however, there
have been not&#151;touch wood&#151;been any complaints against me
or anyone who has instructed me.</div>
					<a name="07062714000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a wide-ranging debate
in the other place, both at Grand Committee stage and indeed on Report.
When the vote took place on delegated complaints handling, there was a
substantial majority in favour of the Lords amendment; it had
significant all-party support. There are many people in the other place
who are not linked to the legal profession and who know a great deal
about the subject. For many years, the Bar combined the representative
functions of the Bar Council with the regulatory function. Although it
did a good job, as indeed the Law Society did with its complaints
procedure, everyone realised that both mechanisms could be
improved.</div>
					<a name="07062714000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what
Clementi was all about; it made clear that there could be improvement.
That is why the Bar Council responded pragmatically and imaginatively
by setting up the Bar Standards Board in January 2006. That is an
independent, ring-fenced regulator, chaired by Ruth Evans, the former
CEO of the National Consumer Council. The Minister mentioned that
Which? and the NCC and other organisations were against the Lords
amendments, but she did not mention that.</div>
					<a name="07062714000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the Bar Standards
Board has a consumer panel, chaired by Dr. Diane Hayter, who sits as a
board member of the
NCC.</div>
				
					<a name="07062714000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key objective of the Bar
Standards Board is to protect consumers, which is why it puts a lot of
emphasis on its lay membership. The Bar Standards Board complaints
committee has 10 lay members who have a veto. Every complaint to the
board has to go to its independent complaints commissioner, Robert
Behrens, who is a non-lawyer.</div>
					<a name="07062714000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said that she was
concerned about a regulatory system that allowed lawyers to judge their
own, but that is simply not the case. It is a ring-fenced organisation
in which lay members predominate. The system that the Bar Council put
in place&#151;the Bar Standards Board&#151;relies on lay members
and members of the profession, barristers and QCs, who provide their
services on a pro bono basis. It is extremely cost-effective and the
result is that it costs about &#163;640 to deal with the average
complaint, which compares with more than &#163;1,000 under the new
unified system. I will come to the costs in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07062714000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
consider what the board has endeavoured to do by putting in place a
system of excellence. It is not just about handling complaints; it puts
a great deal of focus on issues such as education, training and
qualifications and on accountability, transparency and
consultation.</div>
					<a name="07062714000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
board&#146;s annual report for 2006, its chairman
says:</div>
					<a name="07062714000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Within a
little over twelve months from Sir David Clementi&#146;s
recommendation...the Bar Standards Board was able to hold its
first meeting on 26 January 2006. I believe this rapid pace is just one
of many examples of the profession&#146;s willingness to adopt new
ideas whilst making sure that the best of what has gone before is
retained. This is an ethos that we in the Bar Standards Board share and
it underpins all that we
do.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The organisation has
built critical mass and it is doing an excellent job. It was told to
get on and set up an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>independent regulator, which is exactly what it did, and now it is
threatened with having the rug pulled from under it and being wiped
out. That is why many of their lordships found that the Bill needed
improving and proposed their amendments; they are very concerned and
angry that the Government are going to remove them.</div>
					<a name="07062714000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee should consider
not just what Conservative Members say, but also the third party
endorsement of the BSB. In her report for 2006-07, Zahida Manzoor, the
legal services ombudsman, commended the BSB for its very strong
performance. When we consider some of the figures that the Minister
bandied around, it is interesting to note that Zahida Manzoor said that
she was satisfied that out of the 166 cases referred to her, 84 per
cent. had been handled properly. The adverse figure was only 16 per
cent., which compares with the Law Society figures that showed a 29 per
cent. adverse
figure.</div>
					<a name="07062714000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can look at
the relative figures until the cows come home, but the bottom line is
that the new organisation is delivering. Zahida Manzoor said
that</div>
					<a name="07062714000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Bar Standards
Board continue to deliver good turnaround times... for closing
cases in 4-6 months&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062714000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
said that the BSB is to be commended on appointing a non-lawyer, Ruth
Evans, to be its chair. Zahida Manzoor has made it clear time and again
that she thinks this is an excellent Bill, although she said that the
Bill was designed for the OLC to be a single point of entry for all
legal complaints, handling all redress complaints consistently
regardless, of the type of lawyer complained about. In some ways, that
backs up what the Government are trying to do. However, she says on
page 22 of her report:</div>
					<a name="07062714000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The recent track record
of the Bar Council, which is the second largest handler of legal
complaints, has shown that it deals with those complaints more
effectively than the Law Society. There is therefore empathy for those
professional bodies that may feel that the handling of complaints by
the proposed OLC in the West Midlands may be poorer than the current
system they employ.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is substantial third-party endorsement, and the Government should
listen to it
carefully.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000469"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that
point?</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000470"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I was trying to be brief. I want to talk about
safeguards. The Minister seemed to imply that, as it stands, the Bill
will have no safeguards. That is not the case. As presently drafted,
the LSB has the power to make a direction allowing an approved
regulator, such as the Bar Council, to determine such complaints as may
be specified in a
direction.</div>
					<a name="07062714000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
deciding whether to make a direction, the LSB is bound to act
compatibly with the regulatory objectives and other regulatory
principles in the Bill. In other words, safeguards are built into it.
It is just a matter of one size does not fit all. That point was
clearly made by the Law Society. It does not want the LSB to delegate
service complaints to it. It wants them to go to the successor to the
Law Society&#146;s legal complaint service, the OLC. That is
manifestly clear.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>
					<a name="07062714000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society has made it
clear that, by definition, many more complaints will be made against
solicitors. In fact, the Minister mentioned 17,000 to 18,000 complaints
against solicitors and roughly about 600 against barristers, which is
obviously a reflection of the respective sizes of the two branches of
the profession. We should remember that barristers are at the sharp end
of presenting cases in court. They are instructed to perform the
advocacy role.</div>
					<a name="07062714000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we debated clause 133 this morning, we discussed cases going badly
wrong, particularly family law cases. I quoted from Baroness
Butler-Sloss at some length. People lose their cases; they lose their
liberty; they lose their children and families, and they end up being
extremely angry because they believe that they were in the right. Of
course, they will complain against their
advocate.</div>
					<a name="07062714000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
branches of the law will, of course, attract a disproportionate number
of complaints. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst made the point clearly and effectively that young
barristers will do their best in court, but lose the case and a
complaint will be made against them. Over years, the Bar Council has
done well. It recognised a need for improvement, as did the Law
Society. We now have a wholly improved system. However, if we consider
the amount of effort and work that has been put into such matters and
how it has resulted a really excellent body, why throw it away at this
stage?</div>
					<a name="07062714000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to make
two further points. There will be an explosion in work for the OLC if
the alternative business structures system takes off in the way in
which many people consider it will. My hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon is convinced of that, and he is an expert on such issues. He
dealt with this part of the Bill for the official Opposition and
believes that there will be a far bigger increase in the number of new
operations under the ABS system, which undoubtedly will lead to more
complaints being made against the profession.</div>
					<a name="07062714000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the OLC is busy dealing
with complaints from the new operators, surely it will make great sense
to allow the existing system under the Bar Standards Board to stay in
place. It will provide flexibility. As I said, it is a matter of one
size not fitting all. I accept the point about value for money, and I
have looked carefully at the figures that the Government have come up
with. Let us consider what the Under-Secretary of State for Justice,
the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), said on Second
Reading. She stated that the professionals were getting a bargain
because, when the new regime was brought
in,</div>
					<a name="07062714000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it will cost less
overall than the existing system.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 4 June 2007; Vol. 461, c. 98.]</div>
					<a name="07062714000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We have
heard, however, that PricewaterhouseCoopers&#146; forecast for the
transition costs of the OLC has been raised from &#163;26.8 million
to &#163;32.1 million. We have also heard that the forecast of the
annual running costs of the OLC have been raised from &#163;16.8
million to &#163;19.9 million. Let us look at what happened to the
Financial Ombudsman Service, which is based on a similar model to the
OLC. When the chief ombudsman gave evidence to a Joint Committee, he
made it clear that he had experienced a very substantial increase in
workload. In the first five years of operation, his workload had
quadrupled and staff numbers
trebled.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07062714000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see
how Ministers can come to Parliament and say that there is going to be
a reduction in the running costs of the new system when we know that
there is going to be a big increase in the number of complaints. We
know that the number of alternative business structures will increase
the amount of legal activity in many areas.</div>
					<a name="07062714000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government have their
way, they will wipe out a system that has worked extremely well. The
system has been given third party endorsement by many different
organisations.</div>
					<a name="07062714000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
conclude by quoting from Lord Borrie, who speaks from the Government
Benches. He said that the Bar Standards Board has done an excellent
job. He particularly focused on the pro bono work that was done by both
the lay members and the QCs who gave their time on a pro bono basis. He
pointed out that that was one of the key advantages that the Bar
Standards Board had. He congratulated the board on its complaints
handling mechanisms. He said that it would be a great pity if such
mechanisms were lost to the Bill.
</div>
					<a name="07062714000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the Minister to
reflect again on the matter. I know that she feels very strongly about
this. The Law Society is neutral. An organisation that is made up of
decent honourable people&#151;people who have listened to what the
Government have said and heeded their strictures and listened to what
Clementi had to say&#151;has gone away and done exactly what the
Government have asked them to do. The Government cannot then turn
around and effectively say, &#147;What you have done is not enough.
We are going to emasculate you and bring in amendments that will result
in your organisation losing critical mass.&#148; All the good work
that has been done, all the investment, effort and training the
Government have put money into is basically going to be wiped out.
Therefore, I will ask the Minister to think again. That is why the
Opposition cannot accept the amendments and we will be voting against
them.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000471"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> I want to talk about climate change. That is not off
the point because I mean a change of climate. That is the key point
behind the Government amendment. It is why I wholeheartedly endorse it
and wish to speak in favour of it. What is needed is a change of
climate in how barristers see and perform their role. There is a
certain irony in this strongest of closed shops, with the mentality of
a closed shop&#151;a mentality that I fully
understand&#151;attempting to defend its privilege against outsiders.
There are other professions that have done that temporarily over recent
years. They have attempted to fight for their privileged position and
exclude all outsiders.</div>
					<a name="07062714000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk, who has thrown even further back the principles of debate
within the House, has eloquently advocated on behalf of his own closed
shop. I congratulate him on the way he puts his case. However, the
climate must change, and let me illustrate why. There is an idea that
this particular closed shop can look after itself and the rest of the
world need not bother. I recall they used to say that on Fleet street,
and in other professions as well, with equal eloquence, vehemence of
argument and self-belief. It was not an idea that stacked up when one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>looked from the outside. I will give two reasons why. They are unusual
ones, but they are real cases. The first relates to the way in which
barristers are complicit, including with solicitors, in providing
opinions to legal executives carrying out the work of solicitors and
giving a professional veneer to a case being put forward to a
solicitor.</div>
					<a name="07062714000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I raised
that point in the Committee either last week or the week before and
wrote to the Bar Standards Board, which of course said, &#147;Not our
business. We don&#146;t accept complaints about that. That&#146;s
one for the solicitors.&#148; In today&#146;s strange climate, let
me be the one to vehemently defend the Law Society and its systems
against the unprincipled and inaccurate attacks on
it.</div>
					<a name="07062714000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole point
about why the Law Society is getting so many more cases is not that
there has been an enormous change in the performance of solicitors.
There is a particular problem that has led to a particular kind of case
coming in larger volumes than one would normally expect. The Law
Society has made itself more outward-looking, open and accessible to
complainants.</div>
					<a name="07062714000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now
have an incredible situation whereby I wish duly to hold to account
some of the barristers who have been complicit in doing over my
constituents, but the Bar Standards Board says that I can do that only
through the Law Society&#151;by attacking and seeking remedy from the
solicitor. The solicitor who has allowed the legal executive to take
the case when they are not competent to do so is clearly complicit. The
solicitor has then got the barrister to give an opinion so that the
case can go forward and has fed that opinion back without consulting my
constituents. There is clearly a fault in the system but there is
equally a fault with the barrister who has been complicit in
hoodwinking my constituents.</div>
					<a name="07062714000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">One way or another, I shall
take that case forward. It is absolutely not the case that it is merely
the solicitor who should be held at fault; the barrister should as
well. Indeed, consider legal executive versus barrister&#151;there is
a certain hierarchy there. If anything, the balance should be the other
way. The whole point is ensuring that there is equivalence in the
system. If there is bias either way it should not be against the poor,
downtrodden solicitors, whom I have been happy to attack when they have
deserved attacking but whom we should not
over-attack.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000472"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that if a member of
the Bar is at fault they should be subject to a complaint. If that
complaint is justified, it should be upheld. From all the cases that he
has dealt with as an MP, has he been party to complaints against
members of the Bar? If so, how many of them have been upheld and how
many not, and how does that compare with what we have heard from him
about
solicitors?</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000473"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> At the moment one has to make a tactical decision on
where to take a complaint. The Law Society is more accessible, but the
financial penalties are greater. If I want financial compensation for
my constituent at an appropriate amount, there is clearly a bias in the
system meaning that one has to make a complaint against the solicitor.
The case will be won only if the solicitor is at fault, so it is not as
though one were trying to bring an undue case.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>
					<a name="07062714000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a number of the cases, which
tend to be the more complex ones and those in which the potential
compensation is higher if the arguments of my constituent and myself
are upheld, the amounts of money and the scandal are much bigger. I
allege that my constituents have been ripped off. There have been many
cases with the Law Society, and some have been won, so that is not a
vague allegation. The Law Society has upheld some complaints, but the
barrister complicit gets off
scot-free.</div>
					<a name="07062714000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
example is the case of Hobson and others <i class="I">v. </i>AMS and others, in
which 65 miners were wrongly advised on a number of issues but
fundamentally on how to take forward a group litigation order. The key
advice in the documents presented to me was the barrister&#146;s
opinion. The barrister said, &#147;This can be done, this is the way
to do it.&#148; The judge disagreed and said that that was not the
way to do it, throwing the case out of court, from which all sorts of
problems emanated. The detailed case against the solicitor was won
through the Law Society; compensation was paid out, so that none of
those people lost out financially, which was right and proper. However,
it was left to the solicitor found negligent in the case then to take
action against the
barrister.</div>
					<a name="07062714000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
context of access to justice and of regulation, it should be equally
easy to take a case against a barrister. More importantly, it ought to
be easy to take a joint case. Why should my constituent,
Mrs. X the textile worker, who I allege has been badly
advised and treated, have to determine whether it is solicitor or
barrister? It may well be&#151;my advice to her in some of those
cases&#151;that it is both. Therefore, a joint case ought to be
possible. Frankly, that would lead to complications&#151;if there is
an adjudication in her favour, who should pay out? However, the
principles of the system are self-evident to me. Therefore, this
classic closed-shop response needs knocking back. It is absolutely
fundamental to access to justice that it is knocked
back.</div>
					<a name="07062714000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I studied the
discussions in the House of Lords with interest and&#151;given my
inside knowledge of some of the solicitors and barristers employed by
some of those who were attempting to get justice&#151;with
incredulity; absolute incredulity at the way in which the case was put,
because the case is so weak, so poor, that it can barely be put. The
case is one that I used to put to certain employers many years ago.
&#147;Look, we have got these jobs, we are the skilled workers, and
we think that just us should have these jobs and everyone else can get
lost, because we are looking after ourselves.&#148; In essence, that
is the case. There is an honour in that, but it is an outdated honour,
an honour of past generations and traditions, and one that no closed
shop should be allowed to maintain
today.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000474"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has not yet dealt with the
case&#151;let us imagine&#151;of somebody making a complaint about
the service, which included solicitors and barristers, through the one
door of entry. It is checked originally by the overarching regulatory
authority, the view of which is that the fault is entirely that of the
Bar; the solicitors were not at fault. Is there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>not a case in that example? What if the regulator thinks that it is
appropriate for a body dealing with Bar complaints to be passed that
case, having gone through the process that assesses whether it is all
one department&#146;s fault, as it were, or another
department&#146;s?</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000475"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> I will have to consider what the hon. Gentleman had
to say. However, I have another example, where it is possible to
attempt some remedy. That is with the Crown Prosecution Service. I find
that if my constituents have a complaint&#151;they have lots if they
lost their case&#151;the easiest target in the legal profession is
the Crown Prosecution Service. People want to have a go at the police,
the judge, the decisions made, the advocacy and the rest, but there is
that one isolated example, which stands out and which
we&#151;certainly as politicians&#151;can hold to account with
relative
ease.</div>
					<a name="07062714000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
conclusion, I restate my first point. The critical reason why this
Government proposal will be so important is that it will change the
climate. If the barrister giving the opinion has to think through the
consequences if his opinion is not good, far more thought will be given
to the case than is given at present. I base that on the many cases
that I have reviewed. In some instances, the answer will be,
&#147;Actually, I have nothing additional to contribute. I have no
knowledge about the matter. My opinion is valueless, and therefore I
will not cover up what you are doing to strengthen your case purely
because you are trying to do it on the cheap as a solicitors
firm.&#148; That would be a good thing for the legal profession as
well as for the consumer. Therefore, I strongly support the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07062714000476"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> One of the difficulties with the issue rests in
the complication of determining where something has gone wrong. As hon.
Members may be aware, I am concerned about miscarriages of justice in
the criminal courts relating to medical evidence and medical expert
witness evidence. In cases such as those of Sally Clark and Angela
Cannings, the defendants were initially convicted but at a later stage
were proven innocent. The proof rested in the medical evidence; the
cases involved arguments about
it.</div>
					<a name="07062714000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">A question then
arises if a complaint is made about the solicitor or the barrister.
Were they at fault in the initial stage? A recent case in Mold of
shaken baby syndrome looks on the surface to be a miscarriage of
justice. The solicitors may have taken the view that it was in the best
interests of their client to try to negotiate the best deal that they
could get as they would not be able to beat the medical evidence from
the doctors, the difficulty being that medical evidence from doctors is
conflicted. They make a lot of money out of it and it ends up being
wrong much of the time, and a complicated situation
develops.</div>
					<a name="07062714000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
that we have to ask about all of this, and I include the patent agents
and trade mark attorneys, is that much as there is great merit in
having a single point of entry for complaints&#151;if someone has a
complaint, they go there&#151;is there not merit in giving a
permissive power to the Legal Services
Board?</div>

important that the body that deals with the complaint is seen to be
totally independent of the profession? Referring a complaint to the Bar
Council would give the impression, possibly quite rightly, that the
barristers were looking after the
barristers.</div>

Hemming:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Whatever
system the Legal Services Board uses for managing complaints, it must
be seen to be adequate to manage complaints. The point about clause 143
is that it gives a permissive power to the Legal Services Board to
delegate cases; for example, if someone has a complaint about patents,
which are a complicated area. It may be that over time decisions will
be made to do things differently. Without legislation empowering the
Legal Services Board to devolve decision-making, it will have no power
to do so&#151;it will have to operate in accordance with
statute.</div>
					<a name="07062714000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
reasonable case for the Legal Services Board to be allowed to operate
things in the way that it sees fit. There is not inherently injustice
in having a process whereby there is an initial consideration&#151;in
this instance, the Bar complaints process&#151;followed by a
subsequent response at some other point. Without that power, the board
cannot say, &#147;You have a look at this and see if you can resolve
it. Failing that, we will move to another process.&#148; It does not
have the permissive
power.</div>
					<a name="07062714000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Bill
becomes an Act and starts being implemented, there will be a process
whereby it will come into operation. To say that on day one, we have to
move immediately to everything being in one big
organisation&#151;including the patent agents and trademark
attorneys, about whom we have seen no figures relating to
complaints&#151;seems overly inflexible. A more flexible approach
allowing some discretion to rest with the Legal Services
Board&#151;</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000479"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman have any evidence or any
figures about how many cases we are dealing with? As I understand it,
for the types of case that he is talking about&#151;patents and so
on&#151;there are a very small number of complaints a
year.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000480"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> I accept the point. A very small number of
complaints may be made about patent agents every year, and they may be
handled very cost-effectively by the patent agents. It may seem that
allowing the current complaints process to continue for a certain
period rests with a body that is not necessarily seen to be inherently
independent and would therefore have to involve a process of appeal to
the legal services ombudsman, for instance, for a
determination.</div>
					<a name="07062714000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">But we
should not say at the start, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, we&#146;re
going to have to shove it all into one big
organisation&#151;trademarks, patents, barristers, solicitors and
trade unions. Obviously, complaints about trade unions must be handled
in exactly the same way, because there might be complaints about advice
offered by regulated persons within the trade unions. We accept the
point about the amendment&#151;union conveners will not be regulated
by the measures, and rightly so, because industrial relations should
not be regulated by the Legal Services Board. But we are saying that
any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>complaints about trade unions cannot be handled by the trades union
complaint process. It must be handled with a one-size-fits-all
approach. Everything goes&#151;patents, trade unions, trademarks,
barristers and
solicitors.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
143 does not say that for forever and a day, the Bar Council should
handle complaints about the Bar, but it gives the Legal Services Board
a permissive power to say if it sees fit, &#147;Complaints about
trade unions will go through the trade unions&#146; process, and
complaints about barristers will go through the barristers&#146;
process.&#148; The clause gives the Legal Services Board that option
if it sees fit. It is not a requirement; it is permissive. To that
extent, it is a good
clause.</div>

							<a name="07062714000481"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I rise to support the Government, returning to
something that the Minister has stressed on numerous
occasions&#151;the rights of the consumer. I am sorry, but I do not
accept the idea, which was supported by a rather confused argument from
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley, that people who want to make
complaints are quite clear about whom to complain to and how to deal
with their complaints. A one-stop shop for all complaints is certainly
the right
approach.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000482"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> I agree that the one-stop shop is a good
mechanism for handling the initial complaint, but would the hon.
Gentleman say that that should preclude delegating the handling of the
complaint process, so that the complaint might be received at a certain
place but the handling occurs in different
ways?</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000483"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> Yes, I would. The system must be seen to be
independent from the organisations about which people are complaining.
That is fundamental as well. Anything that smacks of people addressing
complaints themselves will take us back to when, for example, the
police investigated the police. It is the same principle
here.</div>
					<a name="07062714000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
shall give an example of a case of mine that, strangely enough, did not
involve miners&#146; compensation. It was a divorce case in which I
heard a complaint about a solicitor, and it demonstrates why it is
important to have a one-stop shop. Mrs. D came to see me
with quite a simple divorce case&#151;no children or dependents were
involved. She had gone to a local firm of solicitors who for some
reason&#151;I could not quite work out why&#151;employed two
barristers to deal with the case. Even with my layman&#146;s
knowledge, I would not have thought that it was a complex case. The
first question that should have been asked was whether barristers
needed to be instructed in that case, and I would have contended that
they did not.</div>
					<a name="07062714000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only
did it take about five months to settle the case, she then had a
problem with the solicitors about the release of monies in the divorce
settlement. The problem was that the solicitors were complaining that
they could not finalise the case because the barristers had not
submitted their fees. Again, I asked the legal services complaints
service to intervene, and it did a sterling job of putting pressure on
the solicitor and raising questions. The poor woman was happy to have
the case moved on to its final point, as she had no other means of
support.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>
					<a name="07062714000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted the case to be taken
right through, but the solicitor offered Mrs. D compensation
for the poor service that she had received and she was happy with that.
I then wanted to go after the barristers, but she was reluctant to go
any further. In that case, solicitors and barristers were clearly
acting in cahoots. I do not know what the circumstances were or why the
barristers were instructed in the case, but if there had been a
one-stop shop that dealt with the problem as a whole, that would have
given the case strength and made it easier to deal with.</div>
					<a name="07062714000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw made his point eloquently. Having also been a trade union
official, I remember the arguments that I used to make on
occasions&#151;on why, for example, boilermakers in the shipyard
should only do certain jobs and why shipwrights should only do others.
Yes, it was an archaic age; perhaps there were reasons why such
practices should have been supported in that dim and distant past, but
we cannot support them any longer. The idea of making the complaints
system simple and easy for people to take things forward is an
important part of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062714000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The complaints system should
have credibility. Since the Law Society separated from it, people have
had more confidence in its complaints system, which is seen to be
independent of the legal profession. I would oppose totally anything
that smacked of complaints being put back to the profession, as that
would undermine the credibility of what the Bill
proposes.</div>
					<a name="07062714000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Birmingham, Yardley seems to think that there should be a
transition phase. I am sorry, but that is a clear attempt to keep
control over the regulation of the Bar. If the amendment were not
agreed to, I do not think that, given time, the Bar Council would wake
up one morning, see a blinding flash of light and say, &#147;We
should now give things up.&#148; No trade organisation, trade union
or self-interested body ever gives up anything willingly, so that would
not happen.</div>
					<a name="07062714000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arguments
have been made that there will be a big bang that will swamp the system
early on. There has been an argument about patent agents. I do not
think that there are more than five complaints about patent agents in
any one year, so I do not think that the system will be swamped. For
those reasons, it is important that the amendments are agreed to. I say
to the Minister that when the Bill goes back to the other place, we
need to resist strongly any attempts to reintroduce this restrictive
practice.</div>

Neill:
						</b> It is good to see you back, Sir Nicholas. Had you
been here this morning, you would have heard me remind Committee
members of my interest as a member of the Bar&#151;although not
currently practising, which is important to what we are
discussing.</div>
					<a name="07062714000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I was once
the subject of a complaint to the Bar Council. It arose when I was
defending someone in Chelmsford Crown court who was acquitted because
the jury concluded that the prosecution witness was not credible. That
witness complained about me to the Bar Council because I had obtained
an acquittal for my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div>client. He also complained that the prosecuting counsel had not gone
hard enough. That shows why we should be careful about the nature of
complaints against members of the Bar. Although it was manifestly
obvious to me, as a young barrister in those days, that what was being
said was nonsense, my head of chambers and I none the less thought it
right and proper to make everything available to the Bar Council. We
got all the papers back from the Crown Prosecution Service, which had
instructed me; we got the notes from the court clerk; I liaised with
the defence barrister; and he got out all his notes and his
instructions from his solicitors. We made all that documentation
available, which took a certain amount of time and concern, and
presented it, and in due course it was dealt with and the complaint was
dismissed. Even though I knew in my heart of hearts that I had done no
wrong, and my colleague on the other side knew in his heart of hearts
that he had done no wrong, for a young member of the profession, it was
a pretty unpleasant experience.</div>
					<a name="07062714000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no doubt become rather
tougher as time has gone on, but over the years many young colleagues
have come to me and said, &#147;I have had this complaint made
against me,&#148; and they have not dismissed it, treated it lightly
or thought that it was something to be laughed off. It causes them
concern, even when in the vast majority of cases, I am glad to say,
nothing comes of it. The idea that the Bar wants to keep a closed shop
because it wants to protect its own and it does not take the issue
seriously is just not justified on the
evidence.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000485"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman just said that in most cases,
nothing comes of the issue. Is that not because barristers investigate
barristers?</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000486"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> No, and I shall come on to that point now, which
unfortunately represents the certain measure of cynicism that creeps
in, and demonstrates that the hon. Gentleman did not perhaps listen
properly to my point this morning. The nature of the complaint arises
because of the nature of the jobs that the Bar does, as opposed to the
nature of the job that the solicitor does. I am not setting the Law
Society against the Bar Council; the simple fact is that the Bar is a
smaller, reference profession, which does not handle clients&#146;
money, for example. As I said this morning and as is well documented,
the vast bulk of the complaints made against barristers relate not to
the advice given in such claims as miners&#146; compensation, when
things clearly went badly wrong, but to family work, which was referred
to, and to criminal
work.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000487"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> That is surely no surprise to the hon. Gentleman,
because the Bar Council refuses to accept such
complaints.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000488"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> No, with respect the hon. Gentleman is wrong and
misses the point. My point, which the Minister accepted, was that the
particular vulnerability to complaint of criminal and family work is
due to the pressure that the client is very often under. I found that
family work was the most stressful element of any legal practice that I
ever undertook. It was stressful for the lawyers and for the clients,
even when they were in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>wrong, as the judge found them to be, because people believe
passionately, if sometimes misguidedly, in the rightness of their
situation.</div>
					<a name="07062714000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Against that
background of profound disappointment, when people lose something that
is precious to them, a complaint will be made that is not necessarily
susceptible to reason or conciliation. For the same reason, the
professional criminal who has got his or her 15 years or more is more
than capable of turning on those who advised him and making complaints
against them, as he will against the police, the judge and the prison
officers who deal with his welfare. The professional criminals are not
shrinking violets, and that is a very different situation from the one
that is posited.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000489"></a>John

hon. Gentleman&#146;s good self in that context?

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000490"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> In my 25 years, there were two, and the result was
the same. Most criminal practitioners find that that sort of thing can
happen to them. It is interesting that the most famous negligence case
against a barrister, Rondel <i class="I">v. </i>Worsley, was brought against one
of the most eminent and impeccably correct Queen&#146;s counsel that
one has ever come across. If anyone thinks that there was anything
improper about Michael Worsley, they know nothing of him or the Bar.
Even the most eminent and successful people can be the subject of
unfair complaint in the world in which we have to
operate.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000491"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> So there are all these greatly emotional family
cases&#151;I am paraphrasing&#151;that have lost out and these
various criminals who either went to jail when they should not have
done or did not go to jail when they should have done. Yet, in those 25
years there were only two complaints against Michael Worsley. Is the
hon. Gentleman not defeating his own
argument?</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000492"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> Precisely not. I find it very difficult to see the
logic of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s case here. I am making my point in
response to the Minister&#146;s point. She said that about a third of
complaints against the Bar were made where people were unhappy. In
response, I would say that that is the nature of the people who tend to
complain about the Bar. They are invariably less likely to be happy,
because of those types of cases, and also because the type of
complaints that they make are less likely to be subject to conciliation
or to be dealt with by any other means. It is also worth bearing in
mind that about 70 per cent. of complaints involving members of the Bar
are hybrid cases, dealing with questions of both conduct and service,
which the Government&#146;s system is rather rigid in dealing
with.</div>
					<a name="07062714000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would accept
the point that was made about climate change, save for this: the Bar
itself has recognised that the climate needs to change and the Bar has
moved. If the Bar had stuck where it was, in the position that it was
in at the beginning of my career, the point about climate change would
be much stronger, but the Bar has not stuck there. It has separated out
the Bar Standards Board; ring-fenced it; made it independent; put in
its chair someone who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>themselves had a distinguished career in consumer protection; appointed
as its independent reviewer, who looks at every complaint, someone who
was previously the secretary to the Committee on Standards in Public
Life; and given its lay panel a veto. The Bar has taken all those steps
to establish that separation of the Bar Standards Board. That is the
big difference.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000493"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> Is it not the case that, a little bit like the Law
Society, the Bar knew that this Bill was coming its way and what the
hon. Gentleman is describing is the Bar trying to duck under the wire
and protect its interests? I would also like to ask the hon. Gentleman
how he would address the point that the public&#146;s perception of
barristers investigating barristers is not something that the Bar can
get away from.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000494"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> That perception, it seems to me, was sensibly dealt
with by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley, when he said that
there is the Legal Services Board, which is the one-stop shop. The
Lords propose to give a permissive power whereby if, and only if, the
board is satisfied that a particular regulatory structure meets its
required standard for protecting the consumer, then it can delegate; it
does not have to delegate, but it can do so. That seems to me to be the
key thing here.</div>
					<a name="07062714000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference was briefly made to
the patents and trade mark situation. There is some evidence regarding
that situation. My understanding is that the Chartered Institute of
Patent Attorneys has had 16 complaints in five years. That is 0.00128
complaints per member, which is a tiny amount. The trade mark body, the
Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys, has had three consumer complaints in
the last six years, all settled by conciliation. These are small
bodies. The legal services ombudsman said of
CIPA:</div>
					<a name="07062714000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
satisfied that CIPA has in place sufficient systems for handling
complaints that are fit for that purpose and appropriate for the size
of its operations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
are small, specialist bodies that already have robust systems in place,
approved by the legal services ombudsman, but under the
Government&#146;s current unduly rigid proposals they would be swept
up disproportionately&#151;to use one of the Minister&#146;s
favourite words&#151;into an overly rigid regime, and that is
wrong.</div>

							<a name="07062714000498"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I will go through the debate and I will say to
the hon. Gentleman that, although the trade mark attorneys, the patent
attorneys, the Bar Standards Board and the Legal Complaints Service for
the Law Society are all&#151;particularly the latter two&#151;doing
an awful lot better at the moment than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>they did in the past, that is not a reason for saying that we should
have anything other than an independent office for legal complaints to
which the consumer can go to have their complaint and claim for redress
dealt with.</div>
					<a name="07062714000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
listened carefully to what hon. Members have said, and although I have
heard all the arguments in the other place, it was good to hear them
reiterated here. It was even better, however, finally to hear in the
debate the voice of the consumer, and to hear it in this House, because
quite clearly the other House was not listening. As I have said, the
consumer organisations have told us in no uncertain terms that clause
143 must not stand part of the Bill. Allowing delegation would fly in
the face of the reforms that we have sought since Sir David Clementi
published his report in December 2004. Neither he nor the consumer
organisations, nor the Government, have ever believed that it is
acceptable to allow the present system to continue in any of its forms.
</div>
					<a name="07062714000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issues raised
by the Liberal Democrat Members, it is entirely possible, for example,
for an assistant ombudsman to be a barrister&#151;as long as he or
she does not hold a practising certificate. My hon. Friends the Members
for Bassetlaw and for North Durham were not too happy about that idea
in earlier debates, but that will be the position. The Office for Legal
Complaints can request advice or assistance under schedule 15,
paragraph 15, from any body or person, and they can get expertise if
that is what they need. Providing that such advice or assistance is
given in that way will ensure that the OLC remains visibly independent
and that complaints handling will restore the consumer confidence that
has been absolutely shattered during the past few years.</div>
					<a name="07062714000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before setting out some of the
comments of consumer bodies, I shall pick up on the point that was made
by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. As a barrister, he made
a very compelling case for barristers to carry on looking after
themselves, but he seemed to have forgotten that more than 2,000
solicitors have rights of audience in the Crown court, yet have not
asked for delegation. In fact, the Law Society has said that, if we
offered them delegation, they would not accept it. He made a compelling
case too about family law and about the difficulties and stresses of
dealing with it. Do not solicitors deal with it too, however, as well
as with immigration cases, and other hugely emotive issues? Are those
issues not likely also to result in similar feelings? Again, however,
the Law Society is not asking for
delegation.</div>
					<a name="07062714000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk talked about the legal services
complaints commissioner and the legal services ombudsman, who performs
a very important function under the current system, and whose work I
very much value. I am in regular discussion with her, and I welcome her
support of the reforms. I am aware of the issues that she has raised in
her report, but as I said in my opening remarks, consumers, the
Government and I all think that delegating complaints handling would
undermine the purpose of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062714000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman also said
that the Law Society was neutral. That is not strictly true, and it is
misleading to suggest that the society agrees with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>Bar that one size does not fit all. The Law Society supports the
establishment of the OLC as a new body that is completely independent
of all the professional bodies and that is responsible for dealing with
all consumer complaints. The Solicitors Regulation Authority is firmly
and absolutely against delegation and has argued strongly that the
co-operation of the Bar and its inclusion in the new system are
essential to the success of the new arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07062714000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">What have the consumers said?
The CAB
says:</div>
					<a name="07062714000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
consider it is essential that complaint handling and adjudication on
issues of service quality should not be delegated in this
way&#148;&#151;</div>

								Mr.
Kidney:
						</b> It is a pleasure to have you in charge of our
proceedings again, Sir. Nicholas. This is about the procedure for a
complainant to find out what happens 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>after making a complaint. If I may start at the beginning of the
process, a complainant who is dissatisfied with a service from a
provider of legal services will first try to resolve their complaint
with the legal server directly. If that fails, as we have just
established with the last vote, there is only one place to go: the
Office for Legal Complaints. Once there, the office can decide whether
it is a complaint about the standard of service, the conduct of the
professional who delivered the service, or partly one and partly the
other.</div>
					<a name="07062714000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">To illustrate
the points that I am about to make, let us take a situation where the
ombudsman and Office for Legal Complaints consider that there is a
mixed case of standards and conduct. The ombudsman will say to the
complainant, &#147;I think that there is possibly an element of poor
standard of service here. I will investigate it and let you have my
decision. However, I also think that there is possibly a problem with
the conduct of the person who delivered the service to you and I shall
refer that to an approved regulator&#148;. The complainant might spot
the difference between those two outcomes and say, &#147;Just a
minute. You have told me that I will hear about the result of the
complaint about the standard of service, but I did not hear you say
anything about what I will hear about the conduct&#148;. The
ombudsman will say, &#147;That is quite right. Either I will not
bother to deal with it and will ask for a report myself about how it is
dealt with, or, even if I do take action, I do not have to tell you
anything about it&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062714000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as consumerism is
concerned, that is a very unsatisfactory situation. As a matter of good
standards of practice it ought to be the case that the ombudsman says,
&#147;I have decided that part of this matter is about standards. I
will investigate it and let you have my decision. The other part is
possibly about conduct. I am going to get somebody else to investigate
that for you and I will let you know the outcome of that investigation
too&#148;. I do not think that any other outcome is satisfactory.
However, at the moment, the way that clause 144 is drafted means that
that is not the case.</div>
					<a name="07062714000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the ombudsman does not
even have to ask the approved regulator to let them know the outcome of
an investigation because the Bill states that the ombudsman may request
a report back, which means that they need not if they do not wish to.
The clause is silent on the ombudsman telling the complainant the
result.</div>
					<a name="07062714000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
276 changes &#147;may&#148; to &#147;must&#148;, which means
that the ombudsman must always ask for a report from the approved
regulator. I was pleasantly surprised to receive recently from the
legal services ombudsman a special report called, &#147;Legal
Services Reform&#151;a perspective&#148;, dated June 2007, in which
my argument is echoed on page 26. It
reads:</div>
					<a name="07062714000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The OLC
rules must require a report from the Approved Regulators on every case
that has been referred from the OLC for potential misconduct. The OLC
could then use this information to build up a picture of any systemic
problems in
regulation&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062714000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition
to my argument that it must be best practice to let a person know the
result of their complaint, the ombudsman has here given another very
good reason&#151;spotting systemic failure in the system and having
that information every time.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>
					<a name="07062714000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						My
amendment No. 277 would provide that when the ombudsman has insisted on
receiving the report, he ought to pass it back to the complainant.
That, again, is my argument about best practice. I then push the boat
out a little bit with amendment No. 298. What would happen if a result
from the approved regulator is that no action be taken, but the
complainant, on hearing that from the ombudsman, says, &#147;But that
is outrageous! This is the worst case I have ever heard of. How on
earth could that be the outcome?&#148;? There is no remedy if that is
the attitude of the complainant. There is the possibility, of course,
that the Legal Services Board, a long time down the road, might pick up
a lot of similar complaints and take some decisive action, but nothing
could happen as a result of that one complainant thinking that the
outcome was poor. I suggest that the complainant could say to the
ombudsman, &#147;Will you please go back to the approved regulator
and ask it to reconsider the decision and have a fuller look at
it?&#148; There would be a filter because the ombudsman could say,
&#147;This is a very unreasonable person. I have been dealing with
their complaint for a very long time. I really do not think that there
is anything in this&#148;, or they could say, &#147;Well, actually,
I was a bit surprised by the outcome and on this occasion I will ask
for a report back&#148;. Again, I think that I am supported by the
same report from the legal services ombudsman. Page 25
states:</div>
					<a name="07062714000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no mechanism for the consumer to ask for a review of any of these
decisions, as there is no longer the Legal Services Ombudsman
independent review available to
them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062714000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">A little later on
the same page it
states:</div>
					<a name="07062714000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposed new OLC process will therefore represent to the consumer the
loss of the independent Legal Services Ombudsman review as against the
current
scheme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, if we legislate as the Bill is currently drafted, we will
introduce a system that is actually worse for the consumer in that
specific situation than the current system. I do not think that that is
what the Minister intends or what the consumer groups outside this Room
are expecting to hear and find at the end of our deliberations. If she
does not like my proposal in the amendment, she ought to consider
another way of ensuring that the ombudsman system is replaced by
something at least equally as robust.</div>

excellent briefing that they gave the Committee and on the practical
stance that they have taken. Obviously, the Opposition have been unable
to support every one of their requests, but certainly we support the

strongly already. All that I would like to do is endorse what he said

points about the consumer knowing the end results and about how, having
made the complaint, it is important in good practice for them to know
the end result. I would therefore like to look at them again. I was
initially resistant because my main concern is that the system should
not be overly bureaucratic and costly. On that basis, I ask my hon.

						</b> Given that I have the advantage of everyone

progress going forward. On the possible objection regarding costs, does
my hon. Friend agree that if it is ingrained in the practices of
everyone concerned, and they are already under duties to exchange
information with each other, it need not be an additional
cost?</div>

							<a name="07062714000525"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. As
everyone on the Committee knows, the parliamentary ombudsman always
writes back to the relevant Member of Parliament and complainant when a
complaint is made. I am sure that there is an efficient way in which
these matters can be dealt with that is not too costly.</div>
					<a name="07062714000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I cannot
accept Amendment No. 298, however. It is not the OLC&#146;s role to
ask an approved regulator to review disciplinary decisions. We have to
make sure that the Bill sets out a clear distinction between redress,
which is for the OLC to consider, and discipline, which is a matter for
approved regulators. I accept that the Bill does not allow the board or
complainants to challenge a regulator&#146;s decision in an
individual disciplinary case, but it does allow the OLC to build up a
picture of how well regulators are dealing with disciplinary matters so
that they can report any concerns to the board. I do not want to accept
the amendment because it could blur some of those issues. Allowing the
board to build up a picture of how well the disciplinary arrangements
of each regulator is working is an acceptable way forward and the Bill
provides the necessary safeguards to ensure that discipline is dealt
with properly. I therefore ask my hon. Friend not to press the
amendment for reasons quite different to those for the previous
two.</div>

example, I should like the Minister to consider that we are losing the

						</b> I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment,
as it would mean that the ombudsman would not be able to enforce
requests for information or documents from complainants. That would be
unacceptable because it could result in unequal treatment of the two
parties in a case under the scheme. As it would mean that the ombudsman
would be unable to follow up requirements for information from
complainants, it could result in people wasting the ombudsman&#146;s
time. It might be of some reassurance to the hon. Gentleman that I
expect the power to be used rarely, if at all. It is nevertheless
important for it to be included in the Bill, to act as a deterrent and
so that, in the interests of fairness, both parties are treated
equally.</div>

								Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I shall be very brief, because we are making
substantial progress. The clause is on the levy, which is an important
mechanism in how the board will run its affairs. The amendment would
insert a new subsection setting out various factors to which the board
must have regard when imposing a levy. It is basically a tidying-up
exercise and would put various qualifications into the clause. It would
improve the Bill, addressing in some detail a concern that a number of
outside bodies have put to us. That is why it is important that the
clause be amended as suggested, and I hope that the Minister will
consider the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07062714000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
wording of the amendment is not up to scratch and the Minister can
consider it and return to us on it, we will be more than happy to
accept that. The amendment is probing, but it strikes me as a sensible
way of improving an important clause. The same can be said for
amendment No. 302, which would add to clause 175 the words:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>
					<a name="07062714000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A debt recovered under
subsection (5) may only be recovered from practising fees held by a
regulator.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">That speaks
for itself and would remove any semblance of doubt on the
matter.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000558"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I have listened carefully to both what the hon.
Gentleman has said and what was said in the other place on the matter.
I reiterate the point that my right hon. and noble Friend Baroness
Ashton made. She highlighted the fact that the board would have to be
satisfied that the apportionment of the levy was in accordance with
fair principles before making levy rules. I am still of the strong
opinion that that is the right way to go about it, rather than set out
in the Bill a prescriptive list of factors as the amendment
would.</div>
					<a name="07062714000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">To set such a
list in primary legislation would restrict the board and preclude it
from considering factors that might subsequently prove to be equally,
or even more, important. I recognise that the list sets out, among
other things, what the board should consider, but my concern is that
any list would put pressure on the board to consider the matters on it
above all else for fear of its decision being reviewed. That would
restrict the flexibility that I have constantly said will be an
important part of the board&#146;s
function.</div>
					<a name="07062714000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
where the amendments come from and I have great sympathy with the views
of the smaller legal organisations that want to ensure that they are
not disproportionately burdened by the levy. They say that they do not
want a one-size-fits-all approach to the matter, and I agree absolutely
and wholeheartedly with them, which is why we need flexibility. The
amendments would reduce that flexibility by predetermining some of the
factors, which might be to the detriment of some of the smaller
organisations that will be subject to the levy. On that basis, I ask
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No.
301.</div>
					<a name="07062714000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
302, for the record, I would in general expect money owed in respect of
the levy to be paid from practice fee income, but I do not think that
it is appropriate for the Bill to state that practice fees are the only
source of funds by which debts to the board may be paid. Once again,
that would restrict the flexibility of a regulator to meet a debt that
might best be dealt with in a way that suits its own financial
arrangements. On that basis, I do not support the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07062714000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite
unusual for legislation to restrict the way in which moneys owed may be
recovered. In effect, it would fetter the court&#146;s ability to
enforce payment of debts. The standard procedure for recovery of debts
should apply, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

was discussed in the other place, as she rightly said, but the
proposals were rejected. I am glad that we have had another discussion.

						</b> The amendments are about the start-up and running
costs of the board. They propose dealing with those matters differently
so that the Government would meet a third of the running costs of the
LSB, and would bear the start-up costs rather than transfer them to the
legal profession.</div>
					<a name="07062714000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee on the Draft Legal Services Bill supports the
amendments. The Government intend that the cost of the regulatory
regime, including the LSB&#151;the umbrella
organisation&#151;should be borne by the legal profession. The
amendment would split the responsibility. No body, and certainly not
the Law Society, has argued that the professions should meet the costs
of the lower tier of regulation, by which I mean the regulators and the
office of legal complaints&#151;that is the current position. The Law
Society supports the status quo, as do we.</div>
					<a name="07062714000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The supervisory tier is a
different matter because its responsibilities are different. To ask the
legal profession to meet its costs is not only unreasonable but
illogical and inconsistent with other Government policies. Sir David
Clementi&#146;s report, to which we have referred often today,
said:</div>
					<a name="07062714000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
issue arises as to how the LSB should be paid for. At present a
substantial part of the oversight function is paid for by the State:
judicial oversight falls to the taxpayer, as does the cost of the
oversight function carried out by Government departments. The arguments
in favour of the Government contributing to the cost of oversight
functions, beyond the fact that it does already, are...that the
LSB, in pursuit of its objectives...such as &#145;access to
justice&#146;, has a wider role in the public interest than the
oversight of practitioners in the legal
sector&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;the LSB
has a duty to the public as well as to the legal
profession&#151;and</div>
					<a name="07062714000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
an element of payment by other than the bodies being regulated confirms
that the regulator is independent of the
regulatee.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important principle We discussed that earlier in a different
context.</div>
					<a name="07062714000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir David
Clementi went
on:</div>
					<a name="07062714000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
an interesting precedent in the proposed funding of the Financial
Reporting Council. Its funding is to be split, two thirds falling to
the private sector and one third to Government. How the split should be
made between the private sector and Government for the LSB would need
to be covered in statute and would, therefore, be the subject of
Parliamentary
scrutiny.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">He pointed out
that the Government already meet a third of the cost of the Financial
Reporting Council. I understand that they also meet the full cost of
the supervisory tier of health care regulation, the Council for
Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. They have not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>given a significant or convincing explanation of why they consider it
appropriate for them to meet part of the supervisory tier of regulation
in accountancy, but not in legal
services.</div>
					<a name="07062714000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One
function of the Legal Services Board is to consider what additional
legal services should come within the regulatory net. That function is
currently the Government&#146;s function and does not form part of
the regulation of legal services. It is carried out entirely in the
public interest rather than in the interest of providers of legal
services. It seems therefore particularly unreasonable for the
Government to expect those costs to be borne by the legal profession.
The Joint Committee considered the issue and concluded that the legal
profession should not be expected to finance public policy
considerations currently funded in-house by the
Government.</div>
					<a name="07062714000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, the Government are saying that they will shift responsibility
from the public purse and pass it entirely from the taxpayer
collectively to the legal profession exclusively. They currently meet
the costs of the legal service ombudsman, whose functions will be
absorbed in the Office for Legal Complaints, now to be taken over
entirely by the legal profession, and part of the costs of the Legal
Services Complaints Commissioner referred to in glowing terms today by
the Minister and others, whose post is to be abolished by the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07062714000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Government also meet the costs associated with the legal services
consultative panel and the costs of the work in relation to the legal
services regulation of the Lord Chancellor and the senior judiciary. A
substantive amount of work is funded by the Government. Contributing on
a continuing basis towards the cost of regulation would thus maintain
the existing position rather than represent a new spending commitment
by the Government. We are not asking for more responsibility, but for
the status quo to be preserved in
essence.</div>
					<a name="07062714000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
can persuade the Minister that, although the Government will always try
to reduce their expenditure commitments, the amount spent on such
matters as a proportion of their expenditure is extremely small. The
sum that goes to the Lord Chancellor&#146;s budget at present
relative to the other budgets of state is extremely small. I hope that
the Government will agree that there is no absolute requirement to
shuffle off that
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="07062714000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
referred to the running costs, but I want now to say a word about
start-up costs. I am talking particularly in relation to amendment No.
241. Under the present provisions of the Bill, the Government intend
that not only the full continuing costs of both tiers of the regulatory
system, but the start-up costs, should be borne entirely by the legal
profession. Our amendment would change that and require the Government
to fund the start-up
costs.</div>
					<a name="07062714000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyone would
accept that it is unreasonable for all the start-up costs to be met by
the profession. As we have heard from the Minister&#146;s own mouth,
the functions of the Legal Services Board are essentially to provide
public assurance about the regulatory system rather than do a
front-line job. It is even more unreasonable for the transitional costs
to be paid by the legal profession, bearing in mind that it has its
system in place and that all have said that it has been ameliorated and
made more effective. To say, &#147;Hang on, guys, you not only have
to pay for what you are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>doing now and for what you have been doing, but for getting from where
you are to where the Government want you to be,&#148; seems
unreasonable.</div>
					<a name="07062714000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee&#146;s look at the draft Bill, in paragraph 455,
said:</div>
					<a name="07062714000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recommend that the Government give further consideration to funding the
start up costs of the new regulatory system. We understand that such
assurances have been given in respect of Part 2 of the Compensation
Bill which introduces a new regulatory regime for claims
management.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee went on to say, in paragraph 467,
that</div>
					<a name="07062714000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if the start-up
costs of the new system are to be met through levies and charges on
front line regulators, initial costs to the profession will be high and
will be met both by practitioners and consumers. This adds weight to
the argument that the start up costs of the LSB and OLC should be borne
by
Government.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s only substantive argument so far is the assertion
that those being regulated should pay for the regulatory system.
However, there is no explanation why, for example, accountancy&#151;a
profession of a similar type, often discussed in the Bill in the
context of working together&#151;should be regulated and funded in
one way, but law should now be regulated differently and should now be
funded differently, which is by the practitioners
themselves.</div>
					<a name="07062714000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
is no incentive in the proposals for Government to make sure that the
start-up costs are limited. By definition, if the Government do the job
and give the bill to someone else, there is no incentive to keep the
bill down. If the Government do the job and know that they have to pay
for it, there will be in-house regulatory systems to control the costs.
The estimates provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers, discussed in
Committee in the last few days, were very high for the transitional
process. Government indications are now that start-up costs are going
to be even higher. All the more reason for the Government to know that
they have a responsibility, which will hopefully add to the pressure to
keep the costs
down.</div>
					<a name="07062714000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
last point is about the precedent across Government. It is not unusual
for the start-up costs of regulatory bodies to be met by the
Government, whatever is done about the running costs later on. The
accountancy Financial Reporting Council, referred to earlier, had the
Government meeting the full transitional costs of establishing the new
body and a third of the continuing costs. That was the approach that
the Government took with the Claims Management Regulator, which we
discussed in a Committee like this not many months ago. Before that,
the Government took the same approach to the Council for Licensed
Conveyancers. There have been several precedents for one type. There is
now a change. The Joint Committee did not believe the change was right.
Sir David Clementi did not believe the change was right. The Government
have really not made their case. I hope that they see the benefit to
the taxpayer, to the consumer and to the profession from moving in an
agreed way. I hope that the Minister will be helpful and seriously
consider this, because at the moment there is severe discontent that
all the burden is being put on the professions to pay for a system
that, by definition, is a system of the Government&#146;s
creation.</div>

							<a name="07062714000563"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> During the Report stage in the other place, my
right hon. and noble Friend Baroness Ashton set out for their lordships
the further work that we have done in updating the financial analysis
conducted by PWC in support of the draft Bill. I have written to hon.
Members to set out how we have approached that work and provide more
detailed figures. Hon. Members should also now have received a copy of
the supplement to the regulatory impact assessment, which was published
alongside the Bill. That updates the cost
figures.</div>
					<a name="07062714000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
explained in that letter, and in the supplement to the RIA, following
our work on the revised costs, implementation now stands at
&#163;32.1 million and the revised running costs are &#163;4
million for the board and &#163;19.9 million for the OLC. Of those
costs, &#163;2.4 million will fall to the Ministry of Justice, so the
Government are making a
contribution.</div>
					<a name="07062714000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
obviously important that both hon. Members and the legal profession can
have some confidence in the figures. I want to emphasise, therefore,
that the adjustments that have been made are based on robust and
detailed analysis. Baroness Ashton has set out the revised figure for
implementation that will now form the basis of the implementation
budget for the board and the OLC, when they finally assume management
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="07062714000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to the principled argument about who should pay. Let me say
right from the outset that I do not accept that the Government should
contribute more than the &#163;2.4 million that I have already
mentioned&#151;either to the establishment costs or to the costs of
running the board and the OLC. We all know that the legal services
market is thriving, and that there was a turnover of some &#163;22
billion in 2005. The legal professions are in a very privileged
position in that they operate in a market where they provide reserved
legal services.</div>
					<a name="07062714000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe absolutely that the increased consumer confidence that will
result from a demonstrably independent regulatory and
complaints-handling service will benefit the lawyers. The opportunities
that the Bill creates for alternative business structures will benefit
lawyers as well. So it seems to me entirely right that, as they will be
beneficiaries, they should pay.</div>
					<a name="07062714000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another argument has been that
the Bill will allow the Government to make considerable savings. I am
not at all convinced of that. We will make some savings, but when we
do, the savings should be invested in other priority areas where the
investment is needed and where other funding sources are unavailable. I
am sure that I do not need to mention other aspects within the Ministry
of Justice in relation to which hon. Members on both sides would like
to see us invest some of that
money.</div>
					<a name="07062714000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally I
cannot accept that the Government should contribute because the board
plays a public interest role. The legal professional bodies currently
raise fees from the members that are not solely intended to pay for
regulatory costs and that also fund important public interest
activities in which those bodies participate&#151;on human rights and
law reform, for example. That approach should continue under the new
framework.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>
					<a name="07062714000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey mentioned the arguments on funding
arrangements that are in place for other regulatory
organisations&#151;in particular, the Financial Reporting Council. I
have considered the funding arrangements of other bodies, including the
FRC, the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, the Financial
Services Authority, the financial services ombudsman, the pensions
regulator, the Office of Communications, and the claims management
regulator. I discovered no rigid approach; the Government fund
establishments and running costs in some cases but not
others.</div>
					<a name="07062714000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the FRC in
particular, its accounting, auditing and corporate governance
activities are funded by a tripartite arrangement with contributions
from the accountancy professions, the business community and
Government. Other costs, connected with audit inspections and the
investigation and discipline of accountants, are funded entirely by the
accountancy professions. The Government provide no funding in relation
to actuaries. There are therefore big differences between systems, and
the decision must be made on a case-by-case basis. Our starting
position is that unless there is a compelling case for public funding
there should be no increase in public expenditure, and I do not believe
that there is such a case in the present instance.</div>
					<a name="07062714000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I know that
the legal profession has argued that, if the Government made a
contribution, that would incentivise them and us to reduce costs. We
are absolutely committed to ensuring value for money in the reforms.
That is why the Bill contains the safeguards that it does. The levy
rules are subject to extensive consultation requirements, the Lord
Chancellor&#146;s consent and parliamentary scrutiny through the
negative procedure and, under clause 147(5)(c), the affirmative
procedure. All those measures will ensure that the new bodies&#146;
spending will be properly contained. As I said, the revised figures
that we have announced will form the implementation budget for the
board and the OLC. That is another check on
costs.</div>
					<a name="07062714000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am conscious
that there is some concern about the impact that the costs involved in
establishing the board and the OLC might have on individual
practitioners. I reassure Members that the Government are clear that we
will not seek to recover those costs in a single year; rather, we will
do so on a phased basis, and we share that with the professionals in
every discussion about the matter. That will help relieve any potential
pressure on the bodies themselves and on their
practitioners.</div>
					<a name="07062714000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
continue to work with stakeholders on the details of the process, just
as I want the Government to work with them on all other aspects of the
Bill&#146;s implementation. Only last Friday, officials held a useful
discussion with stakeholders about costs, and it was agreed that
further individual meetings with stakeholders will take place to ensure
that they are fully sighted on all the issues, methodology and
assumptions underpinning our work on cost. That open dialogue is
important if we are to retain the confidence of the professional bodies
as well as of consumers and others. I am committed to ensuring that we
do so. On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey to withdraw his amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000564"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> There was quite a lot in the Minister&#146;s
reply. I shall pick up on a couple of points, because the issue is
substantive and significant for the
professionals.</div>
					<a name="07062714000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the Minister said that the Government will contribute &#163;2.4
million. Can she put on the record why that sum has been plucked out?
She gave figures according to the latest assessment that she called
robust. Can she put on the record what percentage of the start-up costs
she and her Department believe that sum represents? I have been arguing
that the payment is the start-up costs and a third of the running
costs. It would be helpful to see where we are starting from in this
debate, or where we have got to in our difference of
views.</div>
					<a name="07062714000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
should be interested to know whether the Government have any
independent support for their position. I have not heard the Minister
cite any. If there is any, where does it come from, and will the
Government put that on the record? Independent support exists for the
position for which I am arguing.</div>
					<a name="07062714000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, the one point with
which the Minister did not deal was the argument that if the profession
is to fund all but the &#163;2.4 million, that does not support the
proposition that the board is a brand new body, entirely independent of
the profession, set up by Government to give that independence. It is
inconsistent, because the system will still be funded by the people
against whom complaints will be made. In terms of showing the
independence of the agency, I do not think that the Government have
made the
case.</div>
					<a name="07062714000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly, the
Minister conceded that savings will be made by Government. She said
that they were small. I should be grateful for her best estimate on
advice of the smallest and largest band of savings a year in each of
the first three years so that we can understand, because we are all
interested in the budget of the Ministry of Justice. I am intrigued, as
other people watching and listening will be, to know what the expected
savings are. It would be helpful to have that on the
record.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07062714000417"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07062714000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, the
Minister said, &#147;If we make some savings, there are all these
wonderful candidates for other spend.&#148; The one wonderful
candidate that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk and I have argued
should get more expenditure is legal aid, but Ministers in the
Department are saying that there will be no more expenditure on legal
aid. On Sunday, according to my television, the new Labour leader said
to the nation that the new Government will listen and will serve the
people and bow down in front of them. They should therefore be
listening.</div>
					<a name="07062714000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister had said to us that the Government were going to make savings
of &#163;1 million, which would be added to the legal aid budget, we
would have been tempted, but I have not heard her say that. She has
said that there will be some small savings, which the Government will
spend somewhere, although she will not tell us where. She tells us that
she still does not know whether the Department will get a significant
increase in the comprehensive spending review, which has now been
delayed until the
autumn.</div>
					<a name="07062714000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful for quick answers. With the agreement of the Committee, I
shall not press for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>Division now. The Minister dealt with the comparative points to an
extent. I want to go away and examine accountancy set-up costs,
accountancy running costs and the costs of the Healthcare Commission,
which the Minister talked about. There are issues that it would be
sensible to consider again. If she can answer the specific questions,
we can go into that debate better informed.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000565"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I will do my best to answer at least some of the
questions that the hon. Gentleman has raised. I will, of course, write
to him and to the Committee about any that I do not answer.</div>
					<a name="07062714000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figure of &#163;2.4
million relates to the closure of the Office of the Legal Services
Ombudsman and the Office of the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner,
plus the Ministry of Justice&#146;s costs associated with the
internal running of the programme. That is about 7.5 per cent.
of the implementation costs. The hon. Gentleman said that he felt that
the independence of the board and the OLC would be compromised, to
which I say that both the Financial Services Authority and the
Financial Ombudsman Service are entirely funded by the professions that
they regulate. I do not think that any of us consider that they lack
independence. Despite the fact that the professions will provide the
funding, there is no need to believe that the board and the OLC will
not be absolutely independent.
</div>
					<a name="07062714000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">On some of the other
issues, I will have to write to the hon. Gentleman. I want to ensure
that everyone on the Committee is aware of how we see the money being
spent. He made a plea for increased spending on legal aid; I had a
feeling in my heart of hearts that that would be the first call, should
there be any spare money. It is not for me to make those spending
commitments on behalf of the Government, but I will try to give him the
figures of likely savings to the Ministry of Justice and an idea of how
the Department might use
them.</div>
					
					<a name="07062714000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000566"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I am grateful for that response. By way of a
postscript, I add that we have today been given the chance to pick up
the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which is the first product
of the Ministry of Justice&#151;the first Bill born of its womb. I
venture to suggest that we might save a lot of money if we did not have
yet another Bill with more apparent remedies, just like the past 10
years&#146; worth of criminal justice Bills. Will the Minister be
kind enough to tell us the cost to her Department of implementing that
Bill? Some of us would say that that money would be better spent
elsewhere. I look forward to as full an answer as possible. I would
certainly rather that the Committee has all the information to look at.
We will return to the issue on Report, but in the meantime, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

was so excited about the new Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill that
I had not caught up with the fact that this amendment would be with us
so quickly. It would add for the purpose of clarity a statement that
would give priority to the duty to comply with regulatory arrangements.
It would be inserted after subsection (1), which sets out the duties of
regulated persons.</div>
					<a name="07062714000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are now into part 8; we have made great progress, and we are in the
home stretch. This aspect of the Bill is called &#147;Duties of
regulated persons&#148;, as is the clause, which starts by
saying:</div>
					<a name="07062714000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person who is a regulated person in relation to an approved regulator
has a duty to comply with the regulatory arrangements of the approved
regulator&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062714000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would set out that that statement overrides any other obligations that
that person may have,</div>
					<a name="07062714000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including to shareholders
(otherwise than under the criminal law), if those obligations are
inconsistent with the duty to comply with the regulatory
arrangements.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07062714000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Members&#146; explanatory statement, of which some of us are keen
fans, says that the
amendment</div>
					<a name="07062714000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is intended to
put beyond doubt that for all those within the regulated sector, the
duty to comply with regulatory arrangements is
paramount&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07062714000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real
reason for the amendment is that if the Bill is passed as the
Government want it to be, alternative business structures will be set
up, organisations with people from different professions will work
together, and they will not be governed as the legal profession on its
own was governed in the past, simply by its own regulatory
objectives.</div>
					<a name="07062714000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
debate is like the earlier one about the priority of access to justice
and the Legal Services Board. The amendment would ensure that, beyond
peradventure, people understood and were in no doubt about the
priorities. The Minister may say that the drafting is not perfect, that
it is not in the right place or other things. I hope that she will say
that subject to the criminal law, there must be an overriding duty of
compliance, which the Bill should be absolutely express about for the
avoidance of doubt. I await with interest her
reply.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07062714000568"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> Sir Nicholas, I am sure that you are aware that
this issue was debated on several occasions in the other place. We made
it clear then that the duty of lawyers and their practices to comply
with the professional conduct rules and other regulatory arrangements
is absolutely essential, which is why we have placed those obligations
on a statutory footing and written several supporting safeguards into
the Bill. There should be no scope for it to be compromised by other
obligations&#151;to shareholders or otherwise.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>
					<a name="07062714000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill already achieves the
amendment&#146;s objective. If the lawyer or the licensed body were
to breach professional conduct rules, they would be acting
inconsistently with clause 177 and breaking the law. Approved
regulators would be able to take whatever remedial action was necessary
if the breach were serious&#151;for example, allowing client
confidentiality to be compromised in order to deliver a better return
for shareholders. That would be grounds for revoking a licence and for
permanently disqualifying the individual from ever working in an ABS
firm again. There is no way that compliance with other obligations
could ever provide a defence for that. Directors of that licensed body
could not countenance breach of the law in the name of their duties to
shareholders. If that were the case, directors could cause their
companies to breach regulatory obligations all the time and then defend
their actions by saying that they did it in the name of shareholder
obligation. That simply is not how company law works.</div>
					<a name="07062714000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Directors cannot take decisions
that cause breaches of statutory obligations in the name of an
obligation to their shareholders. They must abide by their statutory
obligations, and their duties to shareholders do not justify any breach
of those obligations. There is no conflict, so there is no need for an
override provision. We have had detailed discussions on this matter
with the FSA and the DTI, both of which confirmed that directors cannot
use their duties to shareholders to justify the breach of a statutory
obligation. They also confirmed that directors&#146; duties,
including those to promote the success of the company as set out in the
Companies Act 2006, presume that directors and their companies will be
subject to all kinds of other obligations&#151;statutory, fiduciary
and regulatory. Section 172 of the Act co-exists with those duties; it
does not conflict with them, so there is no need for an override
provision.</div>
					<a name="07062714000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear that
the introduction of an override provision would cast out the principle
of co-existence and would effectively state that such clauses are
needed to ensure that directors comply with their statutory
obligations, which clearly is not right. Such a provision might create
negative influences for other duties, which could be damaging and could
lead to uncertainty in applying principles that are vital to ensure
consumer protection and to comply with legal obligations.</div>
					<a name="07062714000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The importance of that
principle is not unique to legal services, and I certainly do not want
to jeopardise the interests of consumers in other sectors and create
uncertainty about the application of company law by incorporating an
unnecessary provision. I do not think that an override provision is
needed, and accepting it might compromise the position that is set out
clearly in the Companies Act. It is well known that directors cannot
use their obligations to shareholders to override statutory
obligations. I hope that my comments have reassured the hon. Gentleman
enough for him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her considered
reply, and I take seriously what she said about having consulted the
DTI and others and that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>is their clear view that such protection is not needed. She was very
clear, and people will be able to look back through the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
records to read what has been said about statutes and statutory
protection in certain appropriate circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07062714000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, we are all clear
that the criminal law reigns supreme, but I want to clarify one thing.
I understand the Minister to have said that obligations that do not of
themselves give rise to criminal breach, but are obligations because
the regulator has imposed guidance or required certain things, are
still overriding obligations as set out in the Bill, and that one
cannot pray in aid of shareholders&#146; interests and set those
obligations against each other. Criminal law, of course, comes first,
but other obligations are expressly to take precedence over any
shareholder obligations, even if they do not have a criminal sanction.
I think that that is what the Minister was clearly saying, but I would
be grateful if she could clarify it. If that is the case, it might
provide the necessary reassurance. I would not want any amendment to be
accepted that compromises the achievement of that hierarchy of
obligations.</div>
					<a name="07062714000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
we are looking at different sorts of firms, maybe run by non-lawyers,
such as big insurance or investment companies or private equity firms,
which will need to know what the score is. They need to know absolutely
that if they come into this business, and if ABSs take off and that
part gets through&#151;a lot of discussion still needs to take place
between the two Houses&#151;in England and Wales, they must be
governed by the same regulatory regime as that which governs law-only
professions and which has worked well in that context
recently.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman that
reassurance. Statutory obligations are key. He is right to talk about
criminal sanctions at the top of the hierarchy, but any statutory
obligations will override any obligation to shareholders. I hope that
that gives him that reassurance. He is quite right to say that those
who might own some of those firms in the future must be very clear that
that is the case absolutely. Hopefully, this debate will have gone some
way to making that clear to
them.</div>

applies to set up an ABS, if permitted&#151;some of us are still
unhappy about that, but we will continue that debate
elsewhere&#151;they will get a copy of the &#147;Minister says
