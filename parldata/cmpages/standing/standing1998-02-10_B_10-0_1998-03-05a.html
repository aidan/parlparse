<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 88, in page 20, line 18, at end, insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) Before issuing any code of practice the Secretary of State shall consult the Police Authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I think that I had almost finished. I know why we adjourned early before lunch. It was because the Whip, the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd), was having a little party. It is his birthday today and we should record that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): It is not traditional for the Whip to appear on the public record, but I should explain that that was not the reason why we adjourned early. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind regards and should put it on the record that it is the hon. Gentleman's birthday tomorrow. Strangely enough, he is a few years older than I.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We shall leave it to the Committee to decide who looks the older of the two.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): On a point of order, Mr. Jones. We adjourned for lunch earlier than expected, because the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) had finished his contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have finally remembered that, yes, I had.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter (Basingstoke):</B> I shall not detain the Committee for more than a moment or two on the amendments. I was briefly encouraged by the Minister's comments on clause 37 and I particularly note, if I understood correctly what he said, that he is prepared to consider, at least in some circumstances, a consultation role for the Police Association as well as for the Police Authority. I very much hope that the Under-Secretary will apply the same sentiments as were expressed on clause 37 when he addresses these amendments. In clause 38 we detect that further lack of consultation and a further arbitrary power being bestowed on the Secretary of State, and we do not like what we see.
<P>
To set the amendments in their context, clause 38 provides for the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``issue, and . . . revise codes of practice relating to the discharge by the Police Authority of any of its functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We see here another manifestation of the imbalance and lack of fairness in the tripartite structure of so much of the Bill, to which we have previously drawn attention. Yet again the Secretary of State is being given what amounts almost to dictatorial powers, and amendments Nos. 87 and 88 seek to redress that position.
<P>
Amendment No. 87 inserts the words ``procedures for'' into subsection (1) and amendment No. 88 adds a new subsection (1A):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before issuing any code of practice the Secretary of State shall consult the Police Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If amendment No. 87 were accepted, subsection (1) would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may issue, and from time to time revise, codes of practice relating to procedures for the discharge by the Police Authority of any of its functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This morning my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to amendment No. 87 as a small amendment. I am not sure that it is as small as all that. Perhaps I am reading too much into it, but I believe that it has some significance and is worthy of merit. Amendment No. 88 self-evidently requires the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority before issuing any code of practice.
<P>
The amendments have a common theme--they would enhance the status and operational independence of the Police Authority while correspondingly restricting the power of the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 87 would mean that the Secretary of State would issue or revise codes of practice relating not to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the discharge by the Police Authority of any of its functions'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but to ``procedures for'' the discharging of those functions. That is a significant distinction. The key consideration is that it is not for the Secretary of State to dictate in detail to the Police Authority how it should discharge its functions. We argue that it is more appropriate for the Secretary of State to be at arm's length. He or she should issue or revise codes of practice rather than having the power to intervene arbitrarily and directly.
<P>
Amendment No. 88 advances the same theme and would mean the Secretary of State having to consult the Police Authority before issuing any code of practice. It can be argued that it would be intolerable for the Secretary of State not to do that and instead arbitrarily to impose on the Police Authority a code of practice without consulting it first. Given that that would be intolerable, it is surely right for the Bill to specify that such consultation should take place--hence amendment No. 88.
<P>
The amendments are intended to help ensure that the authority has appropriate status and independence, not least in its dealings with the Secretary of State. They would therefore strengthen the authority appropriately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Clause 38 will enable the Secretary of State to set out publicly how key aspects of the relationship between the Police Authority and the Secretary of State are to be governed. I would point out that in referring to the Secretary of State, we are talking about the Secretary of State enforcing the will of Parliament. The accountability of the police force and everything that is publicly funded must lie with Parliament. I would therefore resist the assertion that they are dictatorial or pre-emptive powers; they are powers invested in Parliament through the Secretary of State.
<P>
I am not convinced of the need for amendment No. 87, which I think the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) would agree is the lesser of the two amendments. Section 39 of the Police Act 1996 uses precisely the same wording as the clause, and I am not aware of it causing any problems in England and Wales. I do not think that a case has been made for changing the wording.
<P>
Amendment No. 88 would require my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority before issuing it with codes of practice. As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said this morning, we would accept such an amendment in principle, and an amendment will be introduced on Report. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 88. We will come back on Report with procedures relating to this cluster of clauses and they will deal with the issues that have been raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for reiterating comments made before lunch by the Minister of State, who assured the Committee that the Government would carefully reconsider clauses 37 to 39, with a view to incorporating at least some Opposition aims into the Bill, perhaps by tabling amendments on Report.
<P>
The Minister referred to section 39 of the 1996 Act. He said that the wording of clause 38 was lifted from that section. I agree. Section 39(3) has not, however, been transferred across. That important subsection states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament a copy of any code of practice, and of any revision of a code of practice, issued by him under this section.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 37(2) requires the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``lay before both Houses of Parliament any statement of principles''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Northern Ireland legislation will include that requirement.
<P>
The 1996 Act states that the Secretary of State--the Home Secretary, in terms of that Act--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall lay before Parliament a copy of any code of practice''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that he would draw up for police authorities in England and Wales. The Bill, which applies to Northern Ireland, omits that subsection. I shall not say that that is an oversight; I am sure that it is not. However, I am puzzled about why the requirement that is stated clearly in clause 37(2) is not repeated in clause 38. For that matter, the requirement relating to codes of practice does not appear in the general guidance covered by the next clause or anywhere else in the group of related clauses.
<P>
The Minister was right to preface his remarks by saying that the relevant powers are given to the Secretary of State because he is responsible to Parliament. That is why the 1996 Act states that the codes of practice shall be laid before Parliament. Parliament would be able to see proposed codes of practice and to scrutinise them, and would perhaps be able to comment on them. In the case of Northern Ireland, however, that will not be done, although it is done in section 37.
<P>
Will the Minister deal with that matter, or at least tell the Committee why it has been deemed appropriate to omit the relevant subsection from the clause?
<P>
I shall make another general point. Government amendment No. 55 changed the word ``may'' to ``shall'' in clause 37. Clause 38, however, states that the Secretary of State ``may'' issue codes of practice. If he shall issue a statement of principles, why should not the word ``shall'' be included in clause 38, and applied to codes of practice? Why is the word ``shall'' not used in this instance? The Government have not proposed to make that change. The Government should, either in relation to the amendments or to clause stand part, clarify why such a change is deemed appropriate in one instance but not in another.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> We can listen to what the hon. Gentleman says and consider the issue. I have not considered it before, but from a quick look at it, it seems appropriate to say ``may issue''. There is no compulsion to issue codes of practice frequently, but one could be issued when the Secretary of State judged it necessary. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the issue is not crucial. We can, however, consider whether a small one-word change needs to be made.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's first point concerned the difference between the English and Welsh legislation and the Bill. The difference is just a question of scale. The codes in England and Wales cover 43 police authorities. There must be an opportunity for local police authority objections to be aired and dealt with in a framework such as that offered by Parliament. In Northern Ireland, grievances can be raised directly with the Secretary of State.
<P>
The Bill contains the requirement to lay matters before Parliament where necessary. The Secretary of State's objectives, which are dealt with in clause 14, and the statement of policing principles, which is dealt with in clause 37, have significant implications for everyone in Northern Ireland and not just for the Police Authority and the Secretary of State. We have, therefore, said that they must be laid before Parliament. The guidance issued under clause 39 is primarily a matter for the Police Authority, the RUC and the Secretary of State. It is, therefore, not necessary to lay it before Parliament. Furthermore, there is a direct right of access to clear issues up. That is a sensible use of the difference in Northern Ireland. The Government wil introduce proposals on Report to strengthen the consultation that would occur in any case.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response; he has confirmed that he will reconsider various issues. He has not, however, answered the question that was put to him. Why is it deemed necessary and important under clause 37 to lay the statement of principles before both Houses of Parliament for parliamentary scrutiny but not to do the same for the codes of practice? The provisions for the codes of practice mirror those in section 39 of the 1996 Act.
<P>
The Minister said that the scale was different and of course it is. At the same time, however, what is being done is equally important for each police authority. If my police authority in Cambridgeshire feels it necessary to have codes of practice laid before Parliament so that it can respond to and have a say in them, I feel that the Police Authority in Northern Ireland would want similar treatment.
<P>
I leave the matter there. I shall withdraw the amendment with the proviso that the Minister and his colleague will consider the provisions for consultation. Will they consider carefully why there is inconsistency between the legislation for England and Wales and that for Northern Ireland?
<P>
The Government's own special clause 37 is replicated nowhere else, and Ministers were at pains before lunch to tell us that we should welcome their new innovation, which is not based on other legislation. They may be the case, but the Government have deemed it proper and necessary to lay the statement of principles before both Houses of Parliament. On that note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 39</center></H4>
<H4><center>Guidance as to exercise of functions by police force</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 20, line 24, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) Before issuing any guidance the Secretary of State shall consult<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the Police Authority<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the Chief Constable.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I need not detain the Committee long on this. We covered the various clauses in our previous debates and the amendment would have exactly the same effect as previous amendments. The principle is that we suggest that in issuing the guidance that is to be exercised by members of the police force in any of their functions,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State shall consult''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
both the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. We have already received an assurance that Ministers are going to take another look at this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I wish to underline the point that my hon. Friend has made, and to say that what we see as the Government's conversion to the principle of consultation is most welcome. I hope that it will be applied in the remit covered by the amendment.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Clause 39 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 40 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 41</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appointment of inspectors of constabulary</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 21, line 6, after `State', insert `and the Police Authority'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 91, in page 21, line 12, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or the Police Authority, with the agreement of the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Clause 41 deals with the appointment and duties of Her Majesty's inspectors of constabulary. It is replicated from section 54 of the 1996 Act. Its contents are also in section 16 of the 1970 Act. There have been cordial and constructive working relationships over a long period between the various inspectors of constabulary and the Police Authority in Northern Ireland. The Police Authority has for some time been in the habit of receiving copies of HMIC reports.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 would insert the words ``and the Police Authority'' in line 6 so that subsection (2) would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The inspectors shall at least once in every year inspect and report to the Secretary of State and the Police Authority on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland Police Service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The inspectors are required to report on those matters at least once a year. One of the primary functions of the Police Authority is to secure the efficiency and effectiveness of the police service in Northern Ireland; I refer yet again to the authority's duties under clause 2(3). It is axiomatic, therefore, that the Police Authority should be informed as soon as possible about the inspectors' findings.
<P>
The police will be held to account by the Police Authority on behalf of the community. We have discussed that several times, especially in relation to the annual policing plan. It is important, therefore, that the authority should be seen to have the same power as the Secretary of State to require the inspectors to carry out the further duties referred to in clause 41(4). Amendment No. 91 would insert, after ``Secretary of State'', the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or the Police Authority, with the agreement of the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) would then read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The inspectors shall carry out such other duties for the purpose of furthering the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland Police Service and make such other reports as the Secretary of State, or the Police Authority, with the agreement of the Secretary of State, may from time to time direct.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments are helpful and reasonable. They would strengthen the position of the Police Authority, not only in substance--the argument might well be made that the Police Authority would be consulted on those matters--but because the authority's role would be defined in the Bill. The authority already receives the inspectors' reports, but the amendments would ensure that it receives them by statute.
<P>
The amendments would strengthen the authority's hand in carrying out its task of securing an effective and efficient police service. As subsection (4) requires the inspectors to report on that issue, it is logical to include the Police Authority so that it can discharge its functions properly. The authority would have the power to ask for reports from the inspectorate as and when necessary. The Secretary of State has that power; there is no reason why it should not be afforded to the authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> My hon. Friend has drawn attention to the context for the amendments. Clause 41 makes provision for the appointment of inspectors of constabulary from among Her Majesty's inspectors of constabulary under section 54 of the 1996 Police Act. The clause closely reflects section 16 of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970.
<P>
Clause 41(2), to which amendment No. 90 refers, requires the inspectors at least once a year to inspect and report to the Secretary of State on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland police service. It is for the Police Authority to secure the efficiency and effectiveness of the police service.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 reasonably requires the inspectors to report not only to the Secretary of State but to the authority. The strength and merit of that are self-evident. The inspectors' annual reports into the effectiveness and efficiency of the police service will provide important and significant help in the achieving of those goals. It is right and proper that the reports be submitted to the Police Authority because it will want to know the inspectors' advice and judgment in order to do its work more efficiently. The arguments can be reversed. It would be hard to think of a reason not to submit reports to it--indeed, failure to do so would detract from and negate the authority's standing. Nor is there a compelling reason for reports to be sent to the Secretary of State alone.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 91 follows logically from amendment No. 90, and the arguments for it are similar. Subsection (4) enables the Secretary of State to direct the inspectors to carry out further duties for the purpose of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland police service. The amendment enables the Police Authority also so to direct the inspectors. Again the reason is self evident; as the authority is responsible for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness, it is only reasonable that it should have the statutory power to direct the inspectors to undertake further duties, to assist it in securing those aims.
<P>
The amendment would not bestow an absolute power because it is rigidly qualified. The power could be exercised only with the agreement of the Secretary of State. That is an important qualification that acknowledges the Secretary of State's primacy in the tripartite structure. In the unlikely event of the authority wishing to exercise its power frivolously or irresponsibly, the Secretary of State effectively has the power of veto. Nevertheless, sensibly used with the Secretary of State's agreement, the power would enable the authority better to fulfil its responsbility for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness. After all, that is the authority's raison d'etre and one of the Bill's purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Having established our qualifications as reasonable people earlier by being so reasonable about consultations, I am afraid that I cannot agree to the amendment.
<P>
I go back to the analogy of the tripartite structure and the three-legged stool that we are erecting. Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary is part of the leg that includes the Government and the Secretary of State. To accept the amendment would have implications not just in Northern Ireland but in the rest of the United Kingdom, because it would change the nature of Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary.
<P>
When the inspectorate conducts an inquiry into the efficiency and effectiveness of the RUC, it also assesses whether the Police Authority has carried out its general duty. The Police Authority is part of that inspection and part of what is being scrutinised. To make the Police Authority part of the body commissioning the inspection changes the relationships. It would be inappropriate for the inspectorate to report to the Police Authority.
<P>
The inspectorate acts on behalf of the Secretary of State, who bears the full cost of an inspection of the RUC. The Secretary of State determines what an inspection should focus on, apart from the general inquiry, and meets the resulting costs. The Police Authority cannot be party to the final decision on how an inspection is to be conducted. There is a great danger in muddling the functions of each leg of the inspection. The Bill tries to clarify the respective roles.
<P>
The matter is clear-cut: on behalf of Parliament and of the people, Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary is part of the important existing accountability mechanism of the police and we should not muddy the waters by saying that one of the bodies that is inspected can commission that inspection. There is an analogy with school inspections. It would not be acceptable for the governors of a school to commission an outside inspection that would look at the configuration of relationships within the school, and as the RUC and the Police Authority are part of the inspection, the waters should not be muddied as the hon. Member for Basingstoke suggests.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman extend his argument to the qualification in amendment No. 91? If the amendment were accepted, under subsection (4) the Police Authority would be able to perform its duty only with the agreement of the Secretary of State. My argument is that it would theoretically be beneficial in some circumstances for the Secretary of State to allow the inspectorate to act in accordance with the wishes of the Police Authority in pursuing its goals of effectiveness and efficiency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Of the two amendments, both of which are wrong in what they seek to do, it could be argued that the second it less wrong than the first. But it, too, would muddy the water. Clearly, if the Police Authority is concerned about the operations of the police, the authority can express its concerns to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State, having heard what the Police Authority says, may then ask the inspectorate to look at the matter. To enshrine in statute the Police Authority's power to take in commissioning the inspection would muddy the water. It must be clear that authority for the inspectorate's work resides with the inspectorate and the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister has made a strong and powerful case. I accept that a requirement to report could be misleading. The Police Authority receives HMIC reports. Clause 42(3)(a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall send a copy of the published report to the Police Authority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept the Under-Secretary's point that to place in statute a requirement for the inspectorate to report to the Policy Authority would put it in a different position from police authorities in England and Wales. As he said, if would muddy the waters. Therefore I shall be happy to withdraw amendment No. 90.
<P>
When the Under-Secretary covered amendment No. 91, he said that the Police Authority was free at any time to approach the Secretary of State with anxieties about policing, the conduct of senior officers or the implementation of the policing plan. It may tell the Secretary of State that an inspection is required to prove a case and to resolve a problem. I am pleased to receive the Under-Secretary's assurance that that is possible, but it would be encouraging if the assurance could be strengthened through guidelines. The ability to approach the Secretary of State should be clearly stated.
<P>
In the light of the Under-Secretary's argument, I accept that it may be wrong for the Police Authority to instigate an inspection. However, if it asks the Secretary of State to send in the inspectors, it indirectly instigates an inspection, albeit with the Secretary of State's agreement and approval. Where in the Bill will the Police Authority find the right to approach the Secretary of State? If the Minister can explain that, I shall be happy not to press amendment No. 91.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Consultation occurs all the time. The Bill provides for it, and the provisions will be even stronger when we table amendments to the clauses that we have just discussed. It is a simple fact that the Police Authority can approach the Secretary of State with its anxieties. We hope that the Police Authority will not be so worried about a problem that it requires the inpectorate to examine it. I hope that good order and discipline practices will prevent such a problem from arising.
<P>
Consultation facilities exist. I reiterate that there is a great difference between consultation and making the inspectorate statutorily subject to the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have one small question about subsection (1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may appoint from among Her Majesty's Inspectors of Constabulary'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
whereas subsection (2) states that the inspectors ``shall'' report to the Secretary of State. Why is it that the Secretary of State ``may'' rather than ``shall'' appoint? That matter need not detain us long, but there may be times when it is imperative for the Secretary of State to appoint, so ``shall'' would strengthen the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> After nearly 11 years in the House, I still do not fully understand ``mays'' and ``shalls'', and I suspect that that applies to hundreds of other hon. Members. I shall check the matter further and provide an explanation on Report.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) Before causing an inquiry to be held the Secretary of State shall consult the Police Authority unless to do so would be against the interests of national security or might jeopardise the safety of any person.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 93, in clause 45, page 22, line 22, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after consultation with the Police Authority'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Amendment No. 90 applies to clause 44 whereas amendment No. 91 applies to the following clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Those are the wrong numbers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I got the numbers wrong, but the gist of what I said was correct because the lead amendment, No. 92, applies to clause 44 and the subsidiary one, amendment No. 93, applies to clause 45. They deal with a similar point relating to consultation between the Secretary of State and the Police Authority.
<P>
Clause 44 deals with the Secretary of State's power to set up inquiries under article 83 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. Similar provision for England and Wales is made under section 49 of the 1996 Act. However, although that section is explicit in providing that the costs should be borne by one or more police funds, the Bill makes no reference to the financing of inquiries.
<P>
I hope that the Minister, with adequate prompting from his officials, will provide me with further information about that problem. It could be covered by a reference in clause 44(3) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Schedule 8 to the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps the information about who pays for the inquiries is to be found there.
<P>
I have not been able, during my research, to discover whether any such inquiry has ever been held in Northern Ireland. Perhaps the Minister will confirm the facts of that. That should not of course mean that the Bill should not provide the Secretary of State with the wherewithal to call such inquiries. No doubt any such inquiry would attract considerable media and public interest. The Police Authority would be at the heart of that, as the body responsible for securing an efficient and effective Northern Ireland police service. Any hint or suggestion of inefficiency or ineffectiveness, or wrongdoing of any kind, would come firmly to rest at the Police Authority's front door. It would have no hiding place. Clause 2 sets out its task of securing effective and efficient policing for Northern Ireland. Any other outcome would be treated as its responsibility.
<P>
In view of what I have outlined, it is inconceivable that the Police Authority should not be consulted about a proposed inquiry. I can envisage its intimate knowledge of policing matters enabling it to carry out an instigatory role. We recently discussed the idea that, in the context of the regular contact between the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority, the latter might instigate reports and inquiries, particularly by the inspectorate. My argument now is the same; that because of its knowledge of policing matters the Police Authority could draw to the Secretary of State's attention circumstances that would lead inexorably to an inquiry.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 would add a new subsection to the clause, requiring the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority before setting up an inquiry. That would assist the Police Authority in maintaining its public credibility, and in discharging the important functions given to it under clause 2. To reverse the argument, it is difficult to see how the Police Authority could discharge those functions if it were excluded from discussions about setting up an inquiry. It might be positively hindered in its duties if that were so.
<P>
Amendment 93 would insert into clause 45 a reference to consultation, so that subsection (1) would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Police Authority, may set up such bodies and take such other steps as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of undertaking research into matters affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland Police Service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Once again, we want the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority--in this case on research into matters of efficiency and effectiveness. There are no similar provisions in the 1970 Act, which is the current legislation. The clause as it stands is probably based on sections 57 and 58 of the Police Act 1996--indeed, I think that clause 45(1) is identical to section 58 of that Act.
<P>
There is no direct link between clause 45(2) of the Bill and the legislation for England and Wales. Subsection (2) allows the Secretary of State to set up bodies to give advice. Section 57 of the 1996 Act refers to ``common services'' and subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may provide and maintain, or may contribute to the provision or maintenance of, such organisations, facilities and services as he considers necessary or expedient for promoting the efficiency or effectiveness of the police.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the same section, powers are given to the Secretary of State 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``requiring all police forces in England and Wales to use specified facilities or services''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State can direct police authorities in England and Wales to take up such services, but before making regulations requiring police forces to use those facilities and services, the Secretary of State must consult police authorities and chief constables. Section 57(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before making regulations under this section, the Secretary of State shall consult . . . persons whom he considers to represent the interests of police authorities, and . . . persons whom he considers to represent the interests of chief officers of police.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, when dealing with matters such as research, advice, and special services or facilities that may or may not be provided, the Secretary of State must ensure that proper consultation takes place with the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 refers to the inquiries that may or may not be set up under clause 44, and amendment No. 93 refers to consultation on the research and advice provisions in clause 45. The logic behind the amendments starts with the premise set out in clause 2(3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall secure that the Northern Ireland Police Service is efficient and effective.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems to me, therefore, that the Police Authority has a direct interest in proposals for establishing bodies to undertake research into matters affecting that service's efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
It is arguable that the duty placed on the Police Authoriity in Northern Ireland is more specific than that placed on police authorities in England and Wales. As the Committee has noted frequently, the working relationship between the Secretary of State, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable--the so-called tripartite structure--is much closer in Northern Ireland because of the scale and because of the way in which the system has been set up. That is not a matter of contention; it has been used in argument by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I recognise not only that that is the reality, but that it is a force for good.
<P>
The Bill prescribes that the Secretary of State shall, without actually talking to the Police Authority, set up bodies to research into the very matters that are the authority's prerogative, duty and responsibility. That seems to be at best an oversight; at worst, it is yet another slight to the authority's standing.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
These two simple amendments deal with a similar issue: consultation. The first refers to inquiries that the Secretary of State may set up, while the other relates to clause 45, under which the Secretary of State may set up research bodies. If the Bill is enacted as published, it is my opinion, as well as the Police Authority's opinion, that to circumscribe the authority's functions in that way diminishes its status and credibility.
<P>
On page 44 of the previous Government's White Paper, ``Foundations for Policing'', under the heading of other responsibilities, we read that it was envisaged that the Police Authority for Northern Ireland would have responsibility for,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in consultation with the Secretary of State and Chief Constable, sponsoring and publishing research into policing issues.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As is clear from that White Paper, until May last year the previous Government intended to introduce legislation--had we had the good fortune to be returned--that would have had built in to it that link in research matters and the setting up of research bodies jointly between the Secretary of State, the Police Authority and, as the White Paper says, the Chief Constable.
<P>
The authorship of much of the Bill originated with the previous Government. Officials, some of whom may be here today, worked extremely hard on the White Paper and have worked equally hard in drafting the Bill. The advice that officials gave before last May was that the area of research should be shared between the various components of the tripartite structure. However, it does not appear that that has been carried across into clause 45. I am curious as to why it has changed--have circumstances altered in the intervening months and encouraged the Government to reword the provision? I am confident that the Minister will tell us why the changes have been deemed necessary, although I for one cannot think of a reason why.
<P>
The Police Authority should be included in and be very much part of research, particularly research into efficiency and effectiveness. In the end, even if we simply live with clause 45, the Secretary of State will seek its advice in order to research the right areas and it will tell her that it needs more help on this or that. That communication will no doubt take place. My amendments puts it in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> With the two amendments we revisit familiar ground. Amendments Nos. 92 and 93 have a common theme: both require the Secretary of State in certain defined circumstances to consult the Police Authority.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, clause 44 provides for the Secretary of State to instigate an inquiry into any matter connected with policing and to appoint a person to conduct that inquiry. It also provides for the Secretary of State to make known a summary of findings and conclusions where a full report is not published. Amendment No. 92 requires the Secretary of State, before causing an inquiry to be held, to consult the Police Authority, unless to do so would be inconsistent with the interests of national security or might jeopardise the safety of any person.
<P>
Clause 45 allows the Secretary of State to establish bodies to undertake research and provide advice on matters
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland Police Service.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Amendment No. 93 requires the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority before establishing such bodies.
<P>
The arguments for the amendments have been well rehearsed, not only just now by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire but because we have used essentially the same ones on previous amendments. Again we are trying to include in the Bill a statutory requirement for the Secretary of State to consult, because we believe that without it the Police Authority is in danger of becoming the poor relation in the tripartite structure.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 therefore requires the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority if she has it in mind to cause an inquiry to be held into any matter connected with policing. That is not a meaningless requirement; it is highly likely that the Police Authority would have an authoritative opinion to offer. The Secretary of State should be aware of that opinion and, most likely, would find it helpful. She would probably find consultation with the Police Authority beneficial in deciding whether to proceed with an inquiry. This role for the Police Authority would also, as my hon. Friend said, help to maintain its credibility in the eyes of the public.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 does not impose an absolute requirement on the Secretary of State. There are two qualifications. The Secretary of State will not be obliged to consult the Police Authority about holding an inquiry if consultation might be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``against the interests of national security or might jeopardise the safety of any person.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State alone would determine whether the subject of the inquiry fell into one or both of those categories. As it is an Executive matter, it is right that the Secretary of State should make the decision, no doubt with the advice of her security advisers, in practice.
<P>
The same line of reasoning that lies behind amendment No. 92 lies behind amendment No. 93. Whereas clause 44 deals with inquiries into
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any matter connected with policing'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
clause 45 and amendment No. 93 relate to what may appear to the Secretary of State to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``necessary or expedient for the purpose of undertaking research''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with the aim promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the police service. With regard to this matter also, it is logical that the Secretary of State should act only after consulting the Police Authority.
<P>
The Opposition's supporting argument for amendment No. 93 is essentially the same as that which we used for amendments Nos. 90 and 91. There is no need to repeat it in detail. It is sufficient to say that securing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland police service is the responsibility of the Police Authority. It is self-evidently appropriate that the Police Authority should be consulted about research and advice that has those objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I shall deal with the simple matters first. There have been no such inquiries. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire answered his own question about who would pay for an inquiry. Clause 44(3)'s reference to schedule 8 to the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 provides for the Secretary of State to pay for the inquiry. That is where the authority for the payment lies.
<P>
With regard to the other issues that have been raised, the Committee is, as the hon. Member for Basingstoke said, revisiting territory. The amendments would require the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority before causing an inquiry to be held under clause 4, and before establishing bodies to conduct research under clause 45.
<P>
We go back to the sort of argument that I deployed in relation to a previous clause about Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. It would be wrong if the subject of an inquiry were its object, and if the body concerned was involved in a formal consultation before a decision was made. For example, wrongdoing might be suspected to have occurred in the Police Authority itself.
<P>
I cannot imagine a Secretary of State considering whether to conduct an inquiry without conducting investigations or having preliminary meetings with people who would have information about whether an inquiry should occur. I am sure that such meetings would always include the Police Authority. If an inquiry seemed to originate in--and be an outcome of--consultation with the Police Authority, it would seem wrong and it would prejudice the inquiry. We have carefully considered the matter. The legislation is an integral part of the Government's reserve oversight powers and such constraint should not be imposed. Formal consultation would weaken the inquiry.
<P>
As a parallel, I should say that internal problems have arisen within the Police Authority during the past two or three years in relation to its conduct and use of resources. It might be suggested that the management of the Police Authority is at fault. If a formal inquiry were deemed to be unnecessary, it would seem wrong to have it written into statute that consultation should have occurred with the Police Authority. As the hon. Gentleman knows, discussions would obviously have taken place with senior people in the Police Authority.
<P>
Amendment No. 93 would, if accepted, require the Secretary of State to consult the authority before establishing bodies to undertake research. I think that my explanation of the issue will satisfy hon. Members. I remember my frustration in opposition over issues that might be involved that turned out to be quite simple.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We need a statutory power to enable the Secretary of State to contribute to research on a UK basis and to UK-wide bodies such as the police information technology organisation. Such a power would be used by the Secretary of State in conjunction with the Home Secretary or equivalent Ministers.
<P>
It would be right for the authority to have statutory consultation rights in respect of matters that are resourced directly by the Government and which are primarily geared to allowing Northern Ireland to play its part in national policing research. Where a research body is confined to Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State will of course consult the Police Authority. Such specific instances do not, however, require provisions in the Bill.
<P>
The Police Authority and others have raised the issue of the authority's power to conduct its own research. There is no doubt that it has undertaken research over the years and that much of it has provided valuable information. A good example of that is its research into community attitudes, community surveys and the attidude to the RUC. Its research has been invaluable and has contradicted many people's assertions about support for the RUC.
<P>
I give an assurance that the Police Authority has the right to conduct research and that there will be consultation where research is restricted to Northern Ireland matters. The Secretary of State needs the power provided for in clause 44 to contribute to UK-wide or other research matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall take amendment No. 92 first. I thank the Minister for answering my two questions about funding and about whether any inquiries had been held in Northern Ireland. He went on, however, to say that there might need to be an inquiry into wrongdoing by the Police Authority. I am at a loss to envisage such a situation. Although the Police Authority will receive a grant for policing under the Bill, it has to pass it to the Chief Constable. Although it is responsible for how the grant is spent, it does not actually spend it. The authority would not have access to the money and could not spend it as it wanted. The only money that it would have would be for running its own administration and perhaps for a little research.
<P>
I note from clause 7 that the authority is required to test public opinion. The clause is entitled
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Arrangements for obtaining the views of the public on policing'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but I cannot see whether it specifically refers to research, although I do not think that it does. I will, however, take it as read that research is one of the activities in which the authority can involve itself.
<P>
The Police Authority will have very little money. The idea that there would be any financial impropriety is pretty remote and small scale. There would be no need to set up a major inquiry into that. I am not persuaded by that argument that the amendment could not reasonably be included. In his counter-arguments to amendment No. 93 the Minister said that the provision was necessary in terms of the United Kingdom-wide research in conjunction with what the Home Secretary might be doing. He mentioned some specific areas which I did not take a note of, but I am more than happy to accept that that is the case.
<P>
Clause 45(1) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may set up such bodies and take such other steps as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of undertaking research into matters affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland Police Service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not refer to a United Kingdom-wide basis. I am not clear exactly why that point is so important as to shoot down my amendment. Obviously there may be research into things that are done in Northern Ireland that would be of help to policing in England, Wales and Scotland. I do not deny that for a moment. But that research will also assist the policing in Northern Ireland itself and will contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of policing in Northern Ireland which is the duty and responsibility of the Police Authority.
<P>
I accept some of the arguments, but I do not believe that those two counts are that important or, especially in relation to amendment No. 93, that the argument counters what is being proposed in the amendment. If there is a possibility of being more specific in the wording of the legislation so that it is clear that in this context the Secretary of State wants to instigate research on a UK-wide basis or to assist in that, that is fine. But research in Northern Ireland to test the efficiency and effectiveness of the RUC and the police services seems different, and the Police Authority should be involved.
<P>
I return to a question that was not answered. In the previous Government's White Paper it was clearly stated that there would be a joint responsibility. On page 44 it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``PANI will also be responsible for ... in consulation with the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable, sponsoring and publishing research into policing issues.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was our clearly stated intention before the election. I concede that it was the previous Government's document, but the same civil servants and officials have no doubt had a hand in it. The Minister did not tell us why they have changed their minds. It was quite clear that there was to be joint responsibility. I think that that makes sense. It is the way forward.
<P>
If going down that road would preclude the Secretary of State from instigating his or her own research that was part of some greater research facility on a UK-wide basis, the reluctance would be fine. I accept that too, but I am not sure that we cannot have both. When this comes up for discussion with his officials I hope that the Minister finds a way to differentiate between the two so that in the context of research for Northern Ireland specifically, the Police Authority is somehow involved. I am happy to say that I shall not press the amendment to a vote. I have made the points that I wanted to make, and I leave it to the Minister to give them some thought.

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> With regard to research, I think that the hon. Gentleman was quoting from a White Paper and not from legislation, the wording of which may need changes along the way. There has not been much of a shift; we have said that in research on matters specific to Northern Ireland we would expect consultation between the Secretary of State and the Police Authority, especially if the Secretary of State was directly involved.
<P>
Clause 45(2) was drafted to enable the Secretary of State to contribute to research that affects the efficiency and effectiveness of the Northern Ireland police service. I assume that it is worded in that way to stop the Secretary of State going outside her Northern Ireland powers, because that would be inappropriate. However, there will be UK-wide research which is of particular benefit to the Northern Ireland police service as part of a wider entity.
<P>
The point made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire about an inquiry is the most significant. Financial impropriety is not the only cause of an inquiry. An inquiry might be held into the conduct of the Police Authority's affairs. Every now and then there is an inquiry in police authorities into the appointment of senior officers, which must be absolutely clear cut and above board. I have read newspaper reports calling such appointments into question and claiming that they were unfairly made. A police authority might also be involved in inquiries into internal affairs. A few years ago, there was a schism between the leader of a police authority and the chief constable and between the leader and members of the police authority. Although that was dealt by other means, not by an inquiry, it is an example of the sort of issues that might lead to an inquiry. I hope that my examples have shown the hon. Gentleman that inquiries are not always about money but can cover other significant matters.
<P>
