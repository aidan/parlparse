assessments at least every two years for at least six years after the
new gateway to PIP has been first implemented. Amendment 228 suggests
that the first report should laid before Parliament within two rather
than three years of assessment roll-out. The amendments are small but
would go some way to help to improve the implementation
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000021">&#160;</a>

our other sittings, we have spoken about the scale of change that we
are about to embark upon and about the mammoth task that lies ahead,
given the Government’s objective to re-assess every working-age
disability living allowance claimant by 2015-16. That would involve
reassessing l.8 million people in three years if the Government are on
course to make the savings that they have laid out in the Budget book.

every year, but she was unable to provide

                        <p>We
have concerns that the basic planning is not at a stage where
parliamentary questions can be answered. However, as I mentioned in a
previous sitting, if we look at the most basic calculation of the
figures that we have at hand and match that to the years, we can
envisage a situation in which the Government have to re-assess 11,000
DLA claimants every week to meet the target.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
questions and worries are now gathering pace that such a big-bang
approach is perhaps not the best way to implement DLA reform. Leaving
aside the principles of whether we agree with the reform, what should
be included in the legislation and how we do it, there is a mechanical
issue about how we go through the process. The amendments are designed
to assist us in getting through the process, I hope, a bit more
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
big-bang approach to DLA as a way to improve the system should be
subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. Part of that commitment must be
that, following the initial roll-out of the assessment, the Secretary
of State will report to Parliament on the operation of the assessment
every two years, rather than three. We are concerned about those
initial years. I will talk about that
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000026">&#160;</a>

recommendations are made as a result of one report, they will barely
work through the system and be in operation before another report comes

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for that point. Of course,
we need to look at those issues, but we are not actually at that stage.
If we had a fully planned system and it was laid out that we should use
some of the phases that we were going through, perhaps we would have be
careful about how reports were interlaid with one another. Those
engaged in the process are asking for how it will be implemented to be
spelled out to Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Parliamentary
scrutiny is important, and two years is a reasonable time frame in
which to do that. If two years are not enough and we need three years
to present the report, there could be 1.8 million cases in those three
years and that raises a question about the whole process. If we cannot
manage to produce a reasonable report within two years and three years
are needed, fundamental questions need to be asked about whether we can
manage the process at all.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000029">&#160;</a>

need to know about that as early as possible; otherwise those who ought
to receive financial support might lose out. If it starts to look as

so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes; yet again my hon. Friend makes an important
point. There is currently a strong interest in this policy, and that is
gathering pace. Within two years, there will be even greater interest
in it as our constituents become more informed. The matter has not yet
been taken up by the wider public, but it certainly will be and
parliamentarians will need to take an even greater interest in the
matter than they do now.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
legislation will go through the parliamentary process and the
appropriate levers will be used to raise questions and voice concerns.
The amendment would provide us with a more structured way to do that
and make the system respond more effectively. In future, there will be
pressure on the Government to respond to concerns about the
implementation of the policy, and the amendment seeks to ensure that
that is done in a structured and planned way. We do not yet have any
evidence of such an approach, and that is what we need to
consider.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we said in
earlier sittings when considering different areas of the Bill, there is
a case for DLA reform, which is a natural step forward following the
reform of incapacity benefit and the introduction of employment and
support allowance. We must, however, ensure that we learn the lessons
from some of the difficulties experienced during that reform. It is
widely acknowledged that the national roll-out of the work capability
assessment had a bumpy ride, and the Government should work to iron out
any issues with the assessment, implement proposals following the
Harrington review and apply the lessons in that
context.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ensuring that
an independent report of the new assessment of PIP is published
regularly every two years will send a number of important signals.
First, it sends the signal that the Government recognise that things
can go wrong during the implementation of a programme and that they are
prepared to report, amend and adapt it, as we learn more about its
operation. That would give parliamentarians across political boundaries
and across the politics of the DLA—whether they support it or
not—the opportunity to raise any concerns about how the
programme was being implemented, and that would provide an important
platform.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government could then show that they were making an effort to get the
matter right. I sincerely believe that they must send out such a signal
because at the moment, people in receipt of the benefit are not
receiving that message. It would be useful to commit to a thorough and
regular report into the assessment, because that would show that the
Government want to work on the programme. It would not stop the
Government from listening or prevent the ongoing consultation process.
The implementation process is important, and the Government need to
inform people about it. That conversation should take place at the
Government’s highest levels and be subject to legislative
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 228
calls for the initial report to be laid before Parliament within two
years rather than three. The rationale behind that is encapsulated in
my earlier 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 880<a class="bkMark" name="Column880">&#160;</a>
                           </div>remarks. It would iron out changes to the assessment. If changes must be
made, that should be done sooner rather than later. Owing to the scale
and timing of the change, we cannot just wait for problems to be
addressed. There will invariably be problems, and waiting three years
before implementation would increase them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government should be proactive, send out the right signals and engage
and listen to people’s views on the process of implementation,
as well as the principles of reform. A more structured and planned
approach is needed to what is an enormous change and, undoubtedly, a
big-bang approach to welfare

                           </strong> It is a pleasure to see you back in the Chair, Mr
Weir. Amendments 227 and 228 call for reports on the operation of PIP
to be laid before Parliament, but before I go into the detail, perhaps
I could just clarify the situation because the hon. Member for Glasgow
East pulled together a number of different issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 86 is
particularly about the report to be written after introduction. That is
very important, but as the Committee has already had extensive debate,
it is equally if not more important that the Government are undertaking
a great deal of consultation, testing and work with disabled people and
disabled people’s organisations throughout the benefit
development process. Indeed, as the Committee knows, we already have an
independent group establishing and scrutinising the assessment, and we
have announced the other measures to ensure close working and testing
in the implementation of the new measure. The written report is simply
one element of a much broader scheme to ensure that learning from
previous work that the Department has done on benefits is incorporated
into the new measure, and that that is robustly tested throughout, with
the full and active participation of disabled people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that I
have reassured the hon. Lady that, rather than a sketchy framework for
the way the new measure will be tested, a detailed and robust framework
is already set out. The report is simply part of the much bigger
architecture of the whole thing. I understand the point that she made;
indeed, we have the shared objective of ensuring that an independent
review of the assessment is undertaken and led by a senior figure with
a strong background in disability. I am sure that the Committee agrees
that such a review must be done properly, and we must make certain that
it is undertaken at a time when it can provide the most accurate
picture of how the assessment is operating. The assessment, therefore,
must be given time to bed in.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Battersea’s intervention was right. She
has been looking at Professor Harrington’s work on the work
capability assessment and at how difficult it is, with an annual
report, to ensure that each of them is as thorough and comprehensive as
required. We must think about the practicalities of when information
will be available and when it is most appropriate for reports to be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000041">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We looked
very carefully at the timing of such a report; the hon. Member for
Glasgow East is right that it must be done in a very timely manner.
Looking at how the process will work, I am concerned that two years
does not give enough time to carry out a review on the scale that both
she and I feel is necessary for this 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 881<a class="bkMark" name="Column881">&#160;</a>
                           </div>important policy and then for the resulting report to be laid. We need
time to carry out the review, but also to gather the data.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady mentioned that the reassessment of individuals under the new
PIP scheme would take place over three years. It will take time for
sufficient individuals to be in the system for us to assess its impact
accurately and robustly. The implementation of the assessment will only
begin after the successful passage of the regulations under the
affirmative procedure, which can happen only some months after clause
78 comes into force. All that will take time,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the amendment, the review would realistically need to begin a year
after the commencement of clause 78. My concern is that that
will leave us little time to get sufficient data—which will be
limited at that stage—to make the sort of impact that both the
hon. Lady and I seek. We need to consider the practicalities of when
data will be available and when it will be most fruitful to assess them
in a report. It will not be possible to gain an accurate picture of how
the assessment is operating after two years, because so few customers
will have experienced it, owing to the phasing in of the regulations
and the start of the reassessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have a
clear shared objective. The measure is shaped by practicalities. We
believe that our approach to lay a report before Parliament within
three years of the legislation’s commencement will enable a
comprehensive review to be undertaken. A third year will allow the
operation of the assessment to settle down and enable much more
evidence to be gathered, as greater volumes of customers experience the
process, before identifying any issue that needs to be
resolved.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
assessment will operate in different ways for different people; we
talked about that on Tuesday. The assessment system needs to work
flexibly. We need to be flexible about where people might be assessed.
All those things will take time to build up a body of evidence. More
time will also provide greater opportunities for the independent
reviewer to work with disabled people and disability organisations, so
that their feedback and experience of the assessment can be properly
reflected in the report. That will make the report more powerful and
useful. Joint working will be integral to the review; it is essential
that it is given adequate time. We have learned from the WCA
experience, and we want to ensure that this part of the review process
is built in from the start. I understand that was not the case with
WCA; the reviews now being undertaken by Professor Harrington were
added later. We have learned from that and ensured that they are built
in from the start.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
has also called for such reviews to be carried out at least every two
years for at least the first six years following the coming into force
of the legislation. We fully recognise the need to ensure that the new
benefit is operating properly, but we do not feel that approach would
be the best way to achieve that. We believe that it would be more
useful to carry out a single full review of PIP, to have an holistic
view of how it is operating. That also came through in our earlier
debates.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Committee
may note that it has been necessary to limit the scope of the first two
independent WCA reviews undertaken by Professor Harrington, owing to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 882<a class="bkMark" name="Column882">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the short time scales. If a similar approach were taken for PIP, the
reviews would necessarily be too narrow in focus. Furthermore, we
believe that reviewing the operation of the assessment every two years
would limit the ability of the reviews to effect meaningful changes. As
I have said, we do not believe that, with such an important policy, two
years is adequate to gain a picture of how the assessment is
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the hon. Lady is assured by my comments and by the fact that
the review will not be the sole means by which we evaluate and improve
the operation of the new assessment. After implementation, we will
continually carry out internal evaluation to monitor performance, as I
am sure she would expect. The assessment will be a living tool, by
which we will review and revise in line with the experiences and
expectations of ourselves and of the people who are in receipt of
PIP.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000049">&#160;</a>

that explanation and the fact that this element of the Bill draws
heavily on the experience that we have gained from the practical
running of the work capability risk assessment, I hope that hon. Lady
feels reassured that we have similar objectives. The sort of time scale
that I am talking about is more likely to achieve her objective, which
is to ensure full scrutiny of the measure and that disabled people and
disabled people’s organisations can play a real and important
part. Given all that, I hope that she will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000050">&#160;</a>

Government say. The Minister’s argument is deeply concerning. In
fact, I am more concerned about it now that I was before. Essentially,
she is saying that two years is not enough time to reassess and
consider the process properly, so we have to extend it to three years.
Three years, however, is exactly the same time that she is giving to
the entire process for 1.8 million people. If two years is not enough
time to reassess, we will go to three years. However, she is also
saying that three years is enough time to conduct the entire process.
That is not a consistent argument and there are real worries about how
this has been undertaken. I do not think that the Minister is grasping
the scale of the big-bang
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000051">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I apologise to the hon. Lady if I did not explain
myself well. The written report is only one part of a much more
comprehensive analysis of how the new system, operational processes and
assessment work. I can assure her that we will not wait until three
years after the scheme’s implementation to make changes. As I
have said from the start, we will do that iteratively because we want
to ensure as soon as we can that the system is
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000052">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that explanation. I
understand that point, but I have a number of arguments to make. First,
Parliament needs the opportunity properly to scrutinise the measure. I
am sure that there will be other processes of assessment and engagement
and other mechanisms to consider how it is implemented. Presumably, we
will not have to wait three years until concerns are addressed. I
absolutely accept that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Presumably,
the Minister would say that Parliament has other means by which it can
question and hold the Government to account. Of course it
does—parliamentary

                           </div>questions, Committee inquiries and so on—and I am sure that they
will be part of the process as well. As someone who uses such
mechanisms, I should like to express frustration with the fact that we
do not always get back the answers that we need.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am asking
the Minister whether she has thought about the 1.8 million people and
how the system will be organised, and she is saying, “We are
still considering the Bill. We do not have answers to that.”
That is not adequate. Parliamentarians will use all those mechanisms,
but they are not quite enough given the scale of the proposed reform.
Parliament and the people whom we represent would expect us to take a
particularly focused look at this reform, and the amendment would give
us the opportunity to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has placed great emphasis on the argument that we are engaged
with other mechanisms, reports, disability organisations and disabled
people and can discuss how the process should be undertaken. She says
that she is producing a detailed and robust framework, but we have no
evidence of that. She will know that grave concerns about the framework
and the approach that is being taken are being expressed by not only
the Opposition, but the organisations that she has quoted. She said
that a great deal of consultation and testing is under way, but that is
not my view; there is no evidence to support that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have
already heard fundamental criticisms about the way in which the
consultation was undertaken. There are debates about the testing. Many
people say that the Government are steaming ahead without thinking
anything through and without pacing the changes. We have fundamental
concerns, so we are not persuaded by their
arguments.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000057">&#160;</a>

we will thoroughly test our new assessment process on many hundreds of
people over the summer. I believe that I am right in saying that we are
actually further forward with the drafting of regulations for PIP than
the previous Administration were at the same point in the WCA

                           </strong> I genuinely hope that I am wrong because, whether
or not the Minister agrees, if the reform goes ahead and affects so
many people of such great vulnerability, it must be as effective as
possible. I am not making this argument for the sake of it; I genuinely
believe that there are real concerns. Five thousand people contributed
to the consultation—we did not have enough time for me to argue
about some of the details, but I will not go into that just
now—but there were more than 5,000 people on the embankment
yesterday who were saying that the Government are fundamentally
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000059">&#160;</a>

Government are closing their ears to real, solid evidence about the
implementation of the measures. Talking to lots of people who say that
it is okay should not be reassuring, because many people are genuinely
saying that it is not. Some people are arguing about the principles,
and others, because they are worried, are arguing about the costings. I
accept both those views,

are also saying that, if Ministers go ahead with the reform, they
really need to take a more structured and planned approach. As things
stand, that is not being done. In the grand scheme of things, the
amendments are relatively

                           </strong> Evidence from the past few days has proven that
the approach is not structured and planned. My right hon. Friend the
Member for East Ham was making strong arguments about why a pilot would
be more effective and why the big-bang approach is not appropriate. We
have voted on that—I accept that—but there are
substantial arguments none the less. I will argue about some of that in
my later amendments, but the fundamental argument for saying that the
Government’s policy is not structured or planned is that they
plan to reassess 1.8 million people over three years. As I have said
several times—the Minister has never challenged my
figures—that means 11,000-plus people being assessed every week.
That means 2,500 people being assessed every day. It is reasonable for
people in my position to ask what the plans are. Has the number of
people who will be reassessed every year been thought through? The
Minister has not, as yet, provided an answer. If there is no answer
about a planned, managed approach, it is reasonable for people to ask
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000062">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister makes my argument for me. Whenever I
ask about detail, she says, “You can’t imply that I
cannot answer.” When I ask for the detail, she says,
“This is about broad concepts.” She cannot have it both
ways. I will ask specific questions later on, and from what she has
outlined, answers can be given. I am concerned that, on 9 May, I
received a response to a straightforward question about how many people
the Government intend to assess in a year and what the target was, but
it cannot be answered. I am sure that her reply would be,
“We’re talking about the bookcase. We’re talking
about the broad concepts. We can’t answer to that level of
detail, but don’t worry, we’re thinking about
it.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000064">&#160;</a>

am telling the Minister—I can reasonably say this on behalf a
large number of people who are on the receiving end of the
process—that there is a real frustration with the
Government’s attitude, because of the scale of the reform,

experiences. They are among the most sick and disabled people in this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000065">&#160;</a>

Ministers to explain the likely processes. I understand that we cannot
get every dot and comma and that the Government cannot say that Mrs A
will end up getting reassessed on 24 April 2014 and give the detail of
everything involved in the process. However, it is reasonable for 1.8
million people—the most sick and disabled people—to ask
what the plans and estimates

look at it, instead of going only on individual, anecdotal experience.
We ought to be able to look at the cumulative evidence and say,

up for it,” but I have not come across such evidence and would

independent reports, not three years after but two years, but it does
not achieve what she wants or what her speech was about. Another just
concern is that the process should be iterative and engaged. If the
Secretary of State disappeared for two years and just produced a report
after implementing the system, I would be very alarmed, as I think we
all would be. Surely there should be an ongoing discussion about how to

She clearly feels very strongly about the issue. What is her response
to the problem that has been identified by many, not only Ministers,
that the first two independent reviews of the WCA undertaken by
Professor Harrington have been limited in scope because of the short
time frames? Does she not expect the Government to take that into

by Westminster Hall debates. The matter should be dealt with through
that process. In many ways, I do not like the clause because it almost
pushes things in the other direction, although I could live with the
measure because it does not detract from anything. The amendment does
not help either. I would much rather ensure that we have a proper and

think he really believes that that is what I am arguing. He knows full
well that my argument is also based on the full operation of those
opportunities. It is not a case of a Select Committee report versus an
independent report; I am talking about having an add-on to that and
another mechanism. The scale, pace and impact of the reform and the
interest in it means that we need to have another report. The hon.
Gentleman has contradicted what the Minister has said about learning
from the Harrington model being applied here. He is suggesting that
that is completely irrelevant. There is a basic contradiction that goes

morning, Mr Weir. The amendment relates to the position of children
under the age of 16 and the reforms to disability living allowance. I
am well aware, as are all hon. Members, that the Government have made
it clear that they expect not to introduce the personal independence
payment for children under the age of 16 at the same time as the
changes come in for adults.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000087">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
that Ministers expect and intend in due course at least to consider the
operation and extension of the personal independence payment to
children. If that is the longer-term expectation, it is vital that the
Bill contains safeguards to ensure that the system that is created will
be fit for purpose and flexible enough to meet the different needs of
disabled children.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I, other hon.
Members and the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign are concerned
about the lack of clarity in the Bill over what the impact on disabled
children will be. Clause 87 repeals clauses 71 to 76 of the Social
Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, and in doing
so, it removes the legislation that currently provides the extra
benefit of disability living allowance for disabled children. We are in
a gap, and although we are happy to accept Ministers’ assurances
that they do not immediately intend to transfer children to the
personal independence payment, as far as we can tell, if and when that
happened, the Bill would be the only legislation in existence to govern
how that would take place and how those children would be treated. It
is, therefore, important that we debate what that would mean for
disabled children and their families.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
330,000 children under the age of 16 receive disability living
allowance. DLA is a vital income top-up for families with disabled
children, and the circumstances of each child who qualifies for DLA can
be very varied. Some children might have a long-term, steady-state
impairment, perhaps from birth, which will not change. Some may have a
short-term, complex health need that will require a high level of
family support for a shorter period of time. Some will have
intermittent conditions, as a result of which there will be times when
they need extra support and times when their condition is more stable.
As we have said in the context of the benefit for adults, there are
clearly issues about the variability of requirement for financial
support for disabled children, but in all those scenarios it is an
absolute lifeline that enables families to meet the unavoidable extra
costs of care when the household includes a disabled child or children.
A remarkable number of families contain more than one disabled child
who is receipt in of DLA, and that benefit is a lifeline that allows
families to care for their children and to enable them to live ordinary
lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The money
that those families receive goes to meet a significant range of
substantial additional costs. Such families may face additional child
care costs, either because a specialist child carer is need for the
disabled child or children and/or because parents, in having to devote
more of their time to caring for the disabled child, need to pay for
child care for other siblings in the family. Child care costs often
mount up. Special equipment may be needed for the disabled child, and
perhaps special travel arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In many
families with a disabled child in the household, at least one parent
will be forced either to give up work entirely or to reduce their
working hours, so DLA can help to replace a loss of parental earnings
to some degree, albeit it is not a replacement benefit, but in terms of
the family budget parents certainly look at it in that way. Additional
costs may be involved in protecting and keeping profoundly disabled
children safe. Adaptations to the home may be required, and extra
supervision costs may arise from the need to supervise those children
more closely when they are outside the home environment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Families may
incur costs for things such as heating, clothing and special diets, and
a significant number of families report that they use some of their DLA
to meet extra costs to support their children’s education and
learning. Even in special schools, the facilities and the resources are
not always available to support disabled children properly to maximise
their learning and education. Schools can be quite poor at identifying
the needs of disabled children, so parents use DLA to support their
children’s educational development.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000093">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
existing DLA system has been designed to meet the different needs of
disabled children and adults. In other words, it recognises that there
are different kinds of needs that particularly arise for children under
16. For example, they receive the care component of DLA for 56 days
longer than adults, in recognition of the additional input from
families that disabled children require when they are settling into a
new environment away from home. There are also different tests for
eligibility, in recognition of the different levels of support that
disabled children may need. In 2006, when a series of informal
parliamentary hearings on services for disabled children took place,
Parliament recognised the need for the system to vary to meet the needs
of disabled children. The hearings recommended that Government should
consider waiving the 90-day eligibility period for children who have
additional time-limited care or mobility needs as a result of medical
intervention. The hearings did not recommend what we are now getting:
the risk that children, too, could have to wait six months to become
eligible. That is a very long time in a young child’s life. It
can be period of immense development or the retarding thereof in a
child’s early years. There is a particular concern, therefore,
about the application of the PIP structure to that
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000094">&#160;</a>

support it. I have some amendments to table later today in relation to
the transition period which, as she rightly says, is a particular and
different difficulty that families with disabled children face. I am
sure we all have constituents who have brought to us instances of that
particular challenge. From my own experience, I know how difficult it
can be to get that transition right. It is a time when families feel
that they have fallen down the hole. So I welcome my Select Committee
colleague’s support for a proper, full analysis of those issues.
Perhaps together we could discuss that with the Chair of the Select
Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne
Begg), who I think would be very sympathetic to the proposition that it
should be

                           </div>looked at in detail. However, I hope that the hon. Lady would accept my
concern that, as things currently stand, the legislation we have in
front of us could be what governs what happens to children under the
age of 16. We have nothing else once the DLA is abolished by the Bill.
That is why it is important that we have an opportunity to debate the
matters in this Committee,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a concern that, with Ministers focusing their attention on the
migration of disabled adults from DLA to personal independence payment,
and the considerable work—which all Opposition Members accept is
being undertaken by Ministers and Department officials—to design
and get right the implementation of that transition for working-age
adults, there will not be any thinking time at this stage in the
process for the Department to develop the design of PIP in a way that
meets the needs of disabled children. There is also a lack of
flexibility in the Bill to ensure that that development can take place
at a later stage, when Ministers make the decision to migrate children
across. Therefore, quite unintentionally, we could find ourselves, two
or three or five or six years down the line, with a system that is not
fit for purpose for disabled children. While I am sure that, if that
turned out to be case, any Government would want to go back and revisit
the legislation and make amendments where appropriate, it would be
better not to get into that situation and to make it clear that the
Bill is specifically aimed at adults and is not necessarily the right
framework for supporting the extra cost of disability for children
under the age of 16. I hope the Minister can tell us whether there is a
timetable for the migration of children from DLA to PIP. I also hope
she can reassure us there will be full flexibility and tell us how that
is reflected in the Bill, so that if and when children move on to PIP,
we can be confident that the system can be adapted to meet the very
specific needs of disabled children and their
families.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000097">&#160;</a>

did not include children or individuals under the age of 16 in these
initial provisions because they provide a different set of challenges
in terms of the support they require. For all the reasons she gave, a
separate set of deliberations is required. It is clearly and

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for supporting my
suggestion. Obviously, more and more children with severe disabilities
are living much longer than they might have done 20 years ago. Does the
Department have any data on how often that life extension takes place
and on the number of children with severe disabilities who move on to
adult social
care?<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000101">&#160;</a>

have those figures at my fingertips, but I can certainly write to her
on that. She raises an important point. I met a group of parents last
Friday at Limington House, an excellent school that I am fortunate to
have in my constituency. It provides superb care for children who face
some of the biggest challenges. That very point was brought up by those
parents. Their children are enjoying a longer life expectancy and we
need to ensure that the support is there. I am pleased to tell my hon.
Friend that, as part of the work I am doing elsewhere as a Minister, I
have announced that we will provide some £3 million to help
user-led organisations support such parents, to ensure that they get
the sort of help and support that they need through what can be very
challenging
times.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions do not limit our approach on children, and changes in
respect of children would clearly be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
We have clearly stated that there will be public consultation. I
understand that the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston has been
discussing the issues with organisations such as Every Disabled Child
Matters, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank that body

clear on Second Reading, it is not our intention to address the issue
of children within DLA at this point. We will do that later, after we
have been able to build on our experience from the implementation of
PIP for adults. There are very clear provisions in the Bill for us to
do what we need to do to ensure that both the assessment and the
operation of PIP is appropriate for children. We have very clearly
built that into the Bill. Perhaps I can reassure the hon. Lady with
those comments that we will not be hamstrung in the approach we
take.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000104">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes. That is why we believe that it is most
appropriate for DLA to continue to support those who are not part of
the current re-assessment process. When individuals, particularly
children, are being considered and an appropriate assessment process is
in place, we would introduce the necessary regulations to abolish DLA.
That is how the process works, and I thank my hon. Friend for allowing

                           </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that point as
well. He is right to say that, as with everything to do with Government
legislation, it takes time for people to be able to understand what is
intended, though I hope that no one would think that the Government
would ever intend to remove a benefit before they had put something
proper in its place. I am sure he was not intending to imply that. The
clause would be the subject of transitional protections to ensure that
the benefit was closed down only when all DLA claimants had moved on to
the PIP, and there is no time by which the DLA provisions must have
been repealed. They are there until that has happened, so that can be
done when the entire case load moves over to PIP. It is important that
people are clear on that, and this debate has given us the opportunity
to be clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We want to
build on the experience of developing assessment and applying it to the
new and existing claimants of working-age DLA to inform the future
arrangements for children. We will consider the effectiveness of those
arrangements before considering an extension of PIP to new claims from
children, or to children already in receipt of DLA. Furthermore, we are
committed to consulting on arrangements for children, and regulations
on the issue will be subject to the scrutiny of both Houses. We take
the situation very

Government’s approach to looking at the support needs of
children currently in receipt of DLA, and how we might develop and
replace that in the future as part of the PIP process, will be very
well informed by the Green Paper that the Minister with responsibility
for families, my hon. Friend the Member for Brent Central (Sarah
Teather), is undertaking. That Green Paper consultation is focusing on
the issue of assessment and statementing, and will draw a wide range of
organisations into the consultation process. I see that as a starting
point for our deliberations about PIP, because I want to look at ways
in which we can simplify the assessment for children and parents
wherever possible. It is right that we make it as easy as possible, not
only for children, but for parents. They have many different
demands—family and work—so we must make the process as
straightforward as possible. From that point on we will look to broaden
our discussions to other relevant organisations, and also talk directly
with families and children. By having that broad consultation from the
start we can make sure that we move forward in as robust and right a
way as possible. It is important that we have had a chance to air that,
and I thank my hon. Friend for raising the

there will be relevant amendments later in our considerations. Under
schedule 10, we have asked for powers that will allow us to put in
place transitional measures for the introduction of PIP. The
flexibility that the powers will give us will ensure a smooth
transition for children on to PIP when they reach 16. For example, time
spent in receipt of DLA could be used towards fulfilling the PIP
qualifying period—another thing that the hon. Lady picked up
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000116">&#160;</a>

that it will want to take her up on that, because I know that it will

of the issues about which many families are concerned: the repeated
assessments that children have to undergo and the strain and distress
that that can cause for children and their families. Parents have
reported to me their concern that some of the assessments made of
children in educational or social care settings are not particularly
well carried out or effective. Any pressure that the Minister and her
colleagues in the Department can apply to colleagues in the Department
for Education to ensure a high-quality assessment that genuinely
assesses and understands all the needs of children in a holistic way
would be very much appreciated by families. Such an assessment would
also improve the way in which the financial support provided by the
Department for Work and Pensions is tailored and targeted to meet
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000122">&#160;</a>

concerns about the legislation. I understand the Minister’s
point that nobody will be left without any money at all. There will not
be a moment when people are eligible for neither DLA nor PIP, having
not yet been transferred across when the new payment product comes in.
My concern is that the Bill could be the only legislative framework for
children in receipt of PIP at the point when they get to it. The Bill
has been designed with adult recipients in mind, not because Ministers
are not well aware that children have different issues—the
Minister is open in recognising that there are differences in the way
in which a benefit for children would be designed, and she recognises
some of the variants between the needs of adults and
children—but because, inevitably, the focus at the moment is on
designing the transition for working-age adults. I am concerned to
ensure that we do not end up with a Bill that is too inflexible to meet
the potentially different needs of disabled children. The Bill does not
currently focus on
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000123">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">‘(3) The Secretary
of State shall not transfer any existing recipients of disability
living allowance to personal independence payment, including under
sub-paragraph (1), until he
has—</p>
                        <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) published a
report about the operation of the personal independence payment
application and assessment process for new claimants;
and</p>

to a consultation about the process that will be used to transfer

payment.’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State does not transfer
existing DLA recipients to the new PIP until a report on the operation
of PIP and an assessment of new claimants is published, and a full
consultation has been conducted on the process of transferring DLA
recipients to PIP. Many of the points have been made, and we may want
to rehearse them, but I want to focus on the mechanics of the reform,
and how it will be
implemented.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
I emphasise the scale of the proposal— 1.8 million
people will be affected over three years—and the need for a
planned, structured approach. Clearly, some people believe that it is
reasonable and doable, but we must test that and extrapolate some of
the issues, which is what people expect us to do. It is worth repeating
that 600,000 people per annum—11,500 a week, or 2,300 a
day—will be involved, and that is a big process. It is a
monumental exercise, and will presumably be led by DWP, which is
introducing a raft of other measures that will work alongside that and
affect many of the same
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
other parts of the Bill, particularly those relating to the
introduction of universal credit, we have discussed the scale of the
change that is being introduced and the organisational challenges. We
are introducing yet another huge change in the same Department, and
there will be an overlap of people. The scale of the change being
introduced across the welfare system is enormous, and there are many
questions, such whether the plans are realistic, and what approach can
be used to ensure that they work effectively. Those are legitimate
questions. We know from earlier debates that many significant issues
must be resolved.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My argument
is that the Bill as drafted is not yet complete, in light of those
questions. There are still issues about carers. We have had some
answers, but others remain outstanding. We have discussed people living
in residential homes, and that discussion will continue. We have not
received clarity on aids and adaptations. There are many concerns about
the impact of the legislation, and substantial policy issues to be
resolved. If we go full steam ahead and begin the assessment process
for 2,500 people every day, we must ensure that the process is
undertaken clearly and coherently. The amendment introduces that
debate, so let us have it
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
emphasise my earlier points about the scale and pace of the reform. I
understand the Minister’s argument, and her colleague’s
argument about the bookcase and the details of what is in the bookcase,
but there is a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 896<a class="bkMark" name="Column896">&#160;</a>
                           </div>strong link between the pace and scale, and the very foundations of the
reform, which interact significantly. We must test the
mechanics.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000159">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
the scale of the reassessment and the demography of those to be
reassessed, it is important at this stage of the legislation to go the
extra distance and reassure those who are so worried about the change,
and how it will happen. We must consider a rational and structured
approach. The amendment would send out a message that we will learn
from mistakes in the system, because mistakes will happen. There will
be hiccups in the system, and we need opportunities to iron them out.
It is worth saying that now, rather than letting them happen and just
using the same old processes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is fair and proportionate. Again, we are not arguing about the
principle. We are not saying, “We’re not going back to
that territory,” but we are saying, “Let’s look at
what is being done here.” Paragraph (a) would assure that a
structured approach to reassessment is sought, while paragraph (b)
would set out, in legislation, the Government’s willingness to
continue the dialogue with those affected by the reform. It would
ensure that that consultation and engagement is continued, and perhaps
enhanced.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are well aware of some issues that I have raised on DLA
reform. There are gaps, and the proposals fall short of justified
expectations about consultation, on which there are ongoing concerns.
However, if we committed ourselves to a separate consultation into the
operation of the assessment as it is being rolled out, which is
essentially what the amendment proposes, it would put a further level
of checks and balances into the assessment’s framework. That is
seriously worth considering, and it would give confidence to those who
are on the receiving end. We really should begin to think through the
big-bang approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister respond and explain some of the mechanics of how the
assessment process will take place? I have a few more questions, which
will give the Minister some idea of the detail that we need. Have staff
been trained for the assessment process, and are plans for that under
way? Are there management plans about how the assessment is to be
enacted? Relating slightly to the points I made earlier, are time
scales and targets established at this time? If they are not, when will
they be, and how will Parliament be engaged on those?<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Have we
decided who will be assessed first? What are the details for the
rolling programme of assessment? Will who is programmed within that be
arbitrary, or will it be geographical? How is it to be determined? Will
we have standards, even if there is no detail, about the principles of
the assessment process? Would that be spelled out in guidance and
regulations, so that we get some sense of how this will be conducted?
For example, how much notice will existing DLA claimants get before
they are reassessed? In our earlier debate, I think that we began to
get a feel for some of the concerns about that matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What about
new applicants? From 2013-14, are new applicants expected just to join
the queue along with the 1.8 million people that I mentioned earlier?
How are  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 897<a class="bkMark" name="Column897">&#160;</a>
                           </div>new applicants to be factored into it? Will they have to wait longer?
Are there plans about dealing with a backlog? How would that be
managed?<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
re-emphasise the point, this is a huge enterprise, and, at this stage,
we need a sense of the Government’s planning on how they will
take us there.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Member for Glasgow East for
raising those issues, and I will attempt to respond to them. However, I
will preface the discussion by saying that we are talking about the
architecture of the introduction of the new personal independence
payment. Some questions in the latter part of her comments were rather
detailed, and I can assure her that the people who work with me on this
project are very busy answering exactly the questions that she asked,
although I am not sure that it is possible to make them part of my
response today. As and when we move forward, however, I absolutely
undertake to keep disabled people, disabled people’s
organisations and other Members of Parliament very well informed about
the progress that we are making. That returns to a point about
communication that was made on Tuesday, because we want communication
to be very clear to everybody involved about when issues, such as those
raised by the hon. Lady, will be finalised, and about the exact details
of these important migration plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
seeks further assurances that we have clear plans in place to ensure
the success of the new personal independence payment. The hon. Lady
also wants to ensure that disabled people and their organisations
rightly have an opportunity to review and feed into the operational
design of PIP and the migration process itself. I can assure her that
that will not only be the case in future, but is the case here and now.
We have already worked with disabled people and their organisations
throughout the development of PIP, and, as I said earlier, we produced
initial draft regulations on it much earlier in the parliamentary
process than was the case for the work capability assessment under the
previous Government. A clear lesson from some of the problems that we
inherited with the WCA is that if people had been involved in the
scrutiny of the regulations earlier, it could have been beneficial all
round. I can assure her that that active commitment will
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady suggested that the migration process should be thoroughly
tested before it is applied across the country, and she is right. As
she will know from our discussions on piloting versus testing, we can
evaluate our processes very thoroughly through the testing process that
we advocate. We are considering different approaches to migration and
how we can manage the risks with such large exercises. As she points
out, we are dealing with large numbers, but, as she will understand,
the experience of the Department in doing that is greatly enhanced by
the work happening now on incapacity benefit as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
considering beginning the migration exercise with a statistically valid
sample of cases, perhaps in dedicated locations. If we were to take
that approach, it would allow us to test and review our processes, the
effectiveness of our communications, the customer experience and so on,
before beginning the full migration process. That is at the heart of
the hon. Lady’s careful and clear questioning—that people
are aware of exactly what will happen and what the implications of it
will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston, or perhaps it was the hon.
Member for Glasgow East, mentioned take-up and ensuring that we are
fully aware of issues around that. That is just the sort of thing that
our approach will pick up. I will be happy to discuss any available
information from that sample with hon. Members and others, to ensure
that we reassure people that our intentions will be met through the
approach that we are taking. In addition, we will also set up customer
research panels to advise us on the design of the operational process.
They will be made up of groups of disabled people with shared
characteristics, for example those who have never claimed DLA or those
who have had a DLA award before. We intend to ask them to review the
end-to-end process of PIP by experiencing it in a simulated
environment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
research techniques we are using will provide first-class research into
the impact of our approach and will, I believe, provide us with an
ability to change the assessment process as required so that it meets
the policy intentions we are discussing on this Bill. That is just one
example of our approach to continuing to involve disabled people in the
testing process. I hope that Committee members can hear that the
Department is taking an extremely robust approach to testing. We are
not taking it lightly or undertaking it in an unstructured way, but
with great seriousness, and we are applying a great deal of resource to
underpin it as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By the time
we come to the implementation of PIP, the Department will have had
considerable experience in migrating individuals to new benefits. We
will draw on our experience with incapacity benefit in this area as
well. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Member for Glasgow East
and other Committee members; we are absolutely committed to ensuring
that we get these processes right. We will use different ways of
assessing and testing our new policies and will not always simply look
at old and tried and trusted methodologies, such as piloting and
geography, and it is right to do so. I think that Members would expect
us to be innovative in our
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11051269000149">&#160;</a>
