<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 294, in page 3, line 5, after `made,' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to a county court or'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 34, in page 3, line 7, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) Subject to subsection (3D) below, an application made under this section shall not be granted without the defendant being given an opportunity to make representations at a full hearing and to ask questions of witnesses upon whom the relevant authority relies in making the application, save that, except with the leave of the court, no question shall be asked of any person who has suffered harassment, alarm or distress or who is to be protected from harassment, alarm or distress, and the identity of any such person shall not be disclosed.<P>
<P>
	(3B) A court may only grant leave for questions to be asked of any such person as is mentioned in subsection (3A) or for such a person's identity to be disclosed if it is satisfied that--

<P>
(ii) it would be unfair to the defendant not to allow such questions to be asked.</ul><P>

<P>
	(3C) At any time in the proceedings when an issue has arisen as to the questioning of such a person as is mentioned in subsection (3A) above or the disclosure of his identity the court may, on an application being made by the relevant authority, exclude from court the public and all parties save for the relevant authority.
<P>
	(3D) An application under this section may be made on an ex parte basis where the court considers that it would be just and convenient to do so in all the circumstances of the case, but such an order shall have effect for a period of no more than three months.'.

<P>
 `(11E) For the purposes of assessing any application for legal aid the hearing of an application for an order and the hearing of an appeal shall be classified as criminal proceedings.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The grouping of amendments is quite a mouthful, and so I will try to be brief in speaking to it. Amendment No. 294 addresses the procedure that should be followed on anti-social behaviour orders.
<P>
The Government stressed that such orders will be civil orders. The Minister has made that point repeatedly. The Government's consultation paper set out arguments for and against hearing the orders in county courts. Why have the Government decided against using county courts as venues for the order? It is not enough to describe the orders as civil orders. Tribunals will not look at the label that is pinned on the order, but they will consider its effect when they come to make decisions.
<P>
I turn to the matter of procedure. We have received guidance notes that reveal more detail about the procedure that the Government wish to follow. However, we seek clarification on a number of points. Applications for the order will be made by complaint to magistrates courts. Those of us who are not familiar with the technicalities of magistrates courts assume that defendants will always be given notice that application has been made for an order. As with other hearings in magistrates courts, defendants make the choice to attend.
<P>
We are anxious to learn whether defendants will have a full opportunity to put their case and to test the case made by applicants. That is why we tabled amendment No. 34. The Government must guard against possible challenges being mounted through the European convention on human rights, as we mentioned earlier. Procedure will be examined closely in the course of such challenges.
<P>
We have been told that such matters will be governed by the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. The Act's provisions on procedure and rules in magistrates courts specify that defendants have the opportunity to be heard. We know that courts must hear evidence from both parties. But how far will the procedure extend in giving defendants the opportunity to test applicants' evidence? Will defendants be able to put questions to witnesses brought by applicants in contested hearings? Naturally, witnesses who are victims of the alleged anti-social behaviour may be vulnerable. What will happen in such cases?
<P>
Amendment No. 34 sets out our ideas on achieving an appropriate balance. We must give defendants the opportunity to make their case and to test the case made by applicants, but we must also safeguard the interests of witnesses. Some witnesses, especially those who are victims, will be afraid of defendants. We are alive to the possibility of witness intimidation. Amendment No. 34 would protect a witness who is the victim on whose behalf an anti-social behaviour application is made. It would ensure that questions cannot be asked of such a witness except with the leave of the court. Moreover,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no question shall be asked of any person who has suffered harassment, alarm or distress or who is to be protected from harassment, alarm or distress, and the identity of any such person shall not be disclosed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
without the leave of the court. Such leave would be given only where
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is no risk of harm to the person<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and where
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it would be unfair to the defendant not to allow such questions to be asked.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a rough sketch of our attempt to balance competing interests. We would like to hear more about the Government's view.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 deals with the standard or proof. The Governement are committed to the civil, rather than the criminal, standard of proof. We apprehend that, in the Minister's view, the effect of the orders is prohibitory, and that the making of an order will lead to an injunction. That argument has already been advanced in respect of anti-social behaviour orders. The Government are here trying to have it both ways. With respect to the absence of legal safeguards, the Government are saying that anti-social behaviour orders will lead only to civil injunctions that will prevent people from doing certain things. The Minister shakes his head, but that is what the Government's consultation paper states. The Government have presented those orders as part and parcel of a crack down on crime, especially youth crime. That was referred to this morning. The Government cannot have it both ways--we must hear more about the matter.
<P>
This morning, the Minister raised the subject of prohibitions. Such prohibitions may be described as civil, or as part of the civil process. However, they could be wide ranging, and could substantially restrict a person`s liberty. A tribunal that examined the matter--for example, a court that considered a challenge made under the European convention on human rights--might decide that such prohibitions constitute a criminal penalty because they are so wide ranging.
<P>
According to the Government's consultation papers, they are contemplating exclusion orders that could prevent people from going into certain areas, and various orders that would prevent people from doing certain things. The orders are therefore potentially wide ranging. The Government must justify such orders, which could effectively constitute criminal penalties.
<P>
With regard to Amendment No. 10, we would like clarification of the Government's position on children and young persons. The Government said this morning that orders would not normally be applied for against people aged 17 years or under. That was a revelation to us, and it is an important development.
<P>
We are mindful of the need to protect young people against whom an order might be sought, and who might be in a particularly sensitive position. The Bill should grant magistrates courts the power to apply to a priest, or someone similar, for a report on the family circumstances of the young person in question. We do not feel that that should be an absolute requirement. However, amendment No. 10 would enable a court to seek such an order if it wished to do so.
<P>
Such a report would bring to light useful information. It could be that the behaviour of that young person, which is the source of the complaint, is caused not by an inherent disposition towards mischief making but by circumstances in the family home. Without such a report, the relevance of the domestic circumstances to the young person's behaviour would never be discovered.
<P>
If an order were made without the benefit of such a report, the young person's behaviour might continue because the root cause of the trouble--the domestic circumstances--had not been tackled. The person might then breach the order, get into further trouble, and gain a criminal conviction. At that stage a report would be prepared as part and parcel of criminal procedure, because the young person would be facing a serious criminal sentence of five years' detention. The young person's family circumstances would no doubt come to light at the time of the report's preparation. However, by that point he or she would have acquired a criminal conviction. It would be helpful if the Bill dealt with that issue. The Government do not envisage many such orders being sought against young people, but this would be a useful safeguard in the event of the few that do arise.
<P>
I shall now turn to amendment No. 12. As the Minister said in this morning's sitting, the defendant has a defence if he can show that his behaviour was reasonable. That was not in the Bill as it was originally published--it was inserted in another place as a safeguard. The burden of proof is on the defendant, and it is up to him to show that his behaviour was reasonable. That is Conservative Members' understanding of the Bill--will the Minister confirm that we are correct?
<P>
A defendant might find it difficult to prove that his behaviour was reasonable. There have been cases in the past of people with eccentric behaviour against whom it would be possible for an authority to apply for an order that would subsequently be granted by a court. Notwithstanding what was said in Committee this morning, the Government have not ruled out non-criminal conduct as a cause for making an anti-social behaviour order. A person such as the one to whom I have just referred could have an order applied for against him. It is possible that what he was doing was reasonable by his standards, but would not be reasonable by someone else's standards.
<P>
The distinguished academics whom I have quoted, as well as people in other organisations, have drawn attention to the Bill's implications for people who are eccentric, unpopular or behaving in strange ways. It is important to have a safeguard that will operate in such cases, and a safeguard was inserted in another place. However, its value may have been weakened by the fact that the burden of proof has been placed on the defendant, so that it is up to him to prove that his behaviour was reasonable. If such a case came before a magistrates court, the magistrates, having examined the defence to determine whether the person's behaviour was reasonable, might conclude, ``The onus is on the defendant to show that his behaviour was reasonable, and we do not think that he has done that.'' Conservative Members query whether the burden of proof should be on the defendant. Should it not rather be left, as it is in other circumstances, for the applicant to establish?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically on amendment No. 32, in the light of what we have read in the guidance.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> I used to try that one on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We live in hope, as the Minister has said in another capacity on other occasions.
<P>
Conservative Members are concerned that someone doing something in his own home might be brought within the ambit of the anti-social behaviour order. Having produced the guidance, the Government have clearly had the same thought. The guidance suggests that the Government do not now think that an anti-social behaviour order is a suitable way of dealing with such situations, which often take the form of disputes between neighbours. One neighbour may dislike another neighbour's activity, or feel that it is carried on with too great an intensity, and that causes alarm, distress or a sense of harassment.
<P>
Now that the Government have arrived at that view, and incorporated it in the guidance, why do they not carry it through into the Bill? Notwithstanding the guidance, the poor magistrates who have to make the decisions will be faced with all sorts of household activities that have given rise to an anti-social behaviour order. It would make sense to exclude disputes between neighbours from the Bill. Will the Minister tell us in detail why the Government are not prepared to take that course even though they are thinking along those lines?
<P>
Amendment No. 31 deals with the possible use of anti-social behaviour orders in a discriminatory way. There is much common ground in Committee on that issue, and I am sure that the Minister agrees with us. He would not want such orders to be used in a discriminatory fashion. Concern has been expressed that they may be used in such a way, but I imagine that the vast majority of local authorities and police forces would not do that. However, there is always a risk.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government's consultation paper promised:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There will be a provision in the statute requiring local authorities and the police not to exercise their functions under it in a way which discriminates against people on grounds of race, religion, disability, sex or sexual orientation.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>We agree with that statement, but we cannot find it in the Bill. It should be there and the Government promised it in the consultation paper. I heard what the Minister said about putting the provision in the guidance notes, but, as he knows, that is not the same as putting it in the Bill. Why does such a provision for anti-social behaviour orders not appear in the Bill? I hope that there are not insurmountable difficulties in drafting such a measure. We made a humble attempt at doing so with the resources that we have available; no doubt, the Government could improve on that if they were minded to do so.
<P>
It is important for the Government to deal with all the issues that I have raised. I know that the Minister will do so because he is answering our questions fully. However, we want satisfactory answers because we do not want to enact a Bill that will be in danger of breaching the European convention on human rights. If the Government adopted, or at least considered, our amendments, they would reduce the risk of a challenge under that convention. I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it in order for me to speak to all the amendments now, or will we taken them individually?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The debate on the amendments is all of a piece. Should there be a desire to move any of the amendments subsequently, that will take place formally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I wish to speak in particular to amendments Nos. 87 and 84.
<P>
Amendment No. 87 would insert the words ``to the criminal standard''. Therefore, it must be obvious to the Committee what it seeks to do. It is similar to amendment No. 7 tabled by my Hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) which refers to ``beyond reasonable doubt''. The amendments are different ways of inserting a criminal standard of proof into the Bill.
<P>
The Lord Chief Justice has approved the direction universally given to juries when they must decide on a person's guilt. The Crown must make the jury sure of someone's guilt and nothing less will do. That is why I would insert the words ``to the criminal standard''.
<P>
I am increasingly troubled by the fact that the clause contains a mixture of civil and criminal law. That is a dangerous and worrying combination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I have heard some lawyers express the same concern, which I do not share. Does the hon. Gentleman apply the criticism with equal passion to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> That is a good question, and I suppose that the answer is probably no. I have thought about it many times, and I simply do not like that approach because it leads to difficulties.
<P>
The Minister has described the behaviour that we are discussing as criminal or sub-criminal. He said that such behaviour made people's lives a misery, and that it was not trivial but criminal and nasty. That is why one of the fundamental planks of our system--the requirement that the burden of proof is placed on the person who brings the case and that the standard of proof is high and beyond reasonable doubt--is the right approach.
<P>
Sometimes cases are hard to prove and witnesses may not be prepared to come forward. The Minister may consider that, for administrative reasons, it is better for those cases to be decided on the balance of probabilities. That may be true, but is it right? If a person's liberty is at stake, is it right that the standard of proof should fall to the level of the civil standard at any stage? I do not think so, and I hope that the Minister will take note of that.
<P>
Amendment No. 84 relates to clause 2, page 3, line 14, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court shall disregard any act of the defendant which he shows was reasonable in the circumstances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or which he shows was not intended to cause harassment, alarm or distress.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>This morning, the Minister gave various examples of bad behaviour, each of which, in effect, amounted to a criminal offence. The conduct that he talked about included assault, threats to kill, criminal damage and so on. Common to all those criminal offences is the requirement that there be some form of mens rea, or intent. It is well known that, in the courts, a person charged with, say, an assault can claim, ``I didn't intend to do it'', or, ``I didn't mean it.'' With offences such as speeding, the person caught remains responsible regardless of whether the transgression was accidental. However, for the broad mass of criminal offences, a person can tell the court in his defence, ``I did not intend it.''
<P>
It is wrong in principle that the only effective defence against an application for an anti-social behaviour order is for the defendant to tell the court that the behaviour was reasonable. Presumably, the burden would be on that defendant to prove that the behaviour was reasonable. Would not it be much fairer to allow a defendant in those circumstances to say ``I did not intend it''? If the court were not sure that the opposite was true, it would have to give the defendant the benefit of the doubt.
<P>
In effect, the clause imposes a strict liability offence--one which applies regardless of whether the defendant intends to cause harassment, alarm or distress. It will avail the defendant not at all to say, ``Whatever else I did, I did not intend to cause any harassment, alarm or distress.'' The court's reaction will be, ``It doesn't matter what you intended; the order is made.'' That is wrong.
<P>
With regard to procedure, the Minister was helpful not only in what he said earlier but in the document that he provided on procedures and what is likely to happen in practice. A few points arise. If asked whether proceedings before the court should be fair to everybody, many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would say yes. There cannot be unfairness. That is the background to my remarks.
<P>
In normal criminal proceedings, there is what is called advance information, that is, the documents given to the defence prior to the hearing to enable it to see the nature of the prosecution's case. That is standard practice nowadays. It sometimes adds to the time taken for a case to get to court, but it means that the defendant has a chance to see what is happening. More recently, rules have been introduced on disclosure by the Crown and on disclosure by the defence in criminal trials. All those procedures have been introduced specifically to ensure fairness to both sides.
<P>
Let us say that one was making a matrimonial complaint in the magistrates court. I see that the Minister is making a note. Under the usual procedure for bringing such a complaint to the magistrates court, the normal rules of disclosure and advance information do not apply. Howevere, as we are, in my view, talking about quasi-criminal proceedings, will the Minister tell us whether there will be any provision for the defendant to a complaint to know the nature of the case against him before he appears in court? I believe that there should be such provision.
<P>
Once the proceedings reach the magistrates court, will the complaint be required to be prosecuted, for want of a better word, by a legally qualified person? The Minister might not be able to answer this now, but is the level of representation in terms of legal aid through the assistance by way of representation procedure applicable in the magistrates court? The green form has a limit, but I am not certain whether there is a limit on assistance by way of representation. One does not want to put at risk a defendant in a magistrates court in terms of legal help and advice.
<P>
Will the Minister deal a little more fully with the vexed question of whether hearings will be held in public or private? What criteria will govern such decisions? We are used to private hearings taking place when they involve juveniles but I think that the Minister said this morning that there was a need--these are my words, not this--to have the names of certain parties in these cases made public.
<P>
What about the right to cross-examine witnesses? I ask the Minister's forgiveness if this is made clear in the documents, but will the defendant to the complaint have the fullest possible right to cross-examine and to make submissions of no case to answer in relation to those giving evidence ahead of him? Will the Minister confirm that the hearsay rule applies? Does he accept that hearsay evidence is not acceptable in criminal trials and is, indeed, frightfully unsatisfactory in every form of procedure unless it is properly put to the test? I must not ask, ``What happens if . . . ?'' too often, because it is not fair. I cannot help but wonder, however, about problems that might occur. In a criminal trial, the defence can usually ask to see confidential and sensitive documents, to look for background. A lengthy argument follows about public interest immunity, and about whether it applies to the producton of such documents. Sometimes they are very helpful to the defence, and sometimes there is good reason for keeping them confidential. There are many reasons for following either course. Will anything similar happen during consideration of the complaints?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The matter of adjournments concerned me. It seems that the Minister did not number the pages of the helpful notes that he made available, so I took the trouble to number them at lunchtime--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): Mine are numbered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I may have a draft copy.
<P>
Section 5.4 of the draft deals with adjournments. I may have got the matter entirely wrong, in which case the Minister will correct me. The section recommends that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it should be made clear in the summons or an accompanying notice that the case will go ahead on the first occasion listed, if necessary in the absence of the defendant''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems fairly clear. Some three pages later, section 6.2 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Courts should think carefully before proceeding in a defendant's absence although there will undoubtedly be some cases where this is necessary. Adjournments should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Am I alone in thinking that there is some contradiction between the two statements? Either the case either goes ahead on the first occasion or it is adjourned. In the first of the paragraphs, it is suggested that it must, and in the second that it may not.
<P>
It is important to give defendants proper time to prepare. I think that under magistrates courts rules--the matter will be confirmed--the return date for a hearing after the issue of a complaint must allow reasonable time for the defendant to respond to allegations. That is very important.
<P>
I should like to ask a general question about the clause, which may have been covered. A person may well behave in an anti-social manner in two or three local authority areas. Areas of London can easily be thought of in which two or three neighbouring authorities virtually meet on one corner. It is not uncommon for marauding gangs to move around. Will the Minister confirm that an order can cover two or more local authority areas? I am sure that it can.
<P>
I draw to a close, to the pleasure of everyone apart from myself, I am sure. I feel strongly about the burden of proof. It would be a bit miserable for someone to be found to have caused harm when he did not intend to and to have an order imposed on him. I also feel strongly that the procedures of our courts should apply fairly and across the board. The defendant as well as the claimant should have a fair chance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I shall speak to amendment No. 291 in my name and speak briefly to some of the other amendments. The aims of amendment No. 291 are twofold. The first is to strengthen the idea that the defendant should be in court by establishing a process for issuing a summons. In that way, the individual could be arrested and brought to court if necessary. That would strengthen the suggestion in the guidance that the defendant be present.
<P>
The amendment's second purpose is to make it clear that the legal aid provisions that are applied in this instance are the same as those applied to any other criminal proceeding. In that way, it will be clear that the seriousness of the potential penalty is related to the legal aid support.
<P>
In respect of the first purpose, the defendant's presence is essential. Paragraph 6.2 of the guidance states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where prohibitions are being imposed, the breach of which is a criminal offence, it is preferable for the defendant to be present to know what the order is about''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to make the wording stronger than ``preferable''. We appreciate that there should be no unnecessary delay when anti-social behaviour takes place and that it is important to seek early resolution. Specific conditions could, however, be imposed on a defendant on an ex parte basis, the breach of which could lead to five years' imprisonment. The initial handing down of that order would be unfair and could lead to subsequent legal challenge on a human rights basis. Someone might go through the entire process and then refer back to the initial court process under which the order was granted to seek relief from the penalty that was imposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because he is trying to be constructive about the clauses, as are other hon. Members. Will he consider one point? If one considers the question that he poses in absolute terms and in isolation, it is easy to come down in one direction. We are concerned with the idea that it is generally preferable for the defendant to be present. However, we need to avoid a delay in making an order that will protect the public. Such a delay might be caused by an individual who is deliberately absent to prevent an order being made against him. Will the hon. Gentleman consider that, rather than being absolute in his remarks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I appreciate the fact that we would not want adjournments to be used as a tool by somebody who does not want to co-operate. That is why we make specific provision in proposed subsection (11B) for an arrest warrant to be issued so that the person can be brought to court. We recognise that there will be difficult circumstances, but an arrest warrant would be appropriate, just as it is in cases such as breaches of community service orders. In those cases, arrest warrants can be issued if the rules and regulations seem to have been deliberately flouted. We do not want there to be a delay, but we want there to be more safeguards to ensure that people are brought before the court when the order is made.
<P>
We would appreciate more clarification about the basis on which the court is given instructions about the proceedings in section 6. The Minister noted that the guidance would apply in addition to existing rules and that there could be a need for new rules of court in relation to the procedures. Will the Minister clarify the Government's thinking on how they can ensure that ``preferably'' means a very strong preference? We do not want the courts to give up at the first opportunity and to conduct the proceedings in the defendant's absence.
<P>
Although one might feel reluctant to allow public money to be used on behalf of those who have, in the Minister's words, parked elephants on one's doorstep, or who have committed heinous acts, one would also, in accordance with all the general principles of criminal law, want to be certain that a person brought before the courts for an order of such gravity would have access to resources--if they had none of their own--to provide a proper legal defence. I should be interested in the responses to the queries of the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) about the level of representation that the Minister envisages being available for both parties.
<P>
The hon Member for Woking, who tabled amendment No. 87 on the standard of proof, and I have taken part in some interesting debates in the Select Committee on Home Affairs about disciplinary procedures for police officers. Those debates are relevant in that they raise the issue of sliding scales under the civil standard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The question of the relevant standard of proof in police disciplinary hearings took up a great deal of the Select Committee's time. Every opinion expressed was heartfelt and genuine, and the hon. Gentleman took a full part in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention. The crucial point that we were trying to establish in those discussions was what a sliding scale means, when decisions are being reached on the balance of probabilities. It was suggested to us that where the penalty is likely to be serious, the courts commonly seek a higher standard of proof than 50-50. The standard escalates with the possible penalty. Thus, in a case where a police officer could be dismissed, a higher standard of evidence would be sought than in a case where the penalty would be a reprimand or small fine. My hon. Friends and I would be interested to know whether the restrictions imposed in relation to an anti-social behaviour order would have a bearing on the standard of evidence that would need to be presented.
<P>
The use, in applications for anti-social behaviour orders, of a lower standard of proof than for offences under the Public Order Act 1986, seems almost to conflict with the possibility of using professional witnesses. The provision of extra tools such as the use of professional witnesses leads me to think that the higher standard of proof could have been tried out. It might become achievable, given all the other new measures that are being introduced in connection with the order. We are worried that the lowering of the standard of proof to the civil level, with the possible consequent restrictions on liberty and the criminal penalties that could follow on a breach, might not be wise. The higher standard could have been tried, given all the other helpful ways that the Government are introducing of trying to achieve a result in court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh (Gainsborough):</B> The Minister seems to resent my contributions; I cannot think why. I am trying only to do my job, and to seek further and better particulars of the Bill. Following what has been said, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking, I remain seriously worried. The Minister and I seem to be speaking at cross purposes on the amendments. Every time I make a point about the burden of proof and the taking of care he replies, ``You seem to have got the wrong end of the stick.'' Of course, he would not be so rude as to say that to you, Mr. O'Hara; he says it to me.
<P>
The Minister says that the matter is not a criminal one, but I remind him that clause 2(10) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If without reasonable excuse a person does anything which he is prohibited from doing by an anti-social behaviour order, he shall be liable--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) on summary conviction, to imprisonment . . . not exceeding six months''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>We all agree that that is the trigger. What worries me is the low burden of proof at the original hearing. Proof beyond reasonable doubt would not be necessary, and that is why the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is very relevant.
<P>
It is possible to envisage the behaviour that the Minister has in mind. We read of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``families whose anti-social behaviour, when challenged, leads to verbal abuse''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We all know what happens in such domestic situations between neighbours on an estate. There might be a family that is abusing another family, but there are two sides to the coin. The family might believe that it has some excuse, even though it may not be a proper excuse. I am not defending such behaviour, but let us assume that the matter is not clear cut. An order could be made against the family, or persons in the family, on a low standard of proof. It might then be claimed that the family, or the persons, have not obeyed the order. They would then be liable to imprisonment. In such a case, the prosecution would not have to prove the original behaviour beyond reasonable doubt. If my assumption is wrong, the Minister may intervene.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We would have an extraordinary state of affairs, which has not previously occurred in our criminal system, in which a scanty and doubtful procedure triggers an order. Magistrates will want to do their job properly. They will impose a conviction only if there is no doubt in the matter, but they will be unable to go behind the original order. The Minister might reply that the prosecution have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the family or persons have broken the order. However, the prosecution does not have to prove beyond reasonable doubt what was in the original order.
<P>
The matter is rather worrying. The European Convention on Human Rights, which I never thought that I would invoke in Parliament, but times change--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No one else would have expected you to invoke the European Convention either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> None the less, I am delighted to do so.
<P>
Under article 6 of section I, the European Convention on Human Rights requires criminal charges to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Under article 6(3)(d), it declares the right of cross-examination. The Minister will reply that we are not discussing criminal proceedings, but as soon as an anti-social behaviour order is made, I envisage that someone could go to the European Court and claim that, contrary to the Minister's view, these are de facto criminal proceedings.
<P>
The Minister has admitted to the Committee that anti-social behaviour occurs on our estates--and we all regret that--but that we are unable to make convictions, and have had to jettison traditional standards of proof to deal with that behaviour. However, people might receive funding from various groups that would enable them to go to the European Court of Human Rights with a serious complaint against the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I want to nail that point immediately. I did not say that we have to jettison the criminal burden of proof in the courts because we cannot obtain convictions against criminal behaviour. I said that we do not have adequate ability to prove that a wide range of individual anti-social actions would lead to a criminal conviction and a punishment. We cannot protect the public against serious anti-social behaviour. The orders are designed to do that. That is a specific and precise point, but that is the specific and precise purpose of the orders. We want to protect the public, who currently are not protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes, we all want to protect the public, but we must ensure that we frame legislation that is not open to challenge. A parliamentary briefing prepared by Liberty states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The European Convention on Human Rights specifies that the standard of proof for criminal trials must be beyond reasonable doubt. Further, the European Court of Human Rights does not regard the categorisation of trials in domestic legal systems as decisive, and would be likely to view the procedure for obtaining an ASBO as being in substance a criminal trial and thus requiring the guarantees of the criminal process. Accordingly, the proposals carry the real and politically embarrassing risk of major government legislation being found to be in breach of Article 6 of the ECHR, possibly by English courts under the Human Rights Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may disagree with that statement; his legal advice may be different from that given to Liberty and if it is, the Committee has the right to hear it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The past few minutes have been a particular pleasure. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) appears to have become the parliamentary adviser for Liberty, having acted as the representative of the Howard League in our previous sitting. It is clear that the hon. Gentleman is really an old softy who wants to protect individuals involved in serious and persistent anti-social behaviour who breach an order following from the consequences of their actions. That would be the result of what the hon. Gentleman said. He seems to be more enthusiastic than the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) in wanting to water down the Bill's provisions and to go much further than merely providing protection.
<P>
I put it to the hon. Gentleman that criminal charges have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, which is the point he made in relation to the European Court of Human Rights, because that is the standard of proof that is required in respect of a breach. The European Court has carefully considered what constitutes criminal proceedings for the purposes of article 6 of the convention; a substantial factor has been found to be whether there is the power to commit to prison, and there is no reason to think that the power to impose prohibitions in an anti-social behaviour order implies that the proceedings are criminal. The hon. Gentleman's interpretation is wrong; I am surprised at his metamorphosis into an old softy, as demonstrated in his contribution.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking expressed concern about the mixture of civil and criminal law, but his concern is misplaced. Most of the people who argued that it is a problem have advanced that argument as a matter of principle rather than of practicality. Clearly, it is right for us to consider points that are made by an experienced lawyer, but we should consider what happens on the streets as well as in the courts.
<P>
The problem on the streets is that the present system has not been able to deal with the sort of anti-social behaviour that has so damaged people's lives. I said earlier that there may be occasions when either the police or the local authority do not test to the full the powers that are available to them, or they may be constrained by resources. But there is adequate evidence of cases in which they test the system available to them to the full and use the resources of time and effort to try to find a solution, but fail to do so.
<P>
I reiterate, especially for the hon. Member for Woking, that the anti-social behaviour order is an attempt to prevent certain behaviour--I underline ``prevent''--in order to protect people. The aspiration is to avoid having to punish, but the assurance of punishment and the assurance, if necessary, of a considerable degree of punishment, must be there if prevention is to succeed. Effective protection of the public is something that Parliament has failed to achieve in relation to this type of behaviour and we must find ways of providing that protection.
<P>
It was interesting to note that in introducing the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the previous Government accepted the underlying approach of combining the civil procedure in respect of prevention with the criminal procedure in relation to punishment, which is the essence of the anti-social behaviour order. That followed publication by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary of proposals on what we originally described as orders of community protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> May I ask the Minister one question to clear the matter up? When a person is charged with breach of an order, will those prosecuting have to prove beyond reasonable doubt his original disorderly conduct, which necessitated the order being made in the first place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No. They will have to prove the breach and the behaviour in respect of which a person is charged and brought before the court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> So, in effect, contrary to what the Minister is saying, the person could end up in prison for behaviour which has not had to be proven beyond reasonable doubt?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No, a person can be brought before the court for the breach of an order that is made as a result of behaviour that does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. But the behaviour that results in the breach has a criminal burden of proof, and of course the court has to consider not only the fact that there is a breach of the order but the seriousness of the behaviour that resulted in the person's appearance in court on a criminal matter. That is for the courts to deal with at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Therefore, the commission of the breach will land the defendant in court. Breaching the order--setting foot in the relevant area in the case of an exclusion order, or setting foot out of doors in the case of a curfew--not anti-social behaviour similar to that which resulted in the order, will lead to a court appearance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> A breach of the order will be tested by referring to the terms of the order. The court will have to consider the seriousness of the breach and apply the usual tests to the punishment for the breach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> But any breach of the order will result in a conviction. The court may examine the seriousness of the breach when fixing the punishment, but any breach will result in a conviction and a record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is for the court to decide whether the order has been breached, and the seriousness of the breach. To enable the court to make that serious decision, the sort of behaviour that the order prohibits must be clear. The police, the local authority and the court would need to be satisfied before respectively applying for and granting the order.
<P>
General and specific points have been made, and I shall try to deal with them in an ordered way. I was asked whether advance disclosure was required for a breach. The answer is yes. A breach is a criminal offence and is subject to the normal procedural rules for criminal offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The question was whether advance disclosure or a similar provision would apply to hearings on the complaint, not those on the breach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No. With the greatest respect, both questions were asked, and I answered the question about the necessity of advance disclosure for a breach. The breach must be without reasonable excuse, and prohibition, which is necessary for protecting the community, must be tested. Prohibition in the order is appealable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking made several complex legal points. I shall restrain myself from describing them as trade union points. Given the long list of specific, procedural points, I shall clarify some of them in writing. The hon. Gentleman's speeches are especially enjoyable. They have the depth and legal intricacy of a John Grisham novel--so I am told. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has missed his vocation, and a more profitable way of earning an honest crust may be open to him than Parliament or the law can provide.
<P>
The defendant may make whatever submissions he considers proper when the court hears the case. He can challenge the evidence placed by the police or the local authority. The procedure will be the same as for other applications by way of complaint, including applications under the Magistrates' Courts Act for the defendant to be bound over to keep the peace.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has just said that the defendant can challenge the evidence. Does that mean that he can cross-examine any witness?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall be coming on to that. I am trying to deal with some of the stray points that I might otherwise overlook.
<P>
The question of adjournment to allow the defendant to be present has been raised by a number of hon. Members. However, speed is needed to stop the behaviour that is being complained about. In most circumstances it will not have come out of the blue. A number of attempts will have been made to use different prohibitions, the threat of eviction or prosecution, or efforts will have been made to get the different parties together to resolve issues without recourse to an application for an anti-social behaviour order.
<P>
The presumption should be to go ahead even though it is clear in part V of the guidance notes that the possibility of an adjournment is there if it is reasonable to take that course of action. The person who receives a summons to face the possibility of an order being made should understand that.
<P>
There is otherwise a danger that he could think that it was not likely to go ahead the first time and not bother to turn up. That could lead to an intolerable delay and a continuation of the very behaviour that we wish to prohibit. Adjournments should be allowed only exceptionally; the defendant's absence will normally constitute a reason for an adjournment only on exceptional grounds.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking also asked whether proceedings would be in public. They would be in public except in the case of juveniles when they could be in private, but that would be at the discretion of the courts. In general it should be left to the common sense of the court. The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point about the overlap of local authority areas. I have given the matter some thought. In cases like inner and outer London or Salford and Manchester, the definition of a local authority or commission boundary may be rather more arbitrary than one would like.
<P>
There are complications whichever way one approaches the matter as different commission areas and different local authority areas can be involved. In general the view has been taken that if an application involves different areas separate applications might be needed to prohibit the same type of behaviour in both areas. The issue cannot be concluded completely tidily and I am continuing to give it some thought. The present drafting of the Bill looks to us the tidiest way of dealing with the matter.
<P>
I turn now to the more specific elements in the amendment. We considered with some care whether the county court, the magistrates court or both should be used for these orders. There are five main reasons for our conclusion. First, many applications will be made by the police. They are more familiar with the magistrates courts process, which makes matters simpler. Secondly, it allows the courts to enforce their own orders through the criminal offence mechanisms in the Bill. That would not be possible for county courts except through contempt of court. Thirdly, we believe that only one court should hear applications. More than one could lead to confusion and would make the establishment of a consistent approach more difficult. We set out, however, as one option to be considered in our consultations, that of applications being made in either the magistrates court or the county court.
<P>
Fourthly, magistrates courts are generally close to the local community than county courts and their use supports the essentially local nature of the orders. Fifthly--I consider this to be conclusive--after we issued a consultation document on the orders last September, we received various comments, many of which were constructive and helpful. A summary of those responses was placed in the Library on 19 December. The responses strongly supported magistrates courts as the venue for dealing with the orders, and we should not ignore that advice. Several arguments pointed in that direction, but it was certainly the overwhelming view of respondents. I hope that I have dealt satisfactorily with amendment No. 294.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 is unnecessary and complicated. The hon. Member for Hertsmere raised some important points and I am happy to reassure him about them. The defendant will have the opportunity for a full hearing and to question witnesses. That is a normal part of the civil process and it applies to the orders. The hon. Gentleman was right--it is made clear in the guidance--that the defendant must be made fully aware of the serious nature of the order when a summons to appear is issued and of the need for him to attend the hearing.
<P>
A defendant would be able to question witnesses. Indeed, it is difficult to envisage circumstances when a court would not consider it unfair not to allow that, even when witnesses might be worried about their position. That is a better solution than that proposed by the hon. Gentleman and it makes special and elaborate witness protection measures for the orders unnecessary.
<P>
It is not possible to compel defendants to attend, so orders on an ex parte basis are possible. There is no need to restrict their length if a defendant refuses to attend. Indeed, that might lead to worse cases being treated more leniently. I reassure members of the Committee that the existing rules of court for magistrates courts will apply. We are considering whether any specific rules are needed to cover such detailed aspects as are outlined in the amendment. The detailed guidance will make clear the rights of the defendant and the summons procedure, for example, and that is the appropriate place for such detailed specifications.
<P>
I reject the suggestion that we should increase the burden of proof from the balance of probabilities that is normal in a civil case to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt, and amendments Nos. 7 and 87 would have that effect. An anti-social behaviour order is a serious matter and it is backed up by the criminal law only if there is a breach. To treat the anti-social behaviour order as if it were a criminal matter throughout would be to negate the purpose of the order and to abandon those whom we seek to protect through the introduction of such orders.
<P>
There are two main reasons why it would do that. First, the initial stage--the application--is genuinely a civil process. There is certainly no penalty, merely the equivalent of an injunction to prevent certain behaviour. It would be odd to make such a procedure subject to the criminal standard of proof. Under current arrangements, the penalty for a breach of an injunction may be imprisonment, following proceedings for contempt of court. The procedure and the balance that we suggest are not entirely innovative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Such imprisonment is civil rather than criminal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Imprisonment feel like imprisonment, whatever the source from which it arises.
<P>
Breaches of an anti-social behaviour order can attract imprisonment and it does not break new ground by creating a jeopardy arising from a civil order. The consequences flowing from a criminal offence of breach of an order is a difference of degree from breaches of normal injunctions, not a difference in kind.
<P>
The second reason is the nature of the civil standard of proof. It is wrong to think of it as one absolute standard of 51 per cent. It is a flexible instrument, which courts can interpret in response to the circumstances of individual cases. Indeed, they do that as a matter of course, and we would expect them to do so if there was particular concern over an application and they wanted to apply a higher test--but that is a matter best left to the courts.
<P>
The Bill provides the defence that the conduct was ``reasonable in the circumstances''; such an amendment was debated in the House of Lords. If the individual establishes such a defence, an order cannot be made. We included that defence in another place to answer the concerns that several hon. Members have voiced today. Indeed, I assure those who have not read the reports of the debates in another place that that particular aspect was the subject of a long and learned debate, and that the Government were able to satisfy the legitimate concerns expressed.
<P>
In conclusion, it would be totally wrong to apply a criminal standard of proof. The orders are civil orders, which carry none of the risk to a defendant entailed in criminal proceedings, such as imprisonment or a criminal record. They do not merit the imposition of a disproportionate standard of proof.
<P>
I understand why amendment No. 10 was tabled, but I assure the Committee that it is unnecessary. Although applications for orders against juveniles will be heard in magistrates courts, the individual's interests will not be neglected; the protections are there.
<P>
Section 44 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 applies to children and young persons in summary proceedings in magistrates courts. Under that section, the court is required to have regard to the welfare of the child or young person. In addition, under section 34A of the 1933 Act, a court may require a parent or guardian to attend the court. That is likely to apply if the parents are not subject to parallel proceedings for anti-social behaviour order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> For those of us who do not have the provisions of section 44 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 at our fingertips, will the Minsiter explain whether it requires or enables a court to ask for a report on the family circumstances of a young defendant to be prepared by an independent person, such as a probation officer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall take advice on that, but I believe that the court can choose to seek such advice if it feels that it is needed. I shall certainly check, but in my experience, magistrates can be quite creative in making sure that they have whatever information is necessary. I should mention also that, under clauses 9 and 1, the court will have discretion as to whether to impose parenting orders for those under the age of 16.
<P>
A number of specific points were raised on amendment No. 12. I have already pointed out that under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, a defendant has to establish that in the particular circumstances, the pursuit of the course of conduct was reasonable. Again, there is precedent for our approach in what the House had already decided. The requirement that it should be reasonable is consistent with the general law on magistrates courts.
<P>
Under section 101 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, where the defence relies on any ``proviso, excuse or qualification'', the burden of proof lies on the defendant. Placing the burden on the individual to show that his behaviour was reasonable is nothing new. That is because it would be in his knowledge rather than that of the prosecutor whether he had an excuse. It is for the prosecution to show that the behaviour complained of has the effect that is described; it is for the individual to show that, despite that effect, it was reasonable in the circumstances. That is surely a reasonable protection. Again, I remind the Committee that legal assistance will be available to defendants. Surely, if a defendant feels that his actions were reasonable, it is right that he should show that to the court. Conversely, the court cannot be expected to know when behaviour is reasonable, which could result in orders being granted inappropriately. The court must be satisified that the case has been made to justify the order.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 refers to the dangers of discrimination. It would add nothing to the obligations in article 14 of the European convention on human rights. I remind the Committee that the European convention will be incorporated into UK law and will be relevant to the courts in making decisions. Accepting the amendment would cast doubt on other powers to grant an order that was not restricted by an anti-discrimination clause.
<P>
<H5>5.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I support what the hon. Member for Hertsmere seeks in his amendment, but I hope that I can reassure him and other members of the Committee that it is not appropriate. We are talking about what should be included in the civil order. It can prevent behaviour only to the extent that is necessary to protect the public from further anti-social acts by a defendent. We are not talking about community sentences or penalties, and I draw attention to the draft guidance that I have circulated to members of the Committee. The order is not intended to ban normal behaviour, merely anti-social behaviour. It should not stop an individual going from A to B; it covers the behaviour that might take place en route. We do not accept discrimination on race or any other grounds. That is a basic tenet of all our legislation and does not need specific endorsement. To do so could call other legislation into question. The guidance leaves the matter in no doubt. The fact that it has been raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere and placed on the record will be helpful in reinforcing that point.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 291, I remind the hon. Member for Hallam that in virtually all cases when an application is made for an anti-social behaviour order, attempts will have been made to persuade individuals to co-operate. We are likely, therefore, to be dealing with unco-operative individuals. Certainly, they are the target of the anti-social behaviour order. I sympathise with the hon. Member for Hallam, but his amendment is unnecessary. Detailed procedural provision for application made by way of complaint is already made in part II of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and rules of court, which deal with the powers of the court in the event of non-appearance by the defendant and make effectively the same provision as that proposed by the hon. Gentleman. I said earlier that we shall consider whether a change of reinforcement is needed in the rules. It is difficult to be completely precise because we are trying to get the balance right between two dangers.
<P>
Amendment No. 32 would insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``part of his quiet enjoyment of his home''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If a defendant can show that his actions constitute
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``quiet enjoyment of his home'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that would demonstrate that his behaviour was reasonable in the circumstances, which could be his line of defence. If, however, his quiet enjoyment somehow causes harassment, alarm or distress to others of a different household, and both the police and local authority believe that an order should be sought, surely it is right that the provision should be used and the reasonableness of the behaviour tested in the court. The defence already provided should be sufficient to meet the need; to add to it would be to dilute the overall strength of the provision and to call into question what it may or may not cover. We could construct a list of exceptions, but it would never be comprehensive. The amendment presents dangers, and the defence for which we have allowed deals better with the matter.
<P>
The same argument applies to amendment No. 84, which is unacceptable because it would place an obstacle in the way of any application for an order. There is an objective test: whether the behaviour that leads to the complaint causes ``harassment, alarm or distress''. The amendment would impose a test of intention, but it is the behaviour and the distress that is relevant when making an order.
<P>
I hope that I have managed to deal with all of the major points raised in the debate, although perhaps I have not dealt with the length of the period for which an order could apply--

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before hon. Members respond to the Minister's summing-up speech, I should like to explain a procedural point for the benefit of the Committee. Earlier, the question arose of the manner in treatment of grouped amendments, and I said that it was possible for subordinate amendments in a group to be moved formally. It is the convention, and the desire of this Chairman, that members of the Committee advise me of their intention to press supplementary amendments, in which case I may call them formally. It is within my discretion whether to call amendments. Sometimes there are a large number of alternative amendments, and it would be vexatious for them all to moved formally.

I have carefully considered this group of amendments, and the only alternative amendments are amendments Nos. 34 or 291 and 7 or 87. If hon. Members intend to move amendments formally, I am thus prepared to consider amendment No. 34 or amendment No. 291, amendment No. 7 or amendment No. 87, and amendments Nos. 10, 12, 32, 84, and 31. I hope that that advice is clear.
<P>
I am not advising members of the Committee to press amendments, but should they wish to do so, would they please advise me and consider the advice that I have just given?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall have to think carefully about some of the Minister's answers. We are not that far apart on some points. My point about the county court was really a query and I will not argue the case. I wondered how it would look to someone outside if a case were to be brought before the European Court of Human Rights, or before a domestic court following incorporation of the convention. Of course, the bulk of the work of a magistrates court consists of criminal cases, although it also has civil jurisdication. Reading the rules which the Government have told us in the consultation paper will be applied, it seems that the civil rules are cheek by jowl with the criminal rules. No doubt those who consider the matter will take into account.
<P>
The Government will have substantial problems establishing that the orders are not criminal orders. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking made a forceful argument about the standard of proof. There is also the question of the effect of such orders. The Minister has said that they are intended to be prohibitory, but not a penalty. From what the Government have told us about their intentions concerning the orders, it is a question of labelling whether one calls them penalties or prohibitions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister shakes his head, but the Government told us in the consultation paper that orders may take the form of a curfew or an exclusion order, which could last for a very long time--possibly indefinitely. No criminal sentence, except for a life sentence, which could last a very long time--possibly indefinitely. No criminal sentence, except for a life sentence, can be applied indefinitely. There is no provision for permanent exclusion or curfew orders in criminal law. There is provision for people to be sentenced to curfews, following conviction for criminal offences or, if the Bill is passed, for prisoners to be released early from their sentences subject to curfew. However, those curfews will be relatively short compared with the duration of curfews under the clause.
<P>
Whether such orders represent a penalty or a prohibition is an interesting point. That point might be argued elsewhere in the context of the European convention on human rights. Certainly, it does not matter how the Government choose to describe such orders--the courts will have to consider their effect and the procedures that have been followed before they come into effect. Therefore, my hon. Friend the Member for Woking raised some important points.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about the burden on proof being put on the defendant. However, a defendant will go before a court, which will use the civil, not the criminal, standard to determine whether he has committed an anti-social act. It will then be for the defendant to show that his behaviour was reasonable. Given that the defendant will not have the benefit of the criminal safeguard, and given the width of matters covered by such orders, is it fair for the burden to be put on the defendant in such circumstances?
<P>
The Minister mentioned other examples where the burden of proof was on the defendant. He mentioned a certain statutory provision in cases such as the possession of an offensive weapon. If a defendant is carrying an offensive weapon, the burden of proof rests with him; in certain circumstances, he must prove that he had a reasonable excuse for possessing an offensive weapon. However, he must do so after the case has been proved to the criminal standard. In how many cases where the civil standard of proof is used does the burden of proof shift to the defendant rather than the prosecution or the applicant? I hope that the Minister will think about that.
<P>
It is the very width of the behaviour that could generate such orders that is important. The behaviour is not carefully defined. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough quoted the Liberty report. Andrew Ashford, professor of law at Oxford, wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``almost any behaviour could potentially qualify, whether it constitutes criminal conduct . . . Playing a TV or CD player too loud or too late, failing to control noisy children, trespassing, uttering supposedly defamatory utterances, or even complaining vigorously to neighbours about their behaviour, are examples that might qualify.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If a court were to decide that such matters qualify, the burden would be on the defendant to show that his behaviour was reasonable. That would weigh the odds against the defendant and put the burden on him. A magistrates court might think a defendant's behaviour unreasonable, because the burden is on him to show whether it was reasonable. Some of that behaviour might be eccentric or different.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about discrimination. The Government promised in their consultation paper to deal with that matter by statute. However, if the Minister is saying that an alternative provision has the same effect, I shall not argue the odds. Having listened carefully to the Minister, I intend to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I, too, intend to seek leave to withdraw my amendments. So far, I have sought leave to withdraw three or four amendments, but I might think differently when we debate a couple of amendments about which I feel very strongly.
<P>
The record will show whether I am wrong, but I think that the Minister said that an ex parte application can be made for an anti-social behaviour order. I do not think that that is what he meant to say. If he did not say it, I apologise. Of course, such orders must be made after a complaint and, by definition, complaint must be served. Therefore, that is not an ex parte proceeding, in which no notice is given to the defendant.
<P>
I referred to the difference between civil and criminal prison, so to speak, and the Minister smiled and said that it did not feel much different when one was behind the gates. The key point is that a prison sentence for the breach of an order means a criminal record, although I would not get a criminal record if I breached an injunction not to molest my spouse or partner, for example, in a civil case. There is a big difference in fundamentals. On that note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I had better clarify the position again. As I said this morning, I note the intention of hon. Members to seek leave to withdraw amendments, but the only amendment that needs to be withdrawn is No. 294, which is the only amendment to have been moved. I shall invite the hon. Member who moved it to withdraw it at the appropriate point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased that in the course of the debate we have added Liberty and the European Court of Human Rights to our grand civil liberties coalition on this side of the Committee. By the end of our proceedings, we may have added some rather more unexpected organisations to the list.
<P>
The Minister's response to our concern about the application of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 to the calling in of defendants was sufficient for us to believe that there is an appropriate way forward. We are pleased that the Government remain open to the possibility of altering the rules, if that proves necessary.
<P>
As we shall point out repeatedly during the Committee's proceedings, there should be regular reviews of orders and reports back so that we can see what is happening in practice. If for example, there were a pattern of ex parte orders being granted in significant numbers, we would want to query how and in what circumstances that was happening, and whether it was due to genuine villains simply refusing to turn up or whether other people were being caught. The Minister's response was encouraging.
<P>
I thank you, Mr. O'Hara, for your excellent guidance on how amendments may be put. Under the circumstances, we do not want to debate our amendment as against the Conservative amendment. We are happy to allow those who wish to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I welcome the nature of today's debate. The Committee is doing its job properly in teasing out these important issues. I am grateful to Opposition Members for their responses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam claimed the liberal forces of the European convention as well as Liberty, but I would point out that it is the Government who are seeking to incorporate the European convention on human rights into the law of this land, rather than forcing our people to go to Europe to enforce those rights. I welcome the fact that that aim seems to be supported by hon. Members on both sides.
<P>
There was an element of confusion about curfews. I was a little puzzled, but I think that I have the position clear now. The only curfew would be in the sense of an order prohibiting a person from doing something within given hours or days. There is no power to impose a curfew order as part of an anti-social behaviour order, because that goes beyond a prohibition. It is what the Bill says and not what the consultation paper says that counts. I thought that the hon. Member for Hallam was referring to the guidance, but I believe that he was referring to the consultation paper.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> To avoid unnecessary repetition, I shall speak to amendments Nos. 292 and 40, and leave Conservative Members to speak to their amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 292 is critical to keep the orders' scope proportional to the behaviour that brings them about. Liberal Democrats believe that that is fundamental to the debate about possible punishments, which the Committee has already touched upon. The punishment for a breach of an order should be appropriate to the original behaviour.
<P>
Curfews were mentioned. The amendment seeks to ensure that the curfew provision is appropriate only for specific times when anti-social behaviour occurred, and that the curfew cannot be extended beyond the repetition of the original anti-social behaviour.
<P>
The Government have sought to give reassurances about the matter. Liberal Democrats are pleased to see how far they have moved away from the consultation paper. I shared the alarm of the hon. Member for Hertsmere when I read it and saw that it offered courts much more general and widespread powers, and that the breach of a more general order could lead to the punishments and sanctions that the Committee has discussed. That was a matter of concern.
<P>
How does the Minister envisage dealing with the making of rogue orders, which specify things that were not intended in the legislation? From time to time, courts will choose to place general provisions within an order, which go far beyond the specific anti-social behaviour that brought the case to court. Liberal Democrats assume that the Government have some means of dealing with that; if not, do they simply intend to allow or to require defendants to go through the appeal procedure, which will be lengthy and difficult? We hope that the Government will have some other means of keeping orders tight and specific.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that the breach itself does not have to cause harassment, alarm or distress? Going to a specific place at a specific time of night could constitute a breach because a person there at that time had caused harassment, alarm or distress before the order was made. If the person involved were found in such circumstances, contrary to the order, he or she could be subject to the sanctions that were mentioned without having caused harassment, alarm or distress.
<P>
The amendment seeks to bring the idea into the Bill that the secondary act that follows the order should be of a similar nature to the first act. A breach that did not repeat harassment, alarm or distress should not be dealt with in the same way. The Minister who dealt with the matter in another place gave assurances about the scope of the order and of the conditions that would apply. We seek further clarification.
<P>
Amendment No. 40 relates to another aspect where Liberal Democrats seek to give more discretion to the courts in dispensing orders. Throughout the Bill, there is a tendency to move towards a form of fixed sentencing. The types of orders and provision that may apply are specified to a greater degree than is necessary. One example is the prohibition on courts from giving a conditional discharge. Similar is the requirement for courts to give a two-year order, which we believe to be an unnecessary restriction. The amendment seeks to introduce a two-year maximum, but would allow courts to give a six-month, a one-year or an 18-month order, or whatever they feel to be appropriate.
<P>
Such provision is especially important in relation to young people. Although they will not usually come under the scope of the order, they still may. Young people can develop greatly in a year. A group of youngsters may cause a problem during one summer, which results in an anti-social behaviour order. We would like the courts to be able to use their discretion to give a one-year order rather than being required to give a two-year order and then to go through the whole process of rescinding it.
<P>
The amendments seek to tease out those two critical issues. The first is the courts' discretion when making orders and dealing with them. The second is the specific behaviour that will cause a breach. In considering that, we must bear in mind--as we have throughout discussion of the clause--the serious matter of the penalties that could come into effect when a breach occurs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I have pleasure in speaking to amendment No. 88 in my name, which is similar to amendment No. 292, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam. When I was first elected to this place, I was placed on a Standing Committee on the Government Back Benches. After a day, it became apparent that it was my duty not to say anything and that if I did, I had to speak extremely briefly and then carry on with my correspondence. I did that until, one day, somebody on the Opposition Benches stood up and said, ``I hope that Conservative Members will listen carefully to what I have to say because I want to persuade them that my argument is a good one.'' Uniquely, I listened carefully and found myself nodding all the time. At the end of the debate, I asked a Government Whip whether it was in order for me to support the Opposition's amendment. That explains why my career--[Laughter.] Amendment No. 88 is one on which I hope there can be a modicum of agreement.
<P>
Amendment No. 88 is effectively the same as that tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam. It would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``leave out `doing anything described in the order' and insert `acting in the manner the subject of the complaint'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What I and, I think, the hon. Gentleman are saying is that we should not have such a wide order. There is a real danger that we could give the courts powers to make sweeping orders--I still have hon. Members' attention and I am trying to keep it a moment longer. It will be a bad thing if the order is so sweeping. In such cases, it is dangerous to let the courts make an order and prohibit the defendant from doing anything described in it.
<P>
The Minister might properly say that the courts will not do that and that they will restrict themselves to dealing with offensive behaviour. If that is right--as it must be--let us amend the Bill. That would not affect the Government's position in regard to the principle and would reflect what we all want. The courts would be able to make an order that prevented the repetition or continuation of anti-social behaviour or prevented someone from acting in the manner that was the subject to a complaint. Do not let us have an order, however, that says, ``Anything goes. The defendant was frightfully abusive and horrid to the lady at No. 12 Acacia Avenue. Let us take a broad brush and ban him from going to that housing estate.'' That is wrong. We should narrow the scope of the order. We should say, ``This is the abusive behaviour that has been complained of. We will make an order against its repetition.'' That is a fundamental principle. It ties up with amendment No. 93 and others, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will move.
<P>
Amendment No. 93--I hope that the Minister will take this on board--states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The terms included in an order under this section shall be such as to avoid any conflict with the defendant's schooling or further education, any organised extra-curricular activity including sport, any employment or any religious belief.''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Let us assume that a youngster is guilty of anti-social behaviour and of causing harassment, alarm or distress to a person or persons in a particular property. We must prevent that, but we must not make the sort of wide order that would prohibit someone from returning to an estate or going down a street for six months. The order should be narrowed to the minimum necessary and, if possible, it should not be burdensome. Unlike the Minister, I believe that many cases under the Bill will be brought against young people--not 10 and 11-year-olds, but 15, 16 and 17-year-olds. Many youngsters go to college or church, for example, or take part in a sport. I believe that to be important.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us try to make the orders that we frame sufficiently wide to cover the anti-social conduct but no wider. Let us try not to pile on the agony by preventing young people who are subject to orders from pursuing the good aspects of their lives. I am pleased that a Labour Member agrees with me. I hope that the Minister will find those arguments persuasive.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall speak briefly.
<P>
Amendment No. 11 would protect defendants' religious beliefs or school attendance by preventing an order from interfering with attendance at school or religious beliefs. The Minister will find the wording familiar because it has been borrowed from several other clauses in the Bill. The amendment would ensure that no orders could be made under clause 2 that would interfere with religious beliefs or school attendance. Such a provision applies to reparation orders, parenting orders and action plan orders. Therefore, we wondered why such a provision was not included in clause 2 to apply to anti-social behaviour orders. Orders will be capable of interfering with religious beliefs or school attendance. The court is allowed to impose any prohibition that is necessary to end anti-social behaviour. Therefore, an order could prohibit a young person from going to a place of worship or a school in an area that was covered by the order. Perhaps the Minister will tell us why the provision that the amendment would make is not included in the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 33 would apply in the case of someone who was prevented from occupying his home. It is an extreme example, but it underlines the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking that the scope of the orders could be very wide. In theory, nothing prevents an order from prohibiting people from occupying their homes. Subsection (6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The prohibitions that may be imposed . . . are those necessary for protecting persons in the local government area''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, if the court took the view, albeit in an extreme case, that it was necessary to protect people by prohibiting the defendants from occupying their home, it would be entitled to do that.
<P>
The Minister mentioned applications for anti-social behaviour orders in more than one local government area. He said that it would be necessary to make separate applications. To be fair, he said that he was thinking about it. I invite him to think a little harder because we all want to avoid unnecessary court hearings, expense and two lots of legal aid.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): If the hon. Gentleman is referring to amendment No. 8, which relates to an order that applies to more than one local government area, how would it work practically? Would he consider producing a procedure note on how one local authority should tell another and how one police force should tell another? What are the implications for the civil liberties of the person concerned, which the hon. Gentleman dealt with at great length this morning, particularly given that the orders are not made because the person has committed a criminal act and that the offence occurs only in the breach of the order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the hon. Lady expects the Opposition to put forward detailed procedural advice and guidance to local government, she may be in for a disappointment. We are simply saying that it would be common sense and save court time and public money if the Government thought about having one application that covered a number of areas rather than many different applications. We have made that suggestion and the Minister has said that he is thinking about it.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The hon. Member for Woking said that he was inviting Government Back Benchers to vote for the amendment. If he expects that support he should be able to explain the practicalities of putting forward an amendment that would have substantial implications for the people concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Lady has not yet been given the opportunity to vote for an Opposition amendment because we have not pressed one to a vote. The time may come, and she would do well to listen to the wise words of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking about his experience.
<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 30, which is an important amendment. The others are important in their own way but I identified two of the amendments as being particularly important and ones to which we would like substantial answers. Bearing in mind what we have said about the potential scope of the prohibitions that could be imposed as a result of the orders, what about a prohibition which a court thought it necessary to impose to protect people but which caused hardship or even exceptional hardship to a defendant? There is nothing to stop such an order being made. An exclusion order could easily cause someone exceptional hardship.
<P>
The courts have regarded people being deprived of their jobs as exceptional hardship for some purposes. What about an exclusion order that excluded someone from his job? He might work in a garage in the middle of an estate where his behaviour had been complained about, and to be excluded from that area would cost him his job.
<P>
How are the courts to take the effects on the defendant into account? Courts should be able to think about that because they do not want to put anyone out of a job, and to do so would be hardly likely to improve the individual's behaviour. At the same time the courts must balance against that the need to protect people from further acts of harassment, alarm or distress. How should courts approach this task? There is no guidance for them at the moment in the Bill, and not very much in the guidance that the Minister has drawn to our attention.
<P>
Finally I turn to amendment No. 13 and the question of how long the order should last. Subsection (7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An anti-social order shall have effect for a period (not less than two years) or until further order.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We would like to hear more about that especially in the light of the consultation paper, which states:
<P>
 ``The court will be empowered to grant an indefinite Order . . . and this may well be the appropriate duration in most cases. We are minded to propose that these Orders should be imposed, in any event, for a minimum period of two years and an application for discharge of an Order (of whatever duration) will not be possible within the first two years except with the agreement of all the parties involved.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government believe that an indefinite order may be appropriate in most cases. We wonder about that; of course, we want bad behaviour brought to an end, and the courts have the powers to do that, but is it wise to make an indefinite order in so many cases? The effect on the defendant must be considered, but so must the practicality of the matter.
<P>
When the injunctions are granted, especially matrimonial injunctions which are granted for much shorter periods--very few are for an indefinite period--problems often arise towards the end of the period when difficulties have subsided after relations between the parties have improved or, as in this case, the anti-social behaviour has subsided. Long after the anti-social behaviour has ceased, the person may breach the order for an entirely different reason and in a different context from that which applied originally. If the order was still in force, he would be breaching the order and committing a criminal offence.
<P>
As we have discovered, the person concerned would not need to commit a further act of harassment, alarm or distress against either the people who originally complained or anyone else, or any other type of criminal offence. All he would have to do to commit a criminal offence would be to breach the order, which in the case of an exclusion order would mean setting foot inside the affected area. That would amount to a criminal offence in itself if the order remained in force. The person could then be brought before the court, prosecuted, convicted and given a criminal record. Is that really sensible?
<P>
For example, several years after getting into trouble, a boy rushing to school might take a short cut through the exclusion area. He knows he should not do so because he will be in breach of the order, but he is late, and he is trying to get to school as quickly as possible. He is stopped by the police and may be prosecuted for breach of an order. Is that really wise? There might be even more extreme cases of people being prosecuted for breaching an order years afterwards, if that order is still hanging around their necks.
<P>
We wonder about the practicality of the proposal. Much of our concern and interest in the subject was generated by the consultation paper. We will listen with great interest to see if the Minister will qualify what was said in the consultation paper and if he will say that it was correct to suggest that an indefinite order would be the most appropriate, because we are thinking about how it will work in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There were several references to the consultation paper, from which we have moved on. It was the first document setting out our views and intentions on what are now known as anti-social behaviour orders, and we took notice of the response to it. The consultation document has no standing in advising the police, the local authority or anyone else about the intentions of Parliament. The guidance, and our debates, have that role, and I hope that hon. Members will take note of that important point.
<P>
It is important that hon. Members understand that the importance of a breach would be assessed, and that they appreciate the safeguard that thus exists. I understand that hon. Members are concerned that a trivial breach of an order should not attract a disproportionate response. If a specific breach is not regarded as serious, the Crown Prosecution Service is not likely to proceed--it can choose not to. That is one of its important roles. It is also true that a court, having heard what had happened, could decide that the defendant merely needed to be warned about future behaviour; it would have the option of granting an absolute discharge. There are a number of protections in regard to the breach of an order.
<P>
Several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Hallam, said that a breach does not actually have to cause harassment, alarm or distress. That is right, but behaviour that is in breach of an order that is imposed, and the extent to which that breach is significant, important or deliberate, will be examined with a view to taking further action, or for consideration by the courts.
<P>
The prohibitions are required to be necessary to protect the community from further anti-social acts. That is a test that the courts have to apply reasonably. They cannot impose orders that are not relevant to the protection of the wider community. Any narrower formulation would permit the defendant to circumvent the order by subtly changing the anti-social activity in question. If the prohibitions were set out in wide terms, it would be correspondingly harder to prove that they had been breached without reasonable excuse. The guidance makes it clear that we expect the order to set out the findings of fact on which the order is based, as well as the specific prohibitions. That should provide the required protection.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
With relation to amendments Nos. 292 and 88, there are circumstances in which the amendments would be limiting. We do not think that the orders should be constrained in such ways. I have already set out the reasons for that view.
<P>
I support the intention behind amendments Nos. 11 and 93 and hope that I can reassure the hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Hallam of that. I hope that that will persuade them to withdraw the amendments. It would not be appropriate to include the amendments in the Bill.
<P>
We are discussing what should be included in civil orders. Such orders can only prevent behaviour, and then only to the extent that is necessary to protect the public from further anti-social acts by the defendant. We are not talking about community sentences or about penalties.
<P>
The guidance makes it clear that the requirements of any order should avoid conflict with such matters as schooling, work, or religious activities. They should not be contained in the order, and we would expect the courts to take that into account when considering these civil orders.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 30 and 33 are unnecessary and restrictive, although I understand the points that hon. Members are trying to tease out by tabling them. We must leave it to the courts to exercise their judgements on the contents of the orders. No court needs to be told that a prohibition that a defendant can show will cause exceptional hardship should not be imposed unless there is a real need to do so. In other words, the test will be whether the order is necessary to prevent anti-social behaviour. That is blindingly obvious, but I will repeat it for the assistance of the Committee: A prohibition should be imposed only if it is necessary to prevent anti-social behaviour.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister quoted a phrase from the clause about acts that the defendant ``shows'' were ``reasonable''. If he was referring to the phrase in subsection (5) about the reasonableness of behaviour, that relates only to the behaviour in question; it does not relate to the effects of the prohibition. Similarly, the second part that he quoted relates only to the protection of the public; it does not relate to the effect on the defendant. There is nothing in the Bill to protect the defendant from something that would cause him exceptional hardship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> That is why I said that no court would need to be told that a prohibition, which a defendant could show would cause exceptional hardship, should be imposed only if there was real need. The courts should not restrict people's behaviour unless that is necessary to prevent the type of behaviour that has caused so much distress in local communities.
<P>
On a related point, courts should not take action that would prohibit a defendant from entering his home, unless the circumstances are truly exceptional. An order is properly limited to the protection of those in the local government area from further anti-social acts by the defendant. It would be unusual to ban someone from his home entirely. Indeed, in some circumstances the failure to comply with such an order might lead to eviction, but that is another matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Is the Minister saying that there are some circumstances, however exceptional, in which an order--not the breach of an order--would exclude someone from his home?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am saying that that matter is not exempt from the provisions in the Bill, but I think that it is unlikely that those circumstances would arise. However, it is not sensible to envisage all eventualities at this stage. That is the sort of issue that would generally be dealt with by eviction or other means. What has been suggested is not impossible, but unlikely. To include a restriction in the Bill would be inappropriate. Restricting the prohibitions in the order to those necessary to protect the community from further anti-social acts by the defendant is the essential safeguard. It is the only one required. Any more would risk cluttering up the Bill unnecessarily and dangerously. No list of what should or should not be included could ever be complete.
<P>
We decided on a minimum duration of two years to emphasise the seriousness of the order. To the defendant that duration would be a mark of society's determination to deal with the relevant behaviour. To the courts it would demonstrate that orders should not be granted for trivial incidents, but only for criminal or sub-criminal behaviour. Some Opposition Members might see that as a protective factor. A minimum duration would not be set in stone. An order could be discharged at any time before the end of two years, provided that all parties agreed. It could also be varied without consent if necessary.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Earlier the Minister said that the order was not a punishment or penalty. Yet the length of the order is meant to convey to the courts the severity of what has been done. I do not understand why, if the order is not a punishment, its duration shows anything about the severity of the situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is not so much a matter of severity as of the seriousness of the actions being dealt with in court and the seriousness with which society regards them. If the defendant remained trouble free during the two years there would be no reason for concern. There would have been no breach of the order. The person concerned would emerge without a blot on his character. After two years he would not require the consent of the applicants to apply for discharge.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to reassure Opposition Members on issues that are unlikely to figure greatly in the operation of the orders. The necessary protection has been included in the measure and the Bill should have the Committee's support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister's reply was disappointing. He will correct me if I am wrong, but I understood him to be advising the Committee not to accept the amendments that I tabled--Nos. 88 and 93--or amendment No. 292, tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam. His reasons for rejecting them do not stand up to scrutiny. He has not tackled the arguments properly.
<P>
The gist of the Minister's argument seemed to be that the phraseology of orders could be dealt with by guidelines, advice and other methods, and that there was no need for it to be included in the Bill. He was also troubled by the idea of what could follow if the Bill was worded in line with the amendments, so that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``repetition or continuation of the anti-social behaviour in question''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acting in the manner the subject of the complaint''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
defined the prohibitions that could be made in an order. He argued that it would be only too easy for a defendant to get round it by behaving not in the way described in the original complaint but in another way that was equally harassing--that was why it was important to have the wide-ranging wording of the Bill. I could not disagree more.
<P>
When people sit in courts administering justice, they have the legislation in front of them. They do not often have Home Office guidelines or memorandums circulated by civil servants to the Magistrates Association--they have the legislation. What does the Bill say? It states that magistrates
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may make an order . . . which prohibits the defendant from doing anything described in the order.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will not it be tempting for a magistrate, or anyone else, when listening to the complainant and hearing evidence, to follow the advice of the local authority solicitor, who may be presenting the case, and take a broad-brush approach? He may say, ``I will make an order that prohibits the defendant from going to this housing estate.'' If there is no power in the Bill to make such an order, the Minister must tell me. If there is, it will be terribly easy for the magistrate, because such an order will sort out the problem indefinitely from the court's point of view.
<P>
Let me turn the Minister's mind to what happens in matrimonial injunctions, for example, and see whether the same difficulties raised by the Minister apply in such cases. No, they do not, because the courts are well able to frame injunctions to cover the situation in such cases. Let me give two examples. If in a matrimonial case a husband is returning to the home and beating up his wife or partner--or vice versa, for that matter--the wording of the injunction is always wide. It may read, ``The defendant''--or the respondent--``is restrained by his servants, or agents, or otherwise howsoever from assaulting, molesting or abusing the petitioner in any way.'' That is extremely wide and stops the conduct.
<P>
Let us also consider the example of a case in which a couple of young men are causing the inhabitants of a certain housing estate a lot of trouble. They may go there and behave disgracefully, but in a sub-criminal way--we all know what that means. The case then goes before a court for an anti-social behaviour order. Why cannot the court pass an order saying, ``The two defendants are prohibited from acting in a manner likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to persons present on the X housing estate''? The order would be plain and an obvious breach of it would take the defendants straight back to court. What if a defendant is causing individual harassment or distress to a certain person on that housing estate--perhaps a lady or gentleman who lives alone and is vulnerable? Why cannot the court make an order along the lines of, ``He is restrained by himself, his agents, or otherwise from abusing, assaulting, molesting or otherwise interfering with the quiet enjoyment of life of the occupants of No. 10 Smith Street''? The order could be made so wide that it covers the position.
<P>
The Minister cannot tell the Committee that it is important to have the wording so terribly wide in order not to permit the defendant to circumvent the court's order. It must be possible to draw up wording that is sufficiently wide to prohibit the mischief complained of but not so cumbersome as to represent a blanket exclusion from a whole area. The Bill allows a defendant to be prohibited from doing anything prescribed in the order. That must be wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Some of the hon. Gentleman's formulations go extremely wide and appear to have some of the dangers against which he argues. I should point out that the word ``anything'' is qualified by the requirement that prohibitions must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``necessary for the purpose of protecting persons . . . from further anti-social acts by the defendant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is more precision in our proposals than the hon. Gentleman gives us credit for.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Let me put it another way. I understand what the Minister is saying, but does he understand that it is terribly important not to have prohibition that is so wide that it will interfere with the normal daily life of a defendant who is behaving properly and legally?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The condition is there--the prohibitions must be necessary in order to prevent the anti-social behaviour. I thought that it was crystal clear. The hon. Gentleman is making a mountain out of a molehill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am concerned--as are my hon. Friends--about the wide scope of the wording. It is important to keep it as narrow as possible. Equally, I am very anxious for the Minister to recognise the need to ensure that whatever is in the order does not conflict with aspects of the defendant's life that are important to him, as set out in amendment No. 93.
<P>
It would have been right for the Minister to say that he would rethink these matters. I might have been inclined not to press my amendment to a Division if the Minister had said that he agreed that a genuine concern was being expressed and that he promised to consider whether the Government could come up with different wording. I would understand it if they could not do so, but the Minister would have acted in good faith if he were to ask his civil servants to reconsider the matter. If he genuinely felt that it was not possible and said, ``I am sorry that we cannot match what you want, but we have thought about it and are keen to take on your concerns'', that might have been enough for me. It is not a lot to ask. There are those in the Minister's Department who would be only too anxious to given further consideration to the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The decision on whether the amended version would be better than the original depends on the understanding of the word ``necessary'' in subsection (6). It is a simple argument of whether one has faith in its application. We retain some suspicion on its possible uses. It may not necessarily be a matter of what the Government intend, but how people apply the provision when the Bill is enacted. We are concerned that people will try to include prohibitions that are far wider than are strictly necessary. One person's ``necessary'' may be different from another's. Those who want to defend the rights of individuals living in difficult areas who have suffered harassment will, perhaps, have a tendency to be over-sympathetic and draw the prohibitions wider than is strictly necessary.
<P>
Given the lateness of the hour, I shall not continue to press the amendment, but we draw the Government's attention to our concern about the exact definition of the word ``necessary''. We are not questioning what is in the Bill, but wonder how that definition will be interpreted in the courts. That concern remains and we shall continue to keep the question open by monitoring the use of the order. I am sure that the Government would not want to impose wide prohibitions that go far beyond what is strictly necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am a little troubled by the Minister's response to two important points. I am becoming increasingly worried by the practicality of what we are being asked to agree to. We are in danger of leaving the courts--especially magistrates courts--in a difficult position by not making the Bill sufficiently clear on what we expect the courts to do. It is all very well to talk about guidance to local authorities, although the Government keep changing their mind as they go along. When magistrates have to apply the law in the courts they are left with what the Bill provides. Magistrates are complaining that they do not know what behaviour is covered by the Bill. They consider the concept of anti-social behaviour vague and they would prefer to have behaviour properly defined legally as it is in the Public Order Act 1986.
<P>
Magistrates will next have the problem of what to do with defendants. When the Minister was responding to my points relating to magistrates courts and how they should decide what prohibitions to impose, he was getting into deep water. He may now want to reconsider some of his remarks. If I understood him correctly, the hon. Gentleman said that if the magistrates find that anti-social behaviour had taken place, they will want to listen to the defendants and think about the effect of such behaviour on them before they decide what order to make. I think that that was the gist of what the Minister was saying, but I shall happily give way to him if he wants to rebut that and say that my interpretation is wrong.
<P>
I now direct the Minister's attention to what magistrates are asked to do under the Bill. If they find that anti-social behaviour has taken place, they are asked to impose prohibitions that are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``necessary for the purpose of protecting persons in the local government area from further anti-social acts by the defendant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Magistrates are not in the position of passing a sentence on the defendant as they would be in a criminal case, where they have to weigh up the seriousness of the offence and the effects on the defendant and consider if there was any mitigation and so on. The task of magistrates is merely to impose prohibitions that are necessary to protect the public. The Bill does not require them to consider the effects on the defendant. If they did, they would be getting into deep water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Stinchcombe </B>(Wellingborough): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Yes, I give way to the hon. Gentleman, because I know he is a member of Liberty and has an interest in the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stinchcombe:</B> The clause refers to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prohibitions that may be imposed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Has the hon. Gentleman overlooked the word ``may''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is the task with which magistrates are charged. They may impose prohibitions, but there is nothing about their considering the effects of that on the defendant. No guidance is given to them about it. The Minister even said that it would be possible for someone to be excluded from his home by the prohibitions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There are a number of theoretical possibilities that members of the Committee can turn to and say, ``Should not we prohibit this or that from coming within the prohibitions allowed by an order?'' I must re-emphasise my point. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) said, the word ``may'' is in the clause. I responded earlier on the need for courts to consider the impact on the defendants and not to be unreasonable.
<P>
Given that courts cannot have a cavalier attitude to what is necessary to protect the public, they must consider carefully--as do the police and the local authority--what is necessary to bring about what the anti-social behaviour order is intended to do, which is to protect the public from further such behaviour. Will the hon. Gentleman have regard to what I said earlier, because I am sure that I have given him the necessary assurance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The problem for the Minister and for the hon. Member for Wellinborough is that magistrates have such power. The word ``shall'' does not appear in the clause, so they are not obliged to take such action. They are given no guidance under the Bill on how to exercise that power. They are not told whether they can take into account the effects on the defendant. The Bill is silent on that matter.
<P>
The Bill is also silent on the matter of duration, which is another important point of practicality. I am worried about that, because we do not want the orders to hang about for ever and a day once they have served their purpose and are in danger of bringing someone into conflict with the law. I listened carefully to the Minister's argument about that and I was not entirely convinced by it.
<P>
The Minister illustrated some of the dangers of the Government's approach when he said that they had moved away from the approach taken in consultation paper. The paper stated that the normal duration for most orders could be for an indefinite period. We did not know that the Government had moved away from that position. It could be that one of their communications about such matters has escaped our attention. If that has happened, perhaps the Minister will tell us. However, the rest of the world was not to know about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> as my hon. Friend rightly says, the Minister has revealed that the Government have moved away from the consultation paper, but we do not know how far, nor on what basis. I am especially concerned because the draft guidance notes, which some of us received only today, contain a passage in brackets at the bottom of the first page which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It should be noted however that it''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
meaning the draft guidance--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``contains the intentions for how the provisions should operate in practice as discussed in Parliament.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Never mind the perculiarity of the grammar of that sentence, will my hon. Friend comment on the peculiarity of issuing guidance notes that supposedly contain the intentions for the operation of such orders before the Bill has been considered in Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am sure that any suggestion that the Government will not listen to the interesting and important points that we are making is entirely inadvertent. I would not suggest that the guidance had been definitively drafted in advance of debate in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) was out of the Room when that point was made. The sentence that he quoted is intended to reflect the fact that the guidance that is finally circulated will take account of debates in Committee. We have issued the first draft as early as possible so that members of the Committee have an opportunity not only to know the Government's thinking but to comment constructively on it. Indeed, several constructive comments have been made during today's debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate what the Minister says, and we shall not press some issues as strongly as others, but we have referred to some important practical defects in the Bill. The guidance is silent on the question of the duration of the orders. All we have to go on is what was in the consultation paper, so it is not surprising that we are concerned. Magistrates courts will be in a difficult position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend knows that until recently the courts refused to take into account what was said in parliamentary debates; they insisted that they had to deal solely with the wording of legislation. It seems that the courts were wise to take that attitude, because it demands a certain rigour of parliamentary draftsmen to draft legislation clearly. Clause 2(6) is a case in point.
<P>
I might be wrong, but, under clause 2(6), when a court finds, on the balance of probabilities, that anti-social behaviour has taken place, it must impose the prohibitions necessary to protect the public. Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that that places the onus on magistrates. Therefore, the Minister cannot say that magistrates will be able to take account of the defendant's circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Magistrates are being given a difficult task. We know that they find the concept of anti-social behaviour to be vague. In practice, they will face many difficulties, and the Committee would do well to consider that. I am not entirely satisfied with what the Minister has said, but I should be happy if the amendment were withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
