<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/101/1999101.htm">Referendums Bill</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Referendums Commission</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, [5 May], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Is it in order for us to remove our jackets?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> Suitably attired, Mr. Wells, I welcome you to Committee. On behalf of all Committee members, I must say that your presence assures us that we will be treated fairly but firmly, which we all appreciate.
<P>
Clause 1 (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission shall advise the Secretary of State and may make reports both on referendums in general and in relation to any referendum proposed by a Minister of the Crown under any enactment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state that the reports may deal with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the wording of any question to be put''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any other matters which the Commission believe require to be regulated in order to ensure fair conduct.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (6) states that the Secretary of State will lay the reports before Parliament and arrange for their publication.
<P>
Those provisions are somewhat vague and, I hazard to say, confusing. They appear, at least in part, to overlap with the additional provisions contained in clause 4. Clause 4(2) states that the commission should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``afforded a reasonable opportunity to report''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
on any legislative provision for a referendum before it is enacted. That appears to duplicate the provision in clause 1(5), which states that the commission
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may make reports ... in relation to any referendum proposed by a Minister of the Crown''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be clearer if all such provisions were brought together in one clause.
<P>
The power that would be conferred on the commission to make reports on ``referendums in general'' is very open ended. I assume that the broad purpose of subsection (5) is to provide the referendums commission with a basis for advising the Government and for making proposals for legislative change in relation to the conduct of referendums. That appears to be fine in principle, but the provisions give a one-dimensional picture of the role of the referendums commission. The conduct of referendums cannot sensibly be detached from the conduct of elections because many of the same rules apply. Interestingly, the Neill committee's report also recommended that an electoral commission should have a duty to advise the Government on the modernisation and revision of electoral law and that it should consult the commission before making or proposing changes relating to electoral law. The Government are currently considering carefully the possible functions of an electoral commission in that respect. Of course, the Government and Parliament would remain responsible for legislation. However, several matters need to be considered. For example, are there areas where it would be right for the Government to legislate only on the recommendation of the electoral commission or the referendums commission? An example might involve proposals to increase or to reduce the maximum amount of core funding to be made available to designated referendum campaigns. On the other hand, it may also be appropriate to ensure that such a commission is placed under a duty to examine particular questions at the request of the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): The Minister appears to be saying that because referendums and elections are similar, there could be one overseeing body. Surely, however, referendums and elections are fundamentally different. An election is about electing an individual, and a referendum is about testing a proposition. There is no reason why the two processes should be regulated by one body. It would be quite easy to have two separate bodies overseeing two separate aspects of community involvement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes his point reasonably well. I was not trying to make out that the similarity between a referendum and an election was as extensive as he suggested. However, there are common features. For example, those who qualify to vote in a referendum presumably do so on the basis of registering to vote in a general election. The process of identifying who is eligible to vote is the same in both cases. For example, counting arrangements will be very similar, even though a referendum involves counting who says ``yes'' and who says ``no''. Aspects of that process are similar to electoral law and should be consistent with it, although I accept that the two are not the same.
<P>
Subsection (5)(a) makes provision for the wording of the question to be addressed by the commission. The Neill committee did not make recommendations about the arrangements for setting a referendum question. The Nairne committee, however, saw a role for an independent commission in advising the Government on the wording of the referendum question, but recognised that the Government of the day would have to introduce legislation for any referendum that might be held. It therefore concluded that the wording of a referendum question was a matter for the Government and Parliament to decide.
<P>
Of course, it is vital that any referendum question or proposition is clear, concise and free from bias. That has been the case with the four referendums that we have held to date and will be the case with any that we hold in future. Take, for example, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum. What could be clearer than the two opposing propositions on the ballot paper? Those propositions were ``I agree that there should be a Scottish Parliament'' and ``I do not agree that there should be a Scottish Parliament''.
<P>
It is right that any proposed wording should be subject to proper debate and scrutiny by Parliament and the wider public. I would certainly welcome such debate and all contributors to it.
<P>
I have sought to make constructive observations on the clause, which is arguably the Bill's central provision. However, like the Bill as a whole, it is ill-conceived, seeking to establish a referendums commission for which there is no immediate role. Such a commission would operate in a vacuum and would soon be superseded by an electoral commission, so it would be kinder not to bring it into being.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1, as amended, order to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Designation of referendum campaigns</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 1, line 23, leave out `the introduction to Parliament' and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) in the case of a bill introduced by a Minister of the Crown, the first reading; and
<P>
(b) in the case of any other bill, the second reading
<P>
in the House of Parliament in which it is introduced'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 5, in page 1, line 23, leave out `introduction to' and insert `Second Reading in'.
<P>
No. 36, in page 1, line 26, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Nothing in subsection (1) shall prevent the Commission from inviting individuals or bodies to apply to be a designated referendum campaign in respect of a referendum before the second reading of any bill which provides for the holding of that referendum.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before I call the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), I should point out that matters raised by the amendments were debated at some length last week. However, I have decided, exceptionally, to allow a second debate, which I trust will be short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I take to heart your comments, Mr. Wells. Let me briefly welcome you to the Chair and proceed immediately to matters raised by amendments Nos. 5 and 36.
<P>
Following last week's debate and the exchange with the Minister that took place at 12.45 pm, I considered how to bring the commission into operation at different times via a Government Bill or private Member's Bill. Amendment No. 35 seeks to achieve that. It states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the case of a bill introduced by a Minister of the Crown'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the commission could swing into action on First Reading; otherwise, it would be at the conclusion of Second Reading. That would prevent a hare-brained proposal with no prospect of going beyond Second Reading from being validated and would prevent the commission's time being purposelessly taken up with business that is unlikely to lead to a referendum. Amendment No. 36 is linked to amendment No. 35.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston):</B> It was constructive of the hon. Gentlemen to go away and devise these amendments. In what circumstances does he envisage individuals triggering an application to the commission:
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> It is unlikely that an application by an individual would excite the interest of the commission, but it is right to leave that option open. A referendum campaign body might not have been set up, but although it had no formal structure, some prominent individual politicians could be its spokesmen. In those circumstances, there could be some advantage in allowing an individual to approach the commission.
<P>
I remain open-minded on the issue. It could be the result of lawyers' jargon that bodies and individuals are so often lumped together. If the current wording does not recommend itself to the Committee, we could strike out the reference to individuals: I would not lose more than two seconds' sleep over that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> My concern is precisely the point that the hon. Gentlemen raised. Not being a lawyer, I cannot be accused of resorting to lawyers' jargon. Under the present wording, could an extremely rich person with a chip on his or her should--the late Mr. Goldsmith, for example--press hard for a referendum and claim, ``By the way, there will be no cost to the public purse because I am going to pay for it.'' Might not the commission feel slightly inhibited by such an approach?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. It is possible to retain the trust of amendment No. 35 without amendment No. 36, which could be taken into account in voting on the amendments. Amendment No. 36 would confer a residual discretion on the commission--in that sense, we would trust the commission--to make value judgments in certain circumstances. One of those value judgments would be not to stir up barmy campaigns. If the Committee wants to give the commission that discretion, it would be wise to vote in favour of amendment No. 36 and to include individuals and bodies in the provision. If, on the other hand, the Committee does not want to confer that discretion, it might be wiser not to have amendment No. 36 at all.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) referred to the rich individual who comes along and says, ``I have £20 million and I think we should have a referendum campaign'', even though there is little public support. But the same argument could apply equally to a body. After all, setting up a body is not difficult. It needs only two or three similarly slightly barmy people. History shows that finding two or three people with barmy ideas is not difficult to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Or even 651.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister says even 651. As with the jury system, there is a slight hope that as the numbers expand, a certain amount of common sense may be injected into the proceedings. It is a perfectly valid point. Amendment No. 35 seems to address the issue that we discussed last week, so I am rather keen on it. Amendment No. 36 suggests a way of trying to give the residual discretion to the commission and if that is what the Committee wants it should vote for the amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): As the author of the original amendment No. 5, I should like to welcome amendment No. 35, proposed by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, which addresses the issues which we discussed at last week's sitting. I have only one query which reflects my lack of experience in the House. I imagine that it might not be common practice to distinguish between two types of Bill: those introduced by Ministers and the rest. If that is unusual, it might be an undesirable precedent from the point of view of the House of Commons which might wish to treat all legislation alike. I would be grateful for guidance from hon. Members with greater experience than mine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I cannot claim huge expertise on the procedure of the House, but I had an opportunity to discuss this with the Table Office Clerk. On the back of every Bill is a list of its proposer and supporters. Identifying a Minister of the Crown is a common practice. Government business appears as such and is thereby effectively the common responsibility of the Government because a Minister's name appear on the back of the Bill. It is common practice. I see the Minister nodding and I am grateful to him.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> In that case I support amendment No. 35. I will withdraw amendment No. 5, which is clearly inferior. Amendment No. 36 is also happily phrased. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, but the type of robust individual whom we all hope to appoint to the commission should be equal to the challenge of not inviting individuals or bodies who flash large sums of money at him. If that is not the case, we have a problem with the commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> These two amendments return to an issue which was the subject of some debate last week. Amendment No. 5 which my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) has just told us he intends to withdraw was debated last week, so I do not propose to say any more about it. However, he pointed out the difficulties that could arise with the present formulation in clause 2(1). Under that provision, the referendums commission is required to start up its machinery for the designation of referendum campaign organisations as soon as possible after any Bill providing for the holding of a referendum is introduced into Parliament.
<P>
From the point of view of the commission, it would make no difference if the Bill were a Government measure which had every prospect of reaching the statute book, or a private Member's measure, perhaps introduced under the ten-minute rule or the ``back of the Chair'' procedure, which had no realistic prospect of receiving a Second Reading, let alone Royal Assent. In the latter circumstances, there is a danger that the commission would be compelled to enter into a process and public money would be spent for no good purpose.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) has made some sensible alternative proposals. Amendment No. 35 draws a distinction between Bills introduced by a Minister of the Crown and all other Bills. Some hon. Members might take exception to such a distinction being made, but we must accept the reality of our parliamentary procedures. We can be reasonable confident that a Government Bill providing for a referendum to be held will reach the statute book, depending, of course, on parliamentary arithmetic. Consequently, it is appropriate for the procedure for the designation of a referendum campaign organisation to come into play as soon as possible after First Reading.
<P>
By contrast, we cannot be so confident that a private Member's Bill will be enacted, so it is right that there should be no obligation on the commission--be it a referendum commission or the proposed electoral commission--to begin the designation process before such a Bill has, at least, received Second Reading. Amendment No. 36 would give the commission the discretion to invite applications at an earlier stage, but it would not be compelled to do so.
<P>
Although the amendments go some way towards making the process envisaged by clause 2 more workable, it is still not without its flaws. Both the clause as currently drafted and the amendments assume that primary legislation will be the mechanism, in every case, by which statutory authority is conferred for the holding of a referendum. We already know from the provisions of schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 that that will not always be the case. Under schedule 1 of that Act, the Secretary of State may by order direct the holding of a poll for the purpose of determining any change in the status of Northern Ireland.
<P>
I accept that that provision was necessary because of the peculiar circumstances of Northern Ireland, so I mention it only for illustrative purposes. However, there could be other circumstances in which such an arrangement proves to be desirable or necessary, or both. We therefore need to provide for referendums being initiated by primary and secondary legislation.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on the amount of thought that he has given to a difficult subject. The amendments are a step in the right direction. I do not know whether they will form part of this Bill, but the hon. Gentlemen has given us food for thought. When the Government introduce legislation, we shall give careful consideration to his points. The debate has been helpful in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his kind words and for his view that the debate may stimulate future thought. However, the Committee cannot just look to the future; it must consider the present. I do not think that we would harm the Bill if we accepted the amendments. I am willing to put them to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Wells. May I seek your guidance? If amendments No. 36 is accepted, will there be a further debate on amendments No. 13, 14, 6, 15 and 17, or will they fall?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 13 comes before amendment No. 36 on the amendment paper, but I shall be calling it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> So there will be a debate on amendment No. 13?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Robathan </B>(Blaby): The issue has been well aired, and the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and the decision taken by the hon. Member for Broxtowe to withdraw amendment No. 5 are extremely sensible. I applaud them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 37 in page 1, line 24, after `referendum', insert `within the meaning of section (referendums to which sections 2 and 3 apply)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 4--Referendums to which sections 2 and 3 apply--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Sections 2 and 3 above apply where the bill which provides for the holding of the referendum--
<P>
(a) specifies those categories of person who may vote in the referendum (which may include persons not entitled to vote in a general election or may exclude persons entitled to vote in a general election);
<P>
(b) where the cost of the referendum is not to be met out of money provided by Parliament, specifies by whom the cost is to be met; and
<P>
(c) where the result of the referendum is not to be decided by a simple majority, specifies how the result is to be determined.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> On the cosmic scale of significance from zero to one million, the amendments rate about one and a half, so I shall not detain the Committee for long. The purpose of the amendments is to define a little more precisely what we mean by a referendum, and to identify the types of information that we would expect to be in a Bill authorising referendums.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 is purely a paving amendment to set up new clause 4, so I will concentrate on the latter. It suggests that in order to benefit from the provisions of the Referendums Bill, a Bill must satisfy three criteria: it must specify the categories of person who may vote in a referendum, by whom the cost of a referendum will be met, if not from money provided by Parliament, and how the outcome will be decided.
<P>
With the first, we are familiar with the fact that there are different electorates for different elections. For example, citizens of the European Union are not in the happy position of being able to vote for us, and people resident in more than one borough can vote in the local election of either but not in both, and so on. With the new clause, it would be necessary, when planning for a referendum, to specify who the electorate are. It would also be possible to specify the electorate for something less than a national referendum. I wish to make that clear because I believe that the framers of the Bill had in their minds national referendums--for instance, the euro referendum and the obvious recent example of the Scottish and Welsh referendums. It is highly desirable to be able to initiate the process under the heading of the Act for regional referendums and, in principle, it ought also to be possible for local referendums to be initiated on the basis of a Government Bill.
<P>
I have in mind the comprise proposed for the concept of fox hunting. As hon. Members are aware, it has been suggested that the Government might initiate some form of national policy that could be varied by referendum at country level. It would be essential for such referendums to be instituted by statute, and it seems desirable to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
<P>
I ran out of time the evening before last in the Chamber while attempting to define how we might trigger a referendum of that kind without actually specifying it in the Act. I invite the Minister to consider this aspect when he develops his own Bill on the subject and provide for the possibility of allowing for referendums to be generated other than by the Government--for example, by local councils.
<P>
Provision (b) of the new clause introduces the possibility that some or all of the costs of a referendum could be met by someone else. But this is not what we might call the Goldsmith's option, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred: it would be possible to envisage ways in which referendums could be triggered by organisations or groups collecting a sufficient number of signatures, provided that this did not put an intolerable burden on the public purse. I am thinking here of the American rather than the Swiss example. In the United States voters in many communities are given power to petition for a referendum. This practice has been widely used--especially in California, as one would expect. Constantly having to organise referendums leads to a considerable burden on local authorities. One might decide that a bond should be put down by the body organising the referendum to contribute to costs, and to make it clear that it is serious and not merely trying to take up public time. It would be useful to have such a measure in this legislation so that the Government, or any individual introducing a Bill, had that option.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Paragraph (c) of new clause 4 allows for the possibility that the outcome might not be a simple majority. That could occur, for example, in a referendum in which there could be several outcomes. Internationally, the way of coping with such situations is often to have an implicit two-round referendum. One would choose in the second round between the alternatives that were left after the first. We might decide to rank options one, two, three, four, for instance, and to use a procedure analogous to the single transferable vote system. We do not need to go into all the possibilities in the debate, but the Bill should take account of them.
<P>
The referendum might be deemed to be satisfactory only if a certain qualifying majority was reached--a two thirds majority might be required. It might be felt unsatisfactory for the abolition of the monarchy to be achieved by a majority of 50.1 per cent.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I have not found new clause 4 easy to follow, although the hon. Gentleman is explaining it fully, and I can see what he wishes to achieve. Does he feel that something in the Bill as currently drafted excludes such categories of referendum from coming within its ambit? My reading of the Bill suggests to me that such referendums will be covered, and that they do not need to be further defined in a new clause. I would be grateful to hear from him if I am wrong.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The Bill at present is undesirably vague on the nature of a referendum. It will be possible to introduce a Bill that refers to its object as a referendum, but which does not have any of the characteristic listed. That might then trigger considerable activity without meeting our expectations of a referendum.
<P>
New clause 4 is intended to act as a guide to hon. Members who wish in future to take advantage of this Bill to introduce a referendum. Basically, unless the hon. Member who introduces a Bill is willing to go to the trouble of defining details as suggested in the new clause, the commission that we propose to set up should not be troubled with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell </B>(Tatton): The point that the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) made about regional referendums, and his specific example of fox hunting, surely makes more urgent the case for having an Act on the statute book. We could not then say, ``We shall not have a referendum for many years,'' because we might. We should not fashion a craft only to torpedo it on launch; we should give it fair weather.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am too nervous of the Chair to enter into a discussion of that point, because it is not addressed directly at new clause 4, and I might be called up if I did.
<P>
A simple majority might also not suffice on the question of turnout. In eastern Europe, in particular, there is a tradition that referendums are considered valid only if the turnout is at 50 per cent. That has led to a good deal of grief in countries where Governments have attempted to introduce new legislation and have found that although they have a majority of 98 per cent. or thereabouts, only 31 per cent. of the electorate bothered to vote, and so the result is not valid. We may or may not consider that a good thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman therefore share the view of some that perhaps the validity of the Welsh referendum might be called into question because of the very small turnout?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That issue is not germane to the debate, and I would not encourage Dr. Palmer to pursue it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am concerned by the attempts of Conservative Members to filibuster the Bill, and drag out the debate with unnecessary interventions. [Laughter.]
<P>
To return to qualifying majorities, I think that is a question of balance. A radical change to the fabric of our constitution and society seems to require a more emphatic endorsement than, let us say, a 5 per cent. vote and a 51 per cent. majority. However, the requirement to act effectively means that we do not make the process of a referendum unreasonably difficult. Fortunately, we do not have to consider that issue now, but simply whether we wish to require anyone who introduces a Bill of this type to address the issue that is before us. It should not be left to the commission, and it should not be left open by default.
<P>
I think that that suffices for this relatively minor new clause, but I should welcome comments from other members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the hon. Member for Broxtowe clarify something, largely for Pepper v. Hart purposes? I want something on the record that makes it clear what his intention is. In relation to new clause 4(b)--should that survive the Committee's inspection--I hope that the hon. Gentleman intends the wording clearly to mean that sections 2 and 3 would also apply where the cost of the referendum was to be met out of money provided by Parliament. I take that to be the implication, but it is not spelt out in the hon. Gentleman's proposal. It would be useful to have the hon. Gentleman's clarification on the record.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) for inviting me to clarify that point. I absolutely agree that that is the intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend on attempting to set out this point in new clause 4. I admit, with some candour, that I copped out of that in new clause 1, which I shall not refer to as it was not selected for debate. It is a very complicated issue, which is why I passed the buck to my hon. Friend the Minister to draft regulations.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe has had a good stab at the issue that concerned me. He referred to the referendums that take place as part of the electoral process in the United States. A few years ago, as part of the British-American Parliamentary Group, I was privileged to be in Seattle when local elections were taking place. As part of the very complicated ballot paper--if colleagues here thought that last week's ballot papers were complicated, they should have seen the Seattle one--a series of local constitutional questions was placed in front of the electorate, as happens in referendums.
<P>
I think that this is a powerful tool. I can think of a local example, which is also relevant to the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell). In Cheshire, we are faced with a situation in which the county council is seeking to make cuts in the provision of homes for the elderly. The council argues that there is insufficient money for it to do otherwise. In America, the approach is more positive. A school board or fire authority may say as part of a referendum campaign, ``This is the situation facing us: we need to modernise this service and we therefore invite the local electorate to contribute another penny to the local rates.'' That kind of opportunity could emerge from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I shall give way to the promoter of the Bill first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders), who was probably about to make a similar point to mine. Although it is an interesting idea that referendums may have a part to play in local government, it is unlikely that any such referendums would come before this Parliament. If a county council in Cheshire wished to have a referendum, that would be up to it rather than to this Parliament, and the Bill concerns this Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I accept that. However, the principle of the commission is that it will set standards that local government, when engaging in referendums, will hopefully follow. The hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) is of course right to say that he intends the Bill, technically speaking, to be about central Government, but it does not actually say so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> Clause 2(1) begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As soon as possible after the introduction to Parliament of any bill which provides for the holding of a referendum.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not therefore talking about local government referendums at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I do not accept that the Bill, viewed in its entirety, could constrain us to matters such as a Bill passed by the House of Commons to conduct a referendum on the euro. For example, every year a Bill allocates money to local authorities. Surely that could trigger questions being posed--
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> It is fundamentally undesirable to have two types of referendum--one that is covered by the referendums commission, which will supervise proceedings and ensure that they are conducted in a way that we would be proud of, and one for disreputable local referendums with all sorts of peculiar proceedings in which we in Parliament take no interest. We should be encouraging local authorities and other bodies to bring their referendums under the scope of the Bill. I appreciate the hon. Member for Blaby's point that that situation is not currently envisaged.
<P>
As I said earlier, I ran out of time on Monday night when drafting an amendment that would provide for trigger legislation to enable local authorities and other bodies to initiate referendums on the basis of an Act of Parliament. I should like the debate on the new clause to inform future discussions of the matter so as to determine whether it is desirable in principle that local authorities should also follow these measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> My hon. Friend puts in far more lucid terms the point that I was trying to make--that although the promoter of the Bill does not believe that it extends to more local issues, perhaps it should do so.
<P>
The new clause that was tabled by Dr. Palmer--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is customary to refer to hon. Members by their constituencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Wells. I have been here long enough to know better.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe--I must ask him where Broxtowe is--referred to subsection (c) of the new clause, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the result of the referendum is not to be decided by a simple majority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I envisage referendums in which it is possible to have complex multiple questions. That seems to require a definition of how the result is to be determined. My hon. Friend gave a fairly extreme analogy, but in certain circumstances one would need to define a qualifying majority; for the commission not to have that power would be a major weakness.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> May I take this opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Wells. I know that all the welcomes get a bit tedious, but I am delighted, as always, to see you here.
<P>
I shall respond to several points made by the hon. Members for Broxtowe and for Ellesmere Port and Neston. The hon. Member for Broxtowe has tabled a sensible amendment and new clause, and the spirit behind his comments is commendable. I would not say that about every amendment that has been tabled, but it is true of this group.
<P>
I am not sure about the phrase, ``when the monarchy is subjected to a referendum''; I see no appetite for a referendum on the monarchy, and I shall certainly not be pursuing one.
<P>
My concern is that the amendment and new clause would make the Bill unnecessarily complicated and prescriptive. The hon. Member for Broxtowe said that the Bill was undesirably vague, but I disagree. The point of setting up an elections commission or referendums commission is to give that commission some leeway in determining what it is that has been decided. For example, the majority that must be in favour, whether the turn-out has to be 50 per cent., 60 per cent. or whatever, can be written into the legislation for any referendum. That is entirely fair. Indeed, it was done in 1978 in the referendums on Scottish and Welsh devolution, which in my opinion had a commendable result.
<P>
Similarly, the categories of people allowed to vote can be determined either by the legislation or by the electoral commission. It can be made plain at the time who should be able to vote. The point about European Union citizens is entirely reasonable. However, that factor should not necessarily be on the face of the Bill because it would detract from the Bill's principle and involve detail that should be given to an elections or referendums commission.

<P>

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am not suggesting that we should attempt to define those matters in the Bill, but that we should require hon. Members introducing a Bill for a specific referendum to lay down such requirements. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that some of those issues could be delegated to the commission--that it might decide, for example, who is entitled to vote?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I think that there must, as always, be a balance between the referendums commission's quasi-judicial function and Parliament as a legislative body. If Parliament determines that there must be a turnout of 60 per cent. or whatever, obviously that will be in the relevant Bill. If it does not, the commission might wish to advise--that is the word that the Bill uses--on that aspect. I suspect that it would not, but that is up to Parliament and the commission. It should not be the role of the Committee to state exactly what must be done in all respects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> May I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Wells.
<P>
I would point out to the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan)--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not entirely clear as to whether the hon. Member for Blaby has given way to an intervention or whether he has finished speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I apologise. I think that I am still speaking. I am not used to leading for the Opposition in Standing Committees and I do not necessarily intend to become used to it.
<P>
Such matters are best dealt with either by Parliament, which must express its intention on each referendum, or by the commission, whose role it will be to consider and advise. After Second Reading, the commission may express its view on the number of people needed to turn out or the majority required in the referendum.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has allowed me to interrupt him again. In the Bill it is proposed only that the commission may advise on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any other matters which the Commission believe require to be regulated in order to ensure fair conduct.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Questions such as who could participate or the minimum percentage to allow a vote to be passed are more political judgments than judgments about fair conduct. It would be difficult for the commission to advise on such questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I do not entirely agree, although that is a sensible point. Apart from the fact that the Bill cannot constrain Parliament, it is reasonable that such matters should be discussed and determined by Parliament, and by the advice of the commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman feel that the commission would be better served by having its powers defined, so that it does not become a puppet, as it were, of the Parliament or Government of the day? Would not it be better if Parliament were to set out the commission's scope and remit now? The commission would then be much freer to act in relation to particular Bills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not agree with his line of argument. Far from preventing the commission from becoming a puppet, the new clause would make it unduly ``prescripted'' if that is the right word. I would rather that the commission had some latitude. I shall return to that point in a moment.
<P>
Costs should be met from public funds. If for some specific referendums, it were determined that costs should be met differently, that would be reasonable. The Bill provides for costs to be met from public funds. Parliament has no way of determining who else might meet those costs, unless through some form of primary legislation to determine how local government should spend its money.
<P>
That brings me to the point about local government made by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. The Bill contains nothing about local government. If the good burghers of Cheshire, through their county councillors, want to hold a referendum on, say, the allocation of custard tarts to every school child in Cheshire--or, indeed, on fox hunting in Cheshire--that is entirely up to them. It is not for me, as a Member representing a Leicestershire constituency, or for Parliament, to determine what is done. It is up to the good citizens of Cheshire to throw such an absurd county council out later if they want to.
<P>
The Bill cannot prescribe for every referendum. I entirely accept that it can set standards, but it cannot determine what is done by Cheshire or Leicestershire county council. That is a red herring.
<P>
What concerns me about the new clause and the amendment is that they may deflect us from the central thrust, which is, as the hon. Member for Tatton said, the fact that we want democracy in practice. If we hold referendums, we want democracy to be practised. I am happy to leave decisions about setting thresholds for votes and so on to Parliament in its wisdom--it is not always wise, but this Committee may not always be wise, either--and to a commission that will be a great deal more impartial, and possibly, from time to time, wiser.
<P>
The hon. Member for Broxtowe said that the Bill was undesirably vague. If we accept the new clause, it may become undesirably prescriptive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I repeat my welcome to you as Chairman, Mr. Wells, and I apologise to the hon. Member for Blaby for misinterpreting the fact that he allowed me to intervene. He had made so many strong points that I could not imagine that there were any more to come.
<P>
I take issue with the hon. Member for Blaby on one point. The Bill is perhaps wider in scope than he intended. Clause 1(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission shall advise the Secretary of State and may make reports both on referendums in general and in relation to any referendum proposed by a Minister of the Crown under any enactment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred to Seattle, and gave an example of a local government referendum. Although I was not present during that election, I imagine that one of the propositions put involved the Seattle housing authority, which was asking for a bond for extra money. That is a way of financing public expenditure paid for by local ratepayers. Such a referendum would not be possible under the English system of local government, so it is unnecessary to take the suggested route, which is something of a red herring.
<P>
While listening to the debate on new clause 4, I warmed to subsections (b) and (c). Conditions could arise in which an outside non-governmental organisation wishes to test a proposition. I see no reason why that should be stopped. If a public company or a local community group wishes to test a proposition, it should be able to do so, so long as it can meet the costs of the referendum. I take on board the point of subsection (c), and agree that a simple statement of yes or no may not be adequate to test a proposition. A system of single transferable votes, or preferential voting, may be necessary to reach a conclusion.
<P>
I am concerned to emphasise that we are debating detail. I hope that the only benefit of that debate will be to give a lead to the Minister on what is required in the Government's Bill rather than on what the Committee can achieve. I also hope that he will seriously take on board what is said in the Committee, the amendments that have been tabled and the arguments for and against them. I am concerned that we may argue about points in a way that will simply waste time. I encourage hon. Members who see their role as keeping things moving to make their comments a little shorter. I shall shut up now.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I begin by apologising to the hon. Member for Blaby for having to leave the Room briefly during his speech. It was necessary for me to do so and it was no reflection on the riveting points that he was making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I take it personally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman takes it personally. The hon. Member for Torbay concluded his remarks by asking me to take seriously our debates on the new clause, on other amendments and on other aspects of the Bill. I hope that I made clear last Wednesday that I welcome our proceedings for that reason. Although I do not think it sensible to proceed with the Bill, for reasons that I gave earlier, I believe that we are in an important process triggered by the Neill Committee recommendations. Although the Committee has a serious parliamentary purpose, it also has the wider purpose of enabling hon. Members to listen to the arguments and test some of the propositions in the Bill. That process is useful and will read directly across into the development of the legislation that will address the Neill Committee's recommendations. That will happen before the summer recess.
<P>
The idea behind the new clause is that although not all referendums will necessarily be initiated directly by an Act of Parliament, Parliament may nevertheless wish to legislate to provide general statutory authority for the holding of referendums on particular issues at, for example, local level. Such referendums would then be initiated locally, and their costs must be borne locally. However, the effect of the clause would be as follow: provided that the Act that authorised the initiating of such polls made provision for the relevant franchise, the funding arrangements and the means of determining the outcome--if that is to be done other than by a simple majority--the referendums commission would be required to invite and consider applications for designated referendum campaign status in respect of such polls, as my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made clear.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The new clause that my hon. Friend has proposed raises an interesting issue, as the hon. Member for Torbay conceded. It is certainly possible that Parliament could pass enabling legislation to provide the legal basis for other authorities to initiate the holding of referendums on particular issues. I believe that my hon. Friend had in mind in particular the scope for making such provision for the holding of referendums on fox hunting.
<P>
However, I do not think that he mentioned that example, although I may have missed it. It was perhaps lurking somewhere in the back of his mind. It is likely that such enabling legislation would only ever provide for the holding of referendums at very local level. As hon. Members will be aware, the Deputy Prime Minister has made it clear that he intends to introduce proposals to provide for consultative referendums on issues of local controversy and for binding referendums on directly elected mayors. I will say more about that in a minute.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Does the Minister agree that it is desirable for such referendums to be covered by the activities of the commission--whether we set up an electoral or a referendums commission--rather than for there to be a second-class referendum?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will come to that point in a few moments. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston gave an example from Cheshire, and I am sure that we could all think of similar examples from our own constituencies of issues in regard to which such an arrangement would have been appropriate or might be appropriate in the future.
<P>
I caught the eye of my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) a few moments ago. He will remember a proposal for an incinerator that was made about 10 years ago which affected both of our constituencies. He and I campaigned against it. Such a development, which generates great controversy and public concern, might well be an example of a matter on which a consultative referendum would be useful. However, that raises all sorts of possibilities about the planning process and appeal procedures, which I do not propose to go into too deeply today. I am sure that you would not want me to do that, Mr. Wells.
<P>
Although this has no direct relevance, I will, for the assistance of the Committee and with your indulgence, Mr. Wells, say a few words about my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's proposals for local government. The draft local government organisation and spending legislation, which includes provision for local referendums on directly elected mayors, was published in March. Subject to the availability of parliamentary time, we expect the legislation to be in force before the next general election. [Interruption.] I suspect that a referendum campaign may be going in the Palace, judging by the noise that is being generated outside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Is my hon. Friend responsible for fire safety?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am.
<P>
Councils should see referendums as an important tool to give local people a bigger say. The Government are therefore committed to introducing legislation when parliamentary time permits to confirm the power of councils to hold consultative referendums. Councils may want to use referendums to consult local people on such issues as major local developments or matters of particular local controversy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> I read with considerable interest what the Minister said in the Committee's first sitting. He has just mentioned that the Government have plans to introduce legislation when parliamentary time permits. Does the Bill not provide an opportunity to deal with several such matters? I am astonished that the Minister says that he needs parliamentary time, but that he and his Government are not using the opportunity that the Bill provides to introduce such changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I could be tempted to repeat what I said in our previous sitting and in response to the hon. Member for Torbay a few moments ago. With your indulgence, Mr. Wells, and as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) has raised the matter, I shall explain our position. The Government have every intention of introducing legislation to deal with all the recommendations of the Neill committee, and intend to publish a draft Bill. I have strong reservations about this Bill because, as the Neill committee said, we should deal with its recommendations as a package because they interconnect.
<P>
I do not want to be negative about what we are involved in. As I said in response to the hon. Member for Torbay a few moments ago, we are part of a process. Regardless of whether the Bill reaches the statute book, what we have done in this Committee will not have been a waste of time. Arguments have been advanced and debated, which is useful.
<P>
The new clause appears to contain a contradiction. Under subsection (b), clauses 2 and 3 would apply if the relevant legislation specified how the cost of the referendum would be borne if it were not met out of money provided by Parliament. However, if the costs of the referendum were not met out of money provided by Parliament, would it not be inappropriate for the referendums commission to consider the allocation of core funding under clause 3? My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe might want to deal with that contradiction when he returns.
<P>
The detail of the new clause reflects the fact that many of the arrangements governing the conduct of a referendum will need to be specified in the legislation providing for it. The Nairne committee's report explored in some detail the scope for generic provision that might allow a referendum to be held with minimal further legislation.
<P>
The new clause shows some of the difficulties involved in trying to make such generic provision. Inevitably, the important issues may vary between one referendum and another. That difficulty lies at the heart of what my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe is trying to explore, but is an issue that we must resolve.
<P>
It has been useful to raise the issue in this way. It has certainly given me food for thought on how such arrangements might work. I suspect that it may give my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister food for thought about the precise arrangements that he is making. The general intention is clear and welcome, but we must consider how in precise detail it will work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am sympathetic to what the hon. Member for Broxtowe is trying to achieve with new clause 4, but he may be in danger of clouding the issue slightly. The reality is that Parliament decides that there shall be a referendum, and, to use Alice-in-Wonderland language, the referendum is that which Parliament decides to hold for the purpose that it decides. New clause 4 therefore introduces a definition that is not required because it is already covered in the Bill.
<P>
The second possibility to which I am alive is that referendums will be used on a much more widespread basis for a host of Parliament-sanctioned local matters; such referendums may be confined to an area, a category of electorate or a wider than normal electorate. If that is to happen, there will have to be parliamentary legislation to set up the framework under which local authorities, regions or whatever have the power to present such referendums. It will not at that stage be difficult to state whether such referendums come within the ambit of the Bill. I do not foresee a problem because if we go outside the previously narrow scope of referendums, the legislation provides for a decision to be made on whether a referendum should be subject to it.
<P>
Although, as the Minister said, new clause 4 stimulates discussion and is an important topic, I am not sure that it is necessary to achieve our objectives. On the basis that simplicity is the mother of good legislation, I suggest that we do not include it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to hon. Members for giving the clause such detailed scrutiny and for having increased its cosmic size to about two and three quarters.
<P>
The comments of the hon. Member for Blaby reveal the philosophical difference that we encountered earlier. He is anxious to leave a fair amount of leeway to the commission to act as it thinks fit in the context of a particular referendum, while I am anxious to protect the commission from an overtly political role.
<P>
It is fundamentally desirable that Parliament should specify the three points in new clause 4. Those points should never be left vague in a referendum proposed by Parliament; I hope that the Bill will be so convincing that people will wish to bring their referendums under it. I am therefore using the Bill to encourage hon. Members to address the issues instead of leaving them to the judgment of the commission, which might be required to go into various political or partisan matters in which it would be better not involved.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Minister raised the possible contradiction--he will correct me if I have misunderstood--that while subsection (b) of the new clause envisages the possibility that Parliament will not meet the cost of a referendum, clause 3 makes extensive provision for Parliament to meet costs. However, the costs referred to in clause 3 are those of campaigns, while those in subsection (b) are those of administering the referendum; perhaps I did not make that sufficiently clear. I gave the example of the American experience. We could be deluged with referendums at significant cost to local authorities that might wish to spend the money elsewhere. Does my hon. Friend the Minister want to comment on that?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am grateful for that clarification as to what my hon. Friend intended. As I understand it, his interpretation of the effect of the provisions is correct. The contradiction that I described was on the assumption that he meant something else.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I see. I am grateful for clarification, too.
<P>
I am in two minds about the issue raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. I appreciate that Occam's razor, as applied to legislation, would require us not to gabble on at length about all sorts of extraneous issues. On balance, I feel that it is desirable that rather fundamental issues, such as who can vote, how the outcome is decided and who will pay, should be determined as part of any referendum. I am not sure that we should leave that to the discretion of the commission or any other body involved.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston pointed out, we cannot bind Parliament to do things; it can pass Acts as it thinks fit. We can, however, specify under what circumstances it can benefit from the Bill, which will be convenient for hon. Members in future. They will be able to say with one sentence that the detailed execution of a Bill is covered by what will by then be the Referendums Act 1999, so we have the opportunity to influence their behaviour when introducing legislation on referendums. Although I seriously considered withdrawing the amendment, I think that I will press it. By what might be said to be a 51 per cent. majority, I feel that it would constructively help the content of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I listened with great interest to the arguments from all parts of the Committee. The purpose of having a Committee to discuss such matters is to air the clauses and, naturally, to alter them when that is felt to be worthwhile. Several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Broxtowe, have made sensible arguments and although I favour simplicity I am not opposed to what he said. Indeed, he has a budding career as a parliamentary draftsmen following the next election.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 1, line 25, leave out `individuals or'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 14, in page 2, line 1, leave out `shall' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may if it thinks fit'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 6, in page 2, line 1, leave out `one individual or body' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`one or more individuals or bodies'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 15, in page 2, line 1, leave out `individual or'.
<P>
No. 17, in page 2, line 3, leave our `individual or'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> We touched on some of my arguments in our debate on the relevance of the word ``individual'', so I shall not repeat what I said. However, it seems that the Bill as it stands would allow the referendums commission to designate an individual rather than an organisation as a referendum campaign. I think that that would universally be agreed to be unacceptable. As I am not a lawyer I shall not argue that case, but we must be wary about the risk of the Goldsmith scenario that I described earlier. It seems difficult to envisage any circumstances in which such a scenario could be right. A single individual is most unlikely to meet criteria set out in subsection (2), such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the ability to conduct an effective campaign'' and enjoy a good ``degree of public support''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that his concerns would not be met simply by  reference only to a ``body''? ``Individuals or bodies'' should remain, because surely a group of individuals can constitute a proper campaign. Individuals should not be required to form themselves into a body corporate or organisation in order to apply to be a designated referendum campaign.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am not sure whether I agree with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath--I almost said Blackpool again, thinking of his former constituency. A risk has been recognised under recent legislation governing the conduct of elections that individuals, whether single or in disparate groups, can create great mischief if they are given the powers that are implicit in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Does my hon. Friend believe that ``body'' has a well defined meaning? An individual is a body, as is a group of individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> We are getting into semantics that are far beyond me. While the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, in his previous career in the courts, and my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, as a distinguished academic, may be able to have exchanges on that point, I would be in some difficulty.
<P>
Under the Bill, there are organisations and individuals. If we are to leave it as it stands, without it being precise or saying to the commission that it is excluding the Goldsmith scenario, we would be doing a disservice to the commission and the electorate. The concept developed in Neill is that of an umbrella organisation, which could comprise individuals. It could bring together several bodies or individuals. That happened in the last year's Scottish referendum campaign. Such groups would be on either side of the argument.
<P>
Is that the promoter of the Bill's intention? I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who has the benefit of guidance from an expert draftsman on such matters, whether the Bill says that. I think that it states something that is potentially unhelpful. My second point about amendments Nos. 13, 15 and 17 is that a single individual could not fulfil the role that clause 3 envisages in respect of broadcasting. A conflict would arise between an individual and the context of clause 3(2).
<P>
I shall deal with amendment No. 14. Clause 2(2) lists the criteria that the commission must take into account in deciding which individual or body should be designated as representing the official referendum campaign. Several bodies might want to be the umbrella organisation. For example, if the various pro-devolution and anti-devolution organisations had not reached agreement, theoretically more than two bodies could have sought to campaign in last year's Scottish referendum. The commission must have the power to determine which of those who apply has the right bona fides. Under the Bill, the commission will have no choice but to designate one or other organisation from either side. I wonder whether that is the right way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am interested by what the hon. Gentleman says. I recognise that he has a point. However, he may want to comment on the fact that, curiously, the Government have moved towards saying that a body must be designated for the yes vote and another for the no vote, otherwise a referendum cannot be operated properly. In the amendment, the hon. Gentleman proposes to move away from that trend and give the commission discretion. Therefore, the commission might simply wash its hands of such matters and designate no organisation. Therefore, much of the Bill's purpose would be lost. How would the hon. Gentleman deal with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am genuinely trying to explore that point. Although I am an extremely strong supporter of the Government, the hon. Gentleman will know that I have tabled amendments that do not have their support. Such matters need to be explored. The hon. Gentleman says that he recognises the point that I am making. In saying that, he recognises that such matters should be debated.
<P>
I am not sure that the Bill has got it right. If it is possible that none of the applicants will meet the criteria set out in subsection (2), should not that possibility be allowed for? That may not be likely in a referendum on the euro, which many Conservative Members would like to hold tomorrow, but the Bill is not confined to that; it is much broader.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I have lost track of what the hon. Gentleman is trying to say. The criteria are not binary; they express continua. In each case, the commission must consider the ability of the applicant to conduct an effective campaign, the views of the party and the extent of public support, for example. Inevitably, one, two or more bodies or individuals will have varying abilities, public support and so on. It would be impossible to have a vacuum in which nobody had any public support or any ability to conduct an effective campaign. Anybody, other than a cow, has some ability. The commission merely has to choose the best one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am not sure that I can agree with that point, although the hon. Gentleman puts it forcefully. Small, unrepresentative groups might press for a referendum on a particular Bill. The Government may take a contrary view. As I said earlier, I am concerned about constraining the commission to act in direct concert with the Government of the day. There is a much more powerful argument to create a body that is slightly removed. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can disagree that there could be circumstances in which none of the applicants meet the criteria.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is clearly looking at a different subsection. There can be no circumstances in which somebody who is articulate enough to make an application has not some ability--however nugatory--to conduct a campaign. There is no circumstance in which the commission will be unable to take into account the views of political parties, because that could include taking into account the fact that political parties have no views. There is no possibility of there being no degree of public support, because the applicant is at least a degree of public support. Such other matters as the commission considers relevant includes no other matters. Therefore, I cannot see what the hon. Gentleman is on about.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> In his opening remarks, the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that the designation could be down to an individual or a small group of individuals. They may not be representative, and given that the running of the body, and indeed the running of campaigns, could incur significant sums of public expenditure, the Bill would be a hostage to fortune if constraints were not included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has forgotten that we are discussing solely the possibility that the referendum has been occasioned either by the Government introducing a Bill, in which circumstance it is inconceivable that what the hon. Gentleman is talking about would apply, or because Parliament has given the Bill a Second Reading. I do not understand what the hon. Gentleman is worrying about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I accept that they are narrow circumstances. That is why I said that I would not spend much time on the clause, but the hon. Gentleman has tempted me to go further. It must be considered whether it is necessary, in all cases, to give a grant to a referendum campaign. If it is already amply funded by private contributions, one should ask whether any public money should be involved--certainly not in the context of the narrowly individually sponsored body, if the word ``individuals'' remains.
<P>
We are aiming for a system that creates fairness for both sides. The hon. Member for Blaby criticised the Welsh referendum as being biased and one-sided in terms of access to resource. I apologise if it was not him who said that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. I did say that because Lord Neill made that point forcefully in his report, and we are trying to enact his recommendations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> The hon. Gentleman's last remark is extremely helpful. I want to explore these seemingly narrow issues and to ensure that we end up giving guidance to the Minister on the issues that the Neill report raised.
<P>
The essential feature is fairness, which may possibly be achieved by giving a grant to one side, but not the other. We do that in other areas of publicly contested issues. Sometimes it works extremely well, but sometimes it is extremely worrying,--for example, the way in which the legal aid formula works. I shall not be drawn on that, because it is not germane. However, it would not injure the basic scheme and it could save public money if the commission were given that discretion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall not detain the Committee. I see absolutely no merit in amendment No. 14. It comes perilously close to being a wrecking amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> It would not have been selected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes, but by mistake it comes close. It provides for the possibility of nobody being chosen to represent either side of the campaign, in which case the Bill would fall away as a piece of useless legislation. That may be a mistake. I think that the hon. Gentleman was trying to solve a problem that does not exist--namely, the hypothetical problem of there being nobody who fulfilled the criteria. However, as I have demonstrated in interventions, the criteria are by necessity fulfilled in any event, so the clause is at best nugatory and at worst destructive.
<P>
The other amendments deal with individuals. I should explain that when my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby and I were considering the text, we intended to resolve a problem that might otherwise have arisen. A body could be chosen by the commission in preference to another body. I remind the Committee that we chose one body rather than many under the helpful inspiration and guidance of the Minister. The choice between two bodies on one side or both sides of the referendum campaign might be hotly contested  and a body could be chosen that happened not to be a body corporate.
<P>
As I understand it, bodies corporate are clearly bodies, but bodies that are unincorporated may or may not be bodies, and no one knows whether they are until the matter is tested in court. The body that was not chosen could therefore contest the choice of the body that had been chosen on the ground that it was not a body. That could be the start of prolonged, wholly unnecessary and time-wasting litigation, thereby fulfilling what I fear may be the Government's intention. [Laughter.] I fear that some members of the Government, but perhaps not the Minister, intend to hide it in the long grass, but I do not want to assist in that ignoble attempt.
<P>
We want there to be not the slightest doubt that once the commission, which is a worthy body, has chosen somebody--in the ordinary acceptance of ``somebody'', and regardless of whether they are incorporated--as the proper designated referendum campaign, no other entity should be able on spurious grounds to challenge whether the body that has been chosen is a body. The phrase ``individuals or bodies'' solves the problem, because any ``thing'' that has been chosen must contain some human beings. We do not want cats being chosen and the Committee will not chose them.
<P>
It is a purely technical matter, but it is of some importance. I therefore hope that my hon. Friends and others who wish the Bill to progress, will vote against the amendment. Better still, the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston might recognise the error of his ways and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> After the contribution of the hon. Member for West Dorset, the Committee is strewn with bodies. It may help the hon. Gentleman and the Committee if I explain the wording of clause 2, which has generated much debate.
<P>
Clause 2 would allow the commission to invite
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``individuals or bodies to apply to be a designated referendum campaign in respect of that referendum.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A Bill usually refers to a person who, in legal terms, might be an individual or a body. The Bill does not use that form of words, and that is why it has allowed some scope for the debate that we have just had. I do not say that to be critical; it is merely that the Bill's wording has allowed us some scope for debating its exact meaning. That is why the word ``body'' was mentioned four or five times in each sentence in the brief contribution of the hon. Member for West Dorset. I do not want to make too much of that.
<P>
It might help if I deal first with amendments Nos. 13, 15 and 17, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. Clause 2 provides for the consideration of applications for designated campaign status from both individuals and bodies, as I mentioned a moment ago. Subsection (2) requires the proposed referendums commission to take into account a number of criteria. It is difficult to envisage that any one individual could meet those criteria, so I understand why the Bill's promoter, the hon. Member for Blaby, believed that to be a suitable formulation.
<P>
We need to consider precisely what sort of application is most likely to secure designation as a referendum campaign. The Bill suggests that the candidate should be able to mount a successful campaign. That is a sensible starting point.
<P>
It is also to be expected that the applicant should represent a broad range of opinion on one side of a referendum campaign. Again, that seems a fairly obvious assumption. This will be evidenced by the support of one or more political parties and a degree of public support. In practice, that is likely to mean an umbrella campaign organisation which draws together and co-ordinates the views and activities, during the course of the campaign, of a spectrum of groups and individuals under a broad banner. The precedent is the 1975 referendum, when grants were made to two umbrella organisations, namely Britain in Europe and the National Referendum Campaign.
<P>
It is possible that a single individual will be in the forefront of pulling a campaign organisation together. In fact, it is more than possible. It is likely that one individual will spearhead a campaign or come to represent it, articulating the argument and directing the organisation. That is not to say that a committee or some organisation will not be pulled together for that purpose, but it is in the nature of these matters that, one person takes a leading role.
<P>
The organisation, not the individual, is accorded designated referendum campaign status. There is the danger that making provision to grant core funding to individuals will encourage applications from individuals whose campaigns amount to personal crusades and do not reflect wider public opinion. It would be better not to encourage expectations that such applications stand any chance of success.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 13, 15 and 17 would delete the references in the Bill to individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> May we focus on this issue? Clearly, we will be guided by the advice that the Minister receives. Does he see any problem with bodies corporate and unincorporate? I know from the limited knowledge gained through my legal practice, that that question has historically been a fertile field for disputes about what status a body might have. I do not remember what status the referendum campaigns in 1975 had. If there is doubt about that question, is that not a good reason for leaving in the word ``individuals'' to allow for such a possibility? That would seem to be the real issue of the debate.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My advice is that that would not necessarily be a good idea because it would leave room for doubt, and we might give some people the expectation that an application might be appropriate under the Bill. I do not think that that is the intention of the hon. Member for Blaby.
<P>
I am loth to get involved in a discussion about bodies incorporated and unincorporated. We do not envisage that that issue will cause a particular problem, and we need have no great concern about that.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston that the present wording of clause 2(2) will force a scheme upon the referendums commission that may not be appropriate. As my hon. Friend made clear, the purpose of the proposed arrangements is to ensure a fairly conducted campaign by ensuring that each side is provided with core funding. However, the circumstances of a particular referendum may demand flexibility in the allocation of core funding if we are to achieve true fairness. The unintended effect of the provisions may be to box the commission into making decisions that do not serve the purpose of fairness. That is the fear that my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston mentioned in reference to new clause 4, and it requires attention.
<P>
Clause 2(2) requires that the commission certify one individual or body as the designated campaign for each possible outcome of the referendum campaign. That makes sense on the face of it. Clause 3(1) requires that each side receives core funding. Members of the Committee might recall that the Neill committee said on that point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``neither side should be prevented from expressing its views merely as a consequence of relative poverty.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the problem is one of relative poverty, it does not necessarily follow that the solution is to award an equal sum of money to both sides. Any such grant to an already well funded campaign may be superfluous in terms of the difference that it would make to the ability of that campaign to put its message across to voters.
<P>
I shall refer again to the 1975 referendum because it is relevant to the discussion. The Government grant to the Britain in Europe campaign amounted to only 8 per cent. of its income. The grant allocated to the National Referendum campaign amounted to 94 per cent. of its income. It is open to question whether the objective of ensuring that both sides of the argument were heard by voters was furthered by providing the Britain in Europe campaign with a public subsidy, given the relative unimportance of that subsidy compared with its wider funding.
<P>
I am sure that other members of the Committee remember as I do that those campaigning against membership found it difficult to be heard because of the strength and funding of the pro-membership group, and the wide support that it enjoyed within certain sections of political parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert N. Wareing </B>(Liverpool, West Derby): My hon. Friend may recall that in the 1975 common market referendum campaign, there was much dispute about the fact that the Government allowed for three documents to be published and sent to every household--one from the National Referendum campaign, one from the Britain in Europe campaign and one from the Government. I can remember an argument on television between Jim--now Lord--Callaghan and Robin Day about the fact that two documents in favour of Britain continuing in the common market were being sent out and only one against. That must be borne in mind as we consider the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. A difficulty sometimes arises because, although there may be two campaigns, the Government are expected to take a view. How should they express that view? That is one of the difficult issues that must be worked through.
<P>
The funding available to one side of a referendum campaign is not the only issue. It may simply be that there is no suitable candidate for the receipt of core funding. The Bill suggests several criteria to which the referendums commission should have regard when deciding which body should be given designated referendum campaign status, but what if none of the applicants fits the Bill? It cannot be taken for granted that umbrella organisations will emerge in every case; although one might sensibly expect that they would, there is no absolute guarantee.
<P>
There might well be a spectrum of individuals and organisations campaigning on one side of a referendum question--possibly for entirely different reasons--who would find it difficult to unite under a common banner. If that were the case, it would be difficult to single out any one organisation as the most appropriate to receive core funding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> The Minister is right in saying that it might be tricky to find a designated campaigner, but that is why we give that task to the commission. If he is saying that we could have a referendum with no opposition, what on earth is the point of having the referendum in the first place? It seems illogical. If there is a referendum, it must be because there are two sides to be heard. The Bill says that both sides must be heard and that the commission should be allowed some discretion regarding the mechanics of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's last point, to which I shall come in a moment. However, he misunderstood what I was saying; if I made myself unclear in any way, I apologise. I was not saying that there would not be campaigns on each side of the case. I was saying that there could be a division of opinion on, for example, tactics within one side of the argument.
<P>
I do not want to be drawn into giving detailed examples, but it is perfectly conceivable that if there were a referendum campaign on the euro, different people would be opposed for different reasons. People like David Owen come into the argument as well as, for example, the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash). Clearly, they have an entirely distinct set of arguments as to why they are unhappy with the euro. It may well be that once a campaign is triggered, Lord Owen and everyone else will come to an accommodation and line up in one distinct camp, while those who favour the euro line up on the other side, but there is no guarantee of that--that was my point.
<P>
The Neill committee suggested that there might be circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to allocate core funding. I assume that by that it means instances when it is not absolutely clear which is the appropriate body on one side of the argument. I agree with the hon. Member for Blaby that amendment No. 14 would provide the necessary flexibility.
<P>
On amendment No. 6, the Bill adopts the right approach in providing for the referendums commission to certify only one organisation on each side of a given referendum question as a designated campaign. That approach was adopted in the 1975 referendum and is favoured by the Neill committee.
<P>
The Neill scheme, and the scheme provided for in the Bill, will not work effectively if, as amendment No. 6 allows, there are several formally recognised organisations for each side of a referendum campaign. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made the point--last week, I think--that supporters of one outcome in a referendum may refuse to work together, and that accordingly we should allow for several officially recognised campaign bodies on each side. The Neill committee specifically addressed that possibility. Its solution was that in such circumstances, no organisation should be formally designated as an umbrella campaign body.
<P>
That makes sense. It would not be fair to expect a referendums commission or an electoral commission to try to pick its way through the entrails of a set of separate organisations that might be broadly on one side of the argument, but may have such large differences on tactics--or, indeed, their motivating principles--that they could not co-operate.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 deserves consideration--if not in Committee, later.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I should like predominantly to speak to my amendment, amendment No. 6, rather than enter at length the discussion about individuals and bodies, which is a long-standing debate introduced originally by Robbie Burns, in one of his seminal works:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Gin a body meet a body<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Coming through the rye.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In discussion on clause 1, I said that I would use a standard example in several debates: that a referendum on the euro is being launched by the present Government; and that one body is in favour of joining and two opposed, led respectively by the hon. Member for Blaby and my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson). My hon. Friend the Minister has accepted that the two of them might not be able to find sufficient common ground to want to form a joint umbrella organisation. Knowing that they are both reasonable people, that might not be the case, but it is easy to imagine circumstances in which bodies might be further apart--so far apart that they feel it undesirable to be seen in each other's company. If the Committee needs further persuasion, let us imagine that the National Front--or a larger body of extreme nationalists than currently exists--became involved. Most opponents of the euro would not want to form an umbrella organisation with extreme nationalist groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> It would of course be equally depressing if the Communist Party of Great Britain--if it still exists outside the smoke-filled rooms of the Labour party--were to take part. What the hon. Gentleman says is perfectly fair, except that it is up to those who want to take part in a referendum campaign. If they cannot grow up and knock heads together, the referendum commission will clearly pick one group and decide that the others have taken themselves out of the equation and should not receive public money.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He will note that his view of what happens in such circumstances differs from that suggested by my hon. Friend the Minister and the Neill committee. They have suggested that in that instance the commission employs the nuclear weapon and says, ``In that case, none of you will get any money.''
<P>
Clause 3(2) regulates the amount of coverage that is given to each side of the campaign. Its wording leaves open the possibility that non-designated bodies on either side may get broadcast time. There is a strong implication that the majority of the referendum coverage should be given to the designated campaign on each side. In the example that I cited, that would mean that the commission, by refusing to designate either of the rival no campaigns would, in effect, prevent broadcast coverage of the case for the no campaign. That would be a disastrous outcome. During a discussion of major significance, the entire debate would be dislocated due to a disagreement between individuals on one side of the campaign.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Blaby suggested an alternative--that the commission should draw a deep breath and decide that one of the bodies represents the arguments for a particular outcome, while the other does not. That would also have drastic consequences. If the hon. Member for Blaby and his organisation was chosen as the one body, the distinct views of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Nottingham, South and the many organisations that support him--trade unions and other left-wing organisations--would be effectively silenced. They would, at least, be shut out from any public support, and it would be difficult for the broadcasting organisations to decide on a fair allocation of time for them under clause 3.
<P>
Let us imagine the converse. If my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Nottingham, South, along with his organisation, was able to persuade the commission that they were much more broadly based and vibrant than the Conservative party under the hon. Member for Blaby, perhaps the Conservative party would be unable to get coverage for its point of view. Attractive as that possibility may seem to many of us, we must have democratic reservations about whether it would be entirely desirable.
<P>
A situation in which the commission is forced to choose between two bodies, and one body gets all the money and most of the coverage, while the other gets no money and is almost silenced, is fundamentally undesirable. The closer those two bodies come to equality, the more outrageous it will seem.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> How does my hon. Friend assume that an electoral or referendum commission would choose between organisations? How would they measure the relative importance of any one organisation? It would be very difficult.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I thank the Minister for his question. I suggest that the commission will be forced in any case to evaluate the relative impact and strengths of the organisations so as to make the choice that is envisaged in clause 2(2). It will have to assess their ability to conduct an effective campaign, taking into account the views of the political parties, the degree of public support and any other such matters that it considers to be relevant. Although it may not spontaneously end up with a numeric rating, it will have to weigh things up and decide, for example, that on balance the campaign of the hon. Member for Blaby and his allies is somewhat stronger than the campaign by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South and his allies. Having got that far, it would not be a great step further to assess that balance as being 60:40, 70:30 or 90:10. The commission may then decide that the balance is so strong that it can identify only one body to represent the campaign. Alternatively, it could find that the balance is so narrow that it is difficult to make the choice, and conclude that it would be much fairer in terms of natural justice to allocate it 50:50 or in some other proportion that it may decide. In practice, the commission may tend to conclude either that one body is dominant or that the funds should be divided equally. That seems a reasonable rule of thumb. The nuclear weapon of saying, ``We find it difficult to decide, so they will all suffer'', is unacceptable in terms of fair conduct for a referendum. I am sorry to disagree with Lord Neill and his distinguished colleagues, but these things happen.
<P>
The mechanics of the procedure that amendment No. 6 would introduce would be dealt with by amendment No. 7, among others that we shall come to later. I phrased amendment No. 7 to allow for the possibility of more than one body being designated. If the Minister and the hon. Member for hon. Member Blaby study practices in other countries, they will see that many countries recognise that there may be more than one body on one side of a referendum and that it is desirable to allow for that possibility. I urge the Committee not to exclude it in advance.
<P>
In a bizarre inversion of our usual roles, I find myself seeking to give the commission greater flexibility, whereas the hon. Member for Blaby seeks to bind it for all time in a sort of magic straitjacket. We should allow the commission to opt to divide responsibility between two sides of a campaign if it thinks it right to do so. The knowledge that it might not do so will be a powerful incentive for groups to come together if they possibly can.
<P>
I am persuaded by the arguments of the hon. Member for West Dorset that it is reasonable to leave in the clause the word ``individuals'', which does not do any harm. As several hon. Members have said, the need for such provision is unlikely to arise in practice. We cannot cover every circumstance that may arise in the indefinite future.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 attempts to address two sets of circumstances when there is no detectable campaign for one of the options, and when there is more than one campaign. I am tempted by the argument of the hon. Member for Blaby that in any referendum, a detectable campaign will work for each possible outcome. It is conceivable that the Government of the day will seek endorsement for some relatively uncontroversial but far-reaching proposition, and that there will be no effective opposition. The regional referendums, especially the Scottish one, came close to that. Historically, the Conservative party has sometimes been open to the idea, but it just happened to be less enthusiastic at the moment of the referendum. I gather that it has since rallied to the flag.
<P>
I acknowledge that sometimes no strong body will be opposed to a referendum. With respect, and contrary to what the Minister said, clause 3 does not require the commission to issue funds--it merely allows it to do so. If almost everyone was on one side, the commission might identify one small group as being opposed, but might decide not to issue funds if the outcome was likely to be a walkover.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred to multiple campaigns. Amendment No. 6 deals with that more effectively than amendment No. 14, which merely gives the commission the option to walk out in dudgeon and to say, ``If there are two campaigns and they cannot agree, we will not recognise either of them. So there.'' That is less desirable than the fair solution of requiring it to recognise the major campaigns on each side and to treat them fairly and proportionately.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I shall deal first with the amendment that was tabled by the hon. Member for Broxtowe, which is superficially attractive. Indeed, it is so superficially attractive that we were initially attracted by it. There are, however, several reasons why we are not now. One is that the helpful advice that we have been given by the Minister and his innumerable Sir Humphreys--sorry, his very helpful civil servants--rightly noted that the amendment was not especially clever. Furthermore, it is entirely contrary to recommendation in paragraph 12.35 of the Neill commission. We are here because hon. Members on both sides of the House of Commons believe that the Neill commission recommendations should be in place before another referendum takes place. Of course, the Neill commission recommendations are not perfect. As I have said before, I would be happy to accept a better Bill from the Government if they came up with one. The truth is, however, that the proposal in the Bill is what Neill recommends; some wise and sensible people sat down and considered it. We should not, therefore, interfere with it. I am interested and delighted that, in this case, the Minister and I agree.
<P>
The amendment is superficially attractive, but it could be unintentionally destructive and could get in the way. Furthermore, a group that was, for example, against the euro and which was led by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South--sadly, he is not here, but he will not mind me saying this in his absence--might go off in high dudgeon. The Bill would not prevent it from campaigning, getting into the newspapers or putting its case. All that would happen is that another group, which wanted the same outcome, could call money from public funds and access the broadcast media. The Bill would not prevent groups from having access to the broadcast media. However, it says, in effect, ``If you are not prepared to grow up and join an umbrella group, as Neill suggests, you will not get the dosh.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> It seems to me that the whole point of referendums is that they involve a yes or no answer. My hon. Friend may be interested to know that I worked for the ``Keep Britain in Europe'' campaign in 1974. We put out different literature for different markets, including some that was aimed specifically at Labour voters and which said, ``Your pound and your pint will stay the same.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I am sure that we all sit round the kitchen table drinking pints these days--having beer and sandwiches even.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. I am sorry to say this, because the amendment seemed quite attractive initially, but the hon. Member for Broxtowe is saying, ``Everybody out there is idiotic.'' Instead of saying that the onus is on people who want to stand as campaigners to sort matters out, he is saying, ``They are quite incapable of doing that, so we must allow the commission flexibility.'' I do not accept that; indeed, I would say that it is nannying people to say that we cannot allow them to get together and sort matters out for themselves. If people cannot go for one or other outcome and sit down in the same room as other people, that is up to them. The National Front or the Communist Party of Great Britain will not be prevented from campaigning just because they are not in an umbrella group, and we must have an umbrella group.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that I am attempting to prevent people from coming together? That is, of course, not the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I am not suggesting that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Hansard will show that the hon. Gentleman did suggest that, although inadvertently, I am sure.
<P>
We are considering the issue of two bodies that, despite the best will in the world, find themselves unable to work together, perhaps because of bitter disagreements on other issues or because they are taking part in referendums for two quite different reasons. So far, the only substantive arguments that I have heard from the hon. Gentleman are, first, that Lord Neill disagrees and, secondly, that the Minister disagrees. I would like to hear why the hon. Gentleman disagrees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I disagree because I do not intend to nanny people if they cannot grow up and come together under an umbrella organisation. If there are three very different and disparate groups in an umbrella organisation, they have simply to come together and say, ``We vote no'' and then take their portion of the public moneys distributed. That is all that they have to do. They do not have to sit down in another smoke-filled room--their accountants have to.
<P>
I am getting rather more excited about the amendment than I thought I would. I think that the hon. Member for Broxtowe is unintentionally trying to cause confusion and disruption about the clause.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> One of the interesting historical facts that we have learnt from this debate rather undermines the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Broxtowe about those with differing views being unable to come together. We heard, both this morning and last week, that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the Minister campaigned for a no vote in 1975, while my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield campaigned for a yes vote. Those roles have been reversed in the 24 years since the referendum. Does not that reinforce the point that those with opposing views can come together in umbrella organisations? In the case of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the Minister, I refer to the new Labour party and in the case of my hon. Friend, the new Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> My hon. Friend is right. In 1975 and since then, many people came together in umbrella groups, although they may have disagreed about everything else. It is true of almost every issue across the House that people agree on one issue, but perhaps not in party political terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Surrey Heath has just made a point concerning the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and me. The point is that it took in excess of 20 years for us to change positions on the issue. I do not think that the time scale of the referendum campaign, on whatever subject, would encompass the journey that we have made.
<P>
Recommendation R85 in chapter 12 on page 164 of the Neill report simply says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Election Commission should decide which organisations, if any, should be in receipt of core funding.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that that simple formulation makes things clear and allows the flexibility required in the circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his bipartisan and humorous contributions to our debate. Lord Neill says on the same page:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``No more than one organisation on each side should be funded.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems quite clear.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 would replace the word ``shall'' with ``may if it thinks fit''. That would rather castrate the commission and, although I do not believe that to be intentional, I hope that the Committee will not support the proposal.
<P>
Finally, amendments Nos. 13, 15 and 17 would replace ``individuals'' with ``bodies''. That issue has been dealt with very well by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset. We were encouraged by parliamentary draftsmen to refer in the Bill to individuals or bodies. It seems very clear and, frankly, the chances of some spurious individual with back pockets full of loot being the designated person are very slim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> This has been an interesting debate. I will seek to assist the Committee on the three issues surrounding whether or not individuals are designated. Two schools of thought seem to have emerged as a result of consulting various parliamentary draftsmen. That is the usual problem when two sets of lawyers and two sets of opinions are involved.
<P>
This is a narrow point, and I think that it has been well aired. My hon. Friend the Minister set out his position clearly. In any case, I suspect that in a more carefully drafted Bill--the result of a promise made by the Government--those issues will be tightened up and clarified. That would incorporate the points that I raised about individuals and my subsequent comments on amendment No. 14.
<P>
The spirit of the debate has been such that I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wareing:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe in his contention that more than one organisation can seek a particular outcome. I do so from experience, especially my experience during the 1975 referendum campaign on whether to stay in the common market. It is entirely possible that two organisations can argue for the same outcome but for a number of different reasons.
<P>
I remember--as will my hon. Friend the Minister--that in Liverpool in 1975 there was an attempt to set up an umbrella organisation for people of different political persuasions who were in opposition to our continuation in the common market. I shared a platform with some dissenting Conservatives who were opposed to the common market and some communists--in fact, the chairman of the meeting was a well-known Communist party member in the area. However, I walked off the platform in protest at the extreme nationalist views that were being expressed by the chairman and by the leading Conservative on the platform, who was undoubtedly a Powellite--after all, the referendum was taking place not too many years after Enoch Powell's ``rivers of blood'' speech. I could not stomach it.
<P>
Thus, there were two separate groups in Liverpool and on Merseyside generally. My hon. Friend the Minister will well remember that members of the Labour party campaigned on the slogan, ``No to the common market, yes to a socialist Europe'', while Conservatives--those who were opposed to the common market--and communists combined, oddly enough, in a nationalist programme,
<P>
It would be grossly unfair for an umbrella organisation presenting one argument to obtain all the core funding while other organisations on the same side received none. For example, if there was an Act of Parliament on Sunday trading which determined that there should be a national referendum on the issue, would it be right to give the core funding to the Lord's Day Observance Society? It would oppose Sunday opening on the ground of religious conviction, but the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, for instance, which would no doubt make a strong argument for protecting workers' rights, would present a different point of view, albeit with the same outcome in mind.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe is entirely right. If there are two irreconcilable arguments for a particular outcome, they cannot be embraced by a single umbrella organisation, but to deny one of them an element of core funding is to deny the general public information. Numerous organisations can provide more and more information about the subject that is the bone of contention. I hope that the Bill, or another that Her Majesty's Government might introduce, might give people a real choice by allowing not one but many flowers to bloom in the arguments to be considered in a referendum. I am rather neutral about the other amendments, having no objection to them, but I feel strongly in favour of amendment No. 6. I hope that the Committee will accept it.

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I reject the charge that the amendment would involve nannying. Nannying would be involved if we required organisations that did not agree with each other to get into bed together, going to bed being a typically nannying activity.
<P>
I realise that some hon. Ministers have expressed disagreement in principle, and I would like to offer them one further argument. What is the purpose of our activity in Committee? We are attempting to establish a structure for the conduct of referendums that is accepted across the political spectrum as fair to all sides of referendum campaigns, and which will not be challenged. The effect of dictating that each side may have only one representative will be to marginalise groups that do not have the support of one of the two major political parties. In practice, referendum campaigns will tend to be dominated by those parties. That will erode support for the principle of the referendum among groups outside the big power structures.
<P>
The amendment would not require the commission to recognise more than one body as representing a possible outcome. It would merely make it possible for the commission to do so if it was satisfied that that was the fair thing to do. I ask the Committee, in the interests of fairness, not to rule out that possibility.

Amendment negatived.
