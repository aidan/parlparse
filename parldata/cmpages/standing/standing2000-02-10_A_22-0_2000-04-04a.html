Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I did not press for a vote on each of those Government amendments because of the apology just before lunch from the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope), the Government Whip. However, I have several questions that I would like him or, if possible, the Minister to answer about the number of amendments that are being tabled. We understand that there are still a number of amendments to come. Will the Minister tell us whether any will tabled today for discussion on Thursday? If so, how many and how can we get copies of them? Do the Government have any other amendments to table in Committee? If so, when will they do so? Are we to understand that some are still not ready? If that is the case, a huge amount of incompetence is still in evidence in the handling of the Bill. If that is not the case, are the Government deliberately holding back from tabling those amendments? That would not be a fair or pluralistic way of carrying on the debate. It would be enormously helpful if we could have responses to those questions.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs Helen Liddell):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. I will undertake during the Committee's deliberations to have a check made on the number of amendments that are likely to be tabled and on what issues.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 778, in page 61, line 41, leave out ``to or''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 779.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> These are both technical amendments. The first removes the words ``to or'' so that subsection (2) more accurately refers to a comparable supply of electricity in a specified area. The second amendment inserts the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or any particular condition of contract<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
at the end of subsection (3) to ensure that it reads consistently with subsection (2), to which it relates.

<P>
Subsection (2) gives the Secretary of State the power to require the holder of a licence to charge prices or to offer conditions of contract in respect of a comparable supply of electricity in a specified area. At present, subsection (3) limits that power by stating that the Secretary of State cannot use it to order any particular or maximum charge or price. The amendment extends the limitation so that the Secretary of State, in exercising that power, cannot stipulate any particular condition or contract.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 779, in page 62, line 2, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any particular condition of contract'.-[Dr. Howells.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I only want to ask why we have the provisions, whether a Scottish Office Minister is present to explain the criteria for Scotland and whether we have jurisdiction over such matters. I am sure that the Minister will be able to explain those matters.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Section 3(2)(a) of the Electricity Act 1989 gave Ministers order-making powers to ensure that the prices charged by public electricity suppliers to electricity customers in a specified area of Scotland did not differ for reasons of geography between different parts of that area. It was commendable that the Act attempted that difficult task and succeeded in it.

<P>
The Secretary of State for Scotland made an order in 1990, specifying the area in question to be that covered by Scottish Hydro-Electric-now called Scottish and Southern-which lies to the north of a line drawn roughly from the Clyde to the Tay: the north and west of Scotland.

<P>
Since the war, successive Governments have taken pains to ensure that electricity was made available to nearly all the remote communities in the north and west of Scotland. That was not done without cost, but while the industry remained in the public sector, the policy was that electricity prices across the whole of northern Scotland remained uniform.

<P>
The issue at stake in 1990 was the need to ensure that these remote communities, after privatisation of the industry, continued to be charged uniform prices for electricity. Section 3(2)(a) secure that end, under what came to be known as the common tariff obligation, which regulates the charging of electricity prices, which are averaged across all of the specified area-including Aberdeen and Dunee-to the benefit of the remote communities in the north and west of Scotland.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Could the Minister touch on the jurisdiction of this Parliament in respect of these matters in Scotland?

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This is not a devolved matter; electricity provision remains the responsibility of the Government in Westminster.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I welcome clause 60. In view of the constituency represented by the leader of my party, it would be difficult for me to say anything else. It would doubtless be pointed out if I failed to do so. The common tariff is relevant to all rural areas, as was mentioned on Second Reading. I therefore welcome the proposal and hope that it will proceed with no dissent.

<P>
Clause 60, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 61</center></H4>
<H4><center>Maximum prices for reselling electricity</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 780, in page 63, leave out lines 1 to 3.

<P>
The Government amendment is a technical one, changing clause 61 by deleting the definition of ``authorised supplier'', which means someone authorised either by a licence or by an exemption to supply electricity. That definition was thought to be useful for the clause, but was also used elsewhere in the Bill. Therefore it should be put into a general interpretations provision of the Electricity Act. That insertion is done by amendment No. 631, which adds the definition to the part of schedule 5 that amends the Electricity Act's interpretation provisions. The definition is redundant here and should be removed.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the Minister explain the purpose of the clause and how it will change the current position?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> With pleasure.

<P>
Existing provisions in the Electricity Act 1989 and the Gas Act 1986 share the overall objective of preventing excessive prices from being charged when electricity or gas is resold-for example, by landlords to tenants-but differ in their details. The clause, together with clause 82, which is next in the order of consideration, reconciles the differences so that the powers granted to the regulatory authority are the same for the two fuels, except for the exemption of gas used for propelling motor vehicles. I know that that is important to the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce), who is concerned about kebab vans.

<P>
The clause makes the power in electricity more flexible. Instead of having to fix prices, the regulatory authority will be able to set a formula by which maximum prices will be calculated. The authority may set an interest rate to be paid on sums charged in excess of the maximum price, which would be in addition to the value of the overpayment itself, as at present; it can require resellers to provide information on prices to purchasers; and it can direct that the maximum price must be reduced by an amount or percentage if the reseller fails to comply with that requirement.

<P>
Those changes will align the electricity regime with the relevant aspects of the current gas regime. The clause updates the existing provision to give the authority greater flexibility to protect consumers.

<P>
Clause 61, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 82 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 80</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exercise of power to make regulations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 652, in page 88, line 5, leave out ``40(7)'' and insert ``47(7)''.

<P>
The amendment is a technical one and corrects a simple typographic error in a cross-reference. The reference should be to subsection (7) of section 47-not of section 40-of the Gas Act 1986. There is no subsection (7) in section 40, and the reference summarising the subsection that comes in brackets in the first line of the clause clearly refers to the contents of section 47(7).

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 756, in page 88, line 11, after ``State'', insert ``or the Authority''.

<P>
The clause will allow the regulatory authority, under the amended Gas Act 1986, to make statutory instruments without needing to have them scrutinised by Parliament. The Government may respond by saying that that is the position in the Electricity Act 1989, in which the authority has similar powers. However, I disagree with that approach, even to the extent of the limited regulation-making powers that are given in that Act. With the enormous new powers in the Bill, it is unacceptable that the authority should be able to issue reams of regulations without recourse to Parliament. If the Government want to harmonise the gas and electricity regimes, they should harmonise them to provide the most parliamentary accountability, not the least.

<P>
People are worried about the growing spate of secondary legislation that goes through the House without any scrutiny at all. There is also a concern about the amount of secondary legislation that cannot be prayed against under the negative procedure. Giving regulatory authorities the power to issue statutory instruments is one thing, but to allow them to do so without any recourse to Parliament is going a stage too far. I hope that the Government will take on board this important amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The Government agree that the amendment is important, and take it seriously. As the hon. member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has told us, the Electricity Act 1989 provides that regulations made by the Secretary of State are subject to parliamentary control, but that those made by the regulatory authority are not subject to such procedures. That lies at the heart of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. We think that that existing provision is right, because its approach is more in line with the principle of arms-length regulation, and we therefore propose to adopt it for gas. That is part of the general agenda of aligning the two regulatory frameworks as much as possible.

<P>
Many regulations made by the regulatory authority will relate to the standards of performance that companies must meet when dealing with customers. Although we have discussed the matter before, I remind the Committee of one exmaple of that: the requirement that companies should keep appointments or pay compensation if they do not. Another possible requirement relates to gas quality, which is dealt with in the next clause that we will discuss. I do not want to pre-empt that discussion, but regulations might specify maximum levels of hydrogen sulphide allowed in gas.

<P>
It would not be appropriate for Parliament to be involved in such detailed regulations, but they require approval by the Secretary of State. In addition, they are scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. The amendment would also subject the authority's regulations to negative assent. Technically, that would render the clause unnecessary because it would no longer effect a significant change to the Gas Act 1986, but it would leave unchanged the Electricity Act 1989, which does not require negative assent for the authority's regulations. The two regimes would be unaligned in that respect.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The amendment would also mean that gas regulations were treated differently from other regulatory actions such as determinations, setting price caps, the decision to grant or refuse a licence, or to propose modifications to licences. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments will continue to scrutinise regulations.

<P>
It would not be appropriate to dilute the regulator's responsibility for arm's-length regulation of technical day-to-day details by involving Parliament. We should set overall objectives, as set out in the clauses on general duties. The regulator should be allowed to get on with his job. The 1989 Act, which was introduced by the previous Government, got the matter right. The clause, with a technical amendment to correct the typographical error, but without the change proposed in the amendment, will pursue the goal of aligning the gas and electricity regimes. It will allow a sensible and balanced view of when parliamentary procedures for regulations are appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister talks about the 1989 Act, but the Bill establishes a different regime. It gives significantly more powers to the regulator than existed under the 1989 Act. In addition, he referred to arm's-length regulation, but the Bill is full of powers that are given to the Secretary of State to issue guidance to the regulator. If anything, the Bill tilts the balance away from arm's-length regulation to no-arm's-length regulation, so that the Secretary of State-himself or herself-will dictate to the regulator how regulation should take place. The Minister speaks with a forked tongue. We do not object to regulators issuing rule books that set out the technical detail with regard to hydrogen sulphide and black dust, but we do object to giving regulatory authorities the power to change the law through statutory instruments.

<P>
The Minister's final point was that the amendment would make the two regimes unaligned. If it is imperative for the two industries to be aligned, he could table a Government amendment-that would bring the total of their amendments to 329, so one more would not make much difference-to bringe the Electricity Act 1989 in line with the Gas Act 1986. Given the regulatory authority's new powers, that would be a better way to align statutory instrument-making powers.

<P>
Having aired our concerns, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) Before making any regulations under this section the Authority and the Health and Safety Commission shall make arrangements with a view to securing consistent treatment of matters which affect both of them.'.<P>

<P>
The clause is well intentioned, but the drafting may cause a problem. The explanatory notes rightly say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The present regulatory regime does not provide a clear alocation of responsibility for regulating gas quality issues which do not have a significant safety aspect but which may nevertheless have a substantial impact on consumers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I presume that that relates to black dust. The Health and Safety Executive does not consider that directly a safety problem, but a quality issue. The clause addresses this issue by giving the regulatory authority the power to make regulations with regard to the quality of gas and its pressure.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I have been reliably informed this morning that it could also be a question of efficiency, since the accumulation of black dust causes a drop in efficiency in the burning of various appliances. That is something that I am sure the hon. Gentleman will want to address.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is a valid point. For consumers, efficiency is a matter of quality. Efficiency affects the quality of the product that consumers receive from their supplier and any drop in efficiency can result in higher bills. The problem with the clause is the fact that the regulatory authority and the Health and Safety Executive will have responsibility for many of the same issues. This causes concern in the industry about regulatory clarity. Amendment No. 757 is designed to remedy that problem by requiring the authority and the Health and Safety Executive to reach an agreement so that in practice there is no overlap of responsibilities. It would be helpful if the two bodies published a memorandum of understanding setting out the details of how the responsibilities will be split in the same way as the Bill provides for a memorandum of understanding between the consumer councils and the regulatory authority. That is the purpose of the amendment. I hope that the Government will look favourably on it, because it deals with a serious concern of the gas industry.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I take this amendment seriously. It is important and covers a sensitive area. I realise that the spirit of the amendmentis to ensure co-ordination and consistency between the authority and the Health and Safety Commission over the regulation of, respectively, the non-safety and safety aspects of gas quality. However, given the various provisions-existing and future-to deal with the matter, the amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
The authority and the Secretary of State will have two relevant duties. First, under clause 10 they will have a duty to consult the Health and Safety Commission on all gas safety issues, whether they affect members of the public or people employed in the gas industry. They will also have a duty to take account of any advice given by the commission, whether it was sought through that consultation or not. The second safety-related part of the general duty, which is clause 8 as amended, states that, subject to the principal objective of promoting the consumer interest, both the Secretary of State and the authority shall carry out their functions in the manner best calculated to protect the public from any dangers arising from gas conveyed through pipes.

<P>
Under clause 10, ``a gas safety issue'' is defined widely as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>anything concerning the conveyance of gas through pipes, or the use of gas conveyed through pipes, which may affect the health and safety of members of the public or persons employed in connection with the conveyance of gas through pipes or the supply of gas.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Though a gas quality issue may not appear to have safety implications, good administration and prudence-against the background of the wide definition in clause 10-would ensure that the authority consulted the Health and Safety Commission before making any regulations under new section 16. The Health and Safety Executive has a duty of consultation under health and safety legislation. Depending on the content of any regulations proposed by the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive, the duty would include consulting the authority on each and every occasion.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about a memorandum of understanding. There is another duty in the current Act that requires the regulator to agree a memorandum of understanding with the Health and Safety Executive
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for securing co-operation and the exchange of information between them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has not been explicitly carried over into the new duties, but we expect the regulatory authority, the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive to make appropriate arrangements.

<P>
I must stress that the culture of consultation that Ofgem and the Health and Safety Commission and Executive have developed now has a life of its own. Close consultation has already taken place on black dust, and I have no doubt that that will continue. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured by that, and I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am most grateful for that full response from the Minister-particularly his comments about the existing provision for a memorandum of understanding. I hope that a memorandum of understanding between the Health and Safety Executive and the authority will be drawn up with respect to the issues that we are considering. I have not raised the issue simply as a result of reading the Bill. It was raised with me by the gas industry. If the authorities involved take on board the Minister's and the Opposition's comments we shall be well served. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 781, in page 88, line 31, leave out ``the regulations'' and insert ``regulations under this section''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 782 to 788 and 812.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> In this group of amendments, No. 781 is technical, and Nos. 782 to 787 and 812 are for clarification, while No. 788 is partly technical and partly for clarification.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 784 to 787 clarify the matters for which regulations made under the new section 16 of the 1986 Act may provide for other matters that are to be dealt with by way of directions given by the authority. Amendment No. 788 clarifies the nature of the duty on gas transporters under new section 16, by requiring them to conduct their business in such a way as may reasonably be expected to lead to their achieving any standards set under the new section. They are useful improvements to clause 81.

<P>
Amendment No. 781 is a technical drafting amendment, aimed at making the wording of subsection (3) more consistent with the rest of the provision. Amendment No. 782 also relates to subsection (3), which requires the authority to appoint competent and impartial persons for various purposes. One such purpose, which was omitted from the provision, was to assist the authority in determining the need for, and contents of, regulations made under the new section. The amendment adds that purpose to subsection (3).

<P>
Amendment No. 783 relates to subsection (4) of new section 16, which sets out various matters for which regulations made under the section may provide. One of those matters is for testing of gas to determine whether it complies with the standards prescribed under the section. The amendment clarifies our intention that tests of gas should be carried out by gas transporters themselves, as well as by the authority's staff.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 784 to 787 are intended to clarify the matters for which regulations made under the new section 16 may provide. They put those matters into a more sensible arrangement and provide that more matters may be dealt with by way of directions given by the authority, rather than in the regulations themselves.

<P>
Amendment No. 788 simplifies the financial provisions of the new section, by deleting subsections (9), (10) and (11) and replacing them with a new subsection (9). It also clarifies the nature of the duty to be imposed on gas transporters by new section 16 so that gas transporters will be under a duty to conduct their business in such a way as may reasonably be expected to lead to their achieving any standard set under the section.

<P>
Amendment No. 812 makes the new duty on gas transporters a relevant requirement for the purpose of section 28 of the Gas Act 1986. That means that the authority will be able to take enforcement action against a gas transporter that fails in that duty.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I oppose amendment No. 788, which will omit the safeguard that the Treasury should approve any expenditure in paying for those outside bodies referred to by the Minister, and which are set out in the clause, to test the gas or equipment or to assist the authority in carrying out its functions. It will omit also the safeguard of Treasury approval being required for how the costs should be reimbursed by the gas transporter. Because payments for testing are, in effect, public expenditure and the reimbursement is, in effect, taxation, they ought at least to be considered by the Treasury, because it has experience in dealing with such matters. The Bill should include that safeguard.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I mentioned that the amendment would delete subsections (9), (10) and (11), and that it would replace them with new subsection (9). Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that that is the heart of his criticism?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Those subsections follow the form of the old section 16.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister referred to new subsection (9), which leaves me a little confused, as the amendment also includes a new subsection (10).

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am talking about new subsection (9). The three original subsections follow the form of the old section 16, and they give the authority the power to pay the staff that it appoints under the section that deals with remuneration and pensions, and the power to recover such payments from the gas transporters. The provisions in clause 81 for the payment of remuneration and pensions are not necessary, because the subject is dealt with in shedule 1, whcih sets up the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. New subsection (9) now provides only for gas transporters to pay a proportion of the authority's expenses attributable to the testing of gas.

<P>
Amendment No. 788 also clarifies the nature of the duty to be imposed on gas transporters by new section 16. Under that section, gas transporters will be under a duty to conduct their business in such a way as may reasonably be expected to lead to their achieving the standards that are set under the section. The Government believe that an absolute duty would not be appropriate. The proposed duty, which is of reasonable expectation, is proportionate-for instance, it allows for cases when the detriment to the consumer is inconvenience and expense rather than injury, and when that detriment arises gradually rather than instantaneously.

<P>
I turn to the specific matter of Treasury approval. The Department has consulted the Treasury. It does not want express provision to be made in the Bill. It used to be the custom to specify Treasury consent, but for several years reliance has been placed on administrative arrangements. I hope that that explanation satisfies the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

<P>
I am not sure what the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) wanted to ask about subsection (10).

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I was seeking some recognition of the fact that amendment No. 788 includes a new subsection (10). The Minister seemed to be ignoring it.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howellls:</B> I apologise if I gave that impression. It is strictly a compliance issue, and it appears at the top of the next page of the amendment paper.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am disappointed by the Minister's response. He said that schedule 1 dealt with my concerns, but it does not. It allows the Secretary of State to give approval, but the Opposition amendments that sought to include a reference to the Treasury were not accepted. It is irrelevant that the Treasury does not want to be mentioned in the Bill; indeed, a lack of desire to pursue its duty as guardian of the public purse would be typical of what happens under a Labour Government. The Treasury should have a duty in respect of any public expenditure or taxation, which is what the process amounts to. The clause will ensure that expenses incurred by the authority can be reimbursed from the gas transporter through the use of legal force. That is taxation, and any taxation or spending matters should pass through the Treasury. In view of the importance of that principle, I shall press amendment No. 788 to a vote.

Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
</font>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The clause gives enormous powers to the authority to employ people, possibly without limit, and to make charges for doing so. We have not heard a word from the Minister in justification of the clause, although I am sure that he was about to explain it. How many staff are likely to be employed? What is the likely cost of the work necessary to ensure that the testing can be done, including that which will be charged to gas transporters? Will the Minister explain what is done now and who currently carries out the specified functions?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We will discuss this matter in some detail during consideration of schedule 3. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will wait until then to pursue the matter, as that schedule deals precisely with employment numbers in respect of regulators and the council.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am not satisfied by that response. Before agreeing to legislation, we should know what it will do. The clause deals specifically with the gas testing issues that I am trying to raise. We should know what the powers are for and why we are giving them.

<P>
I shall tell an apocryphal tale that was told to me when I was work-study engineer. A man had been working in a plant for 25 years. He was told when he started that he had to watch a liquid level up to a particular point; when it got there he had to turn the valve to make the liquid level go down again to the green line, when he would turn the valve back again. When he had been doing the job for 25 years, a work-study engineer discovered that an automatic valve had been installed in the system 20 years earlier, and if the man had not turned the valve, it would have been done automatically. For 20 of his 25 years at the plant, the man had been turning a valve unnecessarily.

<P>
People may laugh at that, but when powers are given for testing, inspection and so on, it sounds great. The guy who is employed to carry out that work will be only too happy that the Government are giving powers to the authority to charge people to do this excellent work. However, members of the Committee must examine what is being done and to what purpose and try to get a handle on the cost, which, in the end, will be paid by the consumer. The Labour party says a great deal about the cost to the consumer and about the fuel poor, but it wants us to wait for schedule 3 before we discuss the additional costs.

<P>
What is being done now? While we are dealing with the gas, the Minister should comment on the fact that, in the past, one group of people put gas into the pipes and charged the consumer for using it. Now, several groups of people put gas into the system and that will cause difficulties if one gas producer supplies defective gas. How will it be discovered and who will be involved when the testers say that there is a problem? Who will adjudicate in the system and decide who should deal with that problem? It will not necessarily be a problem for the transporter, who simply receives gas from one group of suppliers and pumps it out to another.

<P>
It is important that members of the Committee should understand, before we accept the clause, what costs are involved and what people are supposed to be doing. If the testers discover that there is something wrong, how will the issue be resolved?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Ofgem is a technical directorate; it was formerly the gas standards branch of the Department of Trade and Industry. It was transferred from the DTI to Ofgas in March 1996 under the Gas Act 1995. Priorities and resource implications are a matter for the authority, but I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman. I understand that Ofgem is preparing to take on the new responsibilities set out in the clause by carrying out preliminary investigations. That involves, among other things, discussions with local authorities and others about the chemical analysis of black dust which, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is a reaction of copper-Cu-with hydrogen sulphide.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> H2S.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I see that someone else did O-level chemistry.

<P>
 At present, there is no clear and robust responsibility for regulating non-safety aspects of gas quality, such as the hydrogen sulphide content that can lead to the black dust problem. There was a power under the Gas Act 1986, but the legislation was repealed in a series of legislative changes in the 1990s, when the Conservative Administration lost sight of this particular ball. They assumed that gas quality issues were also safety issues, but black dust shows that that is not so.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman was right to question the meaning of the other subsections. I will go through them. Subsection (2) requires the authority to consult: this is an important provision. Subsection (3) requires the authority to appoint competent persons. I take it that this is the point he asked about. It seems to me that the authority should be capable of appointing competent persons. It might be thought that, as we are appointing an authority and paying it a large sum to administer what should be a competent agency, it should be capable of appointing capable persons without having to consult the hon. Member for South Dorset on each occasion.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I have read the clause. It told me that we are giving a power to appoint a lot of people, pay them and pass the cost on to others. My question to the Minister is simple. How many people are currently doing that, what does it cost and how will the new arrangements affect those figures? I suspect that he does not have the information and that if he took a stab at it, as he did with the marble halls that are being provided for the authority, he might find that his first stab is one tenth of the actual cost of the building or of appointing those people. I hope that he will undertake to write to us with that information.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If the hon. Gentleman does not like the stabs that I make, I will not have a stab at that question. I shall try to get by Report stage an idea of the number of competent persons who will be appointed to carry out the task-

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 90, line 35, at end insert-

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` ``electricity licence'' means a licence under section 6 of the 1989 Act; ``gas licence'' means a licence under section 7 or 7A of the 1986 Act;'.<P>

<P>
Goverment amendments to clause 7, which covers payments by licence holders that fund the Consumer Council, introduce references to electricity and gas licences. These terms need to be defined. Amendment No. 90 is therefore an uncontroversial amendment that follows on from the substantial amendment to clause 7. It simply defines more precisely the meaning of the terms in the appropriate place in this part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> On a point of order, Mrs Roe, I must be mistaken because I am sure that no mistakes are ever made in the calling of amendments, but I do not remember Government amendment No. 812 to clause 82 being called.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was grouped for discussion, but we shall come to it later.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 596, in page 158, line 4, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`10. Any expenses incurred as a result of a transfer scheme shall be regarded as deductible expenses for the purposes of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 597, in page 158, line 4, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`10. Where a trade is transferred from one company within a group of companies to another company in that group as a result of a transfer where for the purposes of section 245 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 no change in the nature or conduct of the trade shall be deemed to have occurred.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Schedule 3 contains the details on transfers to the new regulatory bodies, but it contains no measures on the transfer schemes that will be required when the public electricity suppliers split their distribution and supply functions. New clauses on those matters have yet to be tabled, as explained in the explanatory notes, page 4 of which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Bill does not currently give effect to all the proposals set out in the Government's policy documents  Where this is the case, the Government intends to bring forward amendments later in the passage of the Bill through Parliament to give effect to them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also states that those proposals include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>measures consequential on the separation of electricity distribution and supply-including provision for transfer schemes for public electricity suppliers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have yet to see any such amendment.It would be helpful to know when those amendments will be tabled. In case that never happens, we have tabled the amendments to deal with a tax issue that relates to transfer schemes under schedule 3. Schedule 3 is the wrong place for the amendments, but where else can they be debated, pending the arrival of the relevant clauses?

<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 596 is to ensure that the companies can obtain a tax deduction for any expenditure that they will undoubtedly incur in effecting the split between distribution and supply. The Inland Revenue will otherwise regard that as being capital expenditure, because it relates to the structure of a group through the share capital of its companies, rather than expenditure that takes place in those companies. Thus it will not be deductable for the purposes of calculating the schedule D case I corporation tax liability of those companies. That is unfair given that the companies will be forced to incur that expenditure under the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 597 similarly deals with the carry-forward of surplus, unutilised advance corporation tax that may have accrued if a group acquired another regional electricity company in the past three years. I resisted the temptation to bring my yellow ``Butterworth's'' to show the Minister in memory of old times spent serving on Committees that have considered various finance Bills. Under section 245 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, ACT will be lost if a major change in the nature or conduct of a trade takes place in the three years following an acquisition. Separating the distribution and supply businesses might constitute such a change, so the ACT will be lost simply because of the requirement to separate the two elements. Under the amendment, we would remedy that unfairness.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises important matters. He asked me why we have not yet tabled the transfer scheme provisions on the separation of supply and distribution. We intend to do so as soon as possible. As he said, they were intended to be part of the transitional provisions bringing up the rear. We have consulted the industry, as he has urged me to do. The industry has raised several issues with officials in recent weeks, which we want to reflect in any proposals that we introduce. Those provisions are important to the companies involved, and we want to ensure that we get them right.

<P>
The amendments refer primarily to the tax position of electricity companies, which will be required under the Bill to put their supply and distribution businesses into legally separate companies. As the hon. Gentleman said, the schedule is not the place for the amendments, but I shall not hide behind that technicality because they are important. We have received representations from the electricity industry in which it seeks the disapplication of certain tax legislation that might otherwise bite when public electricity suppliers separate their businesses as required under the Bill. We have carefully considered the industry's views. My officials have consulted the Inland Revenue. We do not consider that it would be appropriate to include special tax provisions in the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 596 deals with tax relief on expenditure. I am sure that, as a former tax adviser, the hon. Gentleman knows that when a company transfers or disposes of its assets, the associated expenses will be deductible only against the profits of the company's trade if incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade and if the expenditure is not capital in nature.

<P>
It is conceivable that expenditure involved in the separation of supply and distribution may not satisfy those tests. Not all the public electricity suppliers will be in the same position. Several have already split their supply and distribution for commercial reasons. Others will do so as a result of the Bill.

<P>
The inclusion of a special provision giving tax relief to companies that have not yet split could give them an advantage over those that have already achieved separation for purely commercial reasons. Equally, it is possible that companies required to split by the Bill could find the result commercially advantageous in itself. In the circumstances, it would be invidious to introduce a tax provision, the effects of which are uncertain and which could have an uneven application among those affected.

<P>
Amendment No. 597 deals with whether the rules on the use of surplus advance corporation tax might apply in circumstances in which a company may have acquired a former regional electricity company within three years of the separation requirement taking effect. Under normal rules, the surplus ACT of the acquired company could not be used by that company if there had been a major change in the nature or conduct of its trade or business within three years of its change of ownership.

<P>
As the hon. Gentleman knows, changes in structure and ownership in the electricity sector have continued apace as the market has developed. Several former regional electricity companies have been acquired by new owners in recent years. Circumstances have different in each case: for example, supply and distribution businesses have been sold to one owner or several owners.

<P>
The amendment appears to assume that the separation of supply and distribution required by the Bill would be considered as a major change in the nature or conduct of trade. However, the Inland Revenue would not consider whether that was the case in isolation. It is on record as saying that, on occasion, one factor may be decisive, but that such cases are normally considered in the round, taking into account changes in all relevant aspects of the business in the three years before and after the change in ownership.

<P>
Those wider considerations stop us supporting the introduction of a special provision. In light of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is willing to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The industry will be disappointed by the Minister's response.

<P>
I am intrigued to know when the Government are going to table their amendments, given that there are not many clauses left for us to debate and the Committee will not be sitting for much longer. Are the amendments drafted and ready? When will we be able to examine them? Will they be tabled in Committee, on Report or in the House of Lords?

<P>
On the Minister's substantive points, it is unreasonable to say that, since companies willingly separating distribution and supply into different subsidiaries lose a tax deduction for such expenses, people forced into such a position by the Bill should be denied a deduction. There is a difference between going into a transaction knowing full well what tax consequences are likely and being forced to do so by legislation. Companies that did not voluntarily undertake such an action are of the view that it was not in their commercial interest. Being forced to do so and consequently losing a tax deduction for expenses is unfair and unjust. Will the Government reconsider the matter before tabling amendments on transfer schemes?

<P>
As the Minister pointed out, the Inland Revenue may regard separation as not changing the nature or conduct of trade sufficiently to trigger section 245 and the loss of the ACT carry-forward. However, given that there is a risk and that companies have done nothing to create that risk, other than operate in Britain under the Government's jurisdiction, it is wrong that they might lose millions of pounds of carry-forward advance corporation tax for which they have paid. Again, that borders on confiscation without compensation. I thought that the Government had abandoned all such notions when they decided to become new instead of old Labour. I hope that the Minister will give serious thought to those issues before tabling more amendments, and I would like to know his timetable for doing that.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman's criticisms have been courteous and gentle. It is my intention for the amendments to be tabled on Report. However, they concern technical matters, which their Lordships are good at scrutinising.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to ask us to take the issues seriously. I take the views of industry very seriously.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that candid response, even though it was disappointing on the timing. I take it that a host of other amendments are likely to be tabled on Report or beyond. That is difficult for me to accept. I feel strongly that the traditions and procedures of the House require complete Bills to proceed through all their stages. Chunks of Bills should not pass without scrutiny.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> At the start of the sitting, I undertook to get back to the hon. Gentleman about the number of amendments likely to be tabled for Thursday: 17 minor amendments will be tabled today, and we undertake to give him copies. We have not completed counting the number likely to be tabled for next Tuesday, but we anticipate that those amendments will be available in the next 24 to 36 hours. When they are ready and we have completed our discussions with parliamentary counsel, we will ensure that they are made available to him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Roughly how many does the Minister anticipate for Tuesday? Beyond the amendments that she and the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs mentioned, will more be tabled on Report? Will Government amendments appear for the first time in the Lords?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I cannot yet give a definitive answer. Usually, there are amendments on Report. There may be amendments in the Lords. As my hon. Friend said, we are still consulting industry and consumers. We will attempt to ensure that the Opposition in all their guises are given the earliest possible notice of amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister's answer demonstrates that the Bill is in a shambles. The Government have already tabled 328 amendments, 17 more will be tabled today, and there will be more on Tuesday, on Report, in the Lords and no doubt beyond that. I return to our point that the Bill should have been put back on the shelf and given a new Second Reading after all its problems had been sorted out. I hope that the Minister will take my argument on board seriously, but in view of his response to my concerns about taxation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Third Schedule to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I will speak briefly on what is almost a point of order, although I am sure that the Minister can enlighten the Committee on it. I seem from the amendment paper that amendments Nos. 451 to 453 will remove references relating to water. However, the schedule also contains two references to telecommunications. Paragraph 1(b) relates to the Telecommunications Authority and the Telecommunications Consumer Council. Paragraph 9(1) also refers to the Telecommunications Consumer Council. Why are those items not being taken here? Were amendments made when the big raft of amendments came through, deleting a pile of clauses? Assuming that the three amendments relating to water have already been made, why are they still on the amendment paper, when there are none on it for telecommunications? People outside this place would be very confused if those references appeared to still be in the Bill. At this stage, we have had no Government amendments to remove them.

<P>
I was a little surprised that the Minister seemed to be decrying the fact that we had said that there would probably be about 900 amendments. As we know, the Government have halved the Bill. We are now up to 814 amendments, and I am told that we have had 328 Government amendments so far. We can split 900 in half, and say that there will be 450 amendments. I suspect that the Government amendments alone will be well over that amount, so I am surprised that they were surprised at our first estimation.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The telecoms items mentioned by the hon. Gentleman are consequential to clauses that already stand part and will be removed on Report. Amendments Nos. 451 to 453 will remove provisions relating to water in schedule 3. They were considered at the 11th sitting on 7 March.

<P>
The existing members of the Ofgem technical directorate, who are appointed as competent persons, total 60. They carry out many tasks; for example, the testing of meters. At present, there is no reason why that number of competent persons should be enlarged, because they already undertake those tasks.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister was obviously sent a note by his officials saying that the number of people employed in the task has been dealt with under schedule 3. Now that we have reached that schedule, I think that he has discovered, as I have, that the number of people who might be employed under the previous clause that we discussed is not mentioned. The schedule simply deals with the transfer of employees. It does not refer to the total number of people who could be employed under that previous clause.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman is not seriously suggesting that the number of people employed by such bodies should be in the Bill. That number will change from day to day, as always.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I was hoping that the Minister would give us some information. I was letting him make a speech, but let us assume that he has just intervened on my speech. Earlier, I asked how many people he had been told that the authority was planning to employ, what they would be doing and how that would differ from what they were doing previously. It is reasonable to discuss those matters in Committee, without making provision for them in the Bill. If I had thought that the Bill should deal with them, I would have tabled amendments to that effect. The Minister has asked us to give powers to the authority, and I thought that we would have been entitled to ask him how many people would be employed. Has he received an assurance that the same number of staff will be employed?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question. I certainly did not say that the council would not be able to employ more people. The council does not technically exist. Earlier, we discussed at length the number of people who were employed. Ofgem and the gas consumers council currently employ 230 people in work that will be undertaken by the new council in future. Of those, 110 work for the gas consumers council, and between 100 and 140 staff are employed by Ofgem in activities that will in future be undertaken by the consumer council.

<P>
The consultation document issued by Ann Robinson, the chairman, envisages five regional offices for the new council. The consultation exercise ended on 29 March and I expect to receive considered proposals on the future structure of the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council once she has considered the representations. Those proposals will include her thoughts on staffing levels. I do not know whether that is the detail for which the hon. Gentleman is searching. We have discussed the matter previously. It is part of the day-to-day business of running Ofgem and the council, which is dealt with by schedule 3. I would have thought that that would satisfy him. If not, I shall try to answer his questions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> If the Minister would be kind enough to read the Hansard report, he will see my questions. I shall not repeat them again. A note to members of the Committee would be helpful. He spoke about the council, but we are concerned about officials in the authority who do specific testing work. How many do it now, what is the likely number in the future, and will their functions change? He does not appear to have sufficient detail to answer those questions now.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> On the contrary, I pointed out that the total number of staff in the Ofgem technical directorate, including the competent persons referred to-who may be appointed as required by the Bill-is 60. As well as testing for quality of gas and black dust, they have many other functions, such as testing meters. If that is the answer that the hon. Gentleman requires, I am happy to provide it.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Schedule 3, as amended, agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 124</center></H4>
<H4><center>Specialist members of the Competition Commission</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 789, in page 141, line 11, leave out ``eight'' and insert ``six''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: amendment No. 758, in page 141, line 11, leave out ``eight'' and insert ``four''.

<P>
Government Amendments Nos. 790, 791 and 794.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Clause 124 establishes a panel of specialist members of the Competition Commission to considering references in respect of licence modifications or the alteration of activities requiring a licence under the Gas Act 1986 or the Electricity Act 1989. The chairman of the commission must select at least one member of the panel to be part of any group formed to carry out such functions. During the Committee's 11th sitting, I undertook to introduce an amendment to change the number of members on the specialist panel, given that its scope no longer includes matters relating to water and telecommunications. The Government recognise that the Competition Commission will need some flexibility in assigning members to groups during the period when it faces more than one gas or electricity reference at the same time. That happened in 1987 when the British Gas Transco inquiry and the Northern Ireland Electricity inquiry were running simultaneously.

<P>
Amendment No. 789 provides for at least six specialist members for the purposes of such gas and electricity inquiries. That strikes the right balance between flexibility and efficiency in appointing specialist members to groups. We have consulted the Competition Commission and it agrees with us.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 758, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, could reduce the panel of specialists to only four members. That risks leaving the Competition Commission hamstrung during periods of overlapping energy regulatory references. I therefore ask him not to press the amendment to a Division. He has won a concession given that the number of members is now six instead of eight.

<P>
Amendment No. 790 extends the purpose of the specialist panel to considering modifications proposed by the regulator following licence modification references under the Gas Act 1986 or the Electricity Act 1989. That procedure is provided for in clauses 127 and 128, which the Committee will consider shortly. In a similar vein, amendment No. 791 makes it clear that the chairman of the Competition Commission must appoint at least one member of the specialist panel to a group performing that function as well as to groups formed to consider references in respect of licence modifications or the alteration of activities requiring a licence.

<P>
Amendment No. 794 extends the transitional provisions of clause 124 to ensure that nothing in the clause will affect any group that is selected to perform gas or electricity licence modification references.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State shall appoint not less than eight members of the Competition Commission  for the purpose of references to the Commission under or by virtue of any of the following provisions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then lists four Acts of Parliament: the Telecommunications Act 1984, the Gas Act 1986, the Electricity Act 1989 and the Water Industry Act 1991. However, references to the Telecommunications Act and the Electricity Act have been removed from the Bill. If eight members of the commission were regarded as the minimum number of members to deal with references to those four industries, surely the number of members should total four given that reference will now be made to two industries. If anything, the number of members should total less than four because gas and electricity are more similar industries than telecommunications and water or, indeed, water and gas or electricity.

<P>
The Minister talked about the commission being hamstrung. It is not. The Secretary of State can appoint more members than the number specified in the provision, given that reference is made only to the minimum number. Thus, he could easily appoint six even under the provision, as amended. Will the Minister explain why he cannot accept the simple logic that, if the number of statutes to which reference can be made is halved, why cannot the minimum number of members of the commission be halved?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Even if, in practice, the Secretary of State appoints more than the minimum number of specialist members, it would be wrong to specify in legislation a minimum number that is inadequate to meet the commission's needs. That is the bottom line. If there are not enough specialists, we could be in real trouble, as we certainly were in the example cited of the Northern Ireland case.

<P>
We have consulted widely on the matter. The withdrawal of the parts of the Bill relating to telecommunications and water make it look as if the Bill has been halved, but the hon. Gentleman knows full well that it has not. Those two sectors have come out, but it is possible that some problematic investigations will be undertaken into what remains, and the last thing that we need is for the Competition Commission to be short of the experts that it needs to conduct those investigations properly.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.
