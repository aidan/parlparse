<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000432"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Mr.
Parmjit Dhanda):</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Martlew.
I understand that it is your first outing in such a Committee; we are
lucky to have you. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The whole Committee obviously
agrees.</div><a name="06071253000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall carry on where I left off. Automatic barring without the right to
make representations will result from the most serious sexual offences
against children and vulnerable adults, such as the rape or sexual
assault of a child under 13 in the case of the children&#146;s barred
list, or inducement, threat or deception to procure sexual activity
from a person with a mental disorder in the case of the adult barred
list. Automatic barring with the right to representation will result
from a further list of serious sexual and violent offences, as well as
offences relating to the supply of drugs to children. It will be
evident from those examples that convictions or cautions for such
offences are in themselves evidence of a risk of harm and justify an
automatic bar, in the interests of safeguarding vulnerable
groups.</div><a name="06071253000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">More broadly,
amendment No. 120 suggests that the decision-making processes of the
independent barring board be set out in a code. Paragraph 13 of
schedule 2 allows regulations to specify the operational details of how
the IBB will carry out its functions. We envisage that the regulations
will specify how the IBB will gather evidence, and will deal with
representations by the individual, and the processes for verifying and
considering the evidence and representations.</div>
<a name="06071253000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations will be subject to the negative procedure. Under the Bill,
we have followed generally accepted principles for the delegation of
powers. According to those principles, secondary legislation is used
for subordinate provisions in cases where the overall legislative
framework is clearly in the Bill. Secondary legislation is also used
where flexibility is needed to ensure effective implementation and
where ability to respond to changing circumstances is
required&#151;for example, in respect of the future development of
children or the vulnerable adults work force. It may also be used for
operational, administrative and technical details that are not normally
set out in primary
legislation.</div><a name="06071253000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071253000433"></a><b class="B">Sarah
Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): Before the Minister leaves the
topic, may I pick up on the issue of the possibility of administrative
error, which I raised 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div>with him this morning? He will recall that a few months ago there was
big scandal in the media about the Criminal Records Bureau mixing up
people&#146;s identity and mistakenly identifying individuals as
having convictions. Does he concede that something similar could happen
under the Bill? As there is no appeal process, what processes are being
put in place to make sure that if someone&#146;s identity is
mistaken, the problem can be
corrected?</div><a name="06071253000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000434"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The hon. Lady makes a fair point. As I envisage
it, it will be the role of the IBB to receive direct representations
from people who feel that there has been a mistake. The IBB has the
power to remove a person included on the list as a result of
errors&#151;so, yes, it will take that kind of information on board.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>From a sedentary position, my hon. Friend the
Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) makes a very good point about ID
cards, which will be of great assistance to the work done under the
Bill. They would reduce the amount of time that it would typically take
the CRB to receive a disclosure by three weeks.</div>
<a name="06071253000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyway, getting back to the
amendment, I believe that the negative procedure is the right approach
in this context. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
agrees, because the regulations will deal with matters of operational
detail within the framework created by the Bill and provide for changes
to respond to future circumstances as a scheme is phased in and becomes
established.</div><a name="06071253000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 133 and 134 would ensure that no one under 18 would be
automatically included in the children&#146;s barred list and the
adults&#146; barred list, respectively. I am pleased to say that I
have some good news for the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)
on this group of amendments. I agree with the Opposition on this
principle, and the Government&#146;s policy is that no under-18s
would be included on either barred list automatically. Instead they
would be dealt with under a discretionary process and given the right
to make representations before the IBB takes its decision. The IBB
will, as with all discretionary cases, need to make a judgment on
whether the individual poses a risk to one of the groups and whether it
is appropriate to include them on either or both barred lists. We have
explained that clearly in another place and also on Second
Reading.</div> <a name="06071253000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend to
make the provision in regulations, which will specify prescribed
criteria for automatic barring. It would not be appropriate to do so in
the Bill, because we will specify other provisions relating to age in
regulations&#151;for example, that minimum barred periods will be
shorter for under-25s. I also explained that to the hon. Lady on Second
Reading. It would be inconsistent to have one age provision in the Bill
and other similar provisions in regulations. This kind of detail is
commonly dealt with in regulations, but I am happy to put on record the
fact that we intend to make those
changes.</div><a name="06071253000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 133 and 134 would also require the IBB to refer anyone under 18
years old whom it chooses to bar to therapeutic services, which would
be specified in regulations. The proposal would require referral to
service providers such as the national health service, local
authorities, children&#146;s social care services 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div>or appropriate charitable organisations. Unfortunately, that is
inconsistent with the IBB&#146;s primary role of maintaining the
barred lists, which is what the Bill is about. It would also be
unhelpful if an IBB referral to the therapeutic service provider was
made at the end of the process. The IBB decision is based on
information from the police, sector bodies, employers and courts, any
or all of which could advise the individual to seek medical or
psychiatric help at earlier stages or therapeutic services. To require
a referral of juveniles upon barring does not seem to be the most
effective way to help them and would add a process, when routes are
already established to gain access to that kind of support, such as the
child and adolescent mental health services, and local authorities are
required to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need. I
therefore ask hon. Members not to press the amendment to a
Division.</div>
<a name="06071253000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071253000435"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Maria Miller</b> (Basingstoke) (Con): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Martlew, and look forward to serving under your
chairmanship. I thank the Minister for his responses to the arguments
that were put forward by myself and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole (Annette Brooke). It was useful to get clarification from
the Minister on these issues, although it was concerning to hear that
the IBB has no discretion about people who are referred to it from the
Secretary of State. Obviously, that is how these things have been
proposed. Perhaps it could be viewed as being inconsistent with the
arm&#146;s-length approach, which the Secretary of State was at pains
to stress in
January.</div><a name="06071253000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am rather
disappointed that the Minister feels that it is inappropriate to define
the code of practice in the Bill, although I was glad to hear that it
will be subject to regulations. It is important that such bodies are
clear and transparent in how they operate, and we should do everything
that we can to ensure that that is the case. The Minister
suggested&#151;I hope that I understood him correctly&#151;that the
code of practice will be proposed by way of the negative procedure. If
that is the case, it is a concern. Everything to do with the Bill has
been of great concern to the House, and Members would want to have
every opportunity to debate the issues in great
detail<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i> It sounds as though someone
disagrees with me from a sedentary position. I must take issue, because
this is a matter of great concern to many constituents throughout the
country and many hon. Members want to know the details of how the
organisation will work. Many of the organisations and processes that
are currently in place are simply not working as they should and we
must look for the correct level of
scrutiny.</div><a name="06071253000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
touch briefly on amendments Nos. 133 and 134. It was good to hear that
the Government are taking heed of the amendments, and I hope that that
is a sign of things to come on other amendments. It is worth pointing
out that we have not always clarified Bills through other processes,
such as regulations, and we must ask ourselves what the point of
debating the Bill is if, first, the House does not debate it in detail
and, secondly, the details are not articulated in the body of the Bill.
On Second Reading, I asked when that became the regular way of doing
things and whether it is helpful to hon. Members when discussing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>Bills or to those who administer Bills. We should always aid the debate
of legislation and it is not helpful to debate Bills, which will become
Acts, if the details are not laid down in them.</div>
<a name="06071253000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to hear that the
Minister has some sympathy with the amendment, but I must press him to
reconsider his stance on the use of regulations instead of including
the details in the Bill, so that we can debate them in the
House.</div><a name="06071253000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071253000436"></a><b class="B">Annette

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000437"></a>The

speech on the amendment, but I shall use my discretion and allow the
hon. Lady to
speak.</div><a name="06071253000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000438"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I really do welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Martlew.
It will be a great pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship.</div><a name="06071253000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to make a few brief points. Liberal Democrat Members are still confused
about the automatic barring. If there are no representations and no
appeal, how can there be a check on whether there is an error in the
listing? Will the Minister please answer that, so that we know where we
stand?</div><a name="06071253000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendments Nos. 133 and 134, I am pleased that there will be something
in regulations because the point is important. I notice that the
Minister in his amendments specifies under-16s later on, but I want to
quit while I am ahead and accept that the details will be in
regulations.</div><a name="06071253000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000439"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I assure the hon. Lady that it is not our
intention that the IBB will be an all-seeing, monstrous beast. I want
to make it clear to the hon. Member for Brent, East that, if someone is
on a barred list because they have committed, for example, rape of a
child&#151;we are talking about the most serious crimes for which
offenders receive an automatic bar without the right of
representation&#151;but says that they did not commit the crime and
are not in prison and the IBB then receives correspondence from that
person, it has the right to take that person off the list and admit
that it made a mistake. That is what we envisage it would
do.</div><a name="06071253000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000440"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I think my hon. Friend and I are both relieved to
hear that answer.</div><a name="06071253000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed about the therapeutic services point. I moved an amendment
to the Children Bill 2004, which would have covered the health
authority, local authority and the police, but I could not persuade the
then Minister that that was appropriate. I wonder whether there will
ever be a time in this country when everyone who needs therapeutic
services will actually be referred to them. I am sure that I shall
revisit the issue in yet another guise, but I am disappointed because
the same points were made in relation to the Children Act 2004 and the
Sexual Offences Act 2003, yet we still know that young people are not
getting the treatment that they need. I hope that the Minister will
consider that in his wider role, because it is important.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000443"></a>The

amendment No. 52, in schedule 2, page 37, line 16, leave out
sub-sub-paragraph
(a).</div><a name="06071253000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000444"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The second string of amendments to schedule 2
consists of amendments Nos. 50 and 52. Those amendments would change
the Bill so that there would be no automatic bar on reference
fromthe Secretary of State without the opportunity
tomake representations first. That follows the same theme as
before. Amendment No. 50 would remove the obligation to place directly
on to the barred list those who are referred to the IBB for
consideration for barring. Amendment No. 51 places a duty on the IBB to
inform relevant organisations that a person is under consideration for
barring. The amendments are therefore obviously linked.</div>
<a name="06071253000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Bill stands, the IBB
must automatically bar an individual on referral. As we discussed this
morning, the threshold for that referral is the belief that somebody
has undertaken an activity construable as inconsistent with holding a
job relating to vulnerable adults or children. We have rehearsed the
arguments on why that is the appropriate threshold for referral and the
Minister has made clear his view. On the strength of the threshold, an
individual can be put forward to be automatically barred from the list
until the case is reviewed. It is entirely possible that there are
other meanings, and the Minister might want to clarify the position,
but that is the way that the Bill reads
now.</div><a name="06071253000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to know why the Bill is worded that way, however.
Obviously, we want to remove individuals from settings where there is
potential for harm, but there are some clear consequences that would
ensue from that procedure. When the new legislation is enacted, there
could well be a great many people who are referred to the IBB because
of a lack of understanding and clarity on the nature of the threshold
for barring. We could end up with a situation in which many people are
proposed for barring and are put on the list, but then need to have
their cases reviewed because their cases are believed to be unsound.
That could undermine the credibility of the
IBB.</div><a name="06071253000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment attempts to achieve what the Minister is trying to achieve in
the Bill, but differently. It might be desirable for individuals to be
put forward for potential barring, but it is not desirable that they
continue in situations that would potentially cause vulnerable adults
or children to be exposed to unnecessary risk. However, is it
absolutely necessary to put them on the list straight
away?</div><a name="06071253000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 51
would ensure that even when somebody is being considered for barring,
employers would be aware of the situation and would be obliged to take
appropriate action to ensure the safety of vulnerable adults and
children. We would have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>consult various bodies on the operation of the amendment in practice.
However, those operational details could be incorporated into the
copious volumes of regulations and codes of practice that will follow
the legislation. One can anticipate that employers would take the
stance that individuals should be suspended while they are being
investigated by the IBB. However, I should like to press the Minister
on whether we should consider anonymity for individuals who are under
referral, until a ruling has been made.</div>
<a name="06071253000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister will take the opportunity to clarify that point, because
taking the course of action that is proposed could cause unnecessary
complications in the procedure. If he would explain a little more fully
how it might work in practice and why the amendments are not required,
I should be most grateful.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000445"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I think that, all in all, the
hon. Lady is doing a decent job of scrutiny. I do not mean to patronise
her, but she has got it wrong on this particular area, which is why I
am hoping that she will not press her amendments to a Division. I can
assure her that there is no danger of somebody who is in the work force
being automatically barred as a consequence of a referral. I therefore
hope that she will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071253000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
automatic inclusion provisions apply only to the prescribed
criteria&#151;convictions or cautions. Where there are allegations
against someone in the workplace, such as a teacher in a school, once a
referral has been made to the IBB that person will not be suspended or
stopped from working. They will have a right to make representations. I
can assure the hon. Lady that she has slightly misread the Bill in that
respect, so I hope she will not press her amendments to a Division. It
is a complex Bill and I can understand why she may have drawn her
conclusion, but I can reassure her that what she outlined is not the
case.</div><a name="06071253000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
50 and 52 would remove the provisions in paragraphs (2) and (7) to
schedule 2 stating that the IBB would include individuals in the barred
lists as a result of automatic barring offences where the individual is
given a right to make representations. Our intention in making
provision for automatic barring with a right to make representations
and a right of appeal was to afford the maximum protection to
vulnerable groups by immediately removing the group of people who had
committed a range of serious offences&#151;I must emphasise that we
are talking about serious offences&#151;from positions where they
could cause harm to children or vulnerable
adults.</div><a name="06071253000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the same time, we will ensure that the system is fair by providing a
right to make representations to reflect the fact that in these cases
an assessment of risk should be made by the IBB following barring so
that there is a possibility that such an individual may be removed from
the list. I am talking even about the most serious cases. We envisage
that unless the representations that the individual makes clearly
demonstrate that they did not pose a risk of harm, the IBB would not
remove them from the barred list.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div><a name="06071253000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the IBB has decided to
retain an individual on the barred list, there would be a right of
appeal to ensure that any mistakes in findings of fact or law could be
rectified. If we did not have such a provision, fairness would dictate
that the IBB would have to provide a right to make representations
before barring and effectively treat the offences under a discretionary
route. That would reduce protection for vulnerable groups. The
provision is a key element of the barring scheme and of ensuring that
we are able to provide the safeguards that vulnerable groups deserve. I
therefore ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment. I hope that I
have been able to help clarify the reasons behind the Bill as it
stands.</div>
<a name="06071253000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000446"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for clarifying that. It is
reassuring to know what is and what is not the intention behind what is
included in the Bill. I feel that the use of language in the Bill and
the over-complexity of the Bill makes its interpretation a little
questionable. Will he consider the many people who will have to
interpret the Bill&#146;s content and how we can make it easier and
more straightforward?</div>
<a name="06071253000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000447"></a>Mr.

ensure that we take such action to ensure that that kind of confusion
does not occur.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000448"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I want to make a final point on this matter. The
process is complex; perhaps it has to be complex. I reiterate the point
that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole made earlier about
people being included on the list automatically, even when there is
potential for error, because the rules of the game must be clear when
we communicate the end product of the Bill to people who are affected
by it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06071253000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000451"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> This group of amendments is relatively
straightforward. I shall be interested to hear the
Under-Secretary&#146;s response, because this subject was discussed
in the other
place.</div><a name="06071253000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 29 focuses on removing the discrepancy on conduct involving
pornography concerning adults and children in the two parts of schedule
2, as was discussed in the House of Lords. Amendments Nos. 48 and 49
relate to defining inappropriate conduct inschedule 2. The
amendments are all about better defining 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div>conduct that might prove prejudicial against individuals and prevent
them from working with children or vulnerable adults. Like many of our
amendments, they are intended to clarify, probe and therefore
strengthen the
Bill.</div><a name="06071253000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 29
would remove an inconsistency identified by many interest groups and
Members of both Houses of Parliament. Currently, there is a provision
relating to child pornography and relevant conduct that might bar
people from working with children, whereas the measure relating to
relevant conduct in relation to vulnerable adults mentions all
pornography, without the qualifier, &#147;child&#148;. It is for
the IBB to assess whether conduct relating to pornography is
inappropriate. The Bill does not state that possession of pornography
would, in itself, lead to barring, but we need to take some time to
understand this issue. I was interested to hear that the Government
have not tabled an amendment on this schedule, even though there was a
heavy indication from Lord Adonis that one would be tabled on Report,
primarily because he felt that there was great merit in this
argument.</div><a name="06071253000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference between the two elements of the schedule, relating either to
children or to vulnerable adults, needs to be removed, because&#151;I
am sure the Under-Secretary has been briefed on this&#151;there is a
genre of pornography that depicts adults as children or babies. The
caveat in that part of the Bill is at best confusing and does not
provide the clarity that we need. It is irrelevant whether the
pornography that is deemed to be used inappropriately relates to
children or adults; if it results in behaviour that causes concern, the
IBB should be able to consider it in whatever form it
takes.</div><a name="06071253000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000452"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I may have more good news for the hon. Lady. As
she has said, there has already been a lot of discussion about this
difficult issue in the other place. Lord Adonis advised on Third
Reading that further analysis was needed to agree the precise words to
assure that the requirements for both lists provided the necessary
protection to both groups. He made it clear that that would involve
considering both provisions for both children and adults to ensure that
we deal with all the situations that we wish to
cover.</div><a name="06071253000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we expected,
the issue is particularly complex, for some of the reasons that the
hon. Lady mentioned. We have yet to resolve it, but we remain committed
to doing so. I know from discussion here and in the other place that
there is agreement, but we must ensure that amendments do not create a
situation whereby a large number of individuals are referred to the IBB
for legitimate behaviour relating to adult pornography, which is not
illegal and the use of which will not generally be of concern to the
IBB.</div><a name="06071253000400"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con):
I appreciate that this is a thorny subject and that

undertaken a consultation on the use of extreme images on the internet,

pornography is a separate issue, the downloading, possession and
possible acting

bring in offences to clamp down on
it.</div><a name="06071253000075"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000462"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The amendments relate to the
harm test, which is an important provision in the Bill setting out
behaviour that will qualify somebody to be considered for barring. It
is important that the definition should be clear in our minds and that
those who interpret the Bill have all the information that they can
have, truly to understand the actions that they need to take and the
standard of proof that is required, to ensure that the legislation is
put forward in the way that is
intended.</div><a name="06071253000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there is no clear definition of &#147;harm&#148; in the Bill as it
stands. When the issue was raised in the other place, correspondence on
the matter followed from Lord Adonis. Before I comment on that, I shall
explain the amendment. It is intended to define &#147;harm&#148;,
which means</div>
<a name="06071253000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ill-treatment or the impairment
of health or development including, for example, impairment suffered
from seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of
another&#148;.</div><a name="06071253000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Development&#148;
means</div> <a name="06071253000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;physical,
intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural
development&#148;,</div><a name="06071253000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;health&#148;
means &#147;physical or mental health&#148;, and
&#147;ill-treatment&#148;
includes</div><a name="06071253000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sexual abuse
and forms of ill-treatment which are not
physical.&#148;</div><a name="06071253000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Harm
and the harm test are fundamental planks of the legislation, and
references to them appear throughout the Bill, in schedule 2, and in
clauses 27, 28, 31, 33 and 36&#151;hence the long string of
amendments in the group, to ensure that we cover all references to the
concept in the Bill. The amendment seeks to define &#147;harm&#148;
as a key term in the Bill. How can parents, employers and social
service practitioners be expected to know their responsibilities under
the Bill if such a fundamental concept as harm is not clearly and
unequivocally defined?</div>
<a name="06071253000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I mentioned, Lord Adonis
said in correspondence on the issue that the common-sense definition of
harm would stand. However, as I am sure the Minister is aware, common
sense has no legal meaning. By leaving the Bill as it is drafted, we
risk creating confusion and inconsistency in the system, and
potentially make more work for lawyers, which we would not want to do.
We are anxious to make the Bill as simple and clear as possible. That
sentiment not only was articulated when the Bill was discussed in full
in the other place, but has been expressed by a number of pressure
groups. The concept requires further definition.</div>
<a name="06071253000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group of
amendments use an existing and well-understood definition of harm,
namely that which is contained in section 31(9) of the Children Act
1989. That definition and its reference to &#147;development&#148;
has been said perhaps to be more appropriate for children than for
vulnerable adults, and the Minister might want to pick up on that in
his response. However, it is not necessary for all the elements of the
harm test to come 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>into play at once. Therefore, we on the Conservative Benches feel that
it would be entirely appropriate to include this reasonably lengthy
definition of harm in the Bill, so that those who interpret it know
what we mean. Although some parts of the definition would perhaps not
be deemed appropriate for all the vulnerable groups for whom the Bill
is important, it would be a catch-all for
most.</div><a name="06071253000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
tabled the amendments in the spirit of highlighting that point and
implore the Government better to define such a key term, to ensure that
the system works. I again point out that the Bichard report&#146;s
overriding message was that it is vital to ensure clarity in such
areas, but there are too many loose ends in the Bill to ensure that
clarity. I hope that the Minister seizes this opportunity to improve
the Bill, to provide that clarity and to make it a more workable piece
of legislation at the end of the
day.</div><a name="06071253000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000463"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I am concerned about the lack of
a definition of harm. I can see that in some ways that might mean that
it will have such a wide interpretation that everything could be
covered, which in some sense could be useful. However, it slightly
offends my logic that we do not know what it includes. I have
particular concerns about some issues that were raised by organisations
that represent older people. If the personal property or even the
personal allowance element of money that is paid in to a care home
automatically was withheld from a patient, would that definitively come
under the definition of harm? I am not sure that it comes under the
definition with these amendments, but I am quite concerned about the
financial element when we are talking about elder abuse. Sadly, it
often happens that people make friends with an elderly person, visit
them in their home and then a few things just disappear. Sometimes it
is the price of having some company, which is a really sad state of
affairs.</div><a name="06071253000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
subject that was raised by some of the organisations representing the
elderly was dignity. It is very difficult to calculate an infringement
of dignity in the definition of harm, but dignity is an important
principle. This is so difficult to define that I am not convinced that
the amendments cover everything that needs to be covered. Therefore, in
a sense that is an argument against getting a definition, but on the
other hand is the Minister convinced that the Bill will be workable if
it is left as it
is?</div><a name="06071253000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000464"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Hon. Members are right. This
debate lasted for some hours in another place. This group of amendments
seeks to provide a definition of harm to cover a range of circumstances
in the Bill. They define the term for the purposes of referrals by
employers, local authorities and regulatory and supervisory bodies to
the IBB. The definition would also apply where the IBB was considering
an individual for inclusion in a barred list. The meaning of the word
&#147;harm&#148; is clearly central to many elements of this Bill.
On that we are all agreed. With that in mind, I fully sympathise with
the intentions of hon. Members in tabling the amendments, but they do
not take us beyond the point that we have reached already with our
proposals for the meaning of the term. I shall explain that in a
moment, not least with reference to what the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset
and North Poole said about elderly people and finance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div><a name="06071253000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for
Basingstoke said, the definition used in these amendments is taken from
section 31 of the Children Act 1989, as amended by the Adoption and
Children Act 2002. I would argue that the definition of harm in that
section serves a different purpose from the one that we are trying to
achieve in the Bill. That section is about care and supervision orders
and sets the conditions that must be satisfied before a court grants
such an order. The threshold is deliberately defined in that definition
as significant harm. We must ask ourselves whether that is what we want
to put in the Bill
today.</div><a name="06071253000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
purposes of the Bill, however, we want employers, local authorities and
others, to refer information to the IBB and the IBB itself to place an
individual on the barred list when the conditions set out in the Bill
are met. The Bill is concerned with referrals being made and
individuals being barred in accordance with the specific thresholds
that will underpin the effective functioning of the
scheme.</div><a name="06071253000401"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="06071253000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the IBB to
include an individual on the barred list, it must think it appropriate
to include them. In other words, the IBB will be required to decide
whether an individual&#146;s conduct, or the risk that they may harm
a child or vulnerable adult is sufficiently serious for them to be
included on the list. The conditions are central to defining the
thresholds in a way that is appropriate for the purposes of the Bill,
which are different from the purposes of the Children Act
1989.</div><a name="06071253000105"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000465"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Is the Minister saying that he does not want a
definition, or that this is the wrong definition? Perhaps he could
clarify that. In his response, he is saying that it might be the wrong
definition. Perhaps it would help if we looked for another definition
of
harm.</div><a name="06071253000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000466"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I would be delighted if, during her winding-up
speech, the hon. Lady were to suggest another, better definition. I
would be happy to consider that during the debate. I shall come to the
definition that we are using in a moment. Her definition relates
specifically to supervision orders, and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset
and North Poole made some good points during debate on earlier clauses
about simplicity and the need for people to understand the Bill. We are
discussing the usual use of the word &#147;harm&#148;, but I shall
elaborate on that in a
moment.</div><a name="06071253000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we define the precise meaning of harm as the amendments suggest, there
is a danger that we will unnecessarily restrict the circumstances in
which an employer, for example, can refer information to the IBB or the
IBB itself can consider barring an individual. It is not clear, for
instance, whether the suggested definition would allow the IBB to
determine whether an individual had harmed a vulnerable adult if they
had defrauded elderly care home residents, who the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned. Is that what we want to do? That
would be the consequence of the
amendment.</div><a name="06071253000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government believe that it is far better for harm to take its normal
meaning, which covers our intentions for the scheme. That includes
damage to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>child or vulnerable adult&#146;s mental or emotional state as well as
physical harm. It will include acts of omission as well as commission.
The meaning of the word would not be restricted to physical or indeed
any other kind of consequences. In the case of vulnerable adults, it
might also include harm incurred through financial loss. With all that
in mind, I hope that hon. Members will see fit not to press their
amendments, or perhaps they will present a better definition in their
winding-up
speeches.</div><a name="06071253000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000467"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="06071253000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000468"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am afraid that I have concluded my
remarks.</div><a name="06071253000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000469"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for his
response on that string of amendments&#151;at least, I think I do. I
certainly thank the Liberal Democrats for their support, albeit with
some reservations, for the
amendments.</div><a name="06071253000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said, the concept of harm is central to the Bill. We have used
the definition from another Bill to illustrate the need to include a
firmer definition in this one. I think that all Members would be open
to considering alternatives that may cover the
issues&#151;</div><a name="06071253000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000470"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> Does the hon. Lady agree that there is a problem
with leaving the definition so broad? I can imagine, for example, a
situation in which a bad teacher instilled low self-esteem in a child.
Would that count as harm? Unless it is quite tightly defined, there is
a danger that, in a whole set of issues, somebody might be eligible for
barring. I understand the Minister&#146;s point about wanting the
widest possible range of people, but that is quite different from the
legalistic way that we expect the independent board to make decisions
about who should be
barred.</div><a name="06071253000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000471"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her
contribution. It shows the strength of feeling in the Opposition about
the issue and the need for the Minister to reconsider it before Report.
As she says, the concept is currently used as a catch-all for many
different activities.</div>
<a name="06071253000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, we
must consider what we are trying to achieve with the Bill. We are
trying to achieve clarity, and if we fail to do that, we will fail in
our duty to protect the people whom we are here to serve&#151;the
vulnerable people and children for whom we are trying to provide more
protection. I asked the Minister whether he would like to have a
different definition rather than this one. I got the impression that he
was quite interested in pursuing a further definition. Perhaps he is as
uncomfortable with Lord Adonis&#146;s concept as we
are.</div><a name="06071253000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000472"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I am comfortable with it. The hon. Lady needs to
be aware that, regarding discretionary barring, a risk of harm alone is
not sufficient for the IBB to place a person on the barred list. There
is an additional appropriateness list set out in the Bill. Together
with the normal definition of harm to which we are accustomed in
society, that makes this a good rationale for us to move
forward.</div><a name="06071253000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000473"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification. I
still think that it is a broad, catch-all concept that says that
anything that constitutes harm 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div>can be construed as behaviour that would, if not completely, at least
partially, put somebody forward for consideration to be
barred.</div> <a name="06071253000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
difficult when we are struggling with English in the provision. We have
heard from the Opposition Benches and from other groups that a tighter
definition of harm may be helpful. Yet the Minister said that it would
only ever be part of a decision-making process and that we do not have
to worry too much about it. I do not take much comfort from that. If we
are going to use concepts and terms within Bills that we are struggling
with, let us think about those who are trying to interpret it, who may
not have the
assistance&#151;</div><a name="06071253000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000474"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000475"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> Absolutely. A great number of groups in my
constituency will be forced to take account of what is in this Bill.
They do not have the funds to employ an army of lawyers to go through
it with a toothcomb to attempt to understand the minutiae of the
provision. The Minister needs to remember for whom such legislation is
introduced.</div> <a name="06071253000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has heard from the Opposition that concern remains about
leaving the concept of harm so broadly defined. It is our intention to
return to the matter at a later stage, perhaps when we have had the
opportunity further to discuss with him his particular concerns with
the amendment in its current form. We will do a great service to many
people if we are able to pursue and to receive further clarification on
the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
</div><a name="06071253000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000476"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 116, in
schedule 2, page 38, line 27, leave
out sub-paragraph (1) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) IBB must ensure
that, on receipt of any information in relation to an individual from
whatever source or of whatever nature, it considers whether the
individual should be included in both barred lists, in one barred list,
or in neither barred
list.&#146;.</div><a name="06071253000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000477"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 54, in schedule 2, page 38,line 31, leave out
sub-paragraph
(2).</div><a name="06071253000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000478"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I thought I had better justify my existence here
today. Amendments Nos. 116 and 54 are probing and relate to schedule 2.
My hon. Friend said just now that we are struggling with English in
this Bill. This is again a classic example of the way in which many
parts of this Bill are opaque in the extreme.</div>
<a name="06071253000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The offending provision is
paragraph 11(1) of part 3 of this schedule. Mr. Martlew, if you can
make any sense of it, you are a greater man than I am. It
reads:</div><a name="06071253000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;IBB
must ensure that in respect of any information it receives in relation
to an individual from whatever source of or whatever nature it
considers whether the information is relevant to its consideration as
to whether the individual should be included in the barred
list.&#148;</div><a name="06071253000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is not a
single punctuation mark in that entire sentence, so it is not easy to
grasp. When one gets ones head round it, however, it appears to
be&#151;in common parlance&#151;stating the bleeding obvious.
Naturally, the IBB&#146;s job is properly to consider any information
put to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div>it, and to decide whether that information is germane and relevant to
subsequent action by the IBB, but the wording of the provision is
terribly woolly, which is why we have suggested an amendment that in my
view reads much more clearly. As well as containing some punctuation,
which is no bad thing, the amendment has the added advantage of
including a cut-across between the two lists&#151;the child&#146;s
list and the adults&#146; list&#151;thereby strengthening the
Bill.</div><a name="06071253000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
concerns among certain organisations as to whether inclusion on one
list should effectively mean automatic inclusion on another list. Some
of them would like to see that, and the wording of amendment No. 116
would make it much clearer that the IBB should consider whether the
individual under consideration</div>
<a name="06071253000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should be included in both barred
lists, in one barred list, or in neither barred
list.&#148;</div><a name="06071253000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is plain and
unambiguous, which one cannot say for a lot of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06071253000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 54 refers to
paragraph 11(2), which I just cannot understand. That sub-paragraph
says:</div><a name="06071253000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subparagraph
(1) does not,&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071253000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">at
least we have
punctuation&#151;</div><a name="06071253000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;without
more,&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071253000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">it looks
as though there is a word
missing&#151;</div><a name="06071253000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;require
IBB to give an individual the opportunity to make representations as to
why he should not be included in a barred
list.&#148;</div><a name="06071253000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been doing
Bills for some years, and I have not previously come across the phrase
&#147;without more&#148;. I may be missing something, and I hope
that the Minister will enlighten us and tell us that the term is
perfectly legitimate, so that at least in Committee we may understand
what &#147;without more&#148;&#151;without any noun or adjective
attached&#151;actually means. I hope that he will also explain why
the intention is apparently to prevent individuals from making
representations that they should not be included on the
list.</div><a name="06071253000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid that
this particular part of the schedule is especially woolly and badly
worded, and the intention is not clear. The amendments are supposed to
be constructive and I think that it is quite plain what we are trying
to say. I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s justification of
why paragraph 11(2) should remain in the Bill, and his explanation of
what &#147;without more&#148;
means.</div><a name="06071253000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000479"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Before I set out the unintended consequences of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s probing amendment, regardless of how clear
the English of it might be, I am reliably informed that the offending
paragraph to which he referred was inserted in the Lords to make
explicit what was implied. The Government were responding to pressure
to ensure that the Bill stated the obvious, and I shall explain more
about what that obvious thing is&#151;we shall probably have some
level of agreement on that.</div>
<a name="06071253000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 116 would remove
paragraph 11(1) of schedule 2 and replace it with a different
provision. Amendment No. 54 would remove paragraph 11(2) of the
schedule. Paragraph 11(1) makes it explicit that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>IBB is under a duty to consider all information thatit receives
in relation to both the children&#146;s and vulnerable adults&#146;
barred lists. IBB experts will then exercise their judgment to decide
whether the information merits further consideration in respect of both
or one of the lists. The IBB will then give the individual the
opportunity to make representations on all the evidence on which it may
base its decision, so that the individual might demonstrate that they
do not pose a risk of harm to either or both vulnerable groups.
</div><a name="06071253000402"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="06071253000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
is important. It was created by Government amendment in another place
to make explicit in the Bill what was already implicit. There was much
debate about the issue, and all parties welcomed the resultant
amendment. Lord Adonis noted that the amendment would ensure proper
consideration of cases that are referred from both lists. That is the
principle: if an individual is referred to the IBB, they can be
considered for both lists.</div>
<a name="06071253000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 116 would replace
that provision. The IBB would proceed to full consideration of the case
on receipt of any information by gathering evidence and giving the
individual the opportunity to make representations, rather than first
being able to consider whether the information is relevant. It is
important that the IBB can use its discretion to consider information
and choose not to proceed to a further stage where, for example, the
information is clearly false or malicious. That is why I refer to the
unintended consequence of the probing amendment.</div>
<a name="06071253000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sub-paragraph (2) clarifies
that the opportunity to make representations does not arise in every
case, as the IBB, having considered some information, may conclude that
it does not warrant the individual&#146;s inclusion on the list. If
the IBB considers it appropriate to include a person on the list, it
must give the individual the opportunity to make
representations.</div>
<a name="06071253000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
54 would remove the clarification that paragraph 11(2) provides, but
the IBB would nevertheless be required to give an individual the
opportunity to make representations in every case when the information
indicated a risk of harm. I hope that that provides some clarification
for the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and that my remarks
provide clarity for anybody who should look up the clause. With all
that considered, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
probing amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000485"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> These are again largely probing amendments, but
they follow the principle, to which we like to adhere, of making
explicit in the Bill as much as possible and ensuring that anything
left to the Secretary of State should be made by affirmative
resolution, giving the House sufficient opportunity to scrutinise
it.</div><a name="06071253000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 30
brings us back to a favourite battleground: the substitution of the
word &#147;may&#148; with &#147;shall&#148; on the basis of the
preference that I have just expressed. The provisions in part 3 of the
schedule are defined as &#147;supplementary&#148; but are actually
important and far-ranging. Paragraph 13(1) gives the Secretary of State
the power, by regulations,
to</div><a name="06071253000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make provision as to
the procedure to be followed for the purposes of any decision IBB is
required or authorised to take under this
Schedule.&#148;</div><a name="06071253000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
is at the guts of the Bill, and that is a far-reaching sub-paragraph.
It gives the Secretary of State power to change all the procedures that
the IBB will follow; that is, all the detail that we have debated and
tried to tease out from the Minister. The Secretary of State, if he so
wishes, will be able to change that detail by regulation on a whim. He
will be able to change the whole nature of the procedures followed to
enable people to be referred to and investigated by the IBB. On that
basis, it is essential that the Secretary of State
&#147;shall&#148; do that by regulations rather than just by order.
Contingent on that is amendment No. 31, stating that such regulations
should be</div> <a name="06071253000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to
the affirmative resolution procedure&#148;.</div>
<a name="06071253000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are considering an important part of
the Bill that is not just about day-to-day running, so it should be
subject to the full scrutiny of the
House.</div><a name="06071253000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
109 is on a similar theme, stating that the Secretary of State shall,
again by regulations subject to the affirmative resolution procedure,
make clear the
procedures</div><a name="06071253000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to be
followed for the purposes of removing any person from the
children&#146;s barred list or the adult&#146;s barred list;
and...the procedure to be followed for the purposes of referring
information or individuals to the
IBB.&#148;</div><a name="06071253000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such considerations
are important. If changes are to be made, we believe that that should
happen by regulations subject to affirmative resolution procedure if
the extra information is not to be put in the
Bill.</div><a name="06071253000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under proposed
new paragraph 13A(7), the timing must be made clear, too. The Bill does
not contain, as with much else, detail of timings. How long will the
procedure take whereby information about people is referred to the IBB
and various actions are taken 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>against them? If people are put under the spotlight, it is essential
that they can expect justice swiftly and fairly. As the Minister said,
we are potentially dealing with a great many people, so if the
information cannot be specified on the accompanying procedures with the
Bill, it must certainly be put in regulations to show that the IBB will
deal with the issues in a timely manner. Perhaps he can suggest what
would be defined as
timely.</div><a name="06071253000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now come to our two other amendments. I shall leave the other to the
Liberal Democrats to explain. Amendment No. 55 tries to put more detail
into the Bill about timings of the minimum barred period that will be
determined again by regulations that
are</div><a name="06071253000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure&#148;.</div>
<a name="06071253000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also suggests the procedure to be
followed on timings for those under the age of 18. I hope that that is
clear.</div><a name="06071253000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
119 refers to clause 5. It would pin down some detail of how the
Secretary of State can be scrutinised. Clause 5(3) gives an enormous
power to the Secretary of State. It
states:</div><a name="06071253000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may be order amend that Schedule so as to vary the
meaning of&#151;</div><a name="06071253000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
regulated activity relating to
children;</div><a name="06071253000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
regulated activity relating to vulnerable
adults.&#148;</div><a name="06071253000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition
of regulated activity is important. We need to know what occupations
and activities are covered by the Bill. Such detail needs to be
available at the
outset.</div><a name="06071253000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
gives the Secretary of State the power to change the whole meaning of
regulated activity, which is core to what the Bill wants to achieve. A
change can be made purely by order. Again, we believe that there should
be regulations subject to affirmative resolution of the House so that
matters can be properly scrutinised in Committee in a timely fashion,
otherwise we are giving considerable powers to a Secretary of State who
may choose for whatever reason to change the ground rules. For example,
the IBB might have made a hash of matters and not acted as intended
under the Bill. If that were the case, Parliament would need to know
about it. Parliament needs to know that the IBB, which has been charged
to set up an important initiative and has considerable powers, is
capable of getting it right and will not be subject to having its
ground rules changed at the whim of the Secretary of State without due
scrutiny by Parliament.</div>
<a name="06071253000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, these are
helpful amendments that try to take further the sort of detail that we
have been asking for all through the parliamentary stages of the Bill.
At the very least, if we are not to have the detail concomitant with
the passage of the Bill, we need to know that the Secretary of State
will be subject to further full and proper parliamentary scrutiny if he
chooses to change definitions and
procedures.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000486"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> I have great sympathy with the comments of the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about leaving vast amounts
of discretion to the Secretary of State. There is a great danger in
leaving so many powers so centralised and I look forward to hearing in
the Minister&#146;s reply why this is necessary.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div><a name="06071253000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
16 of schedule 2 describes a process of review for which someone may
apply if they have been included in a barred list. In amendment No. 111
we suggest a similar internal review mechanism for organisations or
individuals who refer somebody to the IBB but it decides not to include
them within the barred list. The Government made it clear in debates in
the other place that they are unwilling to consider any kind of
external review mechanism, but we think this kind of internal review
mechanism fits nicely within that proposed in the schedule and would
not fetter the IBB&#146;s expertise.</div>
<a name="06071253000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder whether this would be
an acceptable compromise that the Minister might wish to consider. It
does, of course, add an extra balance to the system as many of the
decisions proposed within the Bill are highly discretionary. We need
some kind of internal quality assurance mechanism, partly to ensure
that decisions are made on a consistent basis. We wonder whether this
kind of internal mechanism could give organisations the confidence of
knowing that they have an opportunity to challenge again if they feel
that their concerns have not been heard, but also leave the expertise
of decision making up to the body
itself.</div><a name="06071253000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000487"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> It would be interesting to know whether the hon.
Member for Brent, East thinks that the appeal mechanisms in the system
are insufficient and that another process is needed in addition to the
Care Standards Tribunal, the Court of Appeal and, ultimately, judicial
review. Perhaps she will come back on
that.</div><a name="06071253000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
amendments primarily address the issue of regulations and I should
first like to remind hon. Members that the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee is broadly content with the position set
out in the Bill and raised no concerns about the issues covered by
these amendments. Amendment No. 30 would ensure that the Secretary of
State will make regulations governing IBB decision-making procedures
under the provision in paragraph 13(1) of schedule 2. I can assure hon.
Members that we intend to make such regulations following Royal Assent.
We therefore see no need to specify in the Bill that the regulations
will, rather than may, be made. We would argue that a certain degree of
flexibility is helpful to allow regulations to be made covering those
aspects of IBB procedures that I have described as and when it becomes
necessary.</div><a name="06071253000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 31 requires that the regulations specifying IBB procedure would be
subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. We believe that that
would unnecessarily limit the flexibility to adapt these provisions to
changing circumstances and would require Parliament to give greater
oversight to matters of great detail in relation to the operation of
the IBB, which would customarily be left to standing regulations. It is
a convention that that would normally be the case. Having said that,
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham did mention some
specific areas, such as regulated activity, where the affirmative
process would be required. Within the context of this, some of those
regulations will be introduced by the affirmative
procedure.</div><a name="06071253000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000488"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I appreciate that some of these things may be
automatically subject to affirmative resolution. However, he has used
an often used phrase in defence of his position, which is that our
amendments would &#147;unnecessarily limit the flexibility&#148;.
Why?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div><a name="06071253000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000489"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> First and foremost, before the
regulations come into being, we want to have a period of consultation.
I believe that we have already said&#151;and I will be corrected if I
am wrong&#151;that we are looking for a period after Royal Assent
during autumn 2007 for completing the regulations, so that the Bill, or
rather the vetting scheme, can be in place during 2008. In order to do
that, we will need to go away and extensively consult stakeholders to
make sure that we do that appropriately.</div>
<a name="06071253000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We mentioned quite a few areas
involving regulation. I accept that there is a lot of regulation in the
Bill, but there is detail within it as well. As agreed by those on the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, the convention is
that it will be done in the usual way. The usual way is the negative
resolution process. However, I am more than willing to listen to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s case-by-case argument. I have made one such
case with regard to regulatory activity. He may feel that there will be
specific areas and regulations that should be done in a different way
and I would be interested to hear that.</div>
<a name="06071253000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.55 would ensure
that the minimum barred period would be specified in regulation,
subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I assure hon. Members
that it is our intention to make regulations specifying this period.
For the reasons already given, we believe that it is our position to
consult on the regulations before they are subject to the negative
resolution procedure, and that that is the most appropriate way to
ensure general
agreement.</div><a name="06071253000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
subject of age, which the hon. Gentleman raised, our current thinking
is that those over the age of 25, who have an automatic bar, would be
barred for an automatic period of 10 years and those under the age of
25, for five years. However, those are matters on which we wish to
consult
extensively.</div><a name="06071253000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 109 would require that the procedures for removing a person from
the barred list and making referrals to the IBB would be specified in
regulations subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Removal
from the list will be a key part of the IBB&#146;s role. Those
elements of this procedure that are appropriately specified in
regulations will be included in the regulations specifying IBB
decision-making procedure. However, we should not seek to limit the
IBB&#146;s discretion in carrying out its key function of including
or removing individuals from those barred
lists.</div><a name="06071253000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of this amendment would require the Secretary of State to
make regulations on the procedure for making referrals to the IBB. The
clauses that cover the duties to refer information to the IBB already
contain clear tests for the referral. That would place additional
burdens on informers and such burdens would achieve little of
value.</div> <a name="06071253000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
regulations would cover referrals from those who are not under a duty
to refer. Placing restrictions on the way that information can be
referred might limit the flow of information to the IBB, which could
have serious consequences for the protection of children and vulnerable
adults.</div><a name="06071253000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 111 would allow a referrer, usually an employer, to request an IBB
review of a decision not to include someone in the barred list. That
would introduce employer oversight of IBB decisions. I am not convinced
that employers are best placed to decide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 68</div>whether the IBB has erred, and I am unclear what new evidence employers
would have to contribute once the IBB had assembled information from
all relevant parties and come to a decision on the case. The amendment
would draw employers into initiating an appeals process, which is not a
role for them as far as existing barred lists are concerned. They would
require significant resources to pursue it
actively.</div><a name="06071253000184"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000490"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> The Minister asked me after I sat down whether I
felt that the Bill&#146;s appeals process was adequate. He will
realise that the appeals process allows only those included on the list
to appeal against it; it does not allow someone who has referred a
complaint and feels that it has not been satisfied to have that
decision reviewed. That is the point that we are trying to make. He
might have misunderstood
it.</div><a name="06071253000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000491"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I take the point, but I must disagree. Those
making the referral will have the right to know whether the person has
been barred, but the reasons why they have or have not been barred will
not be shared with the referrer for understandable reasons. Some
referrals could be vexatious. The evidence might be flimsy. There might
be a range of circumstances. We are discussing individuals who have
lives to lead. After the IBB has made a decision and expertly weighed
up all the evidence, those who made the referral will not necessarily
need to pry into it, although I agree with the hon. Lady that it would
be best to let them know what the IBB&#146;s decision is, and we
intend to do
that.</div><a name="06071253000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
IBB will have internal administrative procedures to ensure quality and
consistency in its decisions. For example, I would expect it to have
procedures governing the collection of all the information needed to
make a decision and to ensure that the necessary expertise is brought
to bear on decision making. IBB members and senior management will
establish systems for monitoring and quality control before rather than
after notification of decisions.</div>
<a name="06071253000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government envisage that
the IBB will engage actively with employers on the referral process, so
that they know what is required of them and in what circumstances they
should refer information. That will be an important part of the
IBB&#146;s role in ensuring the effective functioning of the scheme.
I hope that I have assured the hon. Lady that the scheme will work well
without the
amendment.</div><a name="06071253000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to amendment No. 119, which would ensure that any changes to the
definition of regulated activity are made through regulations subject
to the affirmative procedure. I reassure hon. Members that the
amendment is not necessary, because clause 46(3) already provides for
that. I hope that I have provided the clarification required, and I ask
hon. Members to withdraw their
amendments.</div><a name="06071253000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000492"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> The Liberal Democrats are still not convinced that
we have conveyed what we mean by the amendment. I am sure that that is
due to its wording rather than anything else. We envisage that a
referral from an organisation or individual that does not result in a
barring decision should have a right of review involving different
people making the decision. That would ensure consistency in decision
making. There 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 69</div>will inevitably be a lot of people making delegated decisions,
internally rather than in a rigid appeal process. There must be checks
and balances in the system so that somebody does not fall through the
net simply because a particular group did not act. We envisage that the
person or organisation concerned would have to prove in some way that
they had deep
concern.</div><a name="06071253000404"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="06071253000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000493"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I think I am getting a slightly better
understanding of what the amendment refers to. The internal processes
of the IBB will be a matter for itself, as it will be independent.
Although the hon. Lady&#146;s point is fair, I cannot comment on the
internal processes of the IBB. It is important that we have an
independent body, making expert decisions. I am sure that there will be
a process whereby those who have made a referral can send supporting
information to the
IBB.</div><a name="06071253000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000494"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister. We are
beginning to get on the same wavelength. I have a genuine concern that
something could be overlooked, because there is a lot of information
and some vital pieces of it might not picked up by a small panel of
people. I hope that the Minister, although he cannot dictate the
board&#146;s internal procedures, will give guidance&#151;not
written guidance&#151;that he expects a review process and a test of
the consistency of the board&#146;s
decisions.</div><a name="06071253000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000495"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I heard what the Minister said, which did not
surprise me. He used phrases that are common when Ministers are
resisting the putting of more detail in a Bill, particularly on tying
down the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to exercise the
considerable powers of regulation that he is given.</div>
<a name="06071253000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in no way trying to
limit, as the Minister put it, the IBB&#146;s discretion to carry out
its functions. We support the idea of the board and therefore its power
to get on with the job that we are tasking it to do. Nowhere in the
amendments do we seek to limit the IBB&#146;s discretion. We seek to
limit the discretion of the Secretary of State, whose role should be
subject to ongoing scrutiny by the House. At every appropriate juncture
when he makes and changes regulations, they should be subject to
affirmative scrutiny. That is the case in clause 5, which amendment No.
119 has usefully probed.</div>
<a name="06071253000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the Minister that the
Secretary of State is being given powers to make regulations that, the
Minister says, will be published after Royal Assent. I do not argue
about that; it is the case with all Bills. It would be desirable if a
Standing Committee could look at the regulations in tandem with the
Bill that gives them effect. That rarely happens, and in this case it
was even less likely to happen because of the necessary speed with
which the Bill was introduced after the Government had been rather
dilatory in responding to the Bichard
recommendations.</div><a name="06071253000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us remind ourselves that the Bichard report was published in June 2004.
It was only the scandals that hit the headlines at the beginning of
this year about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 70</div>paedophiles and other dubious individuals working in privileged
positions, particularly in schools alongside children, that prompted
the Bill. We welcome it, albeit rather late in the day after the
Bichard report. However, the lead time between the Government
announcing that they would introduce the Bill and their producing it
has necessarily been truncated because of the urgency of the situation.
We welcome that.</div> <a name="06071253000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that I am trying to make is that in those
circumstances&#151;less so than those with other Bills that have been
on the back burner for many years&#151;it would not be reasonable to
expect all the regulations to have been done and dusted and thought
through. That is why it is important to tease out some of the
Government&#146;s thinking, to give us an indication of whether we
think that they are going far enough and will achieve the right balance
between protection and the civil rights of individuals who are in the
frame.</div> <a name="06071253000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing we are
suggesting limits the flexibility of the board to do its job when it is
up and running. We are purely asking for checks and balances on the
Secretary of State in what is currently a grey area. Secretaries of
State might find it inconvenient to have to appear before regulation
Committees occasionally. However, it is preferable that they are put on
the spot to justify why various regulations are being fashioned in the
way that the Government propose than to let those regulations go
through without the proper scrutiny that they
require.</div><a name="06071253000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
pioneering territory. The board is a new body. We welcome it, but it is
particularly important that we get it right. We are not just talking
about the initial regulations that the Secretary of State will fashion
after the Bill receives Royal Assent; the Bill will also give him
powers to change those initial regulations. He can change the
regulations for the procedures to be followed, the terms of reference
on which certain people are referred to the board and subsequently
barred, and the timescale over which they may be barred. He is being
given the powers to change an awful lot of things even after he first
sets them out in regulations after Royal
Assent.</div><a name="06071253000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that, where possible, the Secretary of State should ensure
that those regulations and subsequent changes to those regulations are
subject to full and proper timely scrutiny by the House. That is what
the amendments are all about, and that is a point worth making. The
Minister is quite understandably trying to give us reassurances about
when those regulations would be proposed, but that is entirely
irrelevant, given the various points that I have just made. I want to
put that on record.</div> <a name="06071253000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that we will not get anywhere if we seek a vote on the amendment,
but it is important. These are enormous powers, the manifestations of
which both ourselves and the Minister are unclear about at this stage,
because the provision has not been completed. That is why we need to
make sure that they are scrutinised properly. On that basis, I beg to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000496"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> A few clauses are coming up for which no
amendments have been tabled. However, there are items of clarification
that it would be useful for the Committee to seek and for the Minister
to give. </div><a name="06071253000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3 is
short. It deals with barred persons. In paragraphs 3(2) and
(3):</div><a name="06071253000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person
is barred from regulated activity relating to children if he
is&#151;</div><a name="06071253000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
included in the children&#146;s barred
list;&#148;</div><a name="06071253000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">which we
understand
and&#151;</div><a name="06071253000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(b)
included in a list maintained under the law of Scotland or Northern
Ireland which the Secretary of State specifies by order as
corresponding to the children&#146;s barred
list.&#148;</div><a name="06071253000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, we do not
know what that will amount to. We do not know what type of list may
exist or are intended by, for example, the Scottish Parliament, which
has competence in those areas. I ask the Minister for his comments on
the Scottish
system.</div><a name="06071253000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
development of IMPACT&#151;the computer database&#151;is essential
to the process of collating and sharing information. That system will,
we hope, successfully identify individuals who should not be working
with children or vulnerable adults, so that the required information
can be given to the IBB, which will do something about
it.</div><a name="06071253000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition are
concerned that IMPACT is behind schedule and over budget, which is a
common theme when the Government handle computer projects. Originally,
it was proposed that the IMPACT scheme would be available by 2007. Soon
after, the Minister&#146;s colleague, the Under-Secretary of State
for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan)
announced that, in fact, it would be ready in 2008.</div>
<a name="06071253000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsequently, on 21 April, the
Minister without Portfolio, as a Home Office Minister, confirmed what
many of us had understood to be the case from Police Information
Technology Organisation documents: the full computer system would not
be up and running properly until 2010, at the latest&#151;a four-year
gap between the Bill and a computer system that will effectively enable
it to happen. That is a big worry. What is going to happen in the next
four years?</div> <a name="06071253000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
Floor of the House, we have just debated concerns over recent
revelations about the treatment of people with learning disabilities,
particularly the scandals in Cornwall. Problems are happening as we
speak. That computer system needs to be able to deal with such
instances to ensure that they do not happen in the first place or that
such people, when identified, are dealt with
appropriately.</div><a name="06071253000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that Scotland is steps ahead of us&#151;in many things it
is; in others, it is not, including football. The Scottish intelligence
database computer system is up and running already, and rather
effectively, I gather. Apparently, that system was offered to English
police forces as at least a stop-gap measure before IMPACT comes into
effect.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div><a name="06071253000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cost of
IMPACT, as estimated in the comprehensive spending review, was some
&#163;160 million. I think that that figure will be revisited and
will accelerate considerably. The cost of transferring or extending the
SID system to England and Wales was put at &#163;55 million, and it
could be rolled out over 18 months. That roll-out could have started
some time ago and been considerably cheaper and
quicker.</div><a name="06071253000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
query about clause 3: what discussions has the Minister had with his
counterparts in the Scottish Parliament and colleagues in the Northern
Ireland Office about the structures operating in those two parts of the
United Kingdom? Has he learned any lessons from sharing intelligence
and about the systems already in place to bring that about? Are the
list systems, and the information feeding into those systems, in
Scotland and Northern Ireland superior or lacking compared with the
English and Welsh system that we are looking to put in place under the
Bill?</div><a name="06071253000405"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="06071253000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is vital
that we have a system that will work across the United Kingdom. There
have been many cases of abusers of one description or another easily
flitting across borders. There is a problem at the moment with abusers
flitting across county authority borders. Let us take the example of
foster carers taken on by a local authority in, say, Newcastle. The
foster carers fall foul of the local authority because of a degree of
abuse that may not quite have warranted a prosecution, or in respect of
which there was insufficient intelligence to prosecute, but which
should certainly have flagged up serious question marks as to the
carers&#146; suitability to deal with children. They then leave
Newcastle and turn up in, say, my neck of the woods, on the south coast
in Brighton, and present themselves as willing foster carers to the
local authority, which would have no knowledge of their previous
background and which may engage their services. That might turn out to
be completely
inappropriate.</div><a name="06071253000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
who abuse vulnerable people&#151;be it children or adults&#151;tend
to be quite devious and clever in getting round the system, which is
why it is essential that we have a proper and appropriate sharing of
information between authorities in our own country and around all the
different parts of the United Kingdom as well. It also makes it
essential that when the legislation comes into force it is compatible
with the measures that are already up and running in Scotland and
Northern Ireland, or that are intended to be up and running there. That
is particularly the case for Scotland, with the information-sharing
system that the police already have in place, which as things stand
today is superior to ours. Will the Minister comment on the United
Kingdom
dimension?</div><a name="06071253000217"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000497"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> As I said to the hon. Member for Basingstoke
earlier, I am happy to provide a written update on IMPACT. However, I
can assure the hon. Gentleman that the working of the vetting and
barring scheme is not dependent on the roll-out of IMPACT. There are
existing CRB processes that are adequate for the scheme, although
IMPACT will obviously help to improve
matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div><a name="06071253000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Scotland and Northern
Ireland, clause 3 provides that a person who is on one of the barred
lists or on specified barred lists in Scotland and Northern Ireland is
also barred from regulated activity relating to the relevant group in
England and Wales. The clause ensures that the scheme will take account
of similar lists elsewhere in the UK. That will help prevent anyone who
has been listed anywhere in the UK as a risk to children or vulnerable
adults from gaining access to work with those groups. I therefore
commend clause 3 to the Committee.</div>
<a name="06071253000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000498"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I hope that my queries will
get a slightly more detailed response than that, and that if the
Minister is going to write to me he will be able to answer the specific
points that I made. He said that the scheme is not dependent on IMPACT
and that the existing CRB checks are adequate. Clearly, they are not.
Some of the people who were caught in January and who were the cause of
the legislation being instigated had committed offences that had not
been properly investigated and that were not subject to CRB checks.
They were still dealing with children in a neighbouring authority,
including in my own constituency. The problem with CRB checks is that
they are out of date the day after they are sought and they do not
become effective and useful until somebody has actually committed an
offence and has become the subject of a CRB check. Lots of people are
caught in between.</div>
<a name="06071253000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000499"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I do not know the exact circumstances of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituency, but the example he gives might well
have concerned people on the sex offenders register, and the lack of
cross-reference with List 99. There is also a vulnerable
children&#146;s list. The whole purpose of the vetting and barring
scheme is to amalgamate those registers and lists into two: a barred
list to preclude people from working with children, and a list to
prevent them from working with vulnerable adults, with
cross-referencing between the
two.</div><a name="06071253000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept the point about IMPACT being of great assistance. It is a point
that the Minister for Children and Families made on Second Reading in
answer to a question posed by the hon. Gentleman. As I said, I am happy
to give him an update on IMPACT, but the establishment of the scheme is
not dependent on it. I do not want to comment on the circumstances in
his constituency, but issues in some parts of the country were about
the interrelationship with the lists, which is what we are clarifying
in this process. I made clear on Second Reading some of the changes in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. A process in Scotland will mirror our
operation here, and likewise in Northern Ireland. The schemes will link
up to ensure that, if people were barred in one place, they would be
barred in another. With that explanation, I hope that members of the
Committee are satisfied that the clause can stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06071253000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000500"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I want to make just one point about the clause. It
is pleasing that the grounds on which an appeal might be made have been
expanded slightly. Of course, the appeals apply only under the three
categories other than the automatic bar. An appeal can be made on the
basis of a fact, which is to be welcomed. It sounds as though it will
produce a fairer result. At least it gives some feeling that justice
will be applied. However, if facts emerge after the tribunal hearing,
will it be possible to appeal on the grounds of new evidence? When the
Minister sums up, will he deal with that
question?</div><a name="06071253000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000501"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I shall come to that point in a moment. Clause 4
provides for an appeal to the Care Standards Tribunal on a point of law
or a point of fact, as the hon. Lady said. A decision of the IBB to
include or keep someone on the children or vulnerable adults list was a
concession made in another place. Subsection (1) sets out the decisions
against which individuals can appeal. They may not appeal against an
automatic bar under paragraphs 1 and 6 of schedule 2. Under subsections
(2) and (3) of the clause, an appeal can be based on points of law and
findings of fact. However, it is important for me to say that an
individual cannot appeal against the judgment of the IBB when the facts
or law are not in question. When someone has accepted a caution or been
found guilty of a crime, for example, we are talking about periods of
10 years or five, if that person happens to be under the age of 25,
before the person may apply for a review of his inclusion on a barred
list.</div><a name="06071253000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4)
provides for the tribunal to give permission for an appeal. Subsections
(5), (6) and (7) set out the actions that a tribunal can take. It may
confirm the IBB decision, it may remit the case to the IBB for a fresh
decision, it may set out new findings of fact for a fresh IBB decision,
or it may direct the IBB to remove the individual from the list.
Subsection (8) allows the Secretary of State to make regulations
specifying the procedure of the tribunal and, if appropriate, the award
of costs by the
tribunal.</div><a name="06071253000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(9) provides that the Court of Appeal will hear appeals on points of
law in respect of a tribunal decision. It is of great importance that
the right to appeal on points of law should generally be available so
that the courts can give guidance on the proper interpretation of the
law and avoid inconsistent rules by tribunals. The right to appeal on
points of fact ensures that, when a mistake has been made in findings
of fact, there is a proper opportunity to revisit the decision. I hope
that my explanation has satisfied the hon. Lady. I recommend that the
clause stands part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06071253000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000502"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Clause 5 provides that regulated activity relating
to children and vulnerable adults will be set out in schedule 3.
Regulated activity is a key term in the Bill. It is activity that will
be prohibited for an individual on a barred list. Broadly speaking, it
represents work involving close contact with children or vulnerable
adults.</div><a name="06071253000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will allow the Secretary of State to amend the definition of
&#147;regulated activity&#148; by order, providing the flexibility
to respond to changes in the work force and in how services are
provided. Clause 46(3) provides that any order made under clause 5(3)
to vary the meaning of regulated activity must be subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure. The definition is key to the scheme.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000505"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I shall address only amendments Nos. 112 and 113.
It is a long string of amendments, and I want to concentrate on our two
amendments. They are quite complex but nevertheless
important.</div><a name="06071253000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to address the concerns that I mentioned on Second
Reading about the definition of &#147;frequency&#148;. I have great
concerns about it. I have read closely the notes issued by Lord Adonis,
and the more I read them, the more I become convinced that there are
potential loopholes. If you will forgive me, Mr. Martlew, I will go
through the matter in some detail, because I sincerely believe that
there is a big potential loophole in the protection of vulnerable
people.</div><a name="06071253000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to consider the two amendments together and to see the
need for flexibility, particularly in monitoring. A consequence of the
Bill for flexibility in monitoring is that it could impose a huge
administrative difficulty on organisations for one often limited
contact. I understand that that is why the clause includes the rather
tortuous &#147;frequent and occasional&#148;&#151;to get the
right balance so that it does not impose too much 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div>bureaucracy. Proportionality and balance are an issue, but if the
loophole is present, one would have to err at the end of the day toward
less flexibility. I shall consider some examples of what could
happen.</div><a name="06071253000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible, for example, that a barred individual who has harmed children
and poses a risk could get access to regulated activity lasting less
than a week. That is the main problem. As I read the suggested
regulations, &#147;frequently&#148; could mean once every six
months or once a month, but it must be less than a week. If that is
accepted and the word &#147;frequently&#148; is included in the
clause, I envisage that a holiday play scheme lasting five days could
pose a real
danger.</div><a name="06071253000406"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="06071253000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
mentioned unregulated crÃ¨ches, which again, for the most part
must be unregulated. Nevertheless, if a crÃ¨che facility were
provided at a week-long conference somebody could get quite involved
with some of the children. I was particularly concerned when I thought
about a youth group going away for a five-day camp. As far as I see it,
the definitions here would allow a person who is on the barred list to
be involved. It is a question of how much monitoring there is. I am not
sure that I would be happy if someone on the barred list went away on a
youth camp for five days. I hope that the Minister can be clear about
the grouping of days within a week because that is where the concern
arises.</div><a name="06071253000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to move on to the definition of an occasional basis, which comes under
clause 10, and whether a regulated activity provider may use a person
not subject to monitoring. There is a problem again because, under the
Bill, it is an offence for a barred individual to engage in regulated
activity in a regulated position. However, more latitude is given to
regulated activity providers who are not required to carry out a check
under clause 10(4) when the contact is for less than a week or for less
frequent intervals than once per month. That seems rather bizarre,
because it is clear that a dangerous banned adult, let us say a
paedophile who wishes to access children in certain settings, could
exploit the loophole for the monitoring of posts of short-term
duration. That might even be in the setting of a children&#146;s
home.</div> <a name="06071253000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
amendments are meant to be taken together. In a sense, the second
amendment on the use of the word &#147;occasional&#148; is trying
to loosen things up slightly. I should like the Minister to concentrate
on our first amendment, which removes the term
&#147;frequently&#148;. By taking a very drastic step, we would
remove the possible loophole altogether. I hope that the Minister can
look at this again because there is probably a way of closing that
loophole in a less bureaucratic manner. I want to be assured that what
I am pretty certain is a loophole is closed before the Bill reaches the
statute
book.</div><a name="06071253000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000506"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I wish to speak to amendments
Nos. 112, 125 and 127. I may also comment on some of the Government
amendments too. It does not often happen, but great minds think alike
on this. The Liberals and the Conservatives tabled exactly the same
amendment in amendment No. 112. That perhaps shows the strength of
feeling on this matter. Certainly it was an issue that was debated at
length in the other place. Amendments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div>Nos. 112, 125, 126 and 127 would remove the concept of
&#147;frequently&#148; from the Bill. Ultimately, the amendments
have been tabled to probe further on who the Bill seeks to monitor.
Given the strength of feeling on Opposition Benches and among other
interest groups, it would be interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="06071253000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the
Bill comes anywhere near the statute book, the situation with regard to
who should be CRB checked is less than satisfactory for a number of
organisations. I know from speaking to teachers in my constituency that
they find it difficult to understand the concept of
&#147;regular&#148; in connection with those who need to be CRB
checked. The current situation causes concern, which was reiterated in
the consultation on the
matter.</div><a name="06071253000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all understand the Government&#146;s intention in trying to grapple
with the concepts of &#147;frequently&#148; and
&#147;occasionally.&#148; It is interesting that the Liberals and
the Conservatives have come up with the similar solution&#151;it is
worthy of the Government&#146;s further consideration&#151;of
removing the concept of activities carried out
&#147;frequently&#148; and encouraging consideration of the word
&#147;occasionally.&#148; I tabled an amendment that would have
enabled us to examine further the use of that word, but unfortunately
it was not selected. The matter should be considered with this group of
amendments to understand fully our
thinking.</div><a name="06071253000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
probing amendments would remove the word &#147;frequently&#148;.
The amendment that was not selected would have enabled people and
employers to define what constituted occasional activity in a
particular setting. We felt that that was an interesting concept to
play with. The Minister jokingly asked me on Second Reading&#151;or
perhaps he was not joking&#151;to define &#147;frequently&#148;
for him, which we have found difficult to do. The debate in the other
place and the subsequent communication from Lord Adonis showed that a
number of enormous loopholes are created by such definitions. I think
of my own children, who are in a holiday club lasting for five days. It
falls into the category that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole mentioned and, under the Bill, the people running it would not
need to be checked at all. That is a
concern.</div><a name="06071253000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are intended to challenge the Government on whether we need
the word &#147;frequently&#148; in the Bill. Would it not be
simpler to remove it so that monitoring relates to the extensive list
of settings and positions in the Bill and so that it is left to local
employers, whether schools, youth clubs or whatever, to identify
exceptions to the broad need for monitoring and decide when they need
exemptions for people who occasionally help
out?</div><a name="06071253000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within the many
settings to which the Bill will apply, the definition of
&#147;occasional&#148; could vary. In some organisations, an
individual working with children for five days alongside a member of
staff would not cause any problems. As a school governor myself, I have
seen instances in which outside organisations have come into the school
without ever being left in sole charge of the children with whom they
come into contact. There will be activities that do not need to be
monitored, but equally there will be circumstances, such as those
outlined today, that would fall foul of Lord Adonis&#146;s
definitions of &#147;frequently&#148; and
&#147;occasionally.&#148; Those terms do not help to clarify the
situation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 78</div><a name="06071253000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">For clarity and for the record,
I say that the amendments that we are considering are not the full set
of amendments that we tabled. We recognise the need for people to go
into monitored settings occasionally, but there should be an
opportunity for local employers to decide for themselves whether that
should be monitored.</div><a name="06071253000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give the Minister another example of the need to be aware of the
implications of the Bill. There is a very successful community school
in my constituency that has an open access policy for parents. How
should its head teacher interpret the Bill? Will parents going on to
the campus of the school regularly&#151;on more than five consecutive
days or more than once a month&#151;need to be monitored? According
to the Bill, it appears that they would need to monitored, although I
am not entirely sure that that is the intention, nor is it absolutely
necessary.</div> <a name="06071253000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind the amendment is to consider the issue from the point
of view of those who have to implement the legislation on the
ground&#151;in our schools and our playgroups, and in other settings
as defined in the Bill&#151;to ensure that they have a clear idea of
who should be monitored and that they are empowered to identify those
groups that feel should occasionally be allowed within the school.
However, we would force governing bodies and other groups to think that
through for themselves. If the Minister could give us a positive
response on those issues, it would be a most welcome addition to the
Bill.</div><a name="06071253000257"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000507"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I can say with a degree of confidence that the
issue is complex. There is no easy answer, and I think that we can all
understand the reasons why. Before I comment on the amendment, I should
mention something that we shall come to with schedule 4. Areas of
activity such as the one that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole mentioned might not fall under the category of regulated
activity, but instant online checks for such activities could provide
us with new solutions. Where a group want to make checks, even though
an individual might not be seen as a frequent supervisor or visitor,
online checks offer a way of doing so
properly.</div><a name="06071253000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000508"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point about
online checks but, to take the example of the summer camp that my
children are attending, I have no way of knowing the names of the
people who will be looking after them. As a mother, I assume that the
organisation has checked the people who will be looking after my
children for five days this week, albeit for only two and a half hours
each day. There is no way that I would know the names of those people
to them check online. Surely that will be a potential
problem.</div>
<a name="06071253000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000509"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I will not go down that line until schedule 4. I
was using a different example, in which a group that has an arrangement
with somebody under which it employs them infrequently wants to be sure
that they are checked. However, there is no one-size-fits-all policy,
so perhaps I should not have opened the issue up for debate. We could
discuss a million different examples, but I am sure that we will return
to the issue in greater detail on schedule 4, as the online register
opens up real opportunities.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 79</div><a name="06071253000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 112 and 125 to 127 focus on a key element of the Bill&#151;the
definition of &#147;regulated activity&#148;, which underpins the
effective functioning of the new vetting and barring scheme. It is
important that we get the definition right, and I welcome the
opportunity that the amendment affords us to debate the issue. The
group of amendments focuses on a central element of the definition of
regulated activity, namely the frequency test.</div>
<a name="06071253000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
behind the group of amendments is to disapply the test in a range of
circumstances, so that specified activities in relation to children and
vulnerable adults are classified as regulated activities, regardless of
whether they are carried out frequently. For example, certain
activities that bring an individual into close contact with children
and vulnerable adults&#151;such as teaching, caring, advising and
supervising&#151;have to be carried out frequently to be defined as a
regulated activity.</div>
<a name="06071253000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">An individual
who was not engaged in those specific types of activity but who still
worked in a specified setting&#151;for example, a care home or a
school that gave them access to children or vulnerable
adults&#151;would also have to be carrying out their duties
frequently for that to be classified as a regulated activity. The
amendments have major implications for the circumstances in which a
barred individual may engage in regulated activity during which they
are subject to monitoring and the employer has to check their status in
the
scheme.</div><a name="06071253000407"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="06071253000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
frequency test and the scope of the bar, I recognise the concerns of
hon. Members that if an activity&#151;for instance, teaching
children, caring for a vulnerable adult or rebuilding a school history
block while having access to pupils&#151;is carried out on an
occasional basis, it might fall outside the definition of regulated
activity. I recognise also that risks are associated with a barred
individual working with children or vulnerable adults, even on a
one-off
basis.</div><a name="06071253000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to reassure hon. Members that protecting children and
vulnerable adults from those who work with them is the most important
consideration of the scheme. However, it is important also that we do
not place unreasonable burdens on employers, managers and employees, as
well as on volunteers&#151;the latter are important. We should not
make the lives of individuals impossible. We want the scheme to be
proportionate.</div> <a name="06071253000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
some examples: should an aerobics teacher on the children&#146;s
barred list be charged with an offence if a 16-year-old turns up
occasionally for their class, which is otherwise made up of adults?
Should a TV producer on the barred list be charged with an offence if
they instruct a school group that comes to the TV studios to learn how
TV is produced? Should a nurse in a care home barred from working with
children be charged with an offence if they treat in an emergency a
child visitor who has fallen over in the care home? I am sure that hon.
Members will agree that those are not easy questions with which to
grapple.</div>
<a name="06071253000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000510"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> May we return to the example of
the TV producer and the visit to the studios by a school group? That is
not a controlled setting. Will the Minister help me: would the
regulations apply in those circumstances? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div>Presumably, they would if the teacher was going to the school, but as we
have discussed, methods could be put in place to allow that to happen
on an occasional
basis.</div><a name="06071253000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000511"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The point that I was trying to make to the hon.
Lady was that teachers going to a school and contact with children in a
studio are both issues tobe debated in relation to prescribing
regulated or controlled activities because, either way, children could
be put in a vulnerable position. Placing severe or absolute
restrictions on barred individuals criminalises them even though they
did not seek to work with children or vulnerable
adults.</div><a name="06071253000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear,
however, that determining the scope of the bar in relation to the
frequency with which an activity is carried out is a complex issue, and
we shall continue to listen to the concerns of hon. Members in forums
such as this one. We shall continue also to work with key stakeholders.
I am not pretending that there are easy
answers.</div><a name="06071253000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like also to consider the amendments in the context of their
effects on the requirements on individuals to be subject to monitoring
and on employers to carry out appropriate checks. We need to consider
carefully the requirements that we impose on employers and managers to
make checks, and on employees to go through the scheme.</div>
<a name="06071253000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">To extend the requirements on
an occasional basis to individuals who teach, care for or engage in
other activities mentioned in paragraphs 2(1), 5(1), 1(3) and 5(4) of
schedule 3 would place unreasonable burdens and bureaucracy on
employers and managers, and might create a barrier to the effective
provision of services. For example, an adult gym might not be able to
include a child attending with their parent because their staff have
not been through the scheme, and hence checked. However, under schedule
4 employers will be able to check an individual&#146;s status if they
are considering whether to permit an individual to teach, care for
children or vulnerable adults or otherwise engage in an activity
mentioned in paragraphs 2(1) and 5(1) or an activity on an occasional
basis caught by parts of schedule
3.</div><a name="06071253000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light of
those considerations, I hope that hon. Members will see fit to withdraw
the amendments, which do not answer the question
either.</div><a name="06071253000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000512"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> The Minister rightly said that it is not our
desire ever to put unreasonable burdens on employers, but implied that
the amendments would put such burdens on them. I put the contrary
argument: simplifying the system would ensure that employers knew
exactly where they stood in respect of the need to monitor
individuals.</div> <a name="06071253000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
thinking particularly of schools; it has been widely reported that
schools are finding it, or have found it, difficult to understand who
should be CRB-checked and who should not, given the current requirement
for those regularly in contact with children. Surely the opposite of
what the Minister is talking about could happen; instead of the burden
being unreasonable, things might be simplified for
employers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 81</div><a name="06071253000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000513"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> We could say that, but if the frequency test had
been removed and a parent visited the school to give a one-off lecture
on her career as a lawyer, she would fall foul of the process and have
to be cleared by the scheme. That would be an added problem for the
school; that parent would have to go through the vetting and barring
scheme.</div><a name="06071253000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000514"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> All the examples given by the
Minister have been about a one-off occasion rather than the examples on
which I was concentrating. My concern is about what happens when
consecutive days stack up within a week, and I should like the Minister
to address my examples. He gave the example of the online check.
However, the hon. Member for Basingstoke is right; if the organiser
does not do an online check, the parents or relations of anybody
involved in the activity would have no knowledge of
that.</div><a name="06071253000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000515"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The hon. Lady makes a fair point, and I do not
disagree. We could stipulate an activity that happens three times a
week or three days a month. We have said that, typically, more than one
day a month and a contract of more than a week defines frequency.
Equally, the hon. Lady could argue for an intermittent period of less
than a week. That becomes apparent when we take a closer look at the
issue, and I am happy to do that.</div>
<a name="06071253000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I say to her that
removing the frequency test would place a burden on schools, which, for
example, would have to check everybody who turned up on the one-off
basis that I described. I do not believe that the removal of the
frequency test is the way forward.</div>
<a name="06071253000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000516"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> If the Minister is considering the issue again,
may I remind him of my amendment No. 128, which I was not able to
discuss today? It reads as
follows:</div><a name="06071253000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Based
on an assessment made in reference to guidance issued by the Secretary
of State the employer will clearly set out what constitutes occasional
activity for which monitoring is not necessary in relation to that
specific setting.&#148;</div>
<a name="06071253000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000517"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am afraid that the hon. Lady is out of order;
her amendment was not
selected.</div><a name="06071253000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000518"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Thank you, Mr. Martlew; I was about to start
probing an amendment that had not been selected. I do not want to
digress down that path, but if it were down to employers to set the
level of frequency, we&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps we should
enter into correspondence. I am quite happy to consider what the hon.
Lady was saying.</div><a name="06071253000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the earlier point about the TV producer. If the producer were
barred and the frequency test removed, the producer could not instruct
children either in school or elsewhere. That is another example of how
things would work if we did away with the
test.</div><a name="06071253000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
Government amendments Nos. 146 to 148, which also deal with the
definition of regulated activity. They are intended to ensure that an
individual under the age of 16 engaging in regulated activity is not
required to be monitored and that those permitting or supplying such
individuals to engage in regulated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 82</div>activity are not required to check. That will ensure that 15-year-olds
who go on two weeks&#146; work experience at a primary school, for
example, will not be required to go through the scheme and that the
school will not be required to
check.</div><a name="06071253000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
importance of clarifying the definition of regulated activity, I
commend the amendments to the Committee. I hope that hon. Members will
consider this useful debate as well as my desire to reconsider the
issue and hold further discussions with stakeholders before Report, and
will withdraw their
amendments.</div><a name="06071253000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000519"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I am afraid that I am going to disappoint the
Minister. I shall press the amendment to a Division simply because I
feel that it is so important. I welcome his statement that he will
reconsider it, but a Division on the issue will give further force to
the concerns of Opposition Members about the loophole that we are
convinced exists in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06071253000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the Minister said
that we could reconsider the issue in different forums, but I must
point out that there is only Report. We will only have one more go at
this, and that is why I shall press amendment No. 112 to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000537"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The amendments are designed to improve the
Bill&#146;s coverage by ensuring that the definitions of regulated
activity relating to children and requirements to check are focused
where individuals have the greatest opportunity to harm
children.</div> <a name="06071253000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 178 is a minor drafting amendment. Amendments Nos. 145 and 179 will
bring requirements for Welsh child minders into line with those for
child minders in England. AmendmentsNos. 180 and 181 will
ensure that CAFCASS officers and family proceedings officers in Wales
and their managers are covered by the bar and the requirement to check.
As those officers are likely to have unsupervised contact with
children, the amendment ensures that the functions of such officers and
their managers are covered by regulated
activity.</div><a name="06071253000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 144 and 182 ensure that those who act as deputies on behalf of
children and vulnerable adults are within the scope of the scheme.
Amendment No. 182 adds deputies to the definition of regulated activity
in schedule 3, paragraph 4(1) in relation to children. That means that
a person who is barred from working with children cannot act in that
capacity. Amendment No. 144 means that those appointed as a deputy are
treated in line with other positions such as those of local councillors
and charity trustees in situations in which there is no regulated
activity provider.</div>
<a name="06071253000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 183 clarifies the
drafting to ensure that operators and administrators of the information
sharing index are engaging in regulated activity in relation to
children. Amendment No. 184 ensures that where an activity is carried
out by a member of a group of children and possibly others on behalf or
under the direction of an adult engaging in regulated activity with the
group, the group member will not be engaged in regulated activity. That
will ensure that school prefects, who supervise other school pupils,
will not be required to be subject to monitoring and the school will
not be required to check their
status.</div><a name="06071253000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend will later be moving an identical amendment in relation to
vulnerable adults. Those amendments set out real improvements in the
coverage of this Bill. They will increase the protection afforded to
children and ensure that the coverage is appropriately targeted. I
commend those amendments to the
Committee.</div><a name="06071253000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000538"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I should like to speak briefly to amendment No.
118 within the string, which is tabled in my name and the names of my
hon. Friends. It is an important amendment because it relates to local
authorities. I will just read out the part of the Bill that it relates
to. It states that one set of positions that would be monitored is that
of</div><a name="06071253000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an executive of a
local authority&#148;.</div>
<a name="06071253000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would in
effect remove that line from the Bill in order that members of an
executive of a local authority would not be included in the monitoring
process. There are provisions within that particular section of the
Bill that already cover any member of a local authority who discharges
any educational or social services function, so that line is
unnecessary.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 84</div><a name="06071253000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the previous string of
amendments, the Minister was at pains to suggest that we should not
place unreasonable burdens on employers. I am not clear why we would
want to single that group out to be monitored, given that any people
within that particular group that had authority with regard to
vulnerable people and adults would already be covered in the previous
sub-paragraph (2)(a). I hope that he understands why we have tabled
amendment No. 118. We feel that it is not a helpful clause to have
within the
Bill.</div><a name="06071253000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my own local borough council, there are only a few people within the
Conservative-controlled authority executive who have any duties to do
with either vulnerable adults or young people. As the Minister is no
doubt aware, the local borough council has limited influence or policy
or financial obligations towards those groups pf people. Anyone who is
involved in activities regarding those groups of people will be caught
in a previous section of the Bill. It is an unnecessary burden on local
authorities.</div><a name="06071253000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the example of TV producers not being able to teach children because
they are barred, it may not be entirely equitable that some councillors
may, perhaps, stop being involved in activities relating to vulnerable
adults or children and may not be able to be members of
executives.</div><a name="06071253000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000539"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Amendment No. 118 would mean that an individual
who is a member of an executive of a local authority that discharges
any educational or social services functions for a local authority
should not be engaged in a regulated activity. That issue was raised in
the other place. I reiterate the sentiments of my noble friend Lord
Harris of Haringey, vice-president of the Local Government Association,
in saying that no member of a local authority cabinet should be allowed
to serve on that body if they are on the barred list. An individual may
not have direct responsibility for social services or education
functions, but he may help to set the overall strategic direction of
the council and he will have the opportunity to influence, at least
indirectly, the lives of children in the local
area.</div><a name="06071253000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that it is unlikely for an individual to have no responsibility for
education or social services functions. If an executive member sitting
on an executive with education or social services functions requested
information or required access to particular material or individuals,
that would provide the opportunity for close contact with
children.</div><a name="06071253000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000540"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> At the risk of opening a can of worms, as was
hinted at on Second Reading, if local authority executive members
should be monitored because they may have access to certain information
or materials or have close contact with children or vulnerable adults,
perhaps hon. Members should consider whether they should be monitored.
This is the start of what could be an expansive process. If local
authority members who have no direct responsibilities for such matters
should be monitored, why should not Members of Parliament be monitored?
Will local authority members not ask that
question?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000541"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The point about local authority members having
influence over social services and education functions is interesting
and comes from the vice-president of the LGA, so we need to take it
seriously. The Bill as drafted takes the right approach on the
issue.</div><a name="06071253000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
113 would change the focus of the exception in clause 10 so that
employers of individuals engaging in a specified activity in a key

Those employing individuals to carry out specified activities outside
key settings could do so occasionally without that person being subject
to monitoring. I hope that hon. Members will take on board what I have

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000542"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 117, in
schedule 3, page 44, line 31, leave
out sub-paragraph
(a).</div><a name="06071253000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a simple
amendment. I am interested in the Minister&#146;s view on this aspect
of the Bill. As the Committee knows, schedule 3 defines regulated
activity under the Bill, and paragraph 2 of the schedule states that
there are exclusions to monitoring for activities relating to
employment. It excludes from monitoring those who are involved
specifically in the</div>
<a name="06071253000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;care for or supervision of a
child in the course of his
employment&#148;.</div><a name="06071253000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
paragraph 3 states that that exemption does not apply to a child who
has not attained the age of 16. It is possible that I have not
interpreted the schedule correctly because it seems rather
counter-intuitive. There are one or two double negatives in those two
paragraphs.</div><a name="06071253000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
under the Bill as drafted, if a person was employing someone under the
age of 16, that person could be open to the need to be monitored. Will
the Minister clarify how the provision may affect children? We need to
tease that out because I am not sure that the Government intended to
legislate in such a way or, if that is their intention, perhaps the
hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 86</div>could outline what effect the provision may have on the employment
opportunities of those young, budding paper boys and girls who rely on
the money that they receive as a source of income. I should welcome his
comments.</div><a name="06071253000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000543"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I shall certainly come back to that point and give
the hon. Lady a clear answer. I shall need a moment to think about
it.</div><a name="06071253000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2(2) and
(3) of the schedule provide that individuals will be engaged in
regulated activities if they principally care for, train, supervise,
give guidance to or treat children under the age of 16 during the
child&#146;s employment. If those people have the particular role of
caring as a chaperone for an actor who is under 16 years, for example,
they will fall within a regulated
activity.</div><a name="06071253000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
amendment No. 117 is to ensure that, when individuals are frequently
teaching, training or otherwise working closely with children aged 16
or 17 during their employment, they are also engaged in a regulated
activity, which brings with it a requirement for the employer to check
their status before permitting them to engage in such activity. The
amendment is not appropriate. The provisions under schedule 3 provide a
careful balance between protecting children and not discouraging
employers from offering work with children due to the burdens involved
in checking the
staff.</div><a name="06071253000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Requiring
checks on those working with 16 and 17-year-old employees may be
particularly damaging to school leavers who are trying to earn a
living. Generally, people who work with 16 and 17-year-olds do not make
a choice to work with children and do not have the same duty of
care.</div><a name="06071253000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000544"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I wish to be clear. It is a bit of a complex area
for some reason, but if children aged 14 or 15 years are employed by
their corner shop to deliver newspapers, will the newspaper shop owner
whogives the papers to them in the morning need to put himself
forward to be monitored? If not, why is paragraph 2(3)(a) of schedule 3
in the
Bill?</div><a name="06071253000409"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="06071253000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000545"></a>Mr.
Dhanda:</b> I do not believe that the employment by newsagents
of paper boys will come within the Bill&#146;s provisions. It is not
a regulated activity&#151;it is not a case of one-to-one interaction
between the employer and the paper boy. We would also have to consider
the frequency. Nevertheless, though the point is a technical one, it is
well made. There may well be issues about that and it is probably best
if I write to the hon. Lady to flesh it
out.</div><a name="06071253000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, we
do not believe that the amendment is appropriate. Schedule 3 provides a
careful balance between protecting children and not discouraging
employers from offering work to 16 and 17-year-olds. Let us suppose
that hon. Members&#146; concerns relate to army instructors of 16 and
17-year-olds. In that case, schedule 4 already allows employers to
check the status of individuals who frequently teach, train, care for,
or otherwise work closely with under-18s who are employed in the armed
forces.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 87</div><a name="06071253000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall
continue to work with the Ministry of Defence to ensure that there is
sufficient awareness in the armed forces of the requirements on child
protection, and to ensure that support and advice are given on such
issues during implementation of the Bill. I believe that the Bill takes
the right approach on the issues and I urge the hon. Lady to withdraw
her amendment. Having said that, I shall examine the point that she
made on newsagents employing paper
boys.</div><a name="06071253000341"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000546"></a>Mrs.
Miller:</b> I am heartened that the Minister will do that. The
Bill appears to say clearly that there will need to be monitoring of
people who care for or supervise a child, or who do so in the course of
their employment, and paragraph 2(3) clearly states that the exclusions
do not apply in the case of children who have not yet reached the age
of 16. Children or people entering employment will receive instruction
during the course of that employment, or may be in their
employer&#146;s care, whether they are a newspaper boy or girl or
anybody else in the relevant age group. If I were an employer, I would
have great concerns, and if the Bill indeed implied that children of 14
or 15 would need to be in the care of somebody who was monitored during
employment, it would put me off employing someone in that age
group.</div><a name="06071253000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on the
Minister&#146;s remarks this evening, it seems that that would be a
wholly unintended consequence of the Bill. As somebody who employed
people for 17 years&#151;albeit perhaps not of that age&#151;such a
consequence would cause me concern, so I am pleased that the Minister
will examine the matter further. When he does, perhaps he will put
himself in the position of an employer reading the Bill, and ensure
that it is amended to clarify the point for employers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000549"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> I promise not to keep the Committee long. I will
endeavour to be as brief as I
can.</div><a name="06071253000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been said
during today&#146;s debate that people who are abuse are clever. In
fact, in my experience, abuse often arises from ignorance, and more
specifically from institutionalised bad practice. The two probing
amendments in my name would cover establishments that are not currently
regulated and do not have specific standards set for them. In
particular, I wish to include organisations and establishments where
there are opportunities for staff to set their own standards of
practice in working with client groups, appearing to make life easier
for staff but in fact allowing institutionalised abuse to become normal
practice due to a lack of training, supervision and
skills.</div><a name="06071253000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The probing
amendments would extend the range of establishments defined as
providing regulated activities covered by the Care Standards Act 2000.
As the Bill stands, day care establishments in particular do not appear
to be covered. The definition should be extended to such
establishments, at which vulnerable people would otherwise not receive
protection.</div><a name="06071253000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000550"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I will also endeavour to be brief. Amendment No.
104 is a probing amendment. It comes from practical experience, but I
suspect that amendments Nos. 129 and 130 approach the problem in a much
more satisfactory manner. I tabled the amendment, plucking hours and
days out of a hat. When my father was elderly, I was encouraged to keep
him in his own home. He went to a church day centre, with which I had
no problems or worries, for up to six hours a day. He went to the
stroke club one afternoon a week; again, I had no problems and knew
everybody. He also went to a local authority day centre two days a
week. They were very kind and carried out a great deal of personal
care, and I was horrified to see that such a centre seems to be
excluded from the Bill.</div>
<a name="06071253000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, I have visited many
training establishments and day centres for adults with learning
disabilities and feel that they should fall within the Bill. I can see
that the wording is much better in amendments Nos. 129 and 130, which I
hope the Minister will support. I have practical experience of
different types of day centre for elderly people, and it is crystal
clear that some need regulation because it is possible for someone who
is doing the cooking, for instance, to befriend vulnerable elderly
people.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071253000551"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Ivan
Lewis):</b> It is a pleasure finally to get to my feet after
sitting for so long.</div>
<a name="06071253000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) on her probing amendments and the
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole on her constructive
contribution. It is difficult to get the definition of day care right,
and I shall try to explain why I think the Bill gets it about right,
despite the understandable reservations that have been
expressed.</div> <a name="06071253000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
speak first to amendments No. 129 and 130. They seek to define day care
in terms of an establishment in the same way that elsewhere we have
defined care homes, but the term &#147;day care&#148; covers a wide
range of very different types of services provided to old and disabled
people, as has been acknowledged. It can be provided in a variety of
ways: by a local authority or voluntary sector provider, a private
sector organisation or local faith group, for example. Because of the
disparate nature of day care services, we do not believe that seeking a
definition based purely on setting works. We have therefore tried to
capture &#147;day care&#148; in the Bill by identifying it in terms
of activity rather than in terms of a specific establishment. I
reassure hon. Members that the definition of regulated activity already
includes those working in day care settings whose responsibilities
include the provision of care, supervision, training, assistance,
advice or any other activity listed under paragraph 5(1) of part 2 of
schedule 3.</div><a name="06071253000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 129 and 130 seek to achieve their aim by defining day care as an
establishment for people who are entitled specifically to community
care services. Community care services are those services provided to
or commissioned by the local authorities defined in the relevant 1990
Act. We have already made provision for all posts within this sector to
come within the scope of the scheme. The Bill provides that all posts
within community care services which are not covered by the bar but
which give the opportunity for contact with those receiving services or
access to records will be covered by &#147;controlled
activity&#148;. That means that all staff working in local
authority-provided day care settings but who are not undertaking
regulated activity will still be subject to vetting processes under the
new scheme.</div> <a name="06071253000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will
be up to individual employers to decide whether to employ a barred
person in a job involving controlled activity. When an employer takes a
decision to engage a barred person in a controlled activity, we shall
obviously expect extra safeguards to be put in place. We are currently
looking at the most appropriate mechanism for the enforcement of the
requirements related to controlled activity. Extra safeguards are
likely to include additional supervision of a barred person which
prevents him or her from having the opportunity for unsupervised
contact with those individuals attending the day care
group.</div><a name="06071253000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that to
some extent what I have said provides some reassurance. I say to my
hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset
and North Poole that we need to give greater detail about what the
safeguards may be to allay their concerns.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div><a name="06071253000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">I deal now
with amendment No. 104, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats. It
raises similar issues. Under the Bill, the definition of a regulated
activity includes inspection functions carried out by those bodies
listed in sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) of part 2 of schedule 3. This is
to ensure that those individuals with responsibility for inspecting an
establishment, agency, person or body which provides any form of care,
treatment or therapy for vulnerable adults are subject to the bar and
will need to be checked and subject to monitoring. Sub-paragraph (7)
lists establishments, agencies and so on which are subject to
inspection by the relevant listed regulatory
bodies.</div><a name="06071253000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members know&#151;this is a legitimate topic for debate but not
necessarily in the context of the Bill&#151;day care is not currently
regulated under part 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000. Very often, as
hon. Members have said, day care is provided in a community setting
where a range of other activities takes place. As such, it would be
very difficult to define day care in terms of an establishment or an
agency appropriate for inspection by the Commission for Social Care
Inspection. I accept that the nature of inspection and regulation of
day care is not a closed debate, but I do not think it appropriate to
deal with it under the
Bill.</div><a name="06071253000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 185 is a minor, technical amendment relating to the
definition of regulated activity in terms of vulnerable adults. It
would bring the functions of the chief executive and other members of
the IBB within the definition of &#147;regulated activity&#148; in
relation to vulnerable adults. Its omission was an oversight, and I am
sure that all Committee members will accept that it is a common-sense
amendment.</div>
<a name="06071253000410"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="06071253000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
Government amendment No. 186 is identical in its application to
vulnerable adults to amendment No. 184 in relation to children, to
which my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend has already spoken. It
specifically ensures that, where an activity is carried out by a member
of a group of vulnerable adults and possibly others on behalf of or
under the direction of an individual engaged in regulated activity with
the group, the group member will not be engaged in a regulated
activity. For example, it would ensure that where residents of a care
home provide help and assistance to other residents of that care home,
they will not be required to be subject to monitoring and the care home
would not be required to check their status. Again, it is not a simple
or easy issue but, I hope, a common-sense
outcome.</div><a name="06071253000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge my
hon. Friend to withdraw her amendment and the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole not to press her amendment, and I urge the
