                  </span> The point
that I was making this morning arose from my intervention, which the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood kindly took. It is right that I
explain it a little further so that she and the Committee understand
it, for at least two reasons. First, I am concerned about the way in
which the Bill Committee is beginning its business, in that the clause
1 stand part debate appears to be taking place in a partisan
atmosphere, which, given the subject matter of the Bill, should not, I
venture to suggest, be
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000011">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I agree that we
should not be partisan because the Bill is about national security, but
is not one of the reasons why we are perhaps being partisan that, if
the Minister had introduced the legislation as an amendment to the
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005—as my right hon. Friend the
Member for Salford and Eccles said this morning—that would have
been much more
helpful?<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000012">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I will come on to that point in a moment, but
the short answer is this. The right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles
accepted, in the course of her remarks to the Committee, that this was
new legislation. She also accepted that it made certain changes, some
of which are sufficiently significant that they are evidently troubling
the Opposition. Given that, the right way to introduce the Bill is the
way in which it has been brought forward: as a new piece of
legislation, so that we can properly debate all its provisions,
including those that the Opposition suggest overlap with those that are
already in place on control orders. I will deal with that point in
further detail in a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000013">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As
I was saying, it is important for me to explain the intervention that I
made on the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood. The point that my
hon. Friend the Minister put to her and which both he and I evidently
failed to explain particularly well is very simple. She asked why the
current Home Secretary has been using control orders if they are
thought to be objectionable by the current Government. The point that
the Minister made to her was that when the terrorism prevention and
investigation measures regime comes into being—assuming 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>that it passes through Committee and survives the subsequent stages in

extra resources to support the security services and the police. Those
resources

                  </strong> I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for giving
way and I apologise for being a few seconds late in arriving—I
was running up the stairs. What troubles me is that the regime is
likely to come in by the end of this year, but the evidence that we
heard from Deputy Assistant Commissioner Osborne was that it would take
at least a year for the human resources to be recruited, trained and
put in place to exercise the 24/7 surveillance that will be necessary
because of the weakening of the provisions with TPIMs as opposed to
control orders. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman share my concern
about that gap when the resources are not in
place?<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000017">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I will make two points. First, in my limited
experience as a new Member of this place and in my previous
incarnation, it has generally been my experience that both the security
services and the police will always wish to preserve, in a very
conservative way, the existing regime in relation to this area or
anything else, because they know how it works and they know the
resources that they need to deploy to ensure that they operate it
correctly. Therefore, any form of change always involves an assessment
that is generally very conservative by the security services and the
police about both the resources that they need to put it into place and
the time that they need in which to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister and the Department will need to consider whether a
transitional period is needed and, if so, how long it needs to be. I
look forward to hearing that the question has been considered, and to
hearing the Minister’s answer. He is right to raise the point at
this stage. However, I shall not take any more interventions on the
subject as I was going to deal with it in any event.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s argument this morning was simple; he was answering
the Opposition’s point that the Home Secretary has been using
the control order regime since this Government came to office. My right
hon. Friend has indicated that when the TPIM regime comes into being,
additional resources will be put in place. Those resources are not in
place yet, and no one has suggested that they are. The
Opposition’s argument is being made in a partisan way, and for
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood to say that the Secretary of
State has been using control orders is bad for that very
reason.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000020">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not agree that it is a bad point. I do not
accept the argument that the Home Secretary is forced to impose control
order measures that would not be available to her under the TPIM
regime, and which are contrary to the counter-terrorism review, because
of resources. That is not entirely correct. If that were the case, the
Bill would include a clause providing that it would not come into force
until such time as the police had confirmed to the Home Secretary and
Parliament that they had the additional resources needed to manage the

                  </strong> With the greatest respect, the hon. Lady does
not answer the simple point that the argument that she was making this
morning was a bad one. She conflates two factors in her intervention.
The first is the fact that, at present, the Bill does not say when the
TPIM provisions will come into being. The point that she made this
morning was different; she asked why, if control orders are so bad and
strike the wrong balance, the Home Secretary continued to use them. She
has been given an answer to that question by the Minister and
Government Members. The Home Secretary has had to continue using them
because the resources are not yet in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is no
answer to the fallacious nature of her argument for the hon. Lady to
intervene on me and say, “Oh, but there is no clause in the Bill
to say when TPIMs will come into being, which needs to be after the
police have confirmed that sufficient resources are in place to
mitigate the risk to those who will be operating under this
regime.” The hon. Lady still has not answered the question. It
may be that she still does not understand why the argument—I
have no doubt that it was given to her by the Labour Whips—is
such a bad one. We will continue to disagree on this, but it is a
matter of debate, and people can read <em>Hansard</em> and form their own
view. I suspect that the vast majority of those who are sufficiently
unfortunate to have to read <em>Hansard</em> will take the same view as
me, which is that the hon. Lady’s argument was badly planted by
the Labour Whips. That was the first point that I wished to deal with,
and I did so because it was unclear whether I had missed the point this
morning. The answer is obviously that I did not.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000026">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I now turn to
the rather more powerful contribution made by the right hon. Member for
Salford and Eccles; we share a considerable amount of common ground on
this measure. Albeit that some of my hon. Friends might wish that it
went further, it is unfortunately necessary given the security
situation in which the country presently finds itself. The right hon.
Lady saw fit to describe the Bill as dishonest legislation—I
think that she used those words. This is one point where I disagree
with what she said this morning. Indeed, that characterisation is
somewhat regrettable.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000027">&#160;</a>

                  </div>country by virtue of the fact that we are a civilized democracy and have
had protections for our liberties under the common law since time
immemorial. It is therefore right that, if the Government want to
reshape existing legislation that deals with those whose liberty is

protecting the public, that legislation should be debated in is

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
come back to a point that I made during an intervention this morning:
this Committee should, on a bipartisan basis, deal with the substance
of what is necessary to protect the public by restricting
people’s liberties, and not whether we call them control orders,
TPIMs or anything else. That is a semantic question, which I think has
been made obvious to every member of the Committee by the
Opposition’s description of “mini control orders”
or “control orders-lite”. They are seeking to make party
political capital out of that point, which is not what should be taking
place in this House or this Committee. I respectfully submit that we
should focus on what the Bill is about, its measures to protect the
public, and whether they need to go further—as Opposition
Members seem to think—or whether, as I said on Second Reading,
this Bill strikes the right balance between the necessity to protect
the public on one hand and interference with the liberties of the
citizen on the
other.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000029">&#160;</a>

made my point for me. I have listened carefully to what he has said and
there is a great deal of common ground between us, but I think he has
made the very point that I was seeking to establish in my contribution,
namely that what we call this regime is irrelevant. I was seeking to
establish a degree of consensus across the Committee on the view that,
if people who pose a serious threat to the national security of the
country cannot be prosecuted or deported, we must have a regime that
enables us to control their behaviour. The point that I was seeking to
make was that we could have a much more straightforward debate if we
did not pretend that the TPIM regime is a fundamental departure from
the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. It is, in fact, a refinement. By
relaxing some measures and raising the burden of proof, and by not
having a sunset clause, it is a refinement of the existing regime. I
think that the hon. and learned Gentleman, in his usual eloquent and
erudite way, has made that point far better than I
could.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000030">&#160;</a>

am not sure whether my argument is consistent with the entirety of what
she said this morning. Both aspects of my contribution stress, in all
seriousness, that the Committee must approach the issues with which
this Bill grapples in an entirely bipartisan, or perhaps tripartisan,
and proper way. What concerns me about this morning’s
contributions from Opposition Members, and about the facile semantic
debate about whether these are “control orders-lite” or
“mini control orders,” is that we are not focusing, in
the limited time available to the Committee, on what we should be,
namely, as I have already said, the substance of the measures that are
necessary to protect the public, consistent with the liberties that we
hold dear in this country. If the right hon. Lady and the shadow
Minister, the hon. Member for Bradford South, agree with that, they
will not divide the Committee on the clause, and they will

just from this afternoon’s contributions that this has been
quite a passionate debate. A number of important arguments have been

               <p class="tabbed">I should also
formally welcome the Opposition Front-Bench spokespeople. It is a
pleasure to welcome the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood, and this
is possibly the first Bill Committee in which I have had the pleasure
of debating with her. I certainly welcome her to her position. I am
delighted to resume debates with the hon. Member for Bradford
South—he was the first Minister I had the pleasure of debating
with in Committee, on the Consumer Credit Bill I think, back in 2005.
We have had regular debates in Committee Rooms such as this

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
I remember some good, detailed debates with the right hon. Member for
Salford and Eccles on the Police and Crime Bill, and I recognise her
experience. I must also admit to a slight soft spot for the right hon.
Lady—I will confess this at the start of the Committee. At the
time, I was a new Member of the House, and she kindly created a
constituency in my name in the first sitting of the Bill Committee,
because she was unfamiliar with who I was, and I was probably
unfamiliar with who she was. She kindly referred to me on a couple of
occasions as the hon. Member for Brokenshire, which led to a wonderful
debate about what the constituency might look like, which was helpful
at the time, given that my constituency was about to be abolished. I
was grateful for her kind
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000042">&#160;</a>

                  </div>face and the need for Government to take their responsibility
extraordinarily seriously, which we do. Safeguarding our national
security and safety is the first duty of the Government—a
commitment of this Government and the previous one, which is shared by
the public and Parliament. We will not do anything to undermine that
security.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
role and responsibility is to explain to the Committee in its entirety
how the various strands of the Bill fit together. We can look at the
Bill—the point was made well by the right hon. Member for
Wythenshawe and Sale East—but there is a broader context. We
need to look at the roles of what might be described as disruption, of
surveillance and intelligence, of prosecution and of deportation, and
at how all those strands fit together cohesively to deliver on the
safety and security of our citizens. We are debating what might be
considered one of those strands, but it needs to be viewed in context.
That context, given the points made by the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Ladywood, and in case I was not clear enough in response to her
intervention, is why I am seeking to explain that the surveillance and
intelligence sitting alongside the disruption tools are key to the
overarching package of protection that we can deliver. That is what I
was trying to explain in response to her intervention on
context.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Context
is important, so I ought to talk about some of the context of the Bill,
as well as the changes being examined in Committee. Opposition Members,
in essence, are asking why we need to make any changes—that is a
fundamental context which they are taking into account in their
approach to the Committee. Paragraph 7 of the counter-terrorism review
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Control
order powers have always been controversial because they are imposed
without the person on whom they are applied being convicted for the
terrorist activity in which he is judged to be engaged, because of the
use of closed material and because of the very intrusive restrictions
that they can
involve.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000308">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is why the Government embarked on looking at the control order powers
and other intrusive powers in their review, and why certain other
changes are being brought about. There is a need to look at the context
of some of the fundamental liberties that we uphold and believe to be
important in our society—what defines us as a country, and what
defines our values. That has been brought out quite well in some of the
contributions thus far, and my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich
framed it well when he referred to how the state approaches the matter
and how liberties are curtailed. That has been the starting point for
looking at the balance between liberty and security, between collective
liberty and that of the individual, and how to strike the appropriate
balance.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
issues are those of judgment and examination of how that balance is
best struck. Following the review of counter-terrorism legislation, we
concluded that control orders needed a fundamental change, indeed to be
scrapped and replaced with the legislation that we are debating. Some
characteristics are similar in structure, and I do not deny that those
structural characteristics are similar in the procedural ways in which
the legislation is framed, but there are important differences. One is
context, and the fact that the Bill is based on investigation and that
it includes clearly expressed provisions in clause 10 that emphasise
that what we are always trying to do is to bring people before the
courts and to secure a criminal prosecution if that is
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000047">&#160;</a>

Government took the same approach, and whatever criticisms were made at
the time, I did not in any way question the integrity or desire of
Ministers, of whatever political colour, to seek to bring people before
the courts and to secure prosecution and a conviction based on the
evidence, if that is possible. However, there is recognition on both
sides of the Committee that sometimes it is not possible to bring
someone before the courts, either because the evidence is
inadmissible—we can debate what is taking place to make more
evidence admissible—or sometimes because the evidence, if it
were disclosed, could have a dangerous impact on our capabilities,
covert human intelligence sources, and the activities of those who seek
to keep us safe. I endorse the earlier comments about recognising and
thanking all those who do so much, often at great risk to themselves,
in keeping us all safe, and dealing with the threat before
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000048">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is perhaps because of the way the measure
is grounded. The right hon. Lady will obviously have read the Bill
carefully when preparing for the Committee. I point her to clause 10,
which is the key clause that reminds everyone that we are seeking to
ensure prosecutions whenever possible. This measure is largely
preventive, hence the name of the Bill. It is a preventive and
investigatory measure. In large part, the investigation is the support
that sits around it—the covert surveillance, and the additional
funding that is being provided to the police and the security services.
That is why I emphasise the context, and how that investment will
better assist in the overall intelligence perspective to ensure that
more people are brought to justice. Yes, I certainly heard the evidence
that was provided on Tuesday, and the points that the right hon. Lady
sought to adduce when she asked, “Well, how does this assist us
and take us forward?” However, the way in which the measure is
grounded and structured, and the fact there is a statutory requirement
to continue to report back to the police and all those who are working
on our behalf to secure those convictions is so important. It is vital
to telegraph the message from Parliament and Government that that is
our primary
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000050">&#160;</a>

have already admitted to the right hon. Lady and other Committee

disruptive technique is put into place, that puts someone on notice.
Evidence ultimately to gain a conviction may therefore be harder to
secure, but that does not mean it is impossible. The work that sits
alongside the measure is very important. The grounding of the Bill in
the way that I have characterised is
significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000051">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 89<a class="bkMark" name="Column89">&#160;</a>
                  </div>context of an entirely new piece of legislation, often changes the
culture of the way in which these things are approached? We heard
evidence on Tuesday that in the opinion of some control orders are
simply being used as a parking mechanism. As a result, there has been
no investigation of those who are subject to control orders in
circumstances where hon. Members from all parties would agree that the
best thing is to bring these people to
trial.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>

changing the name of control orders to something that includes the word
investigation gives a very clear signal to the law enforcement agencies
and the security services that Parliament wants these people to be
brought to trial. One has only to think of the mistake of the previous
Government in creating something called a Supreme Court to realise how
a change of culture can, in fact, lead to real changes on the
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000053">&#160;</a>

Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup, not for Brokenshire—although
lovely Thomas Hardy moments were conjured up by that. I am listening to
him very carefully and like his colleague, the hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham, he failed to answer my very specific
question. What measures in the TPIM regime are different and will lead
to more people being brought to justice through the conventional
criminal justice system?<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I take his
point about sending a message. The previous Government were often
criticised by Conservative Members for sending messages, rather than
legislating in a proper fashion—some people have referred to it
as “aromapolitics.” If the legislation is to work and to
bring more people to justice and there is a genuine justification for
introducing a new Bill, I am open to hearing about it. However, I have
not yet heard from any hon. Member what specific measures in the TPIMs
Bill are different from control orders and will enable more people to
be brought to justice. In fact, I have heard the contrary from the
Director of Public Prosecutions and from DAC Osborne. The police and
the security services are saying to the Minister that TPIMs are not as
disruptive as control orders because they are a weakening of the
measure. As I think DAC Osborne said, control orders are in the protect
and prepare bit of Contest and TPIMs are under pursue. There is a
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Government really wanted to take such action, they could have put in
place extra surveillance in addition to control orders. If their
justification for the measure is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 90<a class="bkMark" name="Column90">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that more associates will be found and evidence will be obtained, they
could have had extra surveillance. That could have been done if the
reason for the measure is to bring more people to justice. I am afraid
that there are some big logical holes in the Minister’s
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000059">&#160;</a>

is more fundamental than that. It is about the issues of liberty and
where to strike the right balance on the quite invasive measures in the
control order regime. We need to look at the changes as a package
rather than in isolation. Taken together, they will ensure that the
police and security services have the power that they really need, as
well as the enhanced capabilities through surveillance, intelligence
and the way in which the regime itself operates, to have the focus and
to attain the end result.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000060">&#160;</a>

struck by several contributions this morning on the issue of liberty
and how to achieve the right balance. In one exchange it was said that
we could have either security or liberty. I do not accept that. Some
contributors suggested that we were being almost casual with security.
We absolutely are not. We take the responsibility extraordinary
seriously. However, it is fair to say that, when the Opposition were in
government, they were too casual with liberty. Those are not my words,
but the words of the Leader of the Opposition, who
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“My

               <p class="hs_brev">“But

them.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000310">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
was not what I said; it was what the Leader of the Opposition said
about the approach taken by the previous Government. He also said in an
article in <em>The Guardian</em> last summer:<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Well,
I am not quite sure whether I heard that said in Committee this morning
to describe the approach taken by the Opposition. Perhaps they have
reflected on matters and reconsidered, but it is interesting that the
Leader of Opposition himself believes that a different approach should
be taken, and he has underlined the important aspects of how liberty
fits into the issues at
hand.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000064">&#160;</a>

TPIMs in the past two days. I speak as an ex-intelligence officer who
had to recruit sources in Northern Ireland, and one thing that we have
not covered is how, by giving a little more liberty to people under the
TPIMs regime, they would discover that perhaps we are not as bad as
others. It would encourage them to cough up or, indeed, to come over
and perhaps declare that they were in the wrong. That is one of the
advantages of TPIMs, which is why fundamentally, if we keep those
people under surveillance, do things properly and show that we care
about liberty in the way in which we deal with them, we might receive a
better response. It is for that reason that I support TPIMs and

ensure that we do not undermine the very freedoms that we are trying to
protect and thus fuel the problems that we are trying to tackle. That
is why we need to take such great care regarding the steps that we

                  </strong> I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the
Government have made a commitment to provide additional
resource—new money—to the police and the security
services so that they can enhance their intelligence and surveillance
capabilities around the TPIM regime and more generally, which
underlines my point about the context in which they can deliver and
provide enhanced
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000077">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
apologise to members of the Committee for not being able to be clearer
on amounts or sums, but I hope that they understand the challenges
facing the Government and that people may look with malign intent at
what we say publicly in Committee. I have been as forthcoming as I can
be in setting out the enhanced capabilities arising from the overall
package of reform, because the Bill is important and the context is
significant.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000078">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
have noted the comments made in the debate on clause 1. We believe that
the Bill charts a very different direction. The reforms that it makes
are important, including those on issues of liberty. It forms part of
the overall package of measures to deliver security, and it does so in
a way which is more focused, more structured

                  </div>and in some ways less intrusive, which is important in how we frame the
debate about an alternative approach. I therefore hope that hon.
Members will agree that clause 1 should stand part of the Bill, because
we must underline the fact that we are taking a different direction in
seeking to prevent crimes while retaining a focus on bringing criminals
to justice. Ultimately, the Bill is about protection, but it is also
about ensuring that justice is done and seen to be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000079">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> It is a pleasure to speak to this large group of
amendments. The proposals are intended to fix the fundamental problem
that both control orders and TPIMs share, which is the constitutional
objections to them both because, essentially, they sit outside the rule
of law. The shadow Minister accepted the view that some people should
be held outside a legal framework, which I find extremely
disturbing.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000183">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">No doubt, we
face a genuine terrorist threat and I think that Members on both sides
of the Committee would agree that control orders or TPIMs are
exceptional processes. Exceptionalism, however, is simply not the way
to make good law. To work out how to tackle the problem, it is
important to go back to the basics.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000184">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The central
problem is the gap, which has been mentioned, between people about whom
we have enough evidence to prosecute, and people about whom we have
genuine concerns. We face a genuine threat because of that gap, but
what do we do about it? The first and most important step is to try to
close down that gap. It is important to carry out further work and put
further investment into ways of closing it so that we can prosecute
people and go through the due legal process
correctly.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
must resolve the intelligence problems that make us a bit of a laughing
stock in some parts of the world, where people are much more able to
use intelligence in their processes. We must put more money into
investigation and have a greater focus on it. We must allow all sorts
of procedures, such as post-charge questioning, to make it easier to
close that evidence gap and prosecute more people. A problem with
control orders and, to a slightly lesser extent, TPIMs is that they
hinder closure by making it harder to hold an investigation and go to a
prosecution. We need greater focus on that closure. I welcome the extra
financial investments that have been announced, which will accompany
the Bill. Such investments will make a huge difference, because they
will make us better able to investigate and, I hope, achieve more
prosecutions.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000186">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">I
accept, however, that for some people we will not manage to close that
gap, even if we do everything that we should be doing in step 1.
Therefore step 2 should be to try to use existing legal frameworks to
build on. The problem is that the previous Government jumped straight
to step 3, which was to come up with new rules and, as we heard from
the shadow Minister, to hold people outside a legal framework. Surely
that is not what we should do.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to go
back to step 2 and emphasise the importance of the rule of law and take
our lesson from what is already set out for dealing with a range of
criminals, some of whom are very violent—police bail. Police
bail exists; it works. It is not used perfectly in every single case,
but it is well established, it is a key part of the existing legal
framework, and it would not cause the constitutional problems and
concerns that arise from control orders and TPIMs. It would get rid of
that whole concern about exceptionalism. Importantly, however, it would
maintain security. Police bail could be implemented to work in several
different ways, but my group of amendments details one particular way
to do so. Some others ways would change the nuance.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 118
is the key proposal. It begins with a role for the Home Secretary.
Concern was expressed about whether a custody sergeant should initiate
the process, but that would be inappropriate. The Home Secretary would
have the initial role to say: “This is someone about whom we
have concerns.” We do not, however, need to give executive
control—an executive decision about the liberty of
individuals—to the Home Secretary. That would, on principle, be
a step away from the rule of law.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At present,
there is a bar to prevent police bail in terrorism cases. The Home
Secretary would initiate the process, which would remove that bar. If
the bar were gone, on the application of the Home Secretary, the bail
route would be available. At that point, the usual legal processes
could be used—people could be arrested for their terrorism
offence, because we would, presumably, have reasonable suspicion that
they were involved in terrorism well before we got to any of the other
processes. They can be detained without charge for 14 days now, which
is down from Labour’s proposal for 90 days. Even so, we have 14
days during which it is possible to question people.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In my
amendments, a chief police officer would be in charge of deciding what
would happen under police bail. All the normal police bail conditions
would be allowed, and the chief police officer would also be allowed to
use each measure in schedule 1. In keeping with the naming, we have
continued to use the terms “TPIM notice” and
“TPIMs”. Police chiefs would have the power to implement
each measure in the Bill. However, rather than the Executive acting
outside a legal framework, it would fall to the police. There would be
normal protections and a High Court appeal. In the interests of time, I
will not take the Committee through every amendment that I have tabled,
but I will take questions. By putting the primacy for the measures with
the police and by using the terminology from the Bail Act 1976, we put
a very clear focus on investigation and on the role that we should all
want to see. Ultimately we all want people such as terrorists to be
convicted.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
wealth of consequential amendments, but at the core is this: the Home
Secretary does not decide to apply the measures outside the normal
legal frameworks; 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 101<a class="bkMark" name="Column101">&#160;</a>
                  </div>instead, we use the tried and tested approach of bail, which has existed
in this country for a very long time, to address the problem. As we
heard earlier in the week, the proposals have the support of Lord
Macdonald, Liberty and Justice. They provide the security that we need
and the liberty that we deserve, as well as fitting within the normal
legal process. Every schedule 1 power and every power under the current
police bail provisions would be available, but we avoid the
constitutional
objections.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000192">&#160;</a>

drawing his remarks to a close. I would certainly benefit from a little
more elucidation about the practicalities of how his proposals might
work. The more he says, the more I am concerned—not necessarily
always in this place—about people’s liberty. If he were
to set up the type of framework that I think he is suggesting, would he
ask the chief constable of a particular area, depending on where the
person was picked up, to make a decision about restrictions that could
be placed on the individual, which could be at least as draconian as we
have heard, if not more draconian than what is available under control
orders or TPIMs? The chief constable would not have seen the full
intelligence picture and would not be able to assess the threat to
national security. I am very concerned that the hon. Gentleman, despite
his liberal credentials, may cast a much wider net for people. If we
have TPIMs and police bail, we might be “locking up”
people or placing them under restrictions in many more cases. It is
very contradictory; I am

police bail already exists, so I do not think that the introduction of
police bail powers will lead to a massive police state or any such
thing. I absolutely reject that. We have that already. The only issue
is the fact that we do not currently allow terrorist suspects to be
held under police bail. People suspected of any other crime are held on
police bail, so I do not see how the police would suddenly experience a
huge surge in power. As I said earlier, the process has to be initiated
by the

right; we do not want to give the police unfettered power either. The
Home Secretary has to say that it is appropriate to have such measures
for a particular person. However, it would not simply be down to the
Home Secretary’s judgment, with a slight overview from the court
to check that it is not obviously flawed. It would not just be up to
her to judge how the measure would
operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000197">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The chief officer of police would determine those
measures. That is a higher standard than is currently used for other
forms of bail. There is police bail in this country. I do not recall
the right hon. Lady speaking out against it as a massive infringement
of people’s rights. This change would be a step forward. If
there were concerns, the Home Secretary could withdraw the notice. The
Home Secretary would presumably be able to talk to the chief constable
if particular things needed to be brought to their attention. The
provision would provide greater safeguards from a liberal perspective
and in terms of liberty. There would be more opportunity for appeal to
the High Court, which would have the power to vary bail conditions, as
it does currently, rather than only to see whether the decision was
obviously
flawed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000199">&#160;</a>

therefore absolutely reject the right hon. Lady’s position. I

I suggest that she read the document that Liberty has produced, which
deals with the matter in even greater detail. Not being a lawyer or
police officer, I cannot give her the full details of how the police
bail system operates, but I am sure that as a lawyer and former Home
Office Minister herself, she knows that. This proposal would provide
security, liberty and a focus on investigation. I hope that the

seriously.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000200">&#160;</a>

following the consultation that has taken place in relation to the
counter-terrorism review. It sounds a wonderful liberal solution, but
we do not have the detail and the substance of how it would work in
practice. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Cambridge wishes to
press amendment 118 to a Division. I am prepared to go away and look at

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 103<a class="bkMark" name="Column103">&#160;</a>
                  </div>for Cambridge about exactly how the proposed system would work. I, too,
will read the Liberty briefing in detail. The provision was presented
by Lord Macdonald on Tuesday almost as a silver bullet, slightly akin
to the use of intercept as evidence—if only we could use police
bail or intercept material, none of these unfortunate measures would be
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have a number of questions for the hon. Gentleman. I understand that,
at the moment, police bail is given to people after they have been held
for 48 hours, pre-charge. They are released on police bail and the
conditions are that they are not likely to commit an offence or
interfere with witnesses—those kinds of criteria. At the moment,
suspected terrorists who are arrested can be held for up to 14 days
pre-charge while they are questioned. What is proposed in the report is
that at 14 days, either they would be released or they could be subject
to a control order. So is the hon. Gentleman proposing the 48 hours
that currently applies under the Bail Act, or the 14 or 28
days for pre-charge
detention?<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
understanding of police bail is that there must be an ongoing
investigation—that is fundamental to the whole concept of police
bail. Whether the matter involves serious and organised crime,
international partners or whatever, there must be an ongoing
investigation. If, as we have been discussing, people have an
intelligence picture and at that time they know that that intelligence
cannot be converted into evidence or is inadmissible in a court, how
will they convince the High Court or the person who challenges the
police bail that they have a sufficient legal base to enable them to
argue the case for police bail, when they know that at that moment they
do not have an ongoing investigation that is likely to lead to evidence
that will be admissible in a criminal
court?<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
those circumstances, and quite properly, a judge will consider the
situation and say, “What you’re creating is a sham regime
to enable you to rely on police bail, but in your heart of hearts, as a
prosecuting authority”—as Keir Starmer
said—“you know that it will be very unlikely that you
will get any new evidence or information that will enable you to bring
this person to trial.” If I was making that decision as a
judge—luckily, I am not—I would say, “I do not
feel comfortable with giving you serially extended police bail. You
come back to me every month. You say you want another month, another
month and another month, yet at the heart of it, you have no basis on
which you will be able to bring this back.” Dare I repeat the
words said earlier? That is a dishonest approach. That is a dishonest
approach to the issue, and we must be honest and grapple with the
practical
realities.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000205">&#160;</a>

but, in the meantime, will the right hon. Lady look at amendment 44,
which specifies that there would be a need for further investigation of
any matter in connection with which the person had been detained?
Incidentally, the period would be unchangeable from 14 days. We hope
that there is a need for further investigation in such cases, otherwise

it is known at the time that it would be unlikely that further

                  </div>90:10 against. A judge who was asked to authorise the continuation of
bail conditions would find it difficult to resist a challenge that that
bail was granted wrongly when there was precious little likelihood of
further information arising. The hon. Gentleman is using the idea of
criminal investigation almost as a fig leaf for an artificial regime
that makes him feel more comfortable because he had connected it,
however tenuously, to the criminal justice
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000207">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> When the idea was posited yesterday by Lord
Macdonald he put his argument persuasively, and the mere fact that it
was posited by him gives it considerable force. I am no way criticising
my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge, whose liberal credentials are
unimpeachable, but they slightly unravelled in his second
explanation.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have two principle concerns about the measure in addition to that put
ably by the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles. First, it goes
down the familiar route of trying to remove democratically accountable
people from important procedures. The key distinction is that police
officers with delegated powers from Parliament and the Crown will
always err on the side of caution, because their position is to protect
the public. Therefore, they will always try to apply for police bail
and not balance up necessarily the demands of liberty in the way in
which the Home Secretary, answerable to Parliament at the same time as
to the public safety and wider considerations of liberty, will do in
all circumstances. I am worried that, in trying to produce a liberal
alteration to the regime, we would end up with an unintended
consequence, which is a far greater issuance of police bail on grounds
that may or may not be correct, merely because there is no check. I
accept that there is a place for the Home Secretary in such matters,
but it is reduced
considerably.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
I am worried about consistency throughout the country. I have the great
privilege of having a Suffolk constituency. Suffolk has the smallest
police force in the country and fantastically run it is, too. It is
local, and it has marvellous chief constables, and I am sure that they
would take such matters into consideration. I would not be happy about
the previous Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis having control in
such circumstances and the decision-making powers proposed by my hon.
Friend because, frankly, we would have much of London under police
bail. I am therefore worried about the unintended consequences of what
my hon. Friend has suggested because so much power would be given to
the police. So many people would be put before the courts under police
bail, and we would be overwhelmed by the number of people just because
the police wanted to protect their backs. Let us imagine what it would
be like for the police officer, with an atrocity that might have
happened or might not have happened, as a result of the lack of
intelligence. That officer would then have to face the Home Secretary
and the public and say why he did not put them under police bail when
he knew just one tiny piece of
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000210">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge indicated to the Committee that
the amendments follow closely the provisions of the Bail Act; in fact,
that is not that case. In his amendment 118, proposed subsection (1C)
lists the conditions that have to be fulfilled for the procedure to be
brought into play. Under the Bail Act, there is a very important
restriction on bail—there is no right to bail—where a
person needs to be kept in custody for their own protection. I do not
see such a restriction anywhere in my hon. Friend’s amendments.
For example, posit the situation in which there is reasonable
belief—or, under the current regime, reasonable
suspicion—that someone is likely to conduct a suicide
attack.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000214">&#160;</a>

have been making a bad point, as the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Ladywood did earlier. If I have not sufficiently read his amendments, I
apologise and withdraw that point. However, there are other fundamental
objections to his proposals, of which I will deal with only
two.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
first objection has already been partly addressed by my hon. Friend the
Member for Ipswich, who pointed out that nobody under the regime
proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge is answerable for
it in Parliament. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich said, the
proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge would essentially
delegate the powers to those who will err on the side of caution and
would not be answerable for significantly restricting people’s
liberties. For that reason alone, given that we are also concerned
about striking a proper balance, it is simply not appropriate that that
should be done other than by a person who is answerable to Parliament.
That is the first fundamental objection with which he has to grapple,
and I have not yet heard his answer or conceived a solution to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000219">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second objection is far more serious, and I have little doubt that the
right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles will agree with it. It is
simply that there are some people who it is reasonable to believe are
engaged in activities related to terrorism, but who cannot be brought
to trial. They cannot be brought to trial for the simple reason that
were one to proceed as the criminal justice system currently works,
evidence would have to be given that revealed either highly sensitive
information or information that was damaging not to the Government but
to the people of this country whose protection is the

			Column number: 106<a class="bkMark" name="Column106">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Government’s first duty. Where such people cannot be brought to
trial, the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge
would result in one of two things: either they would be kept
indefinitely on police bail, which we would all agree is wholly and
utterly unacceptable, or their bail conditions would be lifted, in
which case we would have let go of the very issue with which we are
trying to grapple, because they would be free to go about their
business of busily planning to blow up London buses and tube trains and
goodness knows what else all over the country. Unless and until my hon.

wholly misconceived, if not downright

essential that the person who holds responsibility for the security of

comments that the hon. Member for Ipswich made on the importance of
that. He also made an extremely relevant point that if it was in the
hands of chief police officers, there would be at least 43 different
approaches to the question. When it comes to matters of national
security, we have to have national standards operated in a carefully

requires that there is an ongoing review of the investigation. The Bill
has that requirement in clause 10. There is no question but
that if police bail were used there would have to be a higher test
applied to that ongoing investigation. We have heard about the
difficulties that there are in investigating these people and getting a
successful prosecution. There are a small number for whom prosecution
would simply not be possible. The hon. and learned Gentleman is right:
the end result of that would be that dangerous people would walk free
from the court and the people of this country would be at great
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000224">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We have had a powerful debate on some of the
issues that surround this group of amendments. I respect my hon. Friend
the Member for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 107<a class="bkMark" name="Column107">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Cambridge for tabling them. The issue of the use of police bail was
something that came up during our evidence sessions. Many people, with
an honest and genuine view, who grapple with these extraordinarily
difficult issues, posit the issue from time to time. I respect Liberty
for how it has sought to advance the proposals. It lies behind some of
my hon. Friend’s amendments that seek to deal with that
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is a
difficult challenge, but for the reasons that my hon. Friends and
Opposition hon. and right hon. Members have highlighted, there are
flaws in the structure that is being drawn up. There are issues on the
principle behind police bail, because of the difficulties that Lord
Carlile highlighted during his evidence. He made the point that a
control order has been issued to three people who have been acquitted.
It is hard. I am not pretending that we want to be in this situation,
but we are. When the risks are balanced, there is a need for a
preventive measure to be able to disrupt and deal with the challenges
that are at
hand.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
issue of bail was considered during the course of the counter-terrorism
review. The manner in which it came forward on the evidence and
information that has been provided did not point towards us being able
to support it or feel that it was an appropriate way forward. When I
was preparing for this debate, I looked at what the previous Government
thought of the issue, because it has been considered for some time. The
right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson), who was the Minister with
responsibility for police and security in the previous Government, gave
evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights on 1 December 2009. He
said that it is “an interesting point”, which it is. He
went
on:<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
have discussed this with the police, with ACPO, and with other
agencies, and the advice that we have been given is that the level of
offence for individuals and the type of offence that has been
considered to date is not suitable for bail, and that was the advice
given to us by operational police officers, and that is the advice we
have
accepted.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000313">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
shows the challenge before us, and, yes, we are grappling with
difficult
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
link to ongoing criminal investigations and the proposed use of police
bail for those being investigated for terrorism offences, combined with
the more limited purposes for which bail can be used, would, in our
judgment, not work in the circumstances in which the risk arises. There
is a particular risk where intelligence indicates a serious threat, but
where exhaustive investigation has not yielded admissible evidence that
is sufficient to prosecute and where further investigation is unlikely
to yield such evidence. A risk may also arise where an individual has
been unsuccessfully prosecuted but is still assessed as posing a risk
to the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000229">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is also a risk where prosecution is not possible, not because of a lack
of admissible evidence, but because using the evidence would not be
appropriate, because there would be a serious and unacceptable risk to
a covert human intelligence source, for example. And there are risks
where there are foreign nationals who we cannot prosecute but want to
remove from the country, but where deportation has not proved possible
because of European convention on human rights concerns about safety on
return.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000230">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
main problem with the approach outlined by my hon. Friend the Member
for Cambridge is that it does not address the problem. That is why, as
a Government, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 108<a class="bkMark" name="Column108">&#160;</a>
                  </div>we cannot consider it further in this context. I have, however,
underlined the Government’s commitment to the priority of
prosecution. I can probably say that that commitment is shared by all
members of the Committee. Obviously, we have sought to emphasise that
in the approach we have
outlined.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000231">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
proposal outlined in these amendments raises a number of other
potentially difficult issues. A key example is the level of involvement
that the Home Secretary would need to have in considering matters
directly related to an ongoing investigation and prosecution of an
individual. That would be a highly unusual approach given the
importance we rightly place on the independence from Government of the
police and prosecuting authorities. That separation of powers is key,
and it was the point adduced in the comments of the right hon. Member
for Wythenshawe and Sale
East.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000232">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Even
if there was an argument for police bail to be available in terrorism
cases, it is unlikely that we would consider this model because it
departs significantly from the model that applies in other cases and it
raises the constitutional issue of the Secretary of State having a role
with an inappropriate level of involvement in operational
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000233">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
members of the Committee may be aware, the Government’s review
of counter-terrorism and security powers considered whether suspected
terrorists should be allowed bail. The police recommended against
making bail available for terrorism suspects because of the potential
risk to public safety. The Government agree with that
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000234">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
priority for the police and the prosecutor is to either charge or
release suspected terrorists as quickly as possible. Therefore, we want
to retain that model. I assure the Committee that, under the current
arrangement, control orders have not been used in cases in which there
is an ongoing criminal investigation with a realistic and pending
prospect of prosecution. Lord Carlile has given evidence on that in
some of the reports to which he
alluded.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000235">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is with regret that I am unable to accept the amendments that my hon.
Friend the Member for Cambridge has introduced with a genuine intent to
deal with the issue. I in no way impugn the desire behind what is
intended under the amendments or by those who have articulated and
argued the case outside the Committee, too. It is genuinely held that
that unfortunately misses an important factor, which is that sometimes
a prosecution cannot be brought. Inevitably, bail is linked to
prosecution and there will be hard, difficult circumstances when that
is not possible. I say that with regret and reluctance, but that is the
situation in which we find ourselves. Given that risk and the
difficulties with his proposal, I hope that my hon. Friend will agree
to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000236">&#160;</a>

reminded me of one of the contradictions in the Bill. One of the main

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 109<a class="bkMark" name="Column109">&#160;</a>
                  </div>were sufficiently different from control orders to provide a positive
incentive for ongoing investigation, for more evidence to be gathered
and for more people to be brought to trial. However, in all
circumstances that the hon. Gentleman has described, I have not yet
heard what measures will make such action more likely. In his latest
contribution to the debate, he seemed to be stating even more firmly
that there circumstances in which there would
be—<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000239">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Obviously, we have discussed the issue. I
have sought to make it clear that terrorism prevention and
investigation measures are primarily disruptive and that they are
primarily preventive, but that they sit within the context of
investigation. Clause 10 underlines such issues. I
understand the right hon. Lady’s point, and I am sorry that I
have not persuaded her of my argument. We will obviously have different
views, but I note that we are probably in agreement in recognising the
difficult challenges that exist in such cases. We must bring those
crimes to justice, which is why preventive and disruptive measures are
important in delivering the safety and security that all members of the
Committee want to uphold. In that context, and on reflecting on the
difficult circumstances and challenges that we face, I hope that my
hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge will be minded to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000241">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to draw attention briefly to amendment 44. To step slightly
further back, to apply for a TPIM notice and to allow bail to happen,
the Home Secretary would have to been involved in each case. That would
deal with the objections made about thousands and thousands of such
cases appearing suddenly. That would not happen unless the Home
Secretary decided that it was important to apply for thousands and
thousands of
notices.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000243">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
44 specifies the conditions when someone could apply for police bail. I
should have thought that we would have all agreed on such matters. The
Minister highlighted his concern that the person would have to be
arrested for a terrorism-related offence. That is clear. As for whether
there was not enough evidence to charge the individual of the offence,
I am sure that we would agree that, if there were, the person should be
charged and there was a need for further investigation of any matter in
connection with which the person was detained.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000244">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I listened
carefully to the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles about whether
such action would be a sham investigation. I do not want it to be a
sham investigation. We should be trying to find other investigative
measures, whenever possible, so that we can prosecute such people. I
want to see a real investigation. There are techniques that we could
use to gain evidential material. However, the right hon. Lady is
absolutely right: one of the purposes of such measures is to have more
investigation and more prosecutions. If such action led to sham
investigations, that is clearly not the intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000245">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
measures would stop people engaging in various activities and include,
in particular, committing an offence while on bail under the Bail Act
1976. That would clearly cover any cases when someone would be a risk.
A number of other interesting points were made. What struck me as
fascinating—I had not expected this from the
Committee—was the fear of the police that was evident in some
comments. There seems to be an idea that we would not be able to trust
chief officers to have those powers, but they use police bail in all
sorts cases with a range of fairly violent people. I have been
fascinated by comments that suggest we could not trust the police to
implement the proposal; perhaps I have a bit more faith in police
fairness.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000246">&#160;</a>

comment was aimed at me, and I do not want my words to be misconstrued.
There is nothing about which I do not trust the police, but the
proposal would give them the powers to take away—possibly for
years at a time—someone’s liberty under very considerable
bail conditions. If the Home Secretary were involved in every single
case, I do not understand where the nexus would be between her and the
chief police officer. I am confused about that

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
power of the Executive to cast a man into prison without formulating
any charge known to the law, and particularly to deny him judgment by

and is the foundation of all totalitarian

               </p>
               <p>I

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
argued against having indefinite police bail; but we do not want
indefinite TPIMs either, which will come to an end after two years. I
am concerned, as are many others, about imposing such measures on
people indefinitely without a conviction. The issue of permanence is
fundamental, and it would apply equally to my proposal as to TPIMs. We
would not want to run any of the measures indefinitely.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
made a number of serious points and I thank him for the tone in which
he did so. He reported that the police were worried about releasing
people on bail for terrorist offences because we would not have enough
controls for them. That is precisely why the controls in my proposal
slightly strengthen police bail to cover all the measures in schedule 1
to the Bill. Exactly the same measures might be imposed on someone for
exactly the same length of time, but with a greater focus on
investigation, and with a different process that would be within the
rule of law.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000252">&#160;</a>

think that that would give confidence to all of us who have concerns
about—watering-down is too strong a word—the change in

to the clause. The whole regime is based on the Home Secretary’s
making an order, which is subject to High Court scrutiny based on
judicial review. Clearly, when the court looks at whether the Home
Secretary’s decision is correct, it will decide whether she has
taken into account all relevant considerations, whether she has taken
into account any irrelevant conditions and whether she has reached a
decision that no reasonable Home Secretary could reach, which are the
basic principles of judicial review. The purpose of the amendments is
to add to the Bill some of the relevant considerations that the Home
Secretary should include in the process of deciding whether to make a

have already had several debates about resources, the extra money that

we have heard various figures. I know that the Minister has provided
extra resources, but I am still extremely worried by Lord
Carlile’s evidence about the cost of 24-hour security and
surveillance for each person. I am not yet convinced that the extra
resources will be sufficient to meet the extra costs incurred, and we
ought to pursue that very practical
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000275">&#160;</a>

                  </div>He knows the figures for the resources that he has put in place to cope
with the TPIM regime. If he looks at those figures and the ones cited
by Lord Carlile of a cost of anywhere between £10 million and
£18 million per TPIM—if there are only 10 of those, that
is £100 million—he will know the relationship
between what he has provided and the likely cost. I am very concerned,
and I want the Home Secretary, in deciding whether to issue a TPIM, to
have to have regard to the practical implications of whether the police
and the security services have the people, the techniques and the
ability to carry out the
surveillance.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000276">&#160;</a>

controls. We can argue about whether that is right or not, but it is
the case because there is no relocation clause, there will be access to
mobile phones and the internet, and there are differing conditions on
work and studying, all of which draw back from the current regime. We
can debate the rights and wrongs of that, but if resources are not in
place to fill the gap caused by that drawing-away from the current
regime, we are opening ourselves up to the risk posed by the
individual, to go back to paragraph (c). It is important that the Bill
provides that the Secretary of State, in exercising her decision-making
power, must focus on those important
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000277">&#160;</a>

The Minister will no doubt argue that, by introducing fewer controls
and additional resources, the overall risk is no greater than under the
control order regime. We have a different opinion on that, but that
would be his contention. My right hon. Friend is arguing very
effectively that the Home Secretary must be satisfied on that in each

                  </strong> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for
expressing himself so forcefully, because this is an important issue.
When we come to the judicial review principles that the High Court will
examine when addressing the Home Secretary’s decision, the High
Court needs to be satisfied not only about the risk posed by the
individual and the facts of overall national security, but that the
provisions are in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000278">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure the Minister will feel this as greatly as I do. I feel it as a
personal responsibility that the orders should never be made unless the
gap can be filled. The police and the security services have both said
that the new resources will help mitigate the risk; they have not said
that they will eliminate the risk. These things cannot be perfectly
resolved, but they have said that the new resources will mitigate the
risk. How far that mitigation goes, and how big the remaining gap is,
goes to the heart of the judgment in such cases, which is what the
Minister
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000279">&#160;</a>

(d) of amendment 23 goes to the heart of my point. Paragraphs (a) to
(c) highlight the issues to which the Home Secretary must have regard,
and, therefore, the amendment would set out those important issues in
the Bill. I thought that, not the hon. and learned Gentleman himself,
but the hon. Member for Ipswich might want to intervene to say that, in
addition to those factors, the Home Secretary should also have regard
to liberty, freedom and other such matters, but he has not chosen to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is right to set out in the Bill the factors that the Secretary of State
should have in mind when she makes a serious order that affects
people’s liberty; we are all agreed on that. It would be helpful
to have that spelled out, particularly for the High Court when it looks
at whether the order should be made. When it does so, the High Court
assesses whether the Home Secretary’s decision is flawed, which
is the phrase it uses, on the basis of judicial review
principles—now I am remembering my legal experience. The High
Court would have to make an assessment of whether the Home Secretary
had taken account of relevant considerations, whether she had taken
account of irrelevant considerations and whether she reached a decision
that no rational Home Secretary would
reach.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000283">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Setting
out in the Bill the factors that the Home Secretary needs to take into
account aids the transparency of the judicial process, because it
brings to the surface the reasons for making such orders and allows
people to see whether the balance has been struck in a proper way. It
is important to take account not only of the theoretical issues, but of
the practical issues of whether there are the resources to fill the
gap.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000284">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I shall be brief. I cannot support the
amendments for two reasons. First, as drafted, they do not make it
clear whether the views are the only factors that the
Secretary of State must take into account. It is also unclear whether
the list is exhaustive, or whether it is intended merely to be a list
of matters that may be taken into account. The amendments are ill
framed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000285">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">More
seriously, I have to say to the right hon. Member for Salford and
Eccles and the shadow Minister that these are exactly the sort of
amendments that one expects of the Opposition, because they arise from
going through the Bill line by line. When one gets to the end of clause
2, it no doubt seems sensible to table the amendments, but as soon as
one gets to clause 3, one sees that they are entirely
unnecessary, either because all the points contained in the amendments
are duplicated in the conditions, or because it is blindingly obvious
that they are matters of which the Secretary of State will take account
when lawfully reaching a decision to ask the court to issue a TPIM.
Frankly, we have  enough law and enough statutes in this
country, much of which we have to thank the right hon. Lady and the
previous Government for, so I do not see why we should add
unnecessarily to the burden on poor lawyers  like
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000286">&#160;</a>

supporting the amendments, it was my genuine intention to have a little
more transparency in the Bill and to express my concerns that these
issues of national security weigh heavily with all of us. I wanted to
raise the issue of resource, because I am not convinced by any stretch
of the imagination that the current proposal for extra resource will
fill the gap of risk. If that is the case, it will weigh heavily on the
Minister when he comes to make his
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000288">&#160;</a>

am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for pointing out that
clause 3 covers some of this territory. I contend that that clause is
not exhaustive, however, and being able to say that something is
“blindingly obvious” is not a reason not to put it in
legislation, in my experience. As he will know, it is important that we
construe language, look at words and look at what is in the Bill before
we consider what might have been blindingly obvious. If something is
not in a Bill, it is far more difficult to determine the intention of
legislators and what they had in mind. I urge the hon. and learned
Gentleman, despite his extensive legal experience, to be a little more
understanding and a little more generous when the intention is to have
a more transparent regime, which I would have thought was attractive to
some coalition Members. When dealing with factors to be taken into

legislative framework than they often

                  </strong> I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend
the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham for his impressive demolition
of the amendments—there might not be too much more for me to
add. I gently say to the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles that
none of the factors outlined in the amendments are contained in the
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which she seeks to pray in aid. I am
sure that she would not mind me suggesting that when she was deciding
whether a control order should be imposed, she would have had regard to
these factors, even though they are not specified in the legislation
that she brought forward. If the factors were so important, she would,
no doubt, have been championing them and asking her officials to ensure
that they were put into the 2005 Bill. However, she did not do so. In
that sense, the 2005 Act and the Bill operate in the same
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments raise an important issue. I agree that the Secretary of
State should take into account the matters outlined in amendments 19
and 23 when imposing a TPIM notice. National security as it relates to
terrorism, the protection of the public, the risk posed by the
individual, and the capacity of the police and the security and
intelligence agencies are all important factors for consideration.
However, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham rightly identified, there is no need for the amendments,
because the Bill provides that the Government must take such factors
into account.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000291">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
conditions that are set out in clause 3 are particularly relevant,
because conditions C and D cover the factors that are outlined in both
amendments. Condition C is<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“that the
Secretary of State reasonably considers that it is necessary, for
purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of
terrorism, for terrorism prevention and investigation measures to be
imposed on the individual.”,<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000319">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">while condition D
is<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000320">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“that the
Secretary of State reasonably considers that it is necessary, for
purposes connected with preventing or restricting the
individual’s involvement in terrorism-related activity, for the
specified terrorism prevention and investigation measures to be imposed
on the
individual.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000321">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
consideration of whether a TPIM notice and the specific measures
imposed under it are necessary means, by definition, that the
Government must consider national security as it relates to terrorism,
the risk to the public, the risk posed by the individual, and the
resources of the police and the security services. All those factors
relate to the question of necessity.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In terms of
judicial review, the court does not look only at whether the Home
Secretary acts rationally and takes relevant factors into account. In
the context of judicial review, in control order cases—by
extension, this is likely to apply in TPIM cases—the court looks
carefully at the Home Secretary’s decisions and considers how
reasonable and proportionate they are. That is a general view
undertaken by the court.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On resources
and the support that is available, let me be clear that I believe that
our police and security services are equal to this challenge. If I did
not, I would not take this approach, and nor would we be bringing
forward the Bill. I remind hon. Members of what I said on Second
Reading: the director general of the Security Service told the Home
Secretary that he is content that the changes provide an acceptable
balance between the needs of national security and civil liberties, and
that the overall package mitigates risk. I hope that the hon. Member
for Bradford South will withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000295">&#160;</a>

amendments in his customary way. In all the years that I have been in
the House—I think this is my 17th—this is the first time
that I have served on a Committee alongside a judge, which is good news
for my legal advice and support to find out about many of these issues.
There is an array of lawyers—working class and
otherwise—on the Committee from whom we can benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000296">&#160;</a>

time in the House, the hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham will find that many amendments to Bills are not drafted in the
way that he might like, but they provide an opportunity for the
Opposition to nudge, cajole and push Ministers into giving us more
information about their thinking. It was in that spirit that the
amendments were tabled.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000297">&#160;</a>

reputation, at least in this Committee, as being something of a bruiser
with regard to his demolition jobs on amendments. I am grateful to him

accused me only of being blindingly obvious, as opposed to
idiotic.<a class="bkMark" name="11062330000298">&#160;</a>
