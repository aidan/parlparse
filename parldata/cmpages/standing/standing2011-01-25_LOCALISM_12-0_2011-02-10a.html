                        <p class="tabbed">We were
discussing the question, raised by amendment 92, of whether
restricting the expression of interest to local bodies was right. I
made the point that there are many national organisations with local
branches that might be particularly useful in helping to build capacity
in areas that may not have a local body at the outset. It is deliberate
and right that we have chosen to do things in that way to kick-start
the process.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000032">&#160;</a>

113, in the name of the hon. Lady, seems pretty benign. There is no
deliberate exclusion of the word “community” where
subsection (7) says “voluntary”. As she knows, the form
in such matters is to reflect on the issue, check that there is no
technical reason for the exclusion and come back to it on Report if
necessary, but I see nothing particularly objectionable in the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000033">&#160;</a>

amendment 114 would lead to an unnecessary restriction. It seeks to
make every organisation that takes up the right to challenge and to
express an interest explicitly not-for-profit. One of my hon. Friends
made the point earlier that we and, I think, the Opposition Front-Bench
team are in favour of mutuals and co-operatives being created. I do not
know if there are any members of the Co-operative party on the Benches

persuaded that the co-operative form has a lot to offer the country,
and we would like a revival of it. Co-operatives sometimes make a
surplus, which they return to their members, and I was interested to
read that the Co-operative Group announced a record profit of
£50 million, which will go to its members as a dividend. It
would be unnecessarily restrictive to exclude co-operatives, whether
they be micro and very small or voluntary enterprises that structure
themselves in that way. We would not want that to happen, inadvertently

otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000036">&#160;</a>

amendment is that the clause would prevent such a body from expressing
an interest, but paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (5) refer to
“two or more employees” of an authority, so that would be
a means for a co-operative to express an interest. In
paragraph (e),

be our intention in regulation to specify co-operatives, mutuals and
social enterprises as being a particular type of “relevant
body”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000040">&#160;</a>

that activity in a locality might be siphoned off through profit, and
that profit spent in another locality. Will the Minister assure the

                           </strong> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman’s
question. Clearly, the provision could have been expressed in a way
that did not specify community bodies. We are interested to ensure that
at the next stage—the procurement exercise—social value
in the local area can be taken into account. That is very much our
intention. As the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South said, there
is currently a consultation on the drafting, and if any concerns come
out of that we will reflect on them. However, the Government’s
intentions are clear to the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000042">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Members of
the Committee who are interested in such matters will know that we are
talking about an area of great change. Different types of bodies have
established themselves. The social enterprise movement has long
traditions, but it is flowering in ways that present different models
and organisational forms. There are community interest companies, and
companies limited by guarantee. Those new arrangements allow bodies
with a social purpose to establish themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given that we
are dealing with primary legislation, it is important to allow
flexibility for the Secretary of State to bring in regulations, so that
if a new organisational form is developed in future—a mutual or
co-operative may have a particular legal form in the future—the
Secretary of State can include it in the list without bringing a Bill
before Parliament, which, clearly, almost never happens.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For that
reason, we think it important to have that flexibility, and to have the
list in a statutory instrument rather than the Bill. I hope that the
Committee will accept that the clear intention throughout this process,
as expressed in the consultation document, is to keep up with
innovation and change, rather than to licence a great multinational
company to bring something forward; I reassure the Committee of that. I
am sure that those words will be considered in any future debate on a
statutory instrument on the subject. That is the reason for the
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000047">&#160;</a>

previous sittings by Opposition Members—and in some cases by my
hon. Friends—about whether all the safeguards

			Column number: 470<a class="bkMark" name="Column470">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are needed. I hope that the Committee will accept that the intention is
to go with the spirit of the Bill and keep it flexible and up to date,
recognising that this is an organic area of policy and that different
forms may develop.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">During the
evidence sessions, in response to a question from the hon. Member for
Scunthorpe, I made a commitment to reflect on whether the powers are
needed to their full extent. I agree that the power is far-reaching,
but it is for a positive purpose. I undertake to reflect on that, and
on some of the other powers, and look at whether there may be
alternative ways of capturing the requirement for such flexibility.
However, I think the flexibility is important.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000049">&#160;</a>

one thing that I would hate to happen—a piece of legislation
suddenly going out of date and people not being able to take it up. I
want it to be a live piece of legislation, and the way to keep it live
is to allow statutory instruments to update it from time to time, but I
will reflect on that and say more about it on Report. I think that I

Minister to look at amendment 90? I do not think that he has commented
on it yet, although it may be his intention to do so later. It relates
to an expression of interest by two or more employees. I have been
deeply involved in procurement issues for 25 years. At the Ministry of
Defence, I worked with a succession of Secretaries of State, from the
colourful Michael Heseltine to Des Browne and, during that period, an
interesting discussion evolved about how we best protect propriety and
the public interest and, incidentally, how we give employees a voice in
the process. The general view was that the last thing we should allow
for is—to use a term used in certain other
situations—insider trading, which allows individuals to benefit
as a consequence of a procurement process or, in this case, of
initiating a process that might lead to a procurement
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the light of the recent decision that was rightly taken to abort the
tendering exercise for the air-sea rescue service, is the provision not
a recipe for two individuals to get together, spot an opportunity for
themselves and go for it, regardless of the public interest or that of
the community? Unless a safeguard is built into the provision, it is
surely open to serious
abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000052">&#160;</a>

the spirit in which it was intended. There is no intention to allow
abuse, and there is a safeguard. I think that I addressed the amendment
at the beginning of my remarks. We are talking about whether we should
put obstacles in the way of people who express an interest. To require
any group of employees to organise a ballot of other employees in
advance of even expressing an interest would be a burden. It would most
likely be costly and put them off. The authority has every right to
consider the implications of responding to a particular expression of
interest, and the right time to do that is when it receives it.
Authorities have pretty wide powers to make reasonable decisions in
response to an expression of interest, but to debar anyone from even
expressing an idea would have the effect of chilling the prospect of
people suggesting different ways of doing
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000053">&#160;</a>

“benign”, but the belief among the Opposition and a
number of outside organisations is that those powers are not benign

ability of two employees of a local authority to put in expressions of
interest and launch a procurement. That has been described as a
loophole; I read out some quotations earlier on that. At lunchtime, I
looked back over the notes from outside organisations. The National
Council for Voluntary Organisations is very concerned about the
issue:<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“While
a right to challenge is to be welcomed, this has to be considered as
part of the much wider context of public service delivery. Being able
to challenge who runs a particular service can only go so far. Public
service delivery cannot be improved just by transferring the
organisation delivering it to another
one.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000404">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
thinks it is important to have the widest possible focus. If it is just
a question of two people putting in a bid, and they run the service
instead of another organisation, that does not achieve the sort of
change that I think the Minister definitely wants. That particular part
of the clause has been seen as a loophole, and it is important to find
a way to close it while we scrutinise the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
notice that the Deputy Prime Minister is said to be trying to clarify
the extent of public service reform in a speech he is making today. I
hope he will also touch on the limits. An article—I do not know
how authoritative it is—in <em>The</em> 
                           <em>Guardian</em>
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“He
will also say that charities will have the right to force an open
tendering process for public services, but will promise that that right
will not be extended to
businesses.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000405">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>If
the Minister promised that that right would not extend to businesses,
we would not have the issues of definition that we are working through
in this group of amendments. That is entirely the source of
worry.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
thing looked for by third sector organisations is the involvement of
users, rather than an abrupt change in who delivers the service. As I
indicated when talking about social care, that sort of change can be
very disruptive and difficult. The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations, which understands these things,
said,<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
more that local people and service users can be involved in the
commissioning process, designing and shaping what that service actually
is, the more responsive it will be to local
needs.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000406">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
91 to 93 cover the point I have just made. Without the assurance that I
have just asked of the Minister, we cannot trust the issues to powers
for the Secretary of State. We do not trust, or think that there is a
need for him to have, those wide powers to change definitions and add
things
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister did not seem to accept my argument on amendment 92. He feels
that national bodies should be able to bid for all contracts, even if
they have no presence in the locality. That will not help to build the
capacity that many people feel is needed in the third sector. From the
debate that we had earlier, I am sure that the Committee shares that
view. I remind the Minister that the Development Trust Association and
bassac have jointly
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
new power will not be effective without nationwide access to technical
support, feasibility support, and
finance.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000407">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is important. I have quoted the figures from the impact assessment; I
do not think that £5 million nationally, or £15,000 per
local authority, is sufficient for that support. The Minister has not
touched on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although the
Minister has accepted a couple of our proposals as
“benign”, he has not been willing to engage with all the
amendments that we have put forward. I will not put them to the vote
this afternoon, Mr Amess, because I believe we should have a look at
the issue again on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

66(2)(d) would give the Secretary of State the power to specify,
through regulations, further persons or bodies that are to be
considered as relevant authorities, subject to the community right to
challenge. The first point to make is that this would be another wide
power. Will the Minister tell us which bodies the community right to
challenge will be widened to include? Does he think it will be widened
to include NHS bodies? That would give cause for concern. Will it be
extended to housing associations? Page 22 of the consultation
document—which came out only last Friday—says that the
Government are minded to extend the community right to challenge to all
fire and rescue authorities, which I was quite surprised to see. Why is
that, and is there an agenda here?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
from the consultation paper that certain activities of fire and rescue
authorities are core activities that would not be subject to
expressions of interest. Happily, they include—this will be a
source of relief to Opposition Members—firefighting, undertaking
rescues from fires, and responding to road accidents. However, fire and
rescue authorities have other vital functions, such as giving advice in
the community about safety and fire alarms. Most importantly, they deal
with other emergencies such as floods. I know that at least one Member
here has experience of floods in his area. On the first point,
firefighters undertake their community role when they are not on
call-out for emergencies, so I see it as complementary to what they do.
To take away part of their role would undermine their funding, and that
is a serious worry.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
particularly concerned about the idea that operations relating to
floods could be subject to tenders for contracting out. If the
contractor failed, in a flood situation, that could be
life-threatening. Could the Minister explain why he is minded to extend
the community right to challenge to fire and rescue authorities and
other bodies or persons? Could he deal with the concern that if we give
the power to the Secretary of State we will not have the chance to
scrutinise that extension? As we touched on before, statutory
instruments are not subject to amendment and do not involve the same
parliamentary processes as a Bill. We will lose the power to amend if
we hand these things over to the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
welcome the Minister’s recognition that the Secretary of
State’s powers under this clause are defined very extensively
and his willingness to reflect on that to determine whether some
modifications might be made. We should make it clear just how extensive
those powers are so that when he makes his comments on Report, we can
judge whether there will be a significant rolling back of the
clause’s centralising
tendency.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me take the Minister through the Secretary of State’s seven
different powers under the clause. The first is in subsection (1)(b),
under which the Secretary of State has a power to set out requirements
that have to be met by anyone making an expression of interest. That is
a fairly small-scale administrative power, but many people would say
that it is best left to the local authority to specify for its own area
what requirements there might be. The second power is in subsection
(2)(d), to which the amendment applies, under which the Secretary of
State has a power to specify by
regulation<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“such

nature”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000408">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South has rightly
highlighted the possible areas of difficulty, and I could add my own
thoughts about the fire and rescue service. Fire prevention activity
has been 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 474<a class="bkMark" name="Column474">&#160;</a>
                           </div>crucial in recent years in driving down fire deaths and improving the
performance of fire authorities. I am concerned that owing to
pressures, including financial cuts, that trend of improving fire
safety will not
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be alarming if fire authorities were challenged about their fire
prevention work. That work includes helping to install smoke alarms and
other fire safety measures in individual homes, identifying the homes
that are most at risk, and ensuring that they are targeted to help
people to avoid the risk of fire and, therefore, unnecessary deaths.
Those measures are important, so I would be troubled if the Secretary
of State were to define that function as something that could be
challenged by another organisation. Another organisation might be well
intentioned, but it would almost certainly not have the kind of
expertise and understanding that makes a fire and rescue authority best
placed to perform that role, given the authority’s access to
advice, inherent expertise and knowledge of the characteristics of its
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State’s third substantial power is granted by
subsection (4), under which he may exclude a particular
“relevant service” from being covered by the provisions.
Again, that power might be benign and there may be good reasons behind
it, but I draw attention to the fact that the power is once again the
Secretary of State’s, not a local authority’s, even
though the authority might be best placed to decide whether certain
services should be excluded from the power to
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
fourth power is introduced by subsection (5)(e). The “relevant
body”— those bodies able to mount a challenge—is
defined in paragraphs (a) to (d), but paragraph (e) provides that the
Secretary of State may add to those
definitions<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>As
we discussed in our previous debate, that gives real cause for concern,
although to give the Minister credit, he actually saw that that was a
potentially wide power, so I hope that it is one of those that he will
examine.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is difficult for us to form a judgment on whether the Secretary of
State will act in a benign and welcoming way when we do not have the
detailed information. The Minister will get bored of hearing us making
that complaint, but it is genuine. We do not know the
Government’s intentions, and that is why we must ask for rather
more information than we have been given so that we can form a
judgment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
last three powers are set out in subsection (9), and they are genuinely
Henry VIII provisions. Under paragraph (a), the Secretary of State may,
by
regulations,<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“amend
or repeal any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection
(5)”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000410">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We
have just discussed that subsection, which deals with relevant bodies.
Secondly, under paragraph (b), the Secretary of State
may<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“amend

(8)”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000411">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
Secretary of State therefore has the power to amend or change by order
the provisions that define “voluntary body” and
“community body”. Finally, under paragraph
(c), the Secretary of State may, by
regulations,<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

quote shows the problem that the Government have got themselves into.
They have localist intentions, but they are proceeding with a series of
ham-fisted measures that give the impression of heavy-handed
centralisation. I must say that we expect the Minister to come back on
Report with some significant concessions to moderate the Secretary of
State’s draconian powers so that we can achieve the benefit of
the localist objective, but without the invasive power of the Secretary

for Worsley and Eccles South first, which also touched on some of our
previous discussion. Of course I agree with Nick, as we all do. The
point is to allow community groups and social enterprises to submit an
expression of interest. As I said on Second Reading, it was open to us
to draw clause 66 so widely that any business in the country could
express interest, but we deliberately chose not to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000090">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The only
thing that I would say to the hon. Lady is that these definitions
change. I shadowed the office of the third sector portfolio, so I know
that members of the social enterprise community are very insistent that
they are regarded as enterprises and as being in the social business. A
degree of flexibility in the definitions is needed to accommodate the
myriad types of organisations that, quite rightly, fall into the
category that we have in mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000091">&#160;</a>

the Secretary of State’s powers are designed to allow things to
happen positively in the future—I think that that is his genuine
intention—but the problem is that a future Secretary of State
could use those powers in other ways. We are looking for proper
constraints and proper reassurances so that the powers cannot be used

to strike a balance between capturing the world as we see it today and
recognising that we would be doing the greatest disservice to the
people who use the legislation if they found that it was moribund after
a year. Different types of organisations will emerge over time. If one
reflects on the proliferation of new forms of social enterprise that
have grown up just in the past 10 years, compared with what was there
in the 1970s, it is clear that a degree of flexibility is needed. Every
Bill will incorporate such flexibility. Given that we are talking about
an important issue and a theme throughout the Bill, however, as I have
said many times—I say it again—we will reflect on the
best way to capture
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000097">&#160;</a>

process that can capture things that are not known now but might arise
is not a novel approach. Given that one cannot risk a Bill—or
the Act of Parliament—becoming moribund, there is a need to
design a process that allows additions to be contemplated and
scrutinised without the requirement to start from scratch with a whole
new Bill. That is the essence of every Bill that goes though the

let us consider a sophisticated company that I have known and worked
with for many years: Serco. The strategic arm of that company is the
Serco Institute. It is legendary for always thinking ahead and looking
at future market prospects. If Serco were looking at the Bill, and
particularly the chapter on the community right to challenge, might it,
as a consequence of the exercise of that right to challenge, derive
commercial advantage by way of
contracts?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000101">&#160;</a>

me address some of the other points that the hon. Member for Worsley
and Eccles South and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
made. There is the question of the impact—the burden—on
local authorities and whether the assessment of the likely take-up of
the expression of interest is accurate or not. The hon. Lady made the
point this morning that it is difficult to discern how frequently such
a new right will be taken up. We have made the best estimate that we
can. Throughout the process, as a service to the Committee, we have
tried to be as precise as we can. However, the doctrine of new burdens
does not apply just to the impact assessment and the amount assessed
there: it is a serious and genuine commitment. If it transpires that
the burden is greater, there is of course an obligation on the
Government to reflect that in the actual funding. I make that
commitment across all these clauses. The 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 478<a class="bkMark" name="Column478">&#160;</a>
                           </div>estimate has been produced in good faith, but if it turns out in any of
these instances to be an underestimate or an overestimate, there will
be an opportunity to adjust the contribution to that burden in the
future as the situation becomes
apparent.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles
South about the fire and rescue service. That is nothing more than
consistent with our earlier debates about the general power of
competence. If we are to give the general power of competence to fire
and rescue authorities as to local authorities, we will want to have a
similar regime, not least because some fire and rescue authorities have
the same characteristics as local authorities. The approach is designed
to avoid anomalies. One of the provisions to which the right hon.
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich referred was the specification of
which services should be excluded from the right to challenge. Our
approach is designed precisely so that we are able to capture these
points, but it is important to maintain the consistency that we have
with the right to challenge in other
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000106">&#160;</a>

fact that we have the opportunity to set out the types of services that
we will exclude from the right allows such clarification to be put in
place. If we were to put an exhaustive list of exclusions in the Bill,
it would create a burden for not just local authorities, but
communities, because the list would no doubt be interpreted by the
courts to have a particular significance, and anything that was not on
it could be interpreted as being deliberately left off it, rather than
accidentally. The use of guidance is well established as a means of
proceeding in such
situations.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000107">&#160;</a>

for flexibility, but the difficulty for the Opposition is that we
simply do not know how the Secretary of State intends to use that
flexibility. It is the absence of any indication of which organisations
may be defined as relevant bodies under the power that makes it very
difficult for us to judge whether the power will, as he says, be used
in a benign way to allow flexibility, or whether it might allow
entirely inappropriate definitions that could cause all sorts of
difficulties, such as those that my hon. Friends and I have tried to

response to the hon. Member for Scunthorpe is that there are ways of
doing that; we are committed to consulting on the restrictions that we
have in mind, and there is provision for statutory instruments to be
debated. We should not pretend that we are talking about a novel set of
procedures. There are tried and tested means of doing that, some better
than others, and we should not regard this as a binary debate, or say
that everything needs to be in the Bill; that would have even more
unintended, perverse consequences than the steps we have taken. Leaving
debate aside, everyone accepts that, so the question is: can we develop
the right process of consultation, sharing proposals with the House,
which will then have the opportunity to strike them down if they are
not in keeping with indications that Ministers gave? That is the right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000109">&#160;</a>

the proposals made by members of the voluntary sector when the
Committee took evidence. They made the point—I
paraphrase—that if what is proposed is good enough for local
government, should it not extend to parts of central Government? There
is some force to that argument. As I am sure that my hon. Friend the
Member for Bradford East would agree, it would be wrong to exempt
ourselves from doing the things that we require of local government.
The provision gives us the opportunity to do those things, following a
process of setting out which bodies might be included, consulting on
that list, and introducing it through
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000110">&#160;</a>

considerations would come into play if we were talking about a
provision for challenging Jobcentre Plus’s delivery of services
in an enormous number of local networks. One could not conceivably have
a community or voluntary organisation located in one small area of the
country taking that on. Although the Minister’s views are
sensible, the clause is not the right vehicle, and we remain suspicious

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman is an experienced
parliamentarian, and given this opportunity—I say
“opportunity”, not “requirement”—to
extend the same principles across other areas of public services, it
would be bizarre to introduce a separate Bill to require that to be
done. On whether that has an implication for the title of the chapter,
I do not expect that the title of chapter 3 of the Bill will be hotly
debated this Friday night in pubs up and down the country, but perhaps
in Greenwich they talk of little else. I think we can live with the
title.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
conclude with a reflection on the right hon. Gentleman’s
overarching argument, which was that the provisions are centralising
powers that require local authorities to operate in a certain way. The
point has been made by many members of the Committee today that there
are good, progressive councils that will, whether in anticipation of
the Bill or otherwise, work very well with local voluntary
organisations and community groups to extend the opportunities in the
Bill to them. However, the Bill is about rights, and about transferring
power. It is important that where there is the possibility
of some authorities taking a Jurassic approach to the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 480<a class="bkMark" name="Column480">&#160;</a>
                           </div>voluntary sector, shutting them out unfairly and closing their ears to
reasonable representations—no doubt there are such
authorities—they are not allowed to get away with it. There
should be the opportunity for every citizen and every community group
to make their case to the local authority. There should be a
requirement that they be heard and not unreasonably refused.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision bites deliberately on councils that do not engage with their
voluntary groups in the way that we all recognise they should. That is
no different from the regime that we have required for some time in the
private sector, where it is illegal—and, increasingly, strongly
punished—to abuse a position of dominance. Sometimes the
relationship between local authorities—and indeed Government,
since there is a provision that deals with that—on one hand, and
community and voluntary groups on the other, is one of dominance. That
cannot be helped, given the disparity in the scale of the
organisations, but it should not be possible for that dominant position
to be readily abused.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is why
we feel very strongly that the rights for voluntary groups should be
entrenched, so that they cannot just be confined to a walled garden of
funding that the local authority might be tempted to confine them in,
and so that they have the right to challenge the provision of services.
If that puts us in friendly disagreement with the Local Government
Association on some matters, that is not unexpected. It would, of
course, want to preserve complete flexibility on the issue, which is, I
daresay, why Sir Stephen Bubb said in evidence to the
Committee:<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000117">&#160;</a>

speaks well, but to talk of a “walled garden of funding”
is rather peculiar, given the cuts that the voluntary sector is

want to hold up the Committee for too long this afternoon. This does
not have to be the only Bill on localism in this Parliament. The
Minister seems to keep searching for some kind of get-out from his
pledge to go through all the powers, one by one, and decide whether
they were centralising or not, but saying that the Bill has to last for
a decade is not a get-out clause. Each of the powers has to be
justified, and I do not feel that the one in question is justified. I
will withdraw the amendment, as I did the others, but we must return to
the issue on Report, and we will have to be satisfied that there is a
better framework that makes it clear that the right is a community

                        <p class="tabbed">Here
we go again. I am afraid this is the same old territory: we are seeking
to remove powers from the Secretary of State, or questioning whether
they are necessary or centralising. I understand that there is
currently a consultation on this power. The Opposition believe, as we
have said earlier today, that the processes should be set up locally.
The task of taking on the new duty, and issues such as timings, are for
local authorities. They are best placed to manage the work, and to set
minimum time periods for expressions of interest to be submitted. I do
not see that it is localist for the Secretary of State to set the
minimum periods.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000125">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will not detain the Committee too long, as this
is a familiar theme, but once again, I think that the amendment
illustrates the fact that we might make better progress if we moved
beyond regarding a clause as part of a list of Henry VIII powers and
centralising powers, and actually looked at the content. The clause is
in the category of clauses that deal with how to protect voluntary and
community organisations from the hopefully rare situation in which a
council was determined to thwart their ambitions to provide services
and suggest different ways of doing things.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
possible to conceive of a council that was not in favour of the
challenges using the administrative process to frustrate them,
particularly through this timing point. Clearly, there needs to be a
window in which to accept expressions of interest. If we did not have a
measure such clause 67, an authority could open the window for
expressions of interest at midnight and close it at five minutes past
midnight on the same day. That would be a means of thwarting the
intention of the Bill. It is therefore reasonable for the Secretary of
State, through regulation, to be able to set a minimum window in which
voluntary organisations have the opportunity to make challenges. That
seems a proportionate and sensible way forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
earlier days of the European Union, when import quotas were being
dispensed with, the French Government had a particular exception to the
import of video recorders from Japan. They were obliged to have no
quota for the import of video recorders and to accept them all. They
found an ingenious way of restricting that, as I think my hon. Friend
the Member for Croydon Central knows: they required every video
recorder to be imported through the town of Poitiers. Presumably, that
was in the hope that such a restriction would diminish the flow of the
goods into the country and reduce the threat of domestic competition.
There is the potential for local authorities to do that and restrict
the opportunity so narrowly that it becomes impossible for voluntary
organisations to bid. That is what the power in the clause is about.
The clause does give power to the Secretary of State, but it is
entirely positive, and done in order to safeguard voluntary
organisations from local authorities that may not be as progressive as
we would like, but which I hope will be few or zero in
number.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000128">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The whole Bill, and the Government reforms in this
area, are about the transfer of power. We have been clear from the
outset that the Bill does not just take power from central Government
and give it to local government, but places obligations on councils to
take some of their power and invest it in their communities and
citizens. It is a clarion call to communities, and we are clear about
that. It is a double devolution, and the provision in the clause is an
example of it. There is power in local authorities, just as there is in
central Government. Just as it is incumbent on us to try to devolve
some of our rights and powers to others, so is it right for local
authorities to transfer some of their power downwards; the most
progressive local authorities do so already. We need a Bill to do that
because sometimes, people who have their fingers on the levers of power
need a bit of assistance to remove those fingers. I hope that we will
not need to have recourse to the legislation, but it is an important
safeguard for voluntary groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000130">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 95 aims to create a mechanism whereby
community groups or charities that want to make a bid to assist in the
provision of a service, but not to run it or deliver it, can do so.
That could take a wide range of forms and lead to creative new types of
delivery. The amendment would mean that a local authority could set out
how it proposes to involve the relevant body in that provision. The
amendment would also remove the requirement for a full procurement
exercise, which, as we noted, would cost £9,000 each time round,
or 5% of the contract value. I see that as a route to greater
involvement, and it means that the process would be more likely to be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000141">&#160;</a>

is on familiar territory: it would remove the power of the Secretary of

authority to define that locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000142">&#160;</a>

continuity of the public service in question? Those extra
considerations in amendment 97 are very important to potential users of
services. Improving equality is a statutory duty for local authorities
anyway, so it should be expressed. Ensuring that changes do not
disadvantage vulnerable groups and considering continuity of service
are also
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
we look at adult social care, which I mentioned earlier, there are two
sorts of services that are often contracted out, and will probably be
contracted out even more in future. My regional BBC politics show
covered that issue at the weekend. It highlighted Wirral borough
council, which, it said, proposed contracting out its care work to care
homes, rather than having those homes council-run—a fair point.
A representative of independent care homes was interviewed, and she
talked about the extras that can be included in a nursing care home,
and the difference that they make to the quality of life. She talked
about providing monthly tea dances and entertainment for the
residents—the residents of the home were people suffering from
dementia. She also talked about the value of extra training for staff.
It is judged that it can be very helpful to have a higher level of
training for staff working with people with dementia. Another person
talked about being able to offer additional therapies such as art
therapy in a day care
centre.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Both
those people are involved with social care provision, but they made it
very clear that they are able to offer those extra activities only at
certain fee levels—the point of debate was the fee levels being
set locally. The ability to consider the impact of a different service
provider that might not offer such additional elements in its care is
crucial, because we are talking about vulnerable people—in my
example, people with
dementia.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
people who have care and support at home—I have already referred
to this—continuity of provision is a key element of quality. A
number of councils, including my own in Salford, have recently
re-tendered their contracts for care at home and have reduced the
number of contractors providing that care. For the people using the
service, changing provider nearly always means changing
carer—changing the person who comes into their home. I know from
local coverage and from my casework that an older person may grow used
to one care staff member. Changing that person can be seriously
disruptive. Those are the reasons why amendment 97 brings consideration
of the continuity of service into the procurement
exercise.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
98 is also familiar ground. It removes the power of the Secretary of
State to specify the grounds on which the local authority may reject an
expression of interest. The local authority has local knowledge, and it
is centralising to give that power to the Secretary of State. Taking
the decision away from the local authority could, in some cases, cause
fragmentation of services. I would be interested to hear how the
Minister justifies that. Amendments 99 and 100 remove the power of the
Secretary of State to regulate the timing of the process. I wait to
hear how the Minister believes that that power is either needed or
localist.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000150">&#160;</a>

process—in print, as well as on its website. It specifies that

                        <p class="tabbed">The
group of amendments is aimed at improving the process of the community
right to challenge. Amendment 97 particularly considers the
users of services. Amendment 95 would provide a more
creative way for community groups or charities to be involved and to
assist in service delivery without going through a procurement
exercise.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000154">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, I am disappointed that some of the
amendments fail, perhaps unintentionally, to capture the real essence
of the clauses, which is to protect voluntary groups from the behaviour
of a council determined to thwart the exercise of the powers. To take
the amendments one at a time, I understand the intention, in amendment
95, to offer alternative ways of participation, and to allow partial
participation in the provision of a service, rather than a taking over
of the whole thing. My understanding is that the Public Contracts
Regulations 2006 impose some rather onerous requirements on how that is
done, but I will see what can be done to capture the spirit of the
amendment, and if something can be done to provide that new kind of
route, I will investigate. I have no objection in principle, but the
question is whether it would work in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000155">&#160;</a>

96 is a familiar one. It would remove the Secretary of State’s
power to define the interval between the submission of an expression of
interest and a tendering process operating. Again, that power is purely
designed for circumstances in which an authority wanted to play fast
and loose with the provisions, opening and closing the tendering
process in a matter of minutes, thereby excluding people from having
the proper opportunity to tender. It is important that people have a
reasonable time frame in which to consider bids and
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000156">&#160;</a>

voluntary groups against councils on the one hand, and the importance
of avoiding the danger of abuse on the other. Can I press him again on
this point in terms of employee self-interest? There is a long and
honourable tradition of employees bidding to provide the services that
they are employed by, such as Greenwich Leisure back in the 1980s at
the time of the compulsory competitive tendering regime. On the issue
of potential abuse by council employees now, I pressed the Minister
earlier and gave the example of a major commercial company.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000166">&#160;</a>

anonymise or fictionalise this. In the construction industry, there are
many reputable operators such as Bob the builder. But there also some
dodgy dealers. Under the provisions of the Bill, Del Boy could meet
with a couple of council employees from building maintenance in the
Nag’s Head and encourage them to bid for the work they currently
do. There are no safeguards in the Bill. There is neither a requirement
for there to be a declaration of self-interest by employees nor the
lock that we would wish to introduce in respect of all those involved
in providing the services who are part of the expression of
self-interest. Does the Minister not recognise that he is leaving room
for abuse by a very small number of employees pursuing narrow
self-interest?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000167">&#160;</a>

Bulky Bob, but clearly this is a firm that will inform our proceedings
over the next few weeks. The provisions in the Bill go beyond even what
is there for current procurement exercises. In the event of an
expression of interest, a procurement exercise would take place. It is
part of the existing procurement process and has all the safeguards
that the hon. Gentleman would rightly seek. In addition, subsection (5)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000168">&#160;</a>

provision objected to by Opposition Front Benchers allows the Secretary
of State to specify other reasons why it may not be appropriate even to
consider an expression of interest, and part of the consultation that

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
97 considers the equalities impact of an expression of interest and the
right to challenge. Everybody, on both sides of the House, understands
that it is important for public bodies to pay regard to their duty to
promote equality and to respect that in their arrangements. However,
the right way to do that is through legislation that applies across the
board—to local government and central Government. If we start to
include amateur versions in every Bill that goes through Parliament,
there will be inconsistent definitions and a minefield of different
regulations, which is precisely what local authorities and voluntary
groups complain about. It takes increasingly long and costs an
increasing

regulations and legislation that they have.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Equality is
an important principle, and we have legislation for it on the statute
book. The Equality Act 2010 already places a duty on public service
providers not to discriminate against, harass or victimise people who
require or use services. When we rightly place such obligations on
authorities, we should do it consistently across the piece, and not try
to do it in an amateur way in every clause that goes through the House.
Our opposition to the amendment in no way diminishes the importance of
those issues. They should be carried through; I am sure that the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Erdington, in his previous life, would have
wanted this to be clear and to cross all Government
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
98, 99 and 100 are, again, disappointing, and I hope that they are
inadvertent in what they reveal about Opposition Front Benchers’
thinking. They would take away some of the safeguards that stop any
local authorities from frustrating the process, if they are minded to
do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
98 removes the Secretary of State’s ability to set out the
reasons why a bid may be rejected. If it were entirely down to local
authorities to cook up any reason whatever to reject a bid, that would
be a major loophole. It would be a major way in which the process could
be declared null and void, because authorities could produce a local
list that was so comprehensive that no one would get a look-in. The
power allows the reasons to be specified.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 99
governs a period of time, and it states that local authorities must
make a decision on an expression of interest in the time specified by
the Secretary of State. Obviously, if a local authority decided that it
would take three years to make a decision on an expression of interest,
that would be a naked abuse of the system. This power prevents that,
and removing it would make this whole area of the Bill, in effect, null
and void.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 100
intends to remove the requirement even to notify decisions in a time
specified by the Secretary of State. Without that, there would be no
obligation on a local authority’s part even to tell a
respondent, or an applicant, whether they had been successful. Clearly,
a local authority should be obliged to do that. The clause is simple,
and it is entirely in the spirit of making this work. Although this may
be inadvertent on the part of Opposition Front Benchers, removing the
requirement would destroy the implications of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendment 101 requires a print version as well as a website
publication. As with the equalities duty, if we are going to place
requirements on local authority publicity, we should do so in a
consistent way, and not require local authority legal officers to take
a magnifying glass and go through every piece of legislation to see
what different requirements there are. There clearly should be a
requirement on local authorities to communicate with people, especially
those who might not have access to websites. That should be a general
obligation effected by the other publicity codes
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000177">&#160;</a>

that a large proportion of people over 65 cannot access the internet

                           </strong> I want to comment on something that does not seem to
be in the Bill, and I would have been critical had it been; I suppose I
am pleased. It is again to do with the prescription. We are told that a
lot of the prescription seeks to stop a local authority from nullifying
the localism intentions of the Bill. I understand that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In this case,
on the question of the authority’s rejecting an expression of
interest, it seems very vague. Clause 68(5) refers to a set
of criteria for rejecting or accepting on the basis of<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“social,
economic or environmental well-being of the authority’s
area”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000419">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is so woolly and unclear. Under clause 69(4)(b), all the authority has
to do is give its reasons. The reason could be, “We do not think
it does meet those criteria.” If one is going into the business
of prescription, that is pretty poor prescription. It allows an
authority to say, “In our view, it is not.” There seems
to be no specific right of appeal. I am not sure whether that is
covered by the reference to the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
concern is that when some expressions of interest come through, there
may be a bit of cherry-picking. Many local authority services involve
cross-subsidy, particularly where charging takes place and where one
part subsidises another. It could be that expressions of interest come
in for that bit of the service that is

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend’s point is reasonable. The debate has focused on whether
there should be strong powers to prevent a council that is determined
to thwart this process from doing so, versus the Labour party’s
view—I am not sure whether it is deliberate—that councils
should be given free rein to do that should they want to.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A balance
must be struck, but once an authority has considered an expression of
interest, we have not said that it must accept it and trigger a
procurement exercise. Councils have a broad range of reasons on which
to reflect, including the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Bradford East, and by Labour Members, that if an organisation is
integrated with different services, and taking one slice out of it
would make the rest no longer viable, that would be a reason not to
proceed with the expression of interest. There should be a requirement
for such things to be reasonably considered.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000191">&#160;</a>

possible to go further, and we are consulting on what reasons the
Secretary of State can say would not be valid to reject the bid. It is
right and consistent with trusting authorities with the details of such
matters to have safeguards that stop them from blatantly abusing the
system. Such safeguards, however, do not intend to prescribe in such
fine detail that the authorities have no chance to make a reasonable
response to the proposals. We are taking a proportionate approach, and
I hope that it will command the support of voluntary organisations and
local governments in bringing the two interests
together.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000192">&#160;</a>

bid to run a service. If their bid is successful, the service will be
run outside the council, so former senior, well-paid employees who were
previously disqualified could find themselves standing for election
even though they were being paid for a contract with the same public
money as before. Under the Bill, there could be one position for
teaching assistants or staff on school crossing patrols, who would
remain disqualified, while more senior people involved in a new type of
organisation could stand for election. Does the Minister propose to do
anything about that anomaly in line with the comments of the Leader of
the House in response to the question asked by my hon. Friend the
Member for
Wrexham?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000199">&#160;</a>

cause of some puzzlement. We will need to look at the hon.
Lady’s question about whether the current disqualification rules
need to be changed and come back to it on Report. I do not want to
raise her hopes, because there are reasons for the current regime, but
I undertook to review the matter properly and I will share the results
of that review and write to her before

the powers of the Secretary of State. Just to be consistent, I have to

made some statements about the provisions to which Labour Members
object, some of which, as I hope has become apparent during the day,
are genuinely to protect local groups from the behaviour of a reluctant
council. I invite all members on both sides of the Committee to reflect
on our intent over the next few days and to give some thought to
whether there are any

is a pleasure to serve with you in the Chair, Mr Amess. This
is my first Front-Bench speech in the Committee, and although I have
the benefit of following my hon. Friends the Members for Worsley and
Eccles South and for Birmingham, Erdington, I hope that you will be
patient with me—I will not say gentle, but patient—should
I stray from the correct format during our proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000236">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before we
come to the substance of the amendment, I would like to put on record
that Labour Members welcome the principle behind chapter 4 of part 4 of
the Bill, as do all of us in the room, so I hope that we can take these
provisions through as consensually as possible and with an open and
genuine debate. I hope that Ministers will, when we make a case
supported by evidence, take away any suggestions for improvement and
changes in the spirit in which they will be offered. These proposals
are fundamentally a development of Labour’s programme of
empowering local communities to take over local assets, which was
brought forward in the previous Parliament but, like most legislation,
could be built
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000237">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
105 would clarify clause 71, which we believe to be incoherent and
confusing in subsections (3) and (4), with respect to the
length of time for which land should remain on an authority’s
list of land of community value. Subsection (3) states that land should
remain on the list for five years, while subsection (4) 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 493<a class="bkMark" name="Column493">&#160;</a>
                           </div>states that the Secretary of State may amend that period of time as he
sees fit, so what are the aims of those subsections? Our amendment is
designed to probe and specifies a time so that we can draw out some of
the arguments and concerns that we and others have. While we can see
why it would be desirable for local authorities to adjust the time that
land should be on their lists to tailor the provisions of this chapter
of the Bill to local needs, we are concerned that the Government,
rather than committing fully to localism, have decided to grant the
ultimate power to the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State’s powers would effectively allow him to
control what happens locally by changing the length of time before land
is deleted from the list. We believe that that is wrong. All citizens
should be able to come together with their communities to take up that
right. The Secretary of State ought not to be able to frustrate the
good intentions of local authority groups by messing with the time that
an asset can be retained on the list. The provisions also fail to
provide any certainty for businesses, but their concerns are in a
different area, so I will return to some of them later in the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not believe that the Minister of State or any of his colleagues
would want a community group in their constituency to be frustrated if
a Secretary of State were to try to block the effect of the clause by
removing land from the list too quickly. We support such flexibility,
but we are worried that it could serve to frustrate the main purpose of
the chapter as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment proposes that five years should be the statutory minimum
length of time for land to be included on the list of land of community
value. I am sure that Ministers will question why we have set an
arbitrary time limit, but it was to ensure that we could have a debate
that would enable us to understand exactly what the Government intend.
During our debate on clause 67, the Minister talked about avoiding
local authorities thwarting expressions of interest. Does not the same
argument apply here? Perhaps we need to consider applying that
principle to clause 71 and apply a minimum period. There is a range of
linked issues to consider, but I would like to raise some of them in
the clause stand part
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000241">&#160;</a>

to follow the procedures for the original listing when it comes to the
end of the five-year period. Subsection (4) relates to the five years;
it is about providing an opportunity for a practical review to be had
about what that period should be. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor
View indicated that there was no magic about five years, but five years
is the period that appears in the Bill. To get into the realm of
speculation, if, at the end of five years, assets were universally
taken on for a second period, it might be expedient to have an asset
list that lasts for 10
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000252">&#160;</a>

developments that had taken place in the meantime—perhaps
developments literally. We should bear in mind that if other provisions
in the Bill come into force, that will be in an era of neighbourhood
planning, so provisions in a neighbourhood or local plan might make the
original listing inappropriate. We are ready to hear views about that.

small local theatre that a community regarded as hugely important to a
community, there would be a desire for the listing to continue for much
longer than five years. I cannot understand why the Government do not
leave the decision to the local authority, rather than impose an
arbitrary figure. Does not the Minister realise the irritation this has
caused the Local Government Association? Its briefing states clearly

I described the reasons for having a period that is sufficiently long
to be meaningful but does not leave an inappropriate legacy. It is
exactly the same as the community right to buy interval of time in
Scotland. The right hon. Gentleman might want to reflect on whether we
should have lists of assets of community value that are run in
different ways in different parts of the country. I put it to him that,
as with the listing of buildings for heritage reasons, there ought to
be some national universal standard, rather than a completely
locally-based description of what those standards are, particularly
because other implications flow from that relating to possible
compensation schemes, which we shall come on to.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000257">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 104, in
clause 71, page 52, line 3, at
end insert—<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>‘(7) A list of
assets of community value shall not include land or assets that are
Operational Land.(8) In this
section “Operational Land”
means—(a) in relation
to statutory
undertakers—(i) land
which is used for the purpose of carrying on their undertaking,
and(ii) land in which an
interest is held for that
purpose;(b) in relation to
public bodies that are not statutory undertakers, land which is used
for the purpose of carrying on their functions and
duties.’.<p class="tabbed">The
amendment arises out of concerns raised with Opposition Front Benchers
by transport operators, although I am sure that they have raised
similar concerns with Ministers in both the Department for Communities
and Local Government and the Department for Transport. They are worried
that the powers in this clause might not provide the necessary
protection for statutory providers of transport, so it would be helpful
for the Committee to know what discussions have taken place between the
two Departments about the implications of this provision. Perhaps the
Minister will tell us whether his officials have been speaking to
officials in the Department for Transport.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000262">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are not
yet at the stage of debating the planning elements of this Bill, but I
have concerns that the provisions in this chapter might be subverted by
certain groups following planning applications. I have no doubt that my
hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington will want to explore
this point further if our concerns are not allayed by the
Minister’s response to this debate. I would not want to see
these powers damaged in the eyes of the public if they are used to
prevent necessary infrastructure projects instead of to turn land of
community value into valuable assets within a community. For example,
how would the Secretary of State for Transport feel if the powers were
used to list land along the route of High Speed 2 as land of community
value?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps the
Minister will clarify whether schemes of national importance fall
outside the remit of this clause. Will the national planning policy
framework make that clear? If so, is it not a shame that, yet again, we
are being asked to take decisions on clauses without access to all the
information we need? There are serious implications for passenger
transport executives, as well as other owners of land. Depending on as
yet unpublished policies and secondary legislation, their ability to
carry out their functions could be
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000264">&#160;</a>

transport authorities and PTEs are extremely concerned that they could
easily find their landholdings subject to these provisions. They have
highlighted the possibility that their operational land, such as bus
depots, tramways and other facilities not obviously covered by other
legislation, such as Railways Acts, could be affected. Equally, sites
that might have possibilities for future development to support
transport, particularly in a

such a use. Real concerns were expressed by witnesses that the Bill as
it stands will not prevent the use of these powers maliciously to
derail development.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000265">&#160;</a>

the review that I referred to, one of the things that we looked at was
a series of tank traps post-planning permission, and it seems that the
designation of land of community value, if not dealt with properly, is
potentially another tank trap that can be abused in order to stop
development at a very late
stage.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Localism

                        <p>Network
Rail also expressed worries about this clause and wanted to see land
and buildings owned by Network Rail for its statutory undertaking not
designated as “land of community value” and therefore
excluded from the listing process. It is important that the powers in
the Bill are realised in a way that strengthens the overall
sustainability of a community and that they cannot be used for
malicious purposes, which I am sure that the Minister would not have
intended.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister set out how the clause provides the necessary protection
against malicious listings? Does he have an answer to the concerns
touched on in the consultation paper on restricted covenants? He sets
out in that paper that certain types of buildings may have covenants
placed on them by an owner that may limit how the property may be used
once it has been sold—for example a pub, once sold, may not be
used as a pub. Such actions can deprive communities of local assets, so
we would welcome any further information that he can give us on that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
providing for further regulations, do Ministers intend to give
protection in specific cases beyond those listed in the consultation
document, including for residential property except where the
accommodation is tied to an asset of community value or integral to the
working of the asset? I understand the example given of a pub or shop
with a flat over it, but do tied cottages fall into this
category?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope the
Minister will also confirm that land and buildings such as trust ports,
ancient monuments, statutory allotments and school playing fields are
likely to be in the regulations—this is the same old record
going round, but sadly we have not seen them. Will the Minister give an
undertaking that the eventual regulations could exclude operational
land from the definition of land of community value? If he cannot give
us full and satisfactory answers, I am afraid that we will press the
amendment to a

                           </strong> I thought that amendment 104 was a probing
amendment. I am sure that the hon. Lady will not mind me saying that,
for all practical purposes, her amendment would undermine the provision
entirely because it refers to public bodies that are “not
statutory undertakers”
and<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000271">&#160;</a>

                        <p>However,
I am certainly ready to give the Committee as good an account as I can
in response to her questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some of the
questions about what we might call vexatious applications, as well as
those that are designed to achieve secondary objectives, are covered in
other clauses in this chapter. There is a procedure on nomination, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 498<a class="bkMark" name="Column498">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a notice of inclusion and a review of decisions to include land on a
list, while there will also be lists of assets that are listed and of
assets for which listing has been refused. The hon. Lady may want raise
some of those points in more detail when we discuss subsequent clauses,
but clause 71 simply sets the process in train. The subsequent clauses
provide the framework for addressing the points that she raised. She
makes the fair point that somebody might attempt to achieve the listing
of a section of the M25 with a view to closing it down to reduce noise
levels, but I think she will find that subsequent clauses would prevent
local authorities from getting to the point of listing that—it
would appear on the list of claims that had been refused.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need to
come back to what the proposal is about in the first place: giving
communities the opportunity to say, “Hang on a minute. You are
changing our neighbourhood and taking away our facilities.” The
problem might be in a rural area, such as the loss of the pub, post
office, chemist or local shop. People often never get the chance to
stop that it happening, or indeed to provide a better service in the
same facility. That is what clause 71 initiates, and it is what the
community value option provides for a neighbourhood in an urban or a
rural area. We will look to make improvements to the provisions, if
they can be found, but something that limits the operation at the
application point is not the way to go. The way to ensure that
vexatious claims do not find their way on to the register is provided
not in clause 71, but in the latter clauses that control the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We all know
that there have been plenty of closures of public sector facilities. My
brief mentions that the number of public libraries in England fell from
3,066 in 1998—obviously that date has been picked at
random—to 2,820 in October. Some 246 libraries were lost during
that period. On many occasions, the local community felt that they were
excluded from having a voice or an effective way of challenging what
happens next.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We recognise
that it is not always appropriate for an asset to be listed and the
exact definitions, as the hon. Lady has quite rightly pointed out, will
be determined in regulations. That forms part of the consultation that
is now in play. What types of land or assets should be excluded? We
propose that the regulations list the types of buildings and land that
do not constitute assets of community value by their own definition and
that should, therefore, be excluded from the listing process. I
speculate that the M25 would probably be included in that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
consulting on the factors that local authorities might be required to
consider when deciding whether an asset meets the definition. One can
imagine all sorts of different circumstances but, for instance, the
community might nominate a piece of Network Rail land that
had—this would be the aim of the listing—a community
centre or a social club on it. The local authority would have to decide
whether that met the definition of land of community value. If so, and
if Network Rail subsequently decided to sell that land as part of a
much larger parcel of land, the community might choose to bid for the
whole parcel. A whole set of complex circumstances needs to be taken
into account, but our aim at every step is to make sure, as in the
example I gave, that the social club or the youth centre that happens
to be on somebody’s land is
protected.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000277">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman took a bit of a risk when he
referred to libraries as a service that had been subject to a certain
number of closures in the past. Judging by what is expected in the
future, the threat to libraries might now be much greater. Let me
specifically pose to him the problem that my hon. Friend the Member for
Lewisham East—she cannot be here this afternoon because she is
at a funeral—highlighted during this morning’s sitting:
the proposal to replace a library in the London borough of Lewisham,
which she represents, with a facility on the other side of a railway
track, which happens to be in the London borough of Greenwich, which I
represent. I cannot see any arrangement in these provisions to deal
with an asset of community value that might straddle two local
authority boundaries. Railway lines often constitute boundaries, so
perhaps the hon. Member will inform us what happens when an asset
involves two local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000278">&#160;</a>

10 or 11 years ago, we had a big school reorganisation in Bradford in
which we moved from a three-tier to a two-tier system. Part of that
involved the disposal of 60 former middle schools—we expanded
the first schools and the upper schools, as we called them. How pleased
I am that the Bill was not in force at that time, because we had to
take a fairly hard stance as we desperately needed the money from the
disposal of the school sites. We managed to reach all-party agreement
on the protocol for the disposals, but the process was very difficult
because, of course, we were bombarded by local community groups that
wanted to take possession—

                           </div>not at full market value, of course—of those local community
assets. We would have loved to have done that, but we desperately
needed some £190 million to fund the school building programme.
I have some understanding of the problems and difficult decisions that
arise when community assets come up for
disposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000317">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
talked to my colleagues in Bradford last night about the budget and so
on. I told them that we have really crucial matters to decide, such as
whether prisoners have the vote, but they are simply dealing with
everyday issues such as whether to close children’s homes. They
are therefore in a far less fortunate position than I am. Decisions on
community assets are crucial, because a certain degree of emotion is
attached to them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000318">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The gist of
the amendment is that it is unfair for private assets to be included on
the list without the permission of those assets’ owners. If the
amendment were accepted, it would need to be accompanied by a
definition—perhaps in an additional subsection or through
regulations made by an appropriate authority—but its purpose is
to exclude private individuals and private businesses from the
measures. I have not asked the Library to carry out a sweep of the
history of this, but if I had, it would surely have gone back to Magna
Carta—or even before. Whether in Magna Carta, the United States
constitution, or European human rights legislation, I am sure that
there are consistent references throughout history to the importance of
private property rights, and indeed to the state having an obligation
to protect them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000319">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand and respect my
hon. Friend’s point. However, does he accept that we are
discussing not the state’s ability to take over private property
rights, but merely the listing of an asset? As the Bill points out, the
community would subsequently have the opportunity—the breathing
space—to get together so that it had the chance to
make a bid. Often, because of the unequal economic circumstances of
some business owners, that is not possible—a good example is the
case of public houses. If the state was to take over the asset, my hon.
Friend’s case would be stronger, but that is not the intention
of the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000320">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I half accept the Minister’s comments, in
that we are talking about listing property and not disposing of it.
Frankly, however, if my property is put on a list, that is an
infringement of my rights, and I believe I have the damn right to say
what list my property goes on. The measure creates an infringement and,
beyond that, it is anti-competitive from the point of view of small
businesses. I believe that it is likely to put off a potential seller,
even if selling the property might be their preference. Listing might
also devalue the property itself, and that will be even more likely if
there is any lack of clarity about the moratorium.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000321">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In many such
instances, the listing will be unnecessary. When members of a local
community go in the local pub or post office, do they not know when the
property will come on to the market? Do they not talk to the person
behind the bar, the postmistress, or the postmaster? Do they not know
when community assets are likely to come up for sale and then engage in
conversation with not only the owner, but with members of the community
about what they would do in the case of a sale? The provision creates

the clause’s purpose in relation to post office closures. It is
important that high streets and village communities are kept thriving
and alive by not doing away with those key amenities that often bring
such communities together. However, a post office or a pub is not a
community asset; it is a private business. It might be of value to the
community, but it is not a community asset. We must remember that pubs,
post offices and small shops are micro-businesses. At present, they are
going through a pretty difficult time. They are affected by the
recession and the bad weather, and the VAT increase might have had an
impact, too. Such businesses have enough on their plates without being
on a list when they have no say about whether their

normally the first person to be sympathetic to the circumstances that
businesses face, but how does one deal with the situation that has
occurred with the Broomwood public house in Sevenoaks way in my
constituency, which is the only public house in a large suburban
estate? The establishment has been bought not by one of the reputable
operators, but by an absentee landlord with no connection to the
community. He is seeking to change its use so that he can speculatively
develop it as a McDonald’s. The pub has been deliberately run
down over a number of years. In such circumstances, it is difficult to
say that it is a struggling small business, as the suspicion must be
that there has been a deliberate attempt to make a gain through a sale
for development. Surely it is right that the community should have some
protection in such circumstances, and that is the purpose of the
listing

a danger that small business people will be put off opening a business

four or five years down the line—it will be included by the

concerned that pressure may be put on the owners of properties by a
community. The free, unfettered right of an individual to say,
“This is what I choose to do with my personal property”
would be compromised by the pressure put on that individual by members
of the local community. The owners of the property have a

Despite varying views about the degree to which individuals should have

people, would probably all subscribe to the view that there must be
safeguards so that we can look after community assets in areas where
the community could be seriously damaged by the kind of speculative
behaviour that the Under-Secretary mentioned. All of us have had that
experience in different forms in our constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000330">&#160;</a>

a number of people who might be thought to be sympathetic in principle
to the Government’s objectives were extremely worried by this

that he fundamentally disagreed with the provision. He not only raised
the issue of the infringement of property rights that the hon. Member

by the public sector. In many towns and villages they are undoubtedly
of community value, as is green space that is held by a private trust
or landowner but used by the community, either for free or at a
peppercorn rent. The amendment would exclude such land from the
provisions in a part of the Bill designed to empower communities. Many
local authorities do not hold large amounts of land, and many are
desperately seeking to dispose of assets to fund capital programmes at
a time when the Government are cutting council funding.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000341">&#160;</a>

available for them to get involved in. With a Tory-led Government
seeking to sell off the forests, perhaps the provision is a clever
coalition wheeze to ensure that the community does not own them. The
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bradford East would place out
of the reach of communities land that they have always seen as a
fundamental part of them. Conversely, perhaps it is rare example of
joined-up government or an unintended consequence.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000342">&#160;</a>

that we all take off our political labels, throw them in the air and

Bradford East. There has been a long-standing dialogue in English
politics on the balance between property rights and community rights.
Every step forward involves some compromise—some balance being
struck between property rights, individual rights and the rights of the
wider community. I draw comfort from the history of the development of
planning law. In 1948, when the Planning Acts came into being, they
were seen as a huge intrusion on the ability of land and property
owners to do exactly what they wanted. I think it is fair to say that
they were seen as somewhere to the left of Trotsky in their impact on
society. We now see, however, that the people who most pray in aid
planning laws and rules are mostly not supporters of Trotsky. It is a
middle-class preoccupation to say that the porch sticks out too far or
that the garage encroaches on the view from the back window. Obviously,
there is always tension, and these things evolve and change over
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000344">&#160;</a>

Member for Bradford East that it is also long overdue in the eyes of
many Liberal Democrat campaigners, who have spent a lot of time saying
that they believe that it is wrong for the owner of an asset to dispose
of it over the head of the community that it serves. That owner might
be a public authority or a private company. It might be a brewery or,
as he says, the owner of a small business. It is, therefore, important
to ensure that the provision is proportionate. It does not state that
somebody who wants to be a bit awkward can claim that something has
community value so that it gets on the list; there is a process. That
process is designed to ensure that we do not have vexatious, silly or
inappropriate nominations included on the register. As we will see in a
later clause, there is a provision to ensure that that is transparent;
there will be publication of both the listed assets and those assets
that have been denied listing. I must say to my hon. Friend that, on
this occasion, his fundamentalist localism has gone out of the window,
and something else has come in. I hope that he will not press the

illustrate the fact that there is a tension between the
community’s rights and those of the individual. The clause and
the chapter change that boundary, as did the introduction of planning
regulations and heritage listing. At each stage, there is a battle as
that boundary is pushed a little way forward, and we believe that that

to the point where I can do whatever I like with my private property. I
believe firmly in the planning process. I live in a conservation
area—not in a listed building, although I am surrounded by
listed buildings, and mine lists in a different sense—and I am
perfectly happy to accept the constraints that living in a conservation
area imposes on me, regarding what I do with my property. To get on
that list, however, a building must meet strict criteria that describe
the importance and the value of properties to the community and the
nation. The definition in the clause is far looser and more woolly; a
local community can decide what it believes to be of community
value.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000350">&#160;</a>

exclusive list, which is wholly dependent on regulations—again,
as yet unseen—that are made by the Secretary of State. As the
Bill is drafted, only two specified groups can make community
nominations: parish councils in England and community councils in
Wales. We welcome the Government’s decision to allow them to
list land that they want protected for the benefit of the community,
but we are surprised that the third category that will be allowed to
have a say will
be<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000357">&#160;</a>

again, we have the centralising power of the Secretary of State. Here,
not only do his fingers reach into the pies of local government, but he
has power over the specification of individual members of communities.

Secretary of
State?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000358">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
106, 107 and 108 are designed to take some of the burden off the
Secretary of State; his desk must be groaning under the weight of all
these regulations, and we are only one third of the way through the
Bill. Amendment 106 would, therefore, remove the Secretary of
State’s powers to specify or describe individuals who would have
the right, and would open the door to communities to allow them the
right to take up the powers described in this
chapter.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Safeguards
remain, because the Secretary of State—he still has some role in
all this—should still be able to prevent an individual or a
community group from participating in the scheme if he felt that was
appropriate. That would allow him to take action if extremist groups,
which none of us would welcome, found that they could use the
legislation to serve their own ends at the expense of community
cohesion. We feel, however, that it is important to get the balance
right in the clause. It must be as inclusive as possible if we are to
give the proposals any chance of
success.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000360">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
it is, limiting to parish councils and their Welsh equivalents the
ability to nominate land for inclusion on the list of land of community
value would mean patchy coverage at best. I have serious doubts about
the policy’s equalities impact. It is not clear, given the
Minister of State’s answers in the evidence sessions, what the
coverage of neighbourhood forums—one of the groupings that I
suspect will appear in the regulations—will be. He put his hands
up and said that he does not do targets and could not tell us how many
there are going to be. There are some estimates that suggest that
coverage could be as low as 20% in 10 years’ time; others
suggest that it might be 60%, but that would still leave large tranches
of the country with very little coverage from any of those groups.
Quite how they fit into the process is not entirely
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000361">&#160;</a>

cover large areas—which touches on the point raised earlier by
my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. We need to

draw the Ministers’ attention back to the comments thoughtfully

of assisting the participation of all sorts of community groups and
ensuring that these clauses are as inclusive as possible. We should
ensure that people who perhaps normally feel that they do not have a
voice and are not able to get involved in the listing process are
enabled to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000365">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
108 removes the right of local authorities to list land as being of
community value. Although amendments 106 and 107 clearly come as a
pair, amendment 108 deals with a separate issue that deserves
discussion. Again, it is a probing amendment, and I appreciate that the
thought behind it might not be immediately clear. We are conversant in
and supportive of aiming to protect community land and assets for
community use, but we want to debate the mechanisms through which land
may be acquired by the state through compulsory purchase orders where
it is essential for the provision of services or
infrastructure.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000366">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
appears to be potential for a conflict of interest, if councils were
able to use the list of land of community value to skew negotiations on
the purchase of land or to manipulate the price by removing land from
the open market. I would welcome the Minister’s thoughts on
that. Has he considered whether it is a potential
problem?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000367">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a risk that landowners might feel that they are being treated
unfairly if councils seek to combine the list of land of community
value with subsequent compulsory purchase orders. What advice has the
Minister taken on the impact that being placed on the list would have
on the value of land and property? That point was raised by the hon.
Member for Bradford
East.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000368">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not want these powers to get a bad name, and we do not want to see
the waters muddied. We very much want these powers to be a means of
empowering local communities. If a community feels that land is of
value, it should be listed, and if the council feels that the land is
needed for the effective provision of local services or for the
delivery of infrastructure, it should quite properly use its existing
legal powers, which are well understood by the property sector. We
think that this element could be misused, so we wish to amend the
clause to ensure that the powers within the chapter are conferred
solely on the local community, leaving local authorities free to use
their existing powers to pursue similar aims. I will welcome the
Minister’s views about the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000369">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In view of the example that the hon. Lady gave, I
should perhaps declare that I am a vice president of the Macclesfield
Canal Society, which would be the sort of body she described. We are
certainly sympathetic to the principle behind amendment 106, which
proposes local connections. We are minded to restrict the nomination
process to groups or individuals with a local connection, and we would
intend to do this following consultation—I come back to the
consultation document—in subsequent secondary legislation. That
consultation will allow us to seek views more broadly. I do not
discount the views expressed by the hon. Lady at all. We should take
then into account, but I do not think that it is appropriate to
anticipate the outcome of the consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000370">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">An important
aspect of the community right to buy is the fact that it empowers local
groups and individuals to save their own community assets, so all such
groups must have that. I fear that the hon. Lady’s valiant
attempt to define what local groups are will not be sufficient, given
the huge range and diversity of groups. I think that she acknowledges
that, but she makes an important point that we certainly have in mind,
and our debate reinforces the importance of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000371">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 108, the hon. Lady asked whether the local authority should
be able to list assets on its own initiative. She has already accepted
that it is valuable that town and parish councils should be able to
nominate, so I put it to her that what is sauce for the goose is sauce
for the gander. If, in her view, parish and town councils are
appropriate bodies, it is a little hard to see why a principal council
would be less able to use fair judgment and avoid conflicts of
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000372">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We think it
is important that councillors, who are likely to be the people who
initiate or generate requests through their councils, should be able to
act. We also think that it is right that councils themselves should
take a strategic view. Perhaps this is more obvious in rural areas, but
one could well imagine that a district council might take a view at a
strategic level within its area that local assets should be listed for
communities with certain characteristics. Excluding local authorities
from that opportunity would restrict their role as place shapers and
would mean that we would lose the benefit of their strategic
knowledge.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000373">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
painted that part of my argument even more clearly when she said that
once parishes, neighbourhood plans and forums were taken into account,
bits of the country would still not be covered by those mechanisms. It
would therefore seem absolutely appropriate for the principal council
in such an area to have the capacity to nominate assets of community
value.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000374">&#160;</a>

hope that the hon. Lady understands that I am sympathetic to the
intentions expressed in her first two amendments, although she has been
a little premature by putting them down on the page. Amendment 108
would be a mistake, however, and would cut across our intentions, which
I believe the Opposition

think that we would disagree with the general thrust of the clause but,
as I pointed out, we have one or two concerns. I was interested by his
comments about local connection and the need to try to define that at

helpful if we could have done so before now. I have made the point that
we need to understand what local connection is, and part of the
reasoning behind the amendments was to try to tease out exactly what
would work. I hope that the Minister will come forward with a clearer
provision on Report, because we support the proposal and want it to be
developed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000376">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
come back to the problem that there is no definition in the Bill of
what land of community value is—other than that it is of
community value. If a nomination is to be deemed valid, will a
community need to provide evidence or an explanation establishing a
burden of proof for the community value of each piece of land? 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 512<a class="bkMark" name="Column512">&#160;</a>
                           </div>I ask that in relation to subsection (3)(b), which states
that land must be included in the list if it “is of community
value”. Who judges whether land is of community value and on
what evidential basis? Can that be challenged? That information does
not appear to be in the Bill, although I am happy to be corrected.
Outside organisations made the point that problems could be caused
unless we have a deeper explanation of the
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000388">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the Scottish system, community groups welcomed the opportunity to take
over areas. The situation up there was initially seen as a win-win by
outside organisations. People involved in the Kilfinan Community Forest
Company felt that once the land was nominated, they would be able to
take over the forest, so they cannot understand why they are being
thwarted at every turn. There seem to be some problems with the
Scottish system, so will the Minister explain how the system in the
Bill is significantly different and how it will enable and empower
community
groups?<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000389">&#160;</a>

British Chambers of Commerce states in its briefing that the clause
should be amended to exclude from consideration community nominations
with the sole purpose of preventing the development of a site. My view
is that it would be difficult to find a level of proof to meet that
criterion, but I am sure that the BCC would like to hear the
Minister’s comments about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000390">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
74 requires the local authority to consider the community nominations
it receives—it does not have the discretion just to forget about
them. The authority is then required to accept the nomination if the
land or building is in its area and is of community value. The hon.
Lady rightly put her finger on the point that what is of community
value will differ in different places. One can imagine different assets
coming to the attention of an inner urban community, a remote rural
area and a suburban area, so we do not envisage a universal set of
things that will be of community value. However, we intend to provide a
definition through regulations under clause 72 to establish the matters
to which local authorities will need to have regard, albeit accepting
that there might be different criteria even within an authority area.
It occurs to me that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East
represents an authority that stretches from rural to inner urban, so
there will be different criteria in different parts of that
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11021111000394">&#160;</a>

though that the criterion that an asset was in a local
authority’s area was a fundamental point until I heard the right
hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich pointing out that an asset might
be partly in an authority’s area. However, if the local
authority considers that the two criteria are met, subject to the
definitions set out in regulations made under clause 72, it must enter

is unsuccessful, the authority must give the person who made it its
reasons for non-inclusion in writing. The process will be transparent,
and I hope that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor Views accepts that
it will deal with the issue that she raised. I hope that the Committee
