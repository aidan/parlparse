<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abolition of death penalty for treason and piracy, etc.</center></H4>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause 
stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): The clause deals with the serious and 
important subject of the abolition of the death penalty for a number of offences relating to treason, 
which are set out in the clause.

<P>
I want to make it clear that although I am speaking for the 
Opposition on the Bill, in my short speech I am expressing my individual views. This is free-vote 
territory for the Opposition. I understand that that is also the case for the Government, and that is 
absolutely right.

<P>
I shall vote against the clause standing part of the Bill. When I studied the 
background to the Bill, I did not expect that consideration of the abolition of the death penalty would 
arise. I understand the circumstances in which it arose in another place, and I have now given the 
matter careful thought, taking into account the views of my constituents. I have concluded that the 
clause should not be part of the Bill. Before I give my reasons for that view, I should like to broach 
two matters with the Minister. First, will he confirm that the death penalty will remain available 
under armed forces legislation? If he confirms that that is the case, will he tell the Committee what 
the Government's plans are in respect of that matter?

<P>
Secondly, will the Minister confirm that the 
penalty of life imprisonment, which will replace the death penalty, will be discretionary rather than 
mandatory? On the assumption—which the Minister may disprove in his response—that it is a 
discretionary sentence, will he explain why that is so? Some people might be opposed in principle to 
the death penalty, and, for that reason, would wish to abolish it. However, they might believe that 
treason is so serious that it should carry a mandatory life sentence.
<P>
The Minister of State is 
looking a little puzzled, but I hope that he will give the Committee a considered response on that 
important point. I will give way to him if he wishes to speak, as he might pre-empt my 
remarks.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> I should be grateful if the hon. 
Gentleman would allow us to respond, rather than commenting whenever an expression of 
puzzlement crosses the brows of Ministers. It might have nothing to do with the remarks that he is 
making at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am sorry; I assumed that the Minister was listening 
carefully to my comments and that that was his response. He may have been thinking about something 
entirely different. We are discussing a serious subject, and I do not want the Minister to get tetchy this 
early in the morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I certainly do not want to get tetchy, but I have commented 
previously on the hon. Gentleman's habit of entering into a dialogue about the expressions on 
people's faces. If he wishes to do that, he should realise that it works both ways. We want to respond 
seriously to the points that he makes, but that habit reduces the seriousness of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was not trying in any way to provoke the Minister, although I seem to have succeeded in 
doing so. I just wanted to point out that that part of my speech may have been unnecessary. However, 
I shall look forward to the Minister's considered response.
<P>
An offence as serious as treason 
should carry a mandatory life sentence. If the Government think that I am over-reacting, they may 
wish to consider many people's reaction to the release of Michael Bettaney. Although he was not 
prosecuted for treason, he was prosecuted for serious offences. The Minister will be aware of the 
public reaction to the case. However, it must be made clear to all those who have commented on his 
release that he had been sentenced to 23 years' imprisonment and that he had served 14 of them. He 
was released subject to remission, and no comment can fairly be made about the fact that he has been 
released. The man had served his sentence. However, the case shows how seriously the public treat 
such matters.
<P>
Will the Minister also respond to the following specific point? I understand that the 
offence of treason will be subject to a discretionary life sentence rather than the death penalty. If that 
is so, it will become a less serious offence than murder and will carry a less serious penalty. Treason 
will carry the same sentence as many other offences, which although serious in themselves, are less 
serious than the most serious offence of all, which is murder. Such offences carry a sentence of 
discretionary, rather than mandatory, life imprisonment. Is that right? Is not treason an utterly 
heinous crime?
<P>
We must consider what happens in practice. We do not want to return to ancient 
legal technicalities. The ancient law of treason made it an offence to violate the King's eldest 
unmarried daughter, counterfeit the Privy Seal, bring false money into the realm or slay the Lord 
Chancellor. Supporters of the euro or admirers of the Lord Chancellor can rest easy. In practice, 
modern Britain does not consider such crimes to be treason. I may be wrong again, but I understand 
that there has not been a prosecution in peacetime for an offence of treason carrying the death penalty 
since the 19th century. One of the last prosecutions for treason in peacetime occurred in the case of 
the Cato street conspiracy, which took place in about 1820. that was a bizarre historical episode in 
which it later turned out that many of the conspirators had been drawn into the conspiracy by a man 
who had been recruited to act as an agent provocateur on the direct orders of the Home Secretary of 
the day. Whatever we may think of modern Home Secretaries, none of us would lay such a charge 
against them. 
<P>
In practice, we are considering the offence of treason in wartime. Prosecutions this 
century for offences of treason that carry the death penalty have all been made in wartime. Treason in 
wartime is the most heinous of crimes, although treason in peacetime is a more difficult issue. I have 
no hesitation in saying that treason in wartime is beyond the pale and must be treated as such. We 
shall debate the issue today, but I hope that the House will have an opportunity to return to it on 
Report and, perhaps, consider an amendment that will allow the death penalty to remain for offences 
of treason in wartime.
<P>
The circumstances of treason in wartime make it an especially heinous 
crime. One of my colleagues who is an eminent lawyer and one of her Majesty's counsel is opposed on 
principle to capital punishment for murder, but supports the penalty's retention for treason in 
wartime. I accept that millions of people oppose capital punishment on principle, but such opposition 
means little when the state is engaged in war. Terrible things happen in war. Thousands of innocent 
service men, women and civilians on both sides of a conflict may die through various acts of war. 
Why is it acceptable to countenance the death of an enemy soldier or civilian, but not the death of 
someone who betrays his country, or seeks to bring about his country's downfall, or to prolong the 
war?
<P>
In war, the highest priority must be given to protecting our service men and women in the 
field. That is my main reason for wishing to retain the death penalty for treason in wartime. Someone 
who betrays our service men and women in war not only deserves the death penalty, but should 
receive it as a deterrent to others of like mind.
<P>
Views differ on deterrence. However, in war, even 
life imprisonment—the new maximum sentence for treason—may not be much of a deterrent. All 
members of the Committee will be able to think of at least one occasion this century when, in world 
opinion, our country's downfall was imminent. On such occasions, life imprisonment would not have 
deterred someone who was minded to commit treason. In those years, when our brave soldiers, sailors 
and airmen were fighting, and civilians were suffering and losing their lives at home, we owed to 
them to have the ultimate deterrent as a protection, and to help save lives, defend the country and 
bring the war to an end more quickly.
<P>
That time may seem long ago, and remote to those of my 
generation and to younger people, but many of our constituents remember it. The last prosecution for 
treason, which carried the death penalty, arose out of the last war. One of those hanged for treason 
was William Joyce. His case has been used as an example of why we should not retain the death 
penalty for treason. On my admittedly incomplete understanding of his life history, I take the opposite 
view.
<P>
Some people claim that William Joyce was an unlucky man who had a posh accent, was a 
figure of fun and made funny broadcasts to this country during the war. I take a different view: I 
believe that he deserved his fate. William Joyce was a Nazi sympathiser who shared the beliefs and 
aims of the Nazi regime, did his best to put them into practice in this country before the war and went 
to assist Germany during the war. People refer to the legal aspects of the case, but William Joyce was 
tried in this country before a judge and jury who took 23 minutes to convict him. He had a fair trial, 
with full legal representation—that is more than can be said for the victims of the regime that he did 
so much to promote.
<P>
Most important, the man committed treason. He was part of the Nazi 
propaganda machine that was directed against this country during the war. He disheartened civilians 
and gave false information to service people. William Joyce had a full and fair trial. He deserved his 
fate because he was a traitor. Someone who commits treason in wartime commits the most heinous 
offence.
<P>
As a matter of conscience, I believe that the death penalty for treason should be available 
in wartime. Therefore, I shall oppose the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I agree 
absolutely with my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison). Like him, I shall oppose 
the clause. Most Labour Committee members, with the exception of the Ministers, the hon. Members 
for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall) and for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) and the Government Whip, the 
hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), are new Members of Parliament.  Therefore, 
they will not know that when the matter came before the House of Commons on a free vote under the 
previous Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) proposed an 
amendment that sought to bring back capital punishment for the crime of murdering of a police 
officer. I supported that amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many Conservative Members take this matter extremely seriously. Like my hon. 
Friend the Member for Hertsmere, I support the sentence that was imposed on William Joyce. I will 
now speak about that.
<P>
I come from a services family. I am one of those slightly unusual people 
whose father and grandfather fought in the same war. My grandfather was a career soldier who served 
on the Western front in the first world war and was still in the Army in the second world war. My 
father was a naval officer who worked on submarines during and after the second world 
war.
<P>
Both men told me of the enormous effects of the propaganda broadcasts of William Joyce—
also known as Lord Haw Haw. They told me also of the incredibly strong feelings of everyone in this 
country who listened to broadcasts that began—as we all know—with the words, "Germany calling, 
Germany calling". That phrase was heard in the dark days of the battle of Britain, after the fall of 
France. [Interruption.] I do not regard that as a matter of levity, as the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. 
Dismore) seems to do. I heard him say from a sedentary position that he regards Lord Haw Haw's 
claim to be an Irishman as significant. At the time, the court did not think that that was relevant. I 
agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere that William Joyce had a fair trial with full 
legal representation. He was a traitor. In my view, and in the view of practically every British citizen 
at the time of his 1945 trial, he was as guilty as those condemned in the Nuremberg trials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to be unfair to Labour Members, so I will not single anyone out. We are 
discussing a serious subject and I invite them to consider that, had Nazism prevailed, Mr. Joyce would 
probably have been a prominent member of the Nazi regime that would have been installed in this 
country. All the terrible things that happened in other parts of Europe would have been visited upon 
us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. I hope that the matter will receive more serious 
consideration than Government Back Benchers appear to be giving it. We will have a free vote on an 
issue of conscience that provokes strong feelings from many of our constituents. I ask hon. Members 
who doubt that to have the bravery to conduct a poll in their constituencies to ascertain how many of 
their constituents would be prepared to support the reintroduction of capital punishment for the crime 
of treason and the crime of murdering police officers.
<P>
I think that we all know that the vast 
majority of people in this country never supported the abolition of capital punishment and would 
support its reintroduction for the murder of on-duty police officers. I accept, of course, that people 
have the right to feel differently from me on matters of conscience.  However, a basic tenent of 
democracy is that such matters should be considered seriously. They should not be treated as matters 
of levity by Government Back Benchers.
<P>
The matter should be debated by the whole House. I 
share the hope of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere that it will be raised in Opposition 
amendments when the Bill is considered on report. We all—particularly those of us who have 
connections with the services—regard treason as one of the most serious crimes that can be 
committed.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere referred to the disturbing case of Michael 
Bettaney, which has received much publicity in the past few days. I would like to draw the attention of 
Committee members to comments made about the appalling triumphalist scenes that were condemned 
by Ministers and Opposition Front Bench spokesmen in the House yesterday.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> 
Order. I remind hon. Members that communication across the Bar is not permitted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> As I was saying, the Government and the Opposition rightly condemned the appalling 
triumphalism at Sinn Fein's so-called Ard Fheis following the temporary release of the Balcombe 
street criminals. That triumphalism provoked correspondence that not all hon. Members will have 
seen. A letter to The Daily Telegraph—or possibly another broadsheet—caught my eye. It recalled the 
terms of editorials in several broadsheet papers about the tragic and appalling murder of a former hon. 
Member M, Airey Neave, at the palace of Westminster. Anyone who was politically aware at the time 
will never forget that. I had the great honour of meeting Airey Neave when I was a young student, and 
some other hon. Members will have known him. He was an exceptionally brave man.
<P>
Editorials 
at the time of the murder, and after the Balcombe street criminals were arrested, referred to the fact 
that had the death penalty remained on the statute book, it would not have been possible for people to 
be regarded as martyrs after serving a lengthy prison sentence.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Given that 
this is such a sensitive time in Northern Ireland because of the referendum, it would be advisable for 
the hon. Gentleman not to pursue that line of debate too far. I do not think that very helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand your warning entirely, Mr. O'Hara, and take it and the matters you mention, 
seriously. However, it would be wrong of me not to mention how seriously our constituents take the 
issue that I was discussing, given that they have been referred to in the newspapers at this sensitive 
time. I shall not pursue the argument further, but I invite hon. Members to read the correspondence 
that I mentioned, as an indication of that concern from the constituents.
<P>
This is not a matter for 
levity. I shall support my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, on the basis of the free vote, in 
opposing the clause. Treason should never be taken lightly. Although our generation has not had to 
fight in a full-scale war, as our parents and grandparents did, many of us had friends in the services, 
who fought in the Falklands, who served and, sometimes, tragically died, in Ulster, or who took part 
in other conflicts. Treason is the most serious crime in the laws of any country. It is not only an issue 
of conscience but a fundamental matter relating to how a democratic state protects its rights and 
freedoms. All hon. Members should understand that. 
<P>
Perhaps I may extend the point made by 
my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere in his helpful intervention, and ask Labour Members to 
examine their consciences as well as considering the views of their constituents. They should ask 
themselves whether, if Nazism had succeeded and the views of William Joyce had triumphed, any 
Labour politician would have been elected to the House in Nazi post-war Britain.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert </B><P>
Smith (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): I apologise for what happened earlier, which was due to 
my lack of knowledge. I hope I shall gradually discover what errors are possible in the 
Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere seemed to feel that there should be a distinction 
between acts of treason in peace or war, and the hon. Member for Surrey Heath extended the 
definition of war to the conflicts in Ulster and the Falkland islands. What clear definition of war 
would the hon. Member for Hertsmere offer to clarify the boundary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. 
Gentleman is making a fair and important point, and an amendment might be appropriate in that 
respect. I said that I considered peacetime a more difficult matter in this context than wartime. 
Perhaps treason in this context could be restricted to times of war; as we expect judges to recognise 
pink elephants on their doorsteps, they should at least know a time of war when they see one.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Some of us are a bit worried about the pink elephants, but that is another matter.
<P>
I 	
am worried that war could be a more difficult time in which to ensure the smooth and fair operation of 
justice. There could be a miscarriage of justice because of the heat of war, and the problem with the 
death penalty is that it is an irreversible sentence: it is no good the state apologising for having made 
an error. Moreover, someone committing an act of treason is trying to foment dissent within the 
nation and the act of sentencing to death might rally people around that cause or provoke greater 
support for it.
<P>
For those who oppose the death penalty at a fundamental level, there is no point at 
which it suddenly becomes operational. If the death penalty, is opposed on the grounds of possible 
miscarriages of justice, the same applies to treason during war as at any other time. It might be 
opposed on the grounds that it is not an effective deterrent—we may recall the practical example 
provided by the hon. Member for Hertsmere of someone who committed an act of treason and was 
sentenced to death. Clearly, the threat of the death penalty did not deter that person from committing 
treason, so the deterrence failed.
<P>
Innocent civilians and soldiers are killed in war, but war crimes 
trials work on the basis that innocent civilians and soldiers should be killed only in extremis—when it 
is necessary to protect life on the other side of the conflict. A person in court who is charged with 
treason is no longer a physical threat because he is under the constraint of the state, so the argument 
does not rest solely on the fact that there are innocent victims.
<P>
Finally, the issue is a matter of 
conscience. The fact that some people argue against the death penalty does not necessarily undermine 
their commitment to the state or to the causes or wars fought by the state. Many of us have relatives 
who fought and died in wars and many of us would have been threatened by the Nazis had they ever 
ruled this country. The issues are serious but the death penalty for treason in times of war is no 
solution to the problem.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): I rise unusually to disagree with my 
hon. Friends, but I hope that the Government, in removing the death penalty for treason, will 
nevertheless make it clear that treason should be considered the most serious of crimes. It is a crime 
not only against one person—as is the case with murder or some other serious crimes—but against the 
whole of society; and it must be recognised as such.
<P>
I support the proposal to abolish the death 
penalty for treason, as I oppose the death penalty in all cases. In a civilised society at the end of the 
20th century, we should not need judicial killing to impose order on our society. As the hon. Member 
for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) said a few moments ago, someone who 
commits a heinous crime and is sent to prison for life is a criminal who can be despised, disliked and 
blamed by the rest of society. If, however, he is judicially killed for his crime, he will become a hero, 
and it is wrong to make heroes out of villains. Given the attitudes of the tabloid press in this country, 
were the death penalty imposed for any reason, we would find that the person concerned would 
become a hero rather than a villain. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Although my hon. Friend knows that I do not 
agree with her, I respect her views and the way in which she expresses them. While taking note of 
your earlier warning to me, Mr. O'Hara, may I ask whether my Learned Friend agrees that the events 
last weekend show that criminals do not have to have suffered the death penalty to become heroes?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Laing:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, but in the circumstances to which 
he obliquely referred there are those who have died in prison by their own hand who have also become 
heroes when they were villains: they were murderers. However, we are not discussing that subject now 
and it would not be in order for me to pursue it.
<P>
Nevertheless, the creation of heroes from villains 
is one reason that I oppose the death penalty for any crime. In the United States of America, the death 
penalty has been brought back for certain crimes in some states. That has resulted in the horrible 
situation in which someone who is convicted of murder is sentenced to death and then kept in prison 
year after year while appeals go back and forward. There was a disgusting case about 18 months ago 
in which the final appeal went to the Supreme Court of the United States at the 11th hour, when the 
man was about to be executed. The execution was held up, but he was executed two days later. That is 
no way to treat even the most heinous villain because it reflects badly on the society in which such 
events take place. Sophisticated legal processes would be instigated if there was a death penalty for 
any crime in this country.
<P>
I appreciate that we are discussing treason in wartime; it is not 
something that would occur in normal, everyday life. Nevertheless, if our law retains the death penalty 
and it is available for any crime, we are leaving ourselves, as a society, open to the possibility not of 
injustice but of bad administration and of scenes such as those in America which I have just 
described.
<P>
I conclude by quoting Enoch Powell. Hon. Members who have not studied his writings 
and speeches might assume that as a traditional, right-wing Conservative he was in favour of the 
death penalty, but he was not. He summed it up extremely well by saying that in our society there is 
enough unavoidable brutality and that imposing the death penalty is avoidable brutality. I argue that 
in any circumstances such brutality by society should be avoided.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I can confirm to the hon. Member 
for Hertsmere that there will be a free vote on the issue. That, of course, is the tradition of the House 
when debating the death penalty. I agree with the hon. Gentleman, with the hon. Member for Surrey 
Heath (Mr. Hakwins) and with other hon. Members who have spoken in what has been a very good 
debate and this is a serious issue which must be addressed accordingly, as we propose to do.
<P>
The 
views expressed by the hon. Members for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) and for Hertsmere are held in 
respect for the integrity with which they have been put, as are those of the hon. Members for West 
Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing). These issues should be fully and 
properly debated. Strong views are expressed strong emotions come into play, and the House of 
Commons is the forum where they should be heard.
<P>
Although capital punishment for murder was 
abolished in 1965, the death penalty still remains on the statute book as a valid, though unused, 
sentence for the offences of treason, piracy with violence and a number of mutinous offences under the 
armed forces legislation. I can confirm that the legislation in relation to the armed forces remains, 
although my colleagues in the Ministry of Defence are examining how it should operate in the future 
and how they would wish to proceed with it. They will in due course announce whatever conclusions 
they reach.
<P>
The clause abolishes the death penalty for treason or piracy and it was inserted, as the 
hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned, following a free vote on an amendment tabled by Lord Archer 
of Sandwell in another place. The other place was virtually united in support of the abolition of the 
death penalty for these offences. Although this is not a Government amendment, we have no intention 
of seeking to overturn the clause. Indeed, it was supported in the Lords by the Home Office Minister, 
Lord Williams of Mostyn. The Government's acceptance of the amendment is consistent with our 
policy and that of successive Governments that the death penalty is a matter of conscience that should 
be left to Members of both the Lords and the Commons. That is why it is a matter for Parliament to 
decide on a free vote.
<P>
I note the comment by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath that there may be 
an Opposition proposal, perhaps on a broader issue, at a later stage when we might be able to debate 
the wider issues. The issue here is narrow: the abolition of the death penalty for piracy with violence. 
In many ways it is academic because the last execution was in the early part of the 19th century. There 
are not many pirates on the Spanish Main any more, and hon. Members who spoke concentrated not 
on that but on the much more difficult issue of the law in relation to treason.
<P>
The law of treason 
is much more complicated as a law. In many ways it is very archaic and in need of review. The matter 
will eventually fall to the Law Commission but the death penalty is being replaced by a maximum 
penalty of life imprisonment which will be discretionary. One of the reasons it is discretionary is 
because we are dealing with an archaic law. We repeatedly referred to the Lord Haw Haw who was 
prosecuted under the Treason Act 1351 which is about as archaic as laws can get.
<P>
The hon. 
Member for Hertsmere alluded to the fact that the offence of high treason covers acts such as violating 
female members of the royal family. It would certainly not be appropriate for laws to oblige the courts 
to impose mandatory life sentences in such cases. One of the issues that the hon. Member for 
Hertsmere raised was what happens in a war.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I will give way in a moment after I have made my point.
<P>
During the second world war, 
the then Government passed the Treachery Act 1940. Haw Haw was not prosecuted under that Act, 
but it put in place provisions that applied only to the circumstances of war when the safety of the 
nation was at stake. Successive Governments have taken the view that Members of the House of 
Commons and of the House of Lords should decide whether the death penalty should be available as a 
sentence. It is always open to Parliament to change its mind and, if there were a war, it could decide 
whether to reconsider the issue.
<P>
The existing offence of treason does not merit a mandatory life 
sentence. The hon. Members for Surrey Heath and for Hertsmere made their points strongly and 
carefully, but I am sure that they would not argue that the current law of high treason should always 
involve a mandatory life sentence. They may agree that the law is not clear and, therefore, that the 
argument for applying a mandatory life sentence is not that strong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I wanted to 
refer to the Minister's preceding point about the archaic nature of the laws. I recognise the need to 
update out-moded laws because that is part of our responsibility as parliamentarians. However, many 
of the people who write to us think that the fact that a law dates back to the 14th or 16th century does 
not necessarily mean that it is archaic. It may have survived for so long because it has had the support 
of the populace. A law is not bad just because it has been on the statute book for a very long time. It 
may have been necessary and it may have public support.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman 
misunderstands my point. I am not saying that we should not have an offence of treason. Strong 
arguments can be made to say that such an offence is appropriate. 
<P>
Existing laws are written in a 
certain style and deal with offences such as those mentioned by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. I am 
sure that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath would not argue that we should apply a mandatory life 
sentence or the death penalty to those offences. Therefore, it is right to look at the issues in the round. 
The Law Commission may have to advise us on how we can ensure that the law on treason is brought 
up to date so that it deals with the problems that Conservative Members have suggested we might face 
if the country were betrayed.
<P>
I have listened to the opponents to the clause. Members of the 
Committee must examine their consciences and decide whether the death penalty is appropriate in the 
circumstances covered by the clause. Every member of the Committee will respect the decision 
reached.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I listened to the Minister's remarks about wartime 
during which he made some interesting points about the Treachery Act 1940. It is difficult to debate 
the issue in an atmosphere in which war seems unimaginable. No obvious enemy threatens us, and we 
have not faced one since the end of the cold war. Although low-scale undeclared wars rage at various 
times around the world and terrorist threats exist in some places, it seems inconceivable to us that we 
would ever be faced with a threat to our very national existence. One thing is certain: the future is 
uncertain and we have no idea what will happen. It is possible, that, in future, there might be a 
situation in which this country—which, for centuries has proclaimed civilised virtues of tolerance and 
free speech—will be threatened.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This vote is important and symbolic and is not entirely academic. One has to 
think only of the situation that faced this country in the 1940s, and it may happen again. Somebody 
could have betrayed secrets to the enemy about the forthcoming D-day landings. The Minister may 
say that that person could have been caught by the then Treachery Act 1940 or the Official Secrets 
Act 1911. I would like to hear what he has to say. One could conceive of a situation, unlike that of 
Lord Haw Haw, in which a British national was putting not only the life of another individual in 
danger, but the life of a whole nation or the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers.
<P>
In relying 
to my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest, I believe that the most telling point is that a life 
sentence is no deterrent. Without going into the details of Northern Ireland, we could study other 
conflicts. Once the war is over, there is tremendous pressure to proclaim that prisoners of war—
people who were fighting for the losing side—are precisely that, prisoners of war, and should be 
released. A life sentence would have been no deterrent for people who wanted to betray this country in 
1940 or even in 1945 because they would have known that, once the hostilities ceased, that sentence 
would almost certainly have been rescinded. Even if they had been on the losing side, they would 
eventually have been let out.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that the death 
penalty would be a deterrent in such situations, given that many people involved in wars are risking 
their lives in taking out any action in the furtherance of the cause that they support?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> 
That is a fair question and the answer is that we cannot possibly now. In the 1940s, people who 
wished to betray this country to Germany could have felt so strongly about what they were doing that 
no deterrent would have persuaded them against such betrayal.
<P>
Much has been made about Lord 
Haw Haw, but I remember when I first served in the House of Commons with Julian Amery. Julian 
Amery's brother was hanged for treason after the second world war. It was considered by many to be a 
shocking case because he came from a respectable family—his father, Leo Amery, was a colonial 
secretary. Julian Amery's brother was captured and spent some time in prisoner of war camps in 
Germany. Being a rather foolish young man, he swallowed the Nazi propaganda and started to try to 
recruit his fellow prisoners of war to fight for Germany. Everybody accepted that he was a foolish and 
silly young man, but he was hanged. Many people thought at the time, and subsequently, that the 
punishment was rather cruel.
<P>
I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath that there are 
two sides to the argument. It is a difficult issue with which to grapple. I come down in favour of my 
hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere in opposing the clause because its deletion now, or at any time, 
is symbolic.
<P>
The clause may be sending a message that I am sure hon. Members do not want to 
send. However, it may be interpreted as saying that we no longer view the nation as supreme and that 
betrayal of the nation is one of the most heinous of crimes, which deserves the death 
penalty.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I want to take my hon. Friend back to the point that he was making about 
Amery. Does he recall Leo Amery's letter to The Times on the morning on which his son was hanged 
for treason? He wrote: "My boy has paid the price. Now let this nonsense stop". Those poignant words 
bear on the subject of our debate today, and many people would agree with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I 
deliberately quoted the case of Leo Amery's son because I wanted to share with the Committee the 
complexities of the matter through that sad case.
<P>
Although Amery was the son of a Colonial 
Secretary, he had tried to recruit people to fight for Nazi Germany. At the time, people felt that that 
was shocking. He was a grown man, and was responsible for his actions.
<P>
When my hon. Friend 
the Member for Epping Forest was introducing her remarks about Enoch Powell, I thought that she 
intended to quote the famous comment—which I think was made by Churchill—that the grass never 
grows over the gallows. The point of that remark was to convince people that hanging terrorists made 
them into martyrs.
<P>
The purport of my hon. Friend's remarks was that mistakes might be made, 
and that people would be made into martyrs. However, I think that she misread the situation. I am 
sure that none of my hon. Friends believe that we should hang people, under the provisions in the 
Bill, if a civil war were taking place. The obvious example is Northern Ireland, where there are deep 
divisions of opinion in one part of the United Kingdom. It is undeniable that those IRA hunger 
strikers, who deliberately did themselves to death—
<P>
The Chairman: Order. The Chair has already 
requested that hon. Members are sensitive in their references to Northern Ireland, at this especially 
sensitive time, during which the referendum is being held. Other members of he Committee have 
observed that advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Of course, Mr. O'Hara, I will be sensitive. However, if we 
cannot enjoy uninhibited free speech in this place, why on earth are we here? I understand what you 
have said, Mr. O'Hara, but I must proclaim my right to speak.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That was merely 
advice from the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am picking my words carefully. I am trying to put both sides 
of the case in Northern Ireland. It is undeniable that terrorists, who die on what they consider to be 
active service, or who commit suicide on hunger strike, or who are hanged, become martyrs.
<P>
I 
want to emphasise that the situation in wartime is different. The sort of person who is likely to fall 
foul of the clause in wartime would not become a martyr with a large following. Some people might 
have sympathised with the son of Leo Amery. In the case of William Joyce, people might not have 
sympathised with what he did, but were sympathetic to his fate. However, neither of them could be 
described as martyrs by any stretch of the imagination. The point made by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Epping Forest is, therefore, not opposite.
<P>
When I first became a Member of 
Parliament, we had a debate on capital punishment and the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, 
opposed it for most crimes. However, he supported it for crimes committed during acts of terrorism, 
arguing that the defence of the nation was paramount. He spoke of his personal opposition to the 
penalty for such reasons as the possibility of mistakes and miscarriages of justice. Those reasons were 
alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest, who also spoke movingly of the 
distressing scenes that take place on death row in America. However, Leon Brittan made the strong 
case that the state must reserve to itself the power to retain capital punishment, if its existence was 
under threat.
<P>
Given the present composition of the House, I have no doubt the clause will be 
deleted. I accept that it is archaic and that no doubt we should amend it—[<P>
Interruption.] I mean, 
of course, that the treason provision will be deleted and that the clause will survive.
<P>
However, we 
are sending out the wrong sort of message, particularly to older people who will remember the second 
world war. They may believe, however unfairly, that the present House of Commons does not hold the 
same views that they had and continue to have—that ultimately the preservation of the nation state is 
more important than anything else.
<P>
I do not want to stray into the wider debate over Europe but 
there is a sub-message underlying the provision; it is not just a question of supporting or opposing the 
death penalty. I appreciate that hon. Members feel strongly about that matter of conscience. In the 
past I voted in favour of the death penalty but 
even I now have some doubts about it, largely as a result of some appalling miscarriages of justice. I 
am now less strongly in favour of the death penalty than when I entered this House 15 years ago. 
However, my views are not central to our debate today, which is about the supremacy of the nation 
state. That is why I shall support my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere in the 
Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now move from the historical background to the aims of the 
youth justice system and the local provision of youth justice services which are also serious subjects in 
their own right.
<P>
I shall speak to amendment No. 150. The reaction of many practitioners in the 
field of youth justice to the clause might well be that the prevention of reoffending has been their aim 
all along and that they do not need the Government to tell them that. However, we need to consider 
the implications of the clause, and I should like to take up one point with the Minister. Why has the 
youth justice system been put in a special position? Do we not also have an interest in preventing 
offending by older persons? Why are we drawing a distinction between older and younger people? Is 
not the purpose of the system to prevent reoffending by anybody?
<P>
For our purposes, older persons 
are not much older than some of the younger ones. Those subject to the youth justice system will be 
children and young persons from 10 to 17 years of age, but anyone who has just turned 18 years of age 
will not come within the ambit of the youth justice system. Should not the prevention of reoffending 
be an equal priority for those over 18, especially for very young people who have only just reached 
that age?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Does the clause have any implications for the standard of justice administered in 
respect of children and young people? Can the Minister assure us that those under 18 will receive the 
same traditional high quality of justice as an older person? Will the safeguards and protections of our 
legal system be available for those over 18? The purpose of amendment No. 150 is to explore such 
issues, and I look forward to the Minister's response to it.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Amendment No. 418 
explores the issues raised by the clause, which appears to have been drafted rather hastily. It makes 
one issue pre-eminent and applies that pre-eminence to the entire system.
<P>
The amendment 
explores the roles and duties of the prosecution and defence. If accepted, it would ensure that the 
clause could not prevent, or dilute, their willingness to carry out their tasks properly. The primary role 
of defence lawyers must be to serve their clients, to present their cases in the best possible light in 
court, and to advise them how to plead in the light of the evidence. Protection of the client is 
paramount in our adversarial system, unless the Government want to change the system, which I do 
not believe that they want to do at this point. That would be a matter to be considered more widely in 
the Bill as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for probing the issues 
raised in an entirely appropriate way. I want to clarify his position on one matter: does he believe that 
there is an inconsistency in representing a client and the aims set out in the clause?
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Yes, there could be, because the best way of dealing with someone who has a record of 
offending might be for the defendant to be found guilty, even though he believes that he is innocent 
and that a fair case could be made to prove it. The defence counsel might therefore have conflicting 
priorities. I want to clarify the matter and to ensure that the defence continues to be clear that its 
priority is the representation of its client.
<P>
Similarly, it is important to avoid wrong signals being 
sent to the Crown Prosecution Service, which should continue to operate under its code to decide 
whether there is enough evidence to proceed and whether it is in the public interest to do so.
<P>
The 
Minister might ask whether there is a conflict; there would be such a danger if the prosecution felt 
that it was so important that the reoffending was stopped, even though the evidence was pretty dodgy, 
that it should go ahead with the case. If the prosecution succeeded, even by a slim chance, the primary 
aim of clause 34 would have been achieved. In other cases, the CPS proceeds according to whether it 
considers that the evidence suggests a serious chance of obtaining a conviction.
<P>
We all want 
guilty people to be prevented from reoffending, but nothing in the system should undermine the right 
of people who are innocent until they are proven guilty to be given the best defence, to which they are 
entitled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There are two contrasting views. On the one hand, it is suggested that 
those who work in the youth justice system do not need the clause to tell them that their main 
responsibility is to prevent offending and reoffending; on the other, it is claimed that there are grave 
dangers in making one aim pre-eminent.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and 
Kincardine that the clause, however it is interpreted, does not require the prosecution or the defence to 
pursue or risk injustice.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked why the clause concentrated on 
youth justice. The Government believe that early and quick intervention is the best way of preventing 
young offenders from becoming adult offenders. There is a greater need to concentrate on preventing 
offending and reoffending by young people, not only in their interests, but in those of the wider 
community and potential future victims.
<P>
Priorities change when one considers the responsibilities 
of adults. Some time ago, we debated the relative age and maturity of individuals, and the need for 
courts to be sensitive about that. It is essential for the youth justice system to have a single and clear 
aim.
<P>
Many debates have taken place about the balance between considering the welfare of a child 
before the court, determining the appropriate punishment, and preventing reoffending. That long-
standing debate has sometimes contributed to muddled decisions by practitioners in the youth justice 
system.
<P>
Clause 34 provides a clear statement that the principal aim of the youth justice system 
should be to prevent offending by the children and young people with whom it deals. It clarifies the 
main aim of those who work in the criminal justice system. The clause is intended to end both the 
uncertainty about what is expected of those who work for youth justice agencies, and the confusion 
about balancing the interests of the offender, the victim and the community. That confusion has been 
apparent for some time and has undermined public confidence in the youth justice system.
<P>
The 
amendments would alter the principal aim of the clause. I understand that they are born of the 
concern that the different professions in the youth justice system are subject to several different duties, 
including the duty to administer justice, which are set out in legislation, professional codes of practice 
or oaths of office, and are not mentioned in the provision. That is why clause 34(2) makes it clear that 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"all persons and bodies carrying out functions in relation to the youth justice 
system"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
must "have regard to" the principal aim of preventing offending by children and 
young people.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in addition to any other duty to which they are subject".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no 
reason for the clause to refer to administering justice because that is already covered by existing duties 
by which agencies and individuals must abide. For example, judges and magistrates are bound by the 
judicial oath to dispense justice to all who appear before them.
<P>
Why should we exempt legal 
representatives from the requirements of clause 34? All those who work in the youth justice system 
can help to achieve the aim of the clause by the way in which they deal with the young people who 
come within their ambit. Before entering Parliament, I had experience of the magistrates court and, 
primarily, the juvenile court which I chaired in my home city of Cardiff. It was clear that in some 
cases defence lawyers obstructed that aim to the detriment of their clients.
<P>
Those who act in that 
way may be a minority and the work of solicitors and counsel is generally of a high standard but it is 
important that all who are involved in the court should be clear about the purpose of the process in 
which they are taking part. It does not go against their responsibility to their client. Of course I 
understand that there are duties and peculiar to defence or prosecution legal representatives, including 
the defence solicitor's duty to his or her client or the Crown prosecutor's duty to comply with the code 
for Crown prosecutors. This aim does not interfere with that responsibility. Clause 34(2) ensures that 
their need to have regard to other duties is not compromised, it makes it clear that they are part of a 
system that is there to deal with offending and to reduce reoffending.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> A little 
earlier I detected a suggestion that representatives of the bench should consider the wider context of 
reoffending. I am still worried that the Minister has not accepted that that could muddy the waters in 
terms of providing the best possible service and focusing minds on clients' wishes and instructions. 
The client's wish must be represented in court because that is the way in which our system works. We 
are not changing the system. Although the person is young he is surely entitled to the same quality of 
representation as an older person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> That is not in question. Often a youngster who 
has been before the court will not have understood the decisions that are being made. I say that with 
some humility. I have had the experience of having youngsters referred to a project that I was running 
as a youth worker who had been before me in 
the court, and finding that, despite the perfect way in which I communicated the decision, they had 
not understood it.
<P>
Many solicitors go to some trouble to explain to their client why the court has 
come to a conclusion and why a particular sentence is being given. Others do not. A clear explanation 
to the youngster of why things have happened in court is an example where the solicitor, as well as 
acting as advocate, can help to reduce reoffending. It is in everyone's interest that youngsters should 
understand why the court, in pursuance of that aim, has reached a particular decision.
<P>
In the 
White Paper "No More Excuses" the Government rightly stress the need for defence lawyers to protect 
their clients' interests and to advise and represent them robustly It also recognises the importance of 
the solicitor helping young defendants to make up their minds about whether to plead guilty in the 
light of the prosecution's case. As I said earlier, the Crown prosecutor is required to comply with the 
code for Crown prosecutors and there is no conflict between that and this aim.
<P>
It is important that 
we clarify the purpose of the youth justice system. We have a youth justice system to deal with 
offences that have been committed, to clear those who are innocent of offences of which they are 
accused and find guilty those who are not. That is there as it always has been. However, the aim of the 
youth justice system must be to avoid the reoffending that has been a scourge of society over recent 
years. I hope that with that explanation and clarification the hon. Member for Hertsmere will feel able 
to withdraw his amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's reply. I 
understand the Governments motives and I understand how they want to reduce reoffending. I do not 
understand why a distinction should be drawn between the adult system and the youth system for 
these purposes; the adult system is for people who in some cases are only slightly older than young 
people. Surely in both systems the interests of those operating and administering the system is to 
prevent offending. Surely they have a common interest. Why is a distinction being drawn between the 
two?
<P>
I accept that there may be different considerations in the case of young people. The welfare 
of young people is more of a consideration than it sometimes is in the case of older people. The courts 
have long recognised, as I am sure the Minister did when he was sitting as a youth magistrate, that 
age can be an important factor in mitigation. The courts need to have regard to the welfare of young 
people who commit offences while they are still growing up. They many have more growing up to do 
and might be influenced in a way that an odder offender, with more convictions and experience, could 
not be. I worry a little about the philosophy underling the measure when the Government talk about 
trying to strike a balance between punishment and welfare.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I regard the welfare of the offender as part and parcel of protecting the public. 
The more that welfare is assured, the greater the protection for the public, as the offender is less likely 
to reoffend. I wonder whether the Government do not make an artificial distinction between 
punishment and welfare, setting them up as contrary forces between which a balance must be 
established, when they are really part of the same process. Perhaps they make such a distinction 
rhetorically, to suggest a crackdown on youth crime. I am not sure about that, and although I do not 
shrink from the idea of strong measures to protect the public in some cases, I am not happy about the 
Government's approach.
<P>
I remain perplexed about why the aim stated should relate to the youth 
justice system but not the system of justice for slightly older people, aged, say, 19 or 20. However, I 
shall not press the matter to a vote.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> As the Minister's reply leads me to think 
that we could deal with some of the relevant concerns more constructively under the next group of 
amendments, I shall not pursue my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I beg to move

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'It shall be the principal aim'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
(a)'.
<P>
No. 272, in page 26, line 
17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(b) to protect and advance the legal interests of children and young 
persons;
<P>
(c) to promote the welfare of children and younger persons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The amendments are intended to bring balance into the system, perhaps in a way that the 
Minister might find acceptable. They would bring together three aims for the youth justice system: 
preventing offending by children and young persons; protecting and advancing their legal interests; 
and promoting their welfare.
<P>
The problem with a primary aim of preventing reoffending is that 
perhaps some methods of doing that would not be compatible with the welfare of the child. For 
example, one might opt for extremely tough sentences, using the reasoning of previous Home 
Secretaries that, while locked up, people do not commit crimes—leaving aside the issue of crimes 
committed in prison. There would be a danger of forgetting the other roles of the youth justice system, 
such as the welfare of a child. Clearly, preventing reoffending and protecting the welfare of the child 
go together, but there can be no harm in ensuring that those who are more concerned with 
punishment recognise the importance of welfare. Similarly, the clause would remind those concerned 
with welfare that reoffending is an important consideration. The amendment would give balanced 
recognition to the need for the legal system to perform its due functions for younger persons, just as 
for older persons.
<P>
The Minister should be able to accept that the amendments come close to his 
aims. They would work well with the present system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There is not much between us 
as to the principles that we consider important. However, there is a chasm with respect to making the 
aims of the system simple. The amendments would restore the muddle that we want to remove. The 
present system, in which there is no clear focus on the prevention of offending, is bad enough without 
enshrining the muddle in statute.
<P>
For far too long there has been a lack of clarity about the main 
purpose of the youth justice system, which has led to uncertainty among those working in the system 
about what is expected of them and to confusion about how to balance the interests of the offender, the 
victim and the wider community. As I said earlier, that has helped to undermine public confidence in 
the youth justice system. People can perceive the muddle, which does nothing to raise confidence in 
the system.
<P>
Clause 34 is intended to resolve those difficulties by providing a clear statement that 
the principal aim of all those working in the youth justice system should be to prevent offending by 
the children and young people with whom they deal. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and 
Kincardine has reflected on fashion changing from time to time. In the past, some people working 
with young offenders thought that their offending did not matter as long as their welfare was 
considered. However, that undermined important considerations about the welfare of young people. 
Failing to address offending behaviour conflicts with the welfare principle, and excuses were provided 
for a great deal of bad practice.
<P>
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was fashionable to believe 
that keeping young people out of the criminal justice system was meritous and virtuous in itself, but I 
do not believe that. Moving more quickly, nipping things in the bud and preventing youngsters from 
having to enter the youth justice system are certainly worth pursuing and are entirely consistent with 
the clause.
<P>
The aim focuses directly on the outcomes of the youth justice process and on the 
interests of all involved with it. Preventing offending is in the best interests of the young person. It 
helps to ensure his or her welfare—there is no inconsistency with the points made by the hon. 
Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine—well-being and future life prospects and 
opportunities. It is certainly in the best interests of the victim and of the public at large to pursue the 
aim of preventing youth offending. Those working in the youth justice system can help to achieve that 
aim through the manner in which they deal with the young people that they encounter in the system, 
which does not conflict with their responsibilities. However, the principle is nowhere set out in 
existing legislation. That is why clause 34 is so important.
<P>
The amendment proposes that in 
addition to preventing offending, the aims of the youth justice system should be to promote the legal 
interests of the child or young person and promote his or her welfare. Important issues are raised for 
those working in the system who should indeed have regard to them. However, existing legislation 
already deals with such issues. For example, section 44 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 
requires courts to take account of the welfare of the child or young person in fulfilling their duties. 
Lawyers are bound by their professional code of practice to act in the best interests of their clients. 
Judges and magistrates are bound by their judicial oath to dispense justice to all who appear before 
them without fear or favour or ill will. In pursuing the aim of the youth justice system as set out in the 
clause, those conditions already obtain. It would muddy the waters to reintroduce elements that are 
already in statute by detracting from the focus of clause 34.
<P>
The youth justice system needs clarity 
of purpose, a shared starting point for developing good multi-agency work and a clear focus on the 
outcomes that it seeks to achieve for the young person, the victim and the general public. That is what 
the clause provides. I hope that the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine will 
recognise the clarity and balance in the drafting and that he will therefore withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I am concerned when people talk about simplicity in finding 
solutions to complex problems. However, I feel reassured by the Minister's reference to other statutes, 
which I hope will remind those involved of the wider issues. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I beg to move Government 
amendment No. 385, in page 26, line 22, after 'the' insert 'persons and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With 
this we shall take Government amendments Nos. 386, 388, 392 and 394 to 398.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> 
Perhaps I should start by saying that the police service is rather unusual. Whereas the elected 
members, the chief officers and officers of a local authority or health authority are part of one entity, 
the police service is made up of two elements in law. A police authority has a separate constitutional 
existence from the operational police service, which is headed by a chief constable or the 
Commissioner as in the case of London.
<P>
When we drafted the original Bill, we thought that it 
would allow the system to reflect the existing constitutional position. Clauses 35 to 37 deal with the 
provision of youth justice services, the creation of youth offending teams and the formulation of the 
annual youth justice plan. They are designed to ensure that there is an appropriate input from police 
authorities and chief police officers. We want that input to take pace in a manner that reflects the 
constitutional role of each in relation to the police service.
<P>
We believed that the Bill's original 
drafting would have achieved those aims, but it has become clear that a different interpretation has 
been placed on the clauses. According to that interpretation, they would result in police authorities 
taking decisions that are properly the responsibility of the chief constable.
<P>
Clearly, chief officers 
will play a key role in the youth offending teams. The deployment of police officers to youth offending 
teams and their role within those teams and the delivery of youth justice services will properly be an 
operational matter for chief officers of police. The key role that we envisage locally for a chief officer 
level steering group in overseeing the youth offending teams in each area and in the preparation of the 
youth justice plan reflects that and should help ensure that chief officers of police are fully involved. 
In practice, many of the roles will be delegated to the local superintendent, but as part of the 
delegation of powers and responsibilities of the chief constable.
<P>
The duties placed on police 
authorities need to recognise their responsibility within the framework of the Police Act 1996 for local 
policing objectives and overall resource allocation as set out within a policing plan and their 
accountability for police performance in their areas. In view of the comments made about the Bill's 
drafting, we decided that it would be helpful to reflect the intended involvement of chief officers of 
police and police authorities in the Bill. That is what the amendments will achieve. 
<P>
Government 
amendments Nos 385, 386, 395 and 396 make it clear that—alongside police authorities, probation 
committees and health authorities—chief constables are placed under a duty under clause 35(2) to co-
operate with local authorities in securing the availability of the youth justice services that are set out 
in clause 35(3). Under clause 37(2), they are entitled to be consulted by local authorities on youth 
justice plans. That recognises that police authorities and chief officers need to be involved in the 
provision of youth services and discussions about youth justice plans.
<P>
Government amendments 
Nos 388, 392, and 394 provide that the duty under clause 36(3) to co-operate with local authorities in 
establishing youth offending teams should be placed on chief constables. That recognises the 
operational nature of decisions about the deployment of police officers to youth offending teams and 
their role within those teams.
<P>
Government amendments Nos 397 and 398 deal with others points. 
They will include chief officers of police—together with local authorities, probation committees and 
health authorities—within the relevant authorities from which the youth justice board will be able to 
obtain information for the purposes of its monitoring and advisory functions under clause 38(5) and, if 
necessary, a report on the discharge of the new duties under clause 38(8). If the new duties are 
formally taken on, it will be important that, in doing so, chief officers of police are covered by the 
monitoring by the board in terms of the provision of youth justice services and the operation of youth 
offending teams.
<P>

<P>
Amendment No. 398 defines "chief officer of police" according to the definition set 
out in section 101(1) of the Police Act 1996, that is all chief officers of police in England and Wales. 
The amendments underline and make clear the role that both police authorities and chief officers will 
need to play if the new structure of youth justice services and youth offending teams is to be 
successfully delivered.

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 
387, in page 26, line 31, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'( ) The local authority and every person or body 
mentioned in subsection (2) above shall have power to make payments towards expenditure incurred 
in the provision of youth justice services—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) by making the payments directly; or
<P>
(b) 
by contributing to a fund, established and maintained by the local authority out of which the payments 
may be made.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we shall take Government Amendments Nos. 
389 to 391 and No. 393.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Clause 35 requires local authorities—in consultation with 
the police, probation committee and health authority—to draw up an annual youth justice plan, setting 
out the way in which youth justice systems and youth funding teams should be provided and funded in 
their area.
<P>
Each agency will pay directly for its own staff seconded to the youth offending teams 
and for the services and other resources it makes available. The youth justice plan will therefore 
amount to a combined inter-agency budget. We believe that there is value in allowing local authorities 
and the other relevant agencies greater flexibility in the way in which the youth offending teams and 
youth justice services can be funded. That means enabling the local agencies to contribute to a pooled 
budget or common fund, which can be used to pay for staff or services. That will assist effective inter-
agency working and help to strengthen the joint ownership of the youth offending team arrangements 
by the local agencies, which will be important to their successful operation.
<P>
The consultation 
paper, "New National and Local Focus on Youth Crime", which we published in October, set out this 
option. The majority of respondents were attracted to it. Government amendments Nos. 387 and 393 
will allow local authorities with social services and education responsibilities—together with the 
police, probation committees and health authorities—to make payments towards expenditure incurred 
in the provision of youth justice services, and by, or for the purposes of connecting with the youth 
offending teams, contributing to a fund, established and maintained by the local authority, out of 
which the payments may be made.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 389, 390 and 391 allow scope, 
where one or more local authorities are collaborating in the provision of youth offending teams, for 
the fund to be held by one of them. That is a practical element, particularly in relation to some of the 
smaller local authorities, where getting the critical mass of expertise will be assisted by a youth 
offending team covering more than one local authority area.
<P>
The purpose of the clause are set out 
clearly. The fund will be able to be used to pay for activities and intervention work directly concerned 
with the provision of one of those services. For example, when drug misuse is a factor in a young 
person's offending behaviour, the fun could be used to pay for his or her referral. That would form 
part of a rehabilitation programme, following a final warning, to a drug counselling project run by a 
voluntary organisation. Such flexibility will allow the youth offending teams to develop their work 
effectively and practically.
<P>
The fund can also be used to pay for salary and other costs connected 
with the operation of youth offending teams. Most of the team members are likely to be provided on 
secondment, but the fund will allow some flexibility over how they are funded. For example, the fund 
may be used to reimburse the relevant agency or organisation when a drug worker or a mental health 
practitioner becomes a member of a youth offending team.
<P>
Accountability for the fund will rest 
with the local authority, which will need to establish appropriate management arrangements. That 
might involve delegating day-to-day authority over the fund to the manager of the youth offending 
team, who would be the accounting officer for the fund and who would report to the local authority 
through the chief officer level steering group. That group probably would be chaired by the local 
authority chief executive. We envisage that it will oversee the youth offending team arrangements in 
each area and the preparation of the annual youth justice plan.
<P>
The fund would be audited within 
the local authority's accounts by a local auditor appointed by the Audit Commission. We will provide 
guidance to local authorities and other relevant agencies on how the fund should operate, in the light 
of guidance that we are developing on establishing youth offending teams.
<P>
There will be no 
requirement that a fund be established or that, where one is, all the relevant local agencies—with the 
exception of the local authority—must participate. That will be a matter for them to determine, 
according to what they consider most helpful and appropriate in local circumstances.
<P>
However, 
the Government believe that there should be flexibility for the local authority and other local agencies 
to set up a common fund, if those bodies consider that that would help strengthen inter-agency 
working in providing youth justice services and youth offending teams. That widens the opportunity 
for appropriate local arrangements to be made to suit the preference of those who come together to 
provide youth services and to set up youth offending teams.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to 
the Minister; he was most interesting. I appreciate that he gave a full introduction to the amendment, 
but will he say a little more about the effects on funding for other organisations that take part in local 
authority youth justice teams? What is the attitude of central Government in their disbursements to 
local Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Could the hon. Gentleman explain his question a little more 
clearly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Yes. Those acting in other fields who will combine with local 
government to operate youth offending teams would like to know what are the implications—if any—
for their funding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I rise to welcome the provision of a 
fund that will exist for a specific purpose, and will be outside the remit of any single statutory body. 
However, I share some of the worries expressed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere about where the 
money will come from initially.
<P>
Earlier in the debate we touched on local authorities' new 
statutory responsibilities, which are not necessarily followed by funding. A range of bodies are being 
given a provision to establish common funds for specific purposes. I am sure that they will want to use 
that provision. However, as yet we have no indication whether local authorities or other bodies will be 
given a specific sum of money through formula funding in recognition of their new responsibilities 
and of their willingness to act in accordance with the Government's wishes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I 
understand the point that the hon. Member for Hertsmere and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam 
(Mr. Allan) are making, but I do not think that it is necessary to change the line that we are 
taking.
<P>
Many functions will be brought together and will be more focused in the work of the 
youth offending teams. For example, educational work is already undertaken  to prevent young people 
getting involved in drugs or substance abuse. The education and health systems have individual 
responsibilities to provide such a service. It may be decided at a local level that those responsibilities 
should be brought together in a more focused way as part of the work of the youth offending team, and 
that providing a pool budget is a better way to do that.
<P>
It must be borne in mind that fragmented 
work is often ineffective. The work of education authorities often pulls in a different direction to that 
of health authorities, even though they should have the same targets. The different agencies will be 
responsible for the same functions that they carry out now. They will work together, and, in many 
cases, that means that the funds of two organisations will be directed towards their joint objectives, 
instead of being diffused as they are under the present system. That is one of the underlying principles 
of the youth offending team approach.
<P>
Mr. Clappison: I am listening carefully to the Minister's 
courteous reply. As he has mentioned drugs, I want to move away from my earlier point about the 
other authorities that were expected to co-operate with the youth offending team. What is the position 
of voluntary organisations which receive funding to provide services for the treatment and 
rehabilitation of drug offenders? Will he assure the Committee that the funding of such voluntary 
organisations will not be affected by the introduction of this new fund?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am not 
sure that I can give an undertaking about the way in which local authorities or other agencies might 
choose to exercise their responsibilities. I shall respond by using a hypothetical example.
<P>
Let us 
say that a local authority currently gives a grant to a voluntary organisation, which uses educational 
and diversionary programmes to prevent young people from involvement in drugs. In that area, a 
health authority contributes to agencies doing similar work. It might be that both authorities would 
continue their grant aid to those organisations and agencies, and would encourage them to work 
closely with the youth offending team, perhaps by seconding a worker to the team.
<P>
Another 
approach—if the pooled youth offending team budget were adopted—would be for the local authority 
and the health authority to put into the pooled budget their contributions towards the purchase of 
voluntary sector services relating to drug prevention and education. The youth offending team would 
therefore undertake management of that element of the authorities' finances.
<P>
The authorities 
could choose to take that course. However, I should emphasis that the voluntary agencies would not be 
compelled to be involved with the pooled budget, even if the local authority wanted to take that route. 
There would have to be agreement on the matter. That is why I can give only a hypothetical 
response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to put the Minister on the spot. This is a difficult 
financial issue. Does he agree that, in general, the ability of voluntary organisations to deliver services 
locally should be an important consideration for those who make the decisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> 
That is correct. As the Minister with responsibility for the voluntary sector, I feel strongly on that 
point.
<P>
The Government are introducing a compact, which will set out the over-arching principles 
for our relationship with the voluntary sector. We envisage that local authorities will establish a 
similar set of principles. Indeed, many local authorities are keen to move in that direction and are 
interested in the way that such work is developing nationally.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere is 
correct to say that the work should be funded locally. Local authorities must consider carefully the 
allocation of their funds to ensure that they contribute to the long-term health of voluntary 
organisations that are doing such excellent work. That also applies to a number of other agencies; for 
instance, the probation service is required to use a percentage of its expenditure to support voluntary 
organisations that undertake relevant work within particular probation authority areas.
<P>
There is 
no conflict about the matter. That is why I was careful and measured when I said that the 
responsibilities would not change. However, it could be the case that a voluntary organisation that is 
receiving funding, perhaps from three different agencies—may find it convenient to develop one 
relationship with a joint funding body targeted at the work of young people. An organisation focusing 
on a problem, but not specifically as it affects young people, might find that inconvenient. I hope that 
my response to the hon. Gentleman's point is adequate.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 154, in page 26, line 34, after 
'adults', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'who shall be wholly independent persons'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment can be 
explained briefly. It relates to a matter of great interest to many magistrates. Clause 35 places a duty 
on local authorities to ensure the availability of appropriate youth justice services, and requires police, 
probation and health authorities to co-operate with the local authority in ensuring that services are 
available. The Minister has just said something on that subject.
<P>
One of the services to be provided 
is that of people to act as appropriate adults to safeguard the interests of children and young persons 
detained or questioned by police. Amendment No. 154 simply explores the question of the 
independence of the appropriate adult, a matter about which many magistrates are 
concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman who made it clear, in moving the 
amendment, that he wants to explore our position, and I hope that my response will satisfy 
him.
<P>
It is clear in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that a police officer or a person 
employed by the police cannot act as an appropriate adult. The amendment would therefore cause 
difficulties: for example, if workers employed by Barnardos were seconded to the youth offending 
team, would they be regarded as wholly independent in the phraseology of the amendment? Could 
they act as appropriate adults?
<P>
The Government recognises the importance of the role played by 
appropriate adults in safeguarding the interests of juveniles and other vulnerable persons in  police 
custody. An appropriate adult provides support to the child or young person, recognising that he may 
have particular needs while in custody, and provides independent validation of the procedures 
followed during the period of custody. As I said the code of practice for the detention, treatment and 
questioning of persons by police officers made under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 
defines "appropriate adult", in the case of a juvenile, as a parent or guardian, a social work or, failing 
either of those, another responsible adult aged 18 or over who is not a police officer or employed by 
the police. That would exclude a police officer who was a member of a youth offending team from 
acting in such a capacity. It is therefore obvious that the presence of a parent is preferable when a 
child or young person is in police custody. Their presence not only provides a safeguard for the 
juvenile, but underlines their own parental responsibilities.
<P>
When there is a good reason for a 
parent being unable to attend, or unwilling to do so, the prompt provision of another suitable person 
to act as appropriate adult is important to safeguard the interests of the child or young person and to 
enable the police investigation to proceed without delay; but any person acting as an appropriate adult 
must be wholly independent of that investigation. That is clear, without the amendment. The person 
must be able to provide independent advice and support to the child or young person, helping him to 
understand what is happening and the consequences of it and ensuring that interviews are conducted 
properly and fairly.
<P>
The responsibility for arranging the provision of persons to act as responsible 
adults falls on the police. Under the Bill, the provision of persons to act as appropriate adults will in 
future have to be co-ordinated by the youth offending team. That is the only change that the Bill 
makes to the existing arrangements for providing appropriate adults.
<P>
I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman will accept therefore that the requirement of independence is already safeguarded. No 
confusion is caused by the introduction of this part of the Bill. But it would be odd if someone who 
was in every other way an appropriate adult was excluded on the grounds that his membership of the 
youth offending team prevented him from acting as the appropriate adult although in every other 
respect the characteristics of that individual were the same as would have been acceptable under the 
Police and Criminal Evidence Act prior to this legislation. I hope that that reassures the hon. 
Gentleman.
<P>
Mr. Clappison: As the Minister has acknowledged, this is an important issue. Having 
heard his response I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the 
clause, as amended, stand part of the bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall be very brief. We are talking 
about the services that can be provided to help prevent youth offending. There is one important issue 
that I should like to raise briefly which all those concerned with youth justice and those working in 
the youth justice teams would do well to bear in mind, namely the provision of services to deal with 
adolescents who are sex offenders or in danger of becoming sex offenders in later life.
<P>
I raise this 
matter chiefly because it was one which the chief inspector of probation saw fit to highlight in his 
recent report on the work of the probation service. I should like to put on record his comments about 
adolescents whom he described as those between 13 and 17-years-old which is an age group covered 
by the youth offending teams. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The largest and most worrying gap in provision was for 
adolescent sexual offenders, responsibility for whom did not lie solely or principally with the 
probation service. There appeared to be no coherent national strategic approach and in many of the 
areas inspected no provision specifically designed to deal with sex offending by adolescents. This 
meant that opportunities were being lost to intervene at an early stage before sexual offending had 
become entrenched and before further individuals were subjected to the distress and long-lasting 
trauma of victimisation."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I simply invite the Minister's comments on this and on what 
those youth offending teams can do at a local level to provide appropriate services to deal with those 
referred to by the chief inspector of probation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman 
for raising an important point and also for his comments about the report from the inspectorate of 
probation. I am glad that he has paid the same attention to that as I have. It is an excellent report and 
timely in view of a variety of recent cases and concerns. It underlines the role of the probation service 
in protection the public from sex offenders and found that there was a lack of clarity about which 
agency—probation or social services—has responsibility for tackling sex offending by those aged 17 
and under.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman also pointed out, the report found that there was no consistent 
or coherent approach across the country on how to deal with the young sex offenders. It recommended 
that the Home Office should collaborate with the Department of Health to ensure that sexual 
offending by adolescents is effectively addressed through the development of systematic assessment, 
intervention and relapse prevention services. It noted that the current review of the youth justice 
system provides an opportunity to deal with that.
<P>
That is what we propose to do. We are setting 
up an inter-departmental working group to take forward the report's recommendations, including 
those on adolescent sex offenders. We are already taking action through the Bill to clarify 
responsibility for work with this group of offenders.The Bill resolves the problem by ensuring that the 
new multi-agency youth offending teams will deal with all offenders who are under 18. The teams 
will include social workers, probation officers, police officers and health and education staff. 
Therefore, they will bring together those who need to work with offenders who are under 18 from 
arrest to completion, when relevant, of a community or custodial sentence.
<P>
The teams must 
ensure a more consistent and coherent approach to dealing with young people who are convicted of 
violent or sexual offences, from assessment and reports to the court to arrangements for through-care 
and supervision in the community. The youth offending teams will provide a real inter-agency 
approach.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere has, by raising the matter, given a good example of 
the benefits of the clearer focus and inter-agency co-operation that we propose. The hon. Gentleman 
made an important point, but there is no need to amend the clause to achieve the end that he 
described. I am grateful for the opportunity to make it clear that the clause deals with the matter, and 
for the hon. Gentleman's courtesy and the constructive way in which he raised an important 
issue.
<P>
Clause 35 covers the provision of youth justice services for all offenders who are under 18, 
including young sex offenders. We expect the youth offending teams to deal with those 
matters.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 27, line 
42, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(f) a person who appears to the local authority to be experienced in the work 
of voluntary organisations in the local authority's area; and
<P>
(g) a person who appears to the local 
authority to have experience of working with or on behalf of the victims of crime in the local 
authority's area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 357, in page 27, 
line 45, after 'above', insert
<P>
'and bodies representing ethnic minority communities in their 
area'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The clause places a duty on local authorities to establish youth offending 
teams, which will be responsible for the youth justice services that clause 35 sets out.
<P>
Amendment 
No. 156 deals with the membership of the youth offending teams. The Bill requires them to comprise 
a probation office, a social worker, a police officer, a person nominated by the health authority and a 
person nominated by the education authority. The Bill enables local authorities to include "other 
persons" in the teams. The amendment explores the position of two groups under that provision. 
Voluntary organisations play an important role in dealing with young people. Perhaps the Minister 
will tell the Committee that he has voluntary organisations in mind for providing "other persons" as 
members of youth offending teams.
<P>
The amendment also mentions victims. I accept that it may 
be more appropriate to discuss victim participation when we debate the youth justice board under a 
later clause. We shall not stray out of order by advocating victim participation now, but we want to 
ensure that the voice of victims is heard at every appropriate opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendment 
No. 357 also deals with representation on the youth offending teams. We are interested in the 
participation of the groups that the hon. Member for Hertsmere suggested. Amendment No. 357 
would include representatives of ethnic minority communities. There are two principal reasons for 
that. The first is the sheer number of young people from ethnic minority communities who come into 
contact with the criminal justice system. It is well documented that that number is disproportionate in 
relation to the whole community. Secondly, those communities are under-represented on many 
statutory bodies. It is well known, for example, that there are few police officers from ethnic 
minorities in relation to the population as a whole, and that applies to many other statutory bodies 
mentioned in the clause.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The general aim of youth offending teams to consider youth behaviour as a whole 
is commendable and we welcome the introduction of such a holistic approach to youth offending. 
However, many solutions will depend on greater support from the young person's community, and we 
want to ensure that youth offenders are dealt with by genuine representatives of their own community. 
I hope that in his response the Minister will be able to assure us that those issues will be dealt with 
and that guidance will be issued to local authorities. We look forward to hearing the Minister 
elaborate the Government's views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): The key to effective youth 
offending teams is adopting a partnership approach, but the shopping list approach of the 
Opposition—making a list of all who should be involved—may not be the best way to proceed. 
Involving other local authorities, as suggested in subsection (2), is important. In my area, the London 
borough of Barnet is already working with the London borough of Harrow to attempt to establish a 
joint youth offending team. It would not be cost-effective if every authority had to make its own 
separate arrangements.
<P>
The proposed youth offending teams are the outcome of much work—
encompassing caution support, bail support, supervision of offenders' sentences, care work with 
young people in custody or in local authority care, and court work in post-custody supervision—
undertaken in my borough. Several innovative projects are already under way. For example, in 
February this year, the council and Barnet football club started a football project to help young 
offenders into some structured leisure activity. Some 15 young people are already engaged in the 
programme and early progress seems encouraging.
<P>
A specialist group to help female young 
offenders was also started in February, and an anger management programme is about to get off the 
ground, launched in tandem with Middlesex probation service, to work with young people with a high 
risk of reoffending who are currently receiving custodial sentences. The council is also undertaking 
work to recruit specialist foster carers to work with young people on remand—an important and 
worthwhile initiative on which to build.
<P>
As I said the partnership approach is crucial and I know 
that the Middlesex probation service in my area has put in a bid to be part of the youth offending 
teams. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear that in mind when he comes to decide who 
should be on the pilot schemes. Youth offending teams can also provide many complementary 
services—such as drug and alcohol counselling, education and careers advice, employment training, 
leisure opportunities, therapeutic intervention and counselling—working interdepartmentally as 
suggested in the clause.
<P>
Building on the initiative announced earlier this week by my right hon. 
Friend the Prime Minister, youth offending teams can also play an important role in ensuring that 
young offenders who are excluded from school or have bad educational records can receive the 
support services that they need to enable them to go back to full-time education or training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and to the two hon. Gentlemen who have contributed to the 
positive tone of the debate. I am pleased to be able to respond positively to what was said.
<P>
I can 
tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon that we have received expressions of enthusiasm from 
various parts of the country, including his own area, about involvement in pilot projects. What 
happens in those schemes will be important for what will subsequently happen in all areas. For those 
who are unsuccessful, the experience of partnership working will have been valuable and we intend to 
encourage it. The Bill will provide an opportunity for the rapid development of that approach. It will 
not be standing still even for those who are unsuccessful, but I am very pleased to hear about the 
enthusiasm in my hon. Friend's area.
<P>
I would describe the two amendments as pushing at an 
open door and I hope that I can give the hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. 
Allan) the assurances that they want. Amendment No. 156 might well not lead to the result hoped for 
by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. Its requirements might be met through what I should regard as 
less than satisfactory involvement by the local voluntary sector. For instance, the local authority might 
choose a person with experience in the voluntary sector but who was employed professionally in the 
relevant area, or someone with past experience of victims, but who would not by virtue of that fact 
necessarily be fully involved in the voluntary sector at the time or place in question. It would be easy 
to comply with the wording of the amendment while failing to accord with its spirit, which the hon. 
Gentleman clearly explained.
<P>
Voluntary organisations, including those which represent the 
interests of victims of crime, have a significant contribution to make in tackling youth offending. In 
many parts of the country they are substantially involved in work with young offenders. We want such 
co-operation involving voluntary organisations to be part of the new framework for dealing with youth 
offending established under the Bill. However, that will be achieved in different ways in different 
areas and we want maximum flexibility.
<P>
In addition to the requirements for professionals on the 
youth offending team, it would be possible under subsection (5) for it to include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such other 
persons as the local authority thinks appropriate after consulting the bodies mentioned in subsection 
(3)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would allow representatives of voluntary organisations and those who had 
worked with or on behalf of victims to be included in youth offending teams where it was considered 
appropriate locally. We would encourage that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked how the 
arrangements might work. One or more members of the youth offending team might be drawn from 
the voluntary sector. Perhaps a representative would come from an organisation providing bail 
support or doing the work on specified activity programmes that the Bill would require. Alternatively, 
the programme of activities might be provided by a voluntary organisation under a partnership 
arrangement with the local authority or the probation service. Where there was a pooled budget, a 
direct arrangement with the youth offending team could be made.
<P>
Whatever the form of the 
voluntary sector's involvement, it would need to be reflected in the youth justice plan drawn up by the 
local authority under clause 37, covering provision for and funding of youth offending teams and 
youth justice services in the area. Those plans would have to be provided to the youth justice board 
and they would be examined to ensure that there was appropriate voluntary organisation 
involvement.
<P>
The variety of relevant opportunities is extensive. Many voluntary organisations 
have experience in counselling, drug education or work with sex offenders that is not always available 
in the teams from the statutory bodies. Voluntary organisations' contribution—either in providing a 
service or as members of the team—will clearly be considerable. I shall follow with interest the 
development of the voluntary involvement in the pilot projects and subsequently.
<P>
Foyers could 
also make a contribution. Many youngsters who get into trouble with the law have problems related to 
unemployment. They may have come out of care and lack a secure home. A voluntary organisation 
bringing together the responsibilities of two or three local authority departments could play a 
considerable part, particularly where counselling back-up was provided.
<P>
I hope I have made it 
clear that we envisage the youth offending teams giving rise to important and developing involvement 
by the voluntary sector. Many voluntary organisations do not fit simply into the categories of 
education or health. Youth offending
teams will make it easier for them to be involved in the partnership work across the divide between 
local authority and voluntary activities. The matter should not be prescribed in legislation, but be 
decided by local areas. The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that it was a probing amendment, and I 
hope that my response will satisfy him.
<P>
I also hope that I am able to satisfy the hon. Member for 
Halam. He is right to suggest that a youth offending team should reflect the diversity of a local 
community. Very often concerns are expressed about the young men in a community. Only last 
weekend, I discussed the problems posed by young men in the Somali community in my constituency. 
It is important to work with the community as a whole in trying to prevent youngsters from an ethnic 
minority background from drifting into offending. We must also listen to their experiences as victims, 
because the two problems often come together.
<P>
I reflect the undertaking that I gave in respect of 
consultation on crime and disorder strategies. It is important to listen to each part of the community, 
and that applies with equal force to our plans for local arrangements to tackle youth offending. The 
plans of local authorities and other agencies for establishing youth offending teams and ensuring the 
provision of youth justice services should reflect the need to deal properly and fairly with all members 
of a local community. 
<P>
Is it right that local authorities should consider the issue and should be 
required to consult the other agencies that have a duty under the Bill to co-opearate with a local 
authority in establishing youth offending teams and providing youth justice services. They should 
consult and involve representatives of ethnic minority communities, but we do not think that it is 
appropriate for wider consultation to be required by the Bill. The degree of consultation and the 
bodies that should be involved will depend on local circumstances.
<P>
In the debate on crime and 
disorder reduction strategies, I said that our guidance on the strategies would draw specific attention 
to dealing with patterns of crime and disorder as they affect different ethnic groups and that we would 
consider consultation with relevant representative bodies. I give a similar assurance on the guidance 
that we shall publish on establishing youth offending teams. It will underline the importance of 
securing that arrangements for the team and the provision of the youth justice services ensure fair, 
proper and effective treatment of ethnic minority communities and it will advise that consideration be 
given to consulting relevant representative groups. I hope that those assurances will be sufficient to 
satisfy the hon. Member for Hertsmere.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. I 
assure him that the last thing that we want to do is to introduce inflexibility into the arrangements. 
However, I hope that the local authorities will consider carefully the strong case for including 
voluntary organisations in the youth offending teams. As the Minister said, the youth justice board 
will look carefully to ensure that is being done throughout the country. On that basis, I beg to ask 
leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 28, line 37, at end 
insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'including at least one youth panel magistrate and at least one person who appears to the 
Secretary of State to have extensive recent experience of working with or on behalf of the victims of 
crime'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee has heard a little about the youth justice board in relation to its role 
with local youth offending teams. We understand that the youth justice board is at present to have 
mainly advisory and supervisory functions in the sense that it will be responsible for advising, 
monitoring, identifying good practice and so forth. We are also told that it may in due course be given 
responsibility for secure facilities for young offenders. That is an extremely important subject and we 
will watch developments on that front carefully. The provision of appropriate secure facilities for 
young offenders is a subject of the highest importance.
<P>
The Minister told me in a debate on an 
earlier amendment that I was pushing at an open door. I want to push a little more specifically in 
regard to the membership of the youth justice board. If the Government are set upon establishing such 
a body, it is highly desirable that magistrates, in particular youth panel magistrates, and the victims of 
crime should be members of it. I need not press the Minister too much on the subject of youth justice 
panel members, but throughout these proceedings we have been keen to ensure that the voice of the 
victims of crime is heard where it should be heard. This is one of those places.
<P>
We are told that 
the board is to consist of 10, 11 or 12 members. With a membership of that size there should be room 
for at least one voice, if not more, to speak up on behalf of the victims of crime and to give their views 
on youth justice. We will press the Government a little more specifically about their ideas on the 
membership of the youth justice board and the place that victims of crime will have on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I must be careful in responding to this. As the  hon. Gentleman is clearly saying that 
experience as a youth magistrate is valuable and gives authority to an individual engaging with the 
youth justice system, I can hardly disagree with him.
<P>
The Government understand the thinking 
behind the amendment but we do not think that it would be wise to put the provision on the face of the 
Bill. The Bill does not specify that any particular profession, organisation or interest should be 
represented on the board. I do not think that it is appropriate for board members to be seen as 
delegates from any constituency within the youth justice system.
<P>
The particular occupational 
background or experience of a member will be less important than the skills and qualities he or she 
can bring to the board and the relevance of that previous experience. When choosing the members 
much will depend on the quality of the applications. We hope that we will have a wide-ranging 
membership. A person with the specific experience that is sought in the amendment may be among 
those who are seen to be ideal, but it would fetter the discretion to ensure that we get the best range 
and quality of individuals to have such a requirement in the Bill.
<P>
It is important that the board 
should reflect a broad range of skills and experience relevant to its functions as set out in subsection 
(5). The functions require the youth justice board to monitor the operation of the youth justice system 
as a whole and provide advice on that to the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman is right to refer to 
the secure estate. Personally, I hope that the youth justice board will play an important role in 
bringing coherence to that difficult issue. It certainly needs attention.
<P>
Subsection (4) already 
requires that the membership of the youth justice board includes persons with extensive recent 
experience of the youth justice system. The Government intend that experience of how that system 
deals with the victims of crime and the perspective of sentencers on the youth justice system should 
form part of the range of experience and expertise which we want to be reflected in the membership of 
the board. Thus I am not unsympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
The information pack 
sent by the Government to candidates expressing interest in applying for membership of the board 
makes it clear that experience of the courts in dealing with young offenders and of services for victims 
are among the key areas of expertise which we want to be represented. In addition, how the youth 
justice system deals with the victims of crime and whether it safeguards their interests will be an 
important part of the monitoring and advisory role of the board. It will also be important that the 
board can draw on the views of those working within the youth justice system on the operation of that 
system, but we do not consider it appropriate or necessary that any particular area of experience or 
expertise in respect of the youth justice system should be highlighted in the Bill.
<P>
In view of my 
sympathetic response to the hon. Gentleman, I hope that he will not press the amendment to a 
Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Although I did not disagree with the earlier part of the Minister's 
response, I drew more satisfaction from the later part. There is common ground between us that it is 
the extensive recent experience of working with victims of crime that should qualify people for 
membership of the youth justice board.
<P>
The Minister said that the board would have an important 
role in respect of the secure estate. That would be true whether or not it had executive responsibility 
for it. I trail executive responsibility as being an extremely important subject, which we shall discuss 
at a later stage. On the basis of what the Minister has said, especially about the victims of crime, I beg 
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I 
beg to move amendment No. 358, in page 29, line 25, leave out 'extend, restrict or otherwise' and

This is a technical amendment, which amends clause

justice board specified in subsection (5) may add a new function or remove an existing one, as well as 
altering an existing function of the board. By virtue of clause 101(3), such an order will be subject to 
the affirmative resolution procedure. I hope that the Committee will be satisfied that the amendment

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have moved from the 
youth justice board and youth offending teams to a new subject—time limits—which is important in 
its own way. The Opposition share the objective of seeking to reduce delay in the criminal justice 
system and to make it as efficient as possible. My right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for 
the Home Department made our views clear on Second Reading. Despite any legislative changes that 
are required, we also take the view that there is a need continually to promote efficiency and co-
operation between the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts. The Committee may 
know of the Narey report, which was instituted at the end of the previous Government, which 
explored some of those issues.
<P>
The issues that we are discussing today are legislative changes, 
concerning the use of time limits for different stages in proceedings—setting a time limit by which 
each stage of the criminal process has to be completed, the breach of which may lead to sanctions. 
That approach builds on the framework that was established by the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. 
Committee members will, I am sure, have been studying the Bill carefully and will have noticed that 
clause 40 changes large parts of the Prosecution of Offences Act.
<P>
So far, these provisions under 
the Prosecution of Offences Act have been used only to set time limits for defendants who are in 
custody. I have little confidence in venturing that suggestion, but it may be confirmed in due 
course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like confirmation now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I 
am grateful. It is always nice to have confirmation. Time limits have been used for defendants in 
custody because it is important to remove the unfairness of a defendant waiting unnecessarily in 
custody for his or her trial. People should not have to wait in custody for a long time.
<P>
There was 
also provision in that Act to set overall time limits for all types of proceedings, not only those 
involving people in custody, and clause moves into that territory. Amendment No. 163 concerns the 
sanctions that follow from the breach of a time limit. The Minister will know that there is a 
commonality of approach on that, which may help to shorten some of what I might otherwise have to 
say. However, it is important to explore the technical issues, which are important.
<P>
When time 
limits set from charge to appearance in magistrates' courts and so forth are breached, proceedings are 
stayed under the provisions of the Bill. Clause 42 describes the sanction of staying proceedings. The 
Prosecution of Offences Act did not have such a sanction. What is the effect of staying proceedings if 
the time limit is breached? If proceedings are stayed, but the prosecution wants to continue to 
prosecute the charge, the only way in which it can do so is by instituting fresh proceedings after a 
direction. In the case of a Crown court, it would mean referring a voluntary bill of indictment. In the 
case of a magistrates court, it would mean laying an information. To cut out the technicality and 
jargon, this could be described as going back to square one, which we are afraid might happen. We 
are concerned about the length of time that it may take for a new prosecution to be instituted and to go 
through the necessary proceedings. I shall be asking the Minister to give us an indication of the length 
of time that he thinks it will take.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee
