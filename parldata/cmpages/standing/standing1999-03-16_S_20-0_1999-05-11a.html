<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 366, in page 47, leave out lines 24 to 29.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 861, in page 47, leave out lines 30 to 39.
<P>
No. 367, in page 47, leave out lines 40 to 42.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 366 relates to subsection (4), which deals with the matters that the Secretary of State has, and has not, to have regard to in the exercise of this power to provide essential living needs. The Immigration Law Practitioners Association&#151;ILPA&#151;observes that this is yet another clause that is entirely devoid of specific content and that, once again, Parliament is being asked to sign a blank cheque. ILPA has suggested the amendment, which would delete subsection (4).
<P>
Amendment No. 367 was also recommended by ILPA. It deals with a subject that we have touched on already and to which the Minister has given a reply. It relates to how a supported person will meet the expenses of a claim to asylum and any appeals arising from that. I have reflected on the Minister's words and on the clause's contents, and I am not entirely happy with the way that things stand.
<P>
Subsection (6) provides that expenses met in connection with a supported person's asylum appeal will be treated as essential living needs for the purposes of the expenditure cap in subsection (5). Clause 75(1)(c) states that support may be provided
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to enable the supported person to meet what appear to the Secretary of State to be expenses (other than legal expenses or other expenses of a prescribed description) incurred in connection with his claim for asylum and any appeal which may be made in relation to it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, clause 76 states that expenses incurred in connection with a person's claim for asylum and any appeal made in relation to it will be treated as essential living needs unless they are legal expenses or expenses of a prescribed description.
<P>
I have reflected on what the Minister said in an earlier debate, but I am hard put to understand how any of a supported person's expenses in connection with his claim for asylum and any appeal arising out of it should be treated as essential living expenses. We had a long debate on the extent of support that asylum seekers will receive for their essential living expenses. Essential living needs mean food, and it concerns me that the costs of making a claim for asylum or for making an appeal may be deducted from essential living expenses. It is pernicious&#151;to choose a word&#151;for asylum seekers to have to decide between whether to meet the costs of making a claim for asylum or bringing an appeal and feeding and supporting their families.
<P>
ILPA states that the proposal in the clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is pernicious, and would mean, for example, that the claimant called for interview who was housed far from his port of arrival, or whose appeal was heard at a distant location or was subject to adjournments, could find expenditure on his food or other daily needs reduced by the amount of his fares.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 248]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister earlier seemed to row back from that proposal, and said that some of those expenses would not be treated as essential living expenses. However, how can he justify regarding any of those expenses as essential living expenses, especially when they will be deducted from the small sums being provided for essential living needs? I have outlined the meaning of the clause. It is unsatisfactory when a clause provides for one thing, yet the Minister claims that it provides for something else. He is trying to get out of its meaning. I am not happy with the basic principle of the clause, which provides that expenses incurred by a supported person in presenting a claim for asylum or an appeal are to be treated as essential living expenses. Those expenses will come out of the money that asylum seekers receive for food, and to support themselves and their families. I am not happy with that. The Minister should give a clearer justification of the clause and a more detailed explanation of what will constitute expenses under clause 75(1)(c).
<P>
The clause alarmed the Immigration Law Practitioners Association; ``pernicious'' is a good description of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I want to speak to amendments Nos. 366 and 367. The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) presented a good case for those amendments. I also want to speak to amendment No. 861. The amendments go to the heart of an issue that we discussed earlier in our proceedings. The Home Secretary intends to devise an alternative support system instead of choosing the cheap and more straightforward option of the existing benefits system.
<P>
Amendment No. 366 explores the powers under which the Home Secretary will set up the alternative benefits system. Under those powers, the Home Secretary will determine the definition of essential living needs, the costs of which he will cover.
<P>
In amendments that we discussed earlier, we suggested alternative definitions of essential living needs. The Government refused to accept the inclusion of a definition in the Bill. We assume that the Government will define those needs in the regulations. It would help the Committee if the Minister was clearer about them.
<P>
It would be especially helpful if the Minister tackled the cost of clothing, which we discussed earlier. When the Minister considered essential living needs, he seemed to exclude clothing. That is worrying, especially in the context of children. As anyone who has young children knows, children's clothing will probably need to be repaired or replaced even if they are here for only six months. When the Secretary of State uses his powers under clause 74, and when, under clause 76(4)(a), he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must have regard to such matters as may be prescribed'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
he should consider the cost of clothing, especially for children. Perhaps the Minister will explain whether the Government will draw up regulations to cover that.
<P>
Amendment No. 861 would delete subsection (5), which is a dangerous provision whereby the Secretary of State has the power to cap specific portions of income support. The provision constitutes one of the Bill's major contradictions. The Bill does not constrain the Home Secretary by defining the income support system, yet subsection (5) presents a capping system for the amount given to asylum seekers. We assume that the provision refers to the proposed figure of 70 per cent., which is mentioned in the document that the Government published. The Government try to dissociate their system from income support, and claim that it is a separate, temporary arrangement for asylum seekers whose claims will be tackled in six months. Yet the Bill provides for some specific restrictions on the Home Secretary. Earlier, we discussed the provision that restricts payment mainly to vouchers. Subsection (5) provides for a cap. Why does the Home Secretary wish to limit himself through such a power? He continually argues that he wants total flexibility.
<P>
We are worried about the impact of a cap on the asylum seeker if a bad bargain has been struck by the Asylum Support Directorate&#151;that may happen. We heard evidence of the costs of distributing support by this method. Kent County Council in particular believes that it costs 10p more in the pound to give vouchers to asylum seekers rather than cash. I accept that the Asylum Support Directorate will operate on a national rather than a local system, but we believe that it will still cost considerably more in the pound than delivering support through the more straightforward, existing Benefits Agency and cash.
<P>
One problem of a cap may be that, if the costs of administration are higher, the asylum seekers will lose out, through no fault of their own. The cap is set in relation to income support levels, but the Government and everyone accept that the delivery mechanism will be more expensive.
<P>
The Minister has said that many essential needs will be covered by the accommodation costs. We referred earlier to such things as light bulbs. My understanding is that the Asylum Support Directorate will draw up a contract whereby the landlord will come and change the asylum seeker's light bulb instead of the asylum seeker going to the shop and buying it because that is not included in essential, living needs. However, if some of the needs that are supposed to be covered in the accommodation package are not covered, and the cap proposed in subsection (5) is in place, the asylum seeker will lose out because it will be impossible to reflect the fact that his essential living needs package is in some way above that which others require.
<P>
On amendment No. 367, the point was well made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere that we do not wish people to have to choose between exercising their legal rights and receiving other essential living needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Feeding their family.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Or feeding their family&#151;that is precisely the point. Amendment No. 367 tries to explore a subsection that seems to have that effect.
<P>
As this is a significant collection of powers, the Minister must spell out where he intends to go, but he must be clearer about the relationship between essential living needs and income-related or capped support, which seems to us anomalous in the context of a general support system in which the Government are trying to deny any connection to normal Benefits Agency support methods.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Hertsmere describe the clause as pernicious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is ILPA's description.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> But the hon. Gentleman said that he agreed. When listening to his synthetic outrage, I am reminded of his vote for the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, which removed all support for asylum seekers pursuing appeals. He may well laugh, but when he complains about people having to choose between travelling to their appeal and buying food, he must remember that, under the Act for which he voted, they would have got neither the travel costs to their appeal nor their food. Therefore, when he starts to describe the provisions in the Bill as pernicious, I wonder how he would describe the legislation that his party put in place, which would have removed all support for asylum seekers and their families in relation to their appeal, and to travel, clothing and other costs. Let us have fewer synthetic outrages from the hon. Member for Hertsmere and perhaps a little more contrition.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's first comment, which I think he again quoted from ILPA, was that the clause was a blank cheque. It is not a blank cheque, because the rules will be subject to parliamentary approval. We make no excuse for taking a power here. The subordinate legislation will give detailed clarity to what would be a wide discretion if it were set out in the Bill. It will also allow flexibility to change the scheme, as we learn from experience.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We want to consult widely with various groups, as we have throughout our debate on the Bill, and ensure that we listen carefully to what they say. Again as we have shown throughout discussion of the Bill, we are prepared to revise specific issues. We certainly want full consultation on the way in which the support system will work.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 366 and 861 would limit the way in which the Secretary of State may decide how to meet the essential living needs of asylum seekers under part VI. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) returned to the debate on the definition of essential living needs, and he wants to me to go back down the route that we have already traversed on that definition. I have already pointed out the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman encountered in trying to make that definition.
<P>
I repeat what I said to the hon. Gentleman earlier, that a set of conditions will govern how the scheme should operate. However, we are not going to go down the narrow route that the hon. Gentleman suggests. We need to take into account the personal circumstances of asylum seekers and the fact that they are likely to be in the country for only a few months. They will either be recognised as refugees&#151;conferring full access to the benefits system, the right to work and other refugee provisions&#151;or, if not, they will be removed. Asylum seekers will generally be provided with fully equipped accommodation, which is an important offer by the state to ensure that they will not have to meet many of the costs facing other people on income support.
<P>
It is worth comparing the support for asylum seekers now with their support under our system, taking into account the operation of the income support system. Comparison is important. The current system is ad hoc and varied in its application among local authorities. People in some areas do better than others. Some provision is not so good; some better elsewhere. We are seeking to put a national system in place, taking the burden off local authorities, many of which find it difficult to cope&#151;especially if they have to make special provision for a small number of asylum seekers. The national system will allow them to be dealt with on a national basis.
<P>
The effect will be that some people will be somewhat better off than they are under the local authority system, though&#151;arguably&#151;not as well off as those in the income support system who are awaiting an initial decision. Nevertheless, in many cases, asylum seekers will be better off than those in the appeals system&#151;port applicants and people who have applied in country. The system that we are creating will be somewhat better, but the hon. Member for Hallam has always been an advocate of the benefits system&#151;an honourable position, which others may well adopt.
<P>
The Government have set out their position on the benefits system very clearly. The Conservatives introduced changes in 1996 and the fall of 14,320 applicants that year&#151;spread across 27 of the 35 major nationalities&#151;shows that those changes had an impact. The main fall in applications was from those in some African states, which was down by 11,255, and from Asia, down by 2,800. That is unlikely to have been caused by changes within the individual states, which are so diverse. It is more likely that developments in the United Kingdom were responsible.
<P>
The peak in applications of approximately 4,715 in November 1995 coincides roughly with the announcement in October 1995 of changes in benefits for asylum seekers. Applications fell consistently from that time until June 1996. The announcement of the withdrawal of benefits from a great proportion of people applying in-country was clearly reflected in a fall in such applications, from double the number of port applications in the first 10 months in 1995 to approximately the same from mid-1996 onwards. So it is clear that the fall in applications at that time was affected by the changes in the benefits regime that the Conservatives introduced.
<P>
People who are genuinely fleeing for their lives come not for benefits but for protection, shelter, food and help, all of which we will provide. Such people will not be deterred from seeking protection by changes in the benefits system. However, people who do not apply are usually those whose application would most likely be rejected because it breached immigration controls.
<P>
We want the need for cash and vouchers to meet medium-term expenses, to be limited. When deciding on support, we want to take account of people's likely needs. We do not wish to be constrained now to a particular approach, which would be the effect of amendment No. 366. We shall set out in detail how we see the support system developing, learning from experience and from the needs of asylum seekers as we go, and investigating what would be effective in supporting them adequately and properly. Subsection (4) gives us the discretion that we need.
<P>
The Government consider the link to the amount of income support benefits to be generally quite helpful. We do not intend to apply the income support figure, which, as the hon. Member for Hallam knows, is 90 per cent. We feel that the provision should be 70 per cent., and we are monitoring carefully the development of consultations. In our view, there is no direct parallel with the needs of people who receive income support who live permanently in the United Kingdom and those who come on a temporary basis as asylum seekers, because asylum support benefits do not cover some of the items that a person on income support would be expected to meet from his own resources. There is an indication of the basic amount of income support that a person in this country needs to get by in the medium term, on a temporary basis. I hardly need remind hon. Members that were we to provide a significantly higher amount of benefit for asylum seekers, many of whom would be shown to have made unfounded claims, we would, I suspect, be criticised by some constituents for showing favouritism. The amendment's effect would be that people seeking asylum would receive a package, which included an offer of furnished accommodation, with all heating, lighting and other costs paid for, plus financial support&#151;some vouchers, some cash&#151;and, if the hon. Member for Hallam had his way and we included the other accommodation benefits, support would probably exceed that given to people with the right to be here on a permanent basis who claim income support.
<P>
I am a little surprised that hon. Members want to remove the regulation-making powers, which would be the effect of amendment No. 366. The advantage of our approach is that, in cases of doubt especially, it would make clear which matters are taken into account when provision is made for essential living needs.
<P>
I come to amendment No. 367. Clause 75(1)(c) sets out other costs that asylum seekers may incur in connection with their claim, such as postage stamps, telephone calls and travelling expenses. An asylum seeker currently on income support has to meet those costs out of his benefit. Clause 75(1)(c) allows for such expenses to be provided and clause 76(6) places them generally within the envelope of benefits defined in subsection (5). We do not envisage a separate allowance for such expenses, although we may pay travelling costs for someone to attend asylum interviews with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and appeals at the appeals authority. The purpose of clause 76(6) is to allow account to be taken of such expenses by reference to income support; amendment No. 367 would prevent such a limit being imposed. The Secretary of State cannot be expected to pay unlimited sums of money&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a moment. The Secretary of State cannot be expected to pay unlimited sums of money to help asylum seekers meet the non-legal expenses of their claims as the amendment proposes.
<P>
The cost of administering vouchers will not be offset against the so-called cap on the level of benefits under subsection (5). The purpose of the provision is to establish a principle for a proper level of support. If we were to start off paying asylum seekers more, it could surpass what local people on social security benefits have to manage on, especially if one adds back the cost of utilities which we will provide in kind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I seek clarification of the Minister's statement that the Government may pay the costs incurred by asylum seekers travelling to interviews in connection with their claims or appeals. He used the word ``may''. Does he mean that the support system may pay asylum seekers to travel in connection with their claims and appeals and that the money will therefore come out of their essential living expenses?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The aim if to provide a system within which asylum seekers can make applications for needs in respect of legal necessities. They would be allowed to claim travel expenses for attending an interview at the IND. ``May'' means that we will be allowed to reimburse asylum seekers; the travel money would be in addition to essential living expenses. For example, let us suppose that someone located in Manchester had to travel to Croydon for an interview. He would apply to the asylum directorate for a one-off payment, probably a rail voucher, to cover the costs of his journey. We have the power to allow such a payment, but we are not committing ourselves always to providing it.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman knows from earlier debates, some asylum seekers will not need such support because they are quite wealthy, and come to this country with considerable sums of money. We are creating a safety net for those who do not have those resources. Those who are near to destitution, within the fairly broad terms that we have set, will be able to apply for funding if they have a long journey to Croydon to attend an interview, or if they have to travel a substantial distance to attend an appeal hearing. However, we hope that they will meet the cost of short journeys themselves. We would consider granting them an extra sum for a long journey which would have a significant impact on their available resources.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister said that support may be given to the person travelling from Manchester to Croydon. Can I put it to him that that would not then be treated as support for the purposes of clause 76(6)? If that is the case, could he give me an example of the sort of expenses in connection with a claim that will be treated as essential living expenses under clause 76(6), after support has been given under clause 75(1)(c)?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I think I followed the hon. Gentleman's question. The Secretary of State will have a discretion over how the provision is applied. Therefore, we will be able to consider going above the cap where appropriate. Where necessary, using the discretion in subsection (5), the Secretary of State can exceed the cap. However, we need to have the principle of a cap to ensure that there is no waste. Subsection (6) includes postage, documentation and possibly travel. We have adopted a belt-and-braces approach here to cope with the variety of circumstances that may arise.
<P>
No one here seeks to make the circumstances of asylum seekers more onerous or difficult than is necessary to deter abusive asylum seekers. We are not providing all the access to the benefit system that the hon. Member for Hallam, although not the hon. Member for Hertsmere, seeks, but we are providing a basic package of support that is available to families and individual asylum seekers. We believe that it will be sufficient to enable them to pursue any asylum claim properly. We are putting it in the context of speeding up the whole system so that asylum claims are considered properly.
<P>
Once people have been accepted into the process, we want to create circumstances in which they can property pursue their asylum claim without having a lot of cash in hand. If they need to travel and if they meet the financial and other criteria, we want the power to enable them to travel to make a claim, to go for an interview or to go for an appeal. That is for a specific, and normally one-off purpose. We will have the ability to make regulations to deal with that.
<P>
We also want to ensure that if other issues need to be addressed we will learn from the experience of supporting the asylum seekers. We want the power here to be broad enough to give us enough discretion to amend the regulations to cope with problems that arise. The provisions must also be clear enough so that Parliament knows what we intend in so far as we can set it out at this stage. I am trying to be as clear as I can with hon. Members about what we propose. We have put out a public consultation document. The objective now is to ensure that we will put in place the detailed regulations that will set out how it will affect the individuals who will be subject to it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam asked me whether clothing and shoes can be replaced. We are providing asylum seekers with funding that is 20 per cent. less than they would get if they were on income support because they would get 90 per cent. on income support. Unlike other income support provisions, it includes all heating and lighting costs, if they are not part of the accommodation package.
<P>
Therefore, we believe that asylum seekers will be able to replace their clothing or shoes. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that they should be able to buy the lastest and most expensive Reebok trainers: the provision is not designed to cover that. However, it will give asylum seekers a level of support which is not too dissimilar from that which is available to people on income support. Therefore, should asylum seekers need to replace clothing or shoes, they will be able to buy those items, as they will not have to meet the costs of their heating, lighting, gas, rent and so on.
<P>
No doubt, the hon. Gentleman knows that people who are on 90 per cent. income support sometimes have limited housing benefit, especially if they live in London. Such people may well meet part of their rental costs from their income support. However, they are expected to meet the costs of replacing clothing and shoes and many other costs that our package will meet directly.
<P>
So the hon. Gentleman is overdoing the idea that asylum seekers will be on a less sufficient provision than those currently on income support. He must be careful, as the level of income support is never generous, even if paid at 100 per cent. We certainly do not claim that we are providing a generous package, but it must be seen as a whole and in that respect it is adequate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for attempting to clarify the matter, although his answer was depressing.
<P>
The Minister proposes that asylum seekers will have their income support cut from 90 per cent. to 70 per cent. He is offering heating and utilities costs&#151;which are only about 5 per cent.&#151;so asylum seekers are having their income support cut by 15 per cent.
<P>
Will vouchers be redeemable against clothing, shoes and so on? I belieive that the cash element will be rapidly used up on other cash products.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The vouchers will be redeemable against clothing or shoes that asylum seekers may wish to buy from supermarkets or other chains supplying those items. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that many large supermarkets sell such items. We will negotiate with the large chains to ensure that the use of vouchers is acceptable.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman says that the support will be cut. He is referring to a cut in support, should someone currently be on income support. However, many asylum seekers are not on income support, but are governed by the provisions of the 1996 Act, which&#151;I am sure the hon. Gentleman agrees&#151;are completely inadequate and shambolic. Local authorities are doing their best, but it was never intended that the Children Act 1989&#151;which was often applied&#151;or the National Assistance Act 1948 would be used in such a way.
<P>
Therefore, we must examine the matter in the round, rather than attempt a rather spurious definition of the cut. The hon. Gentleman alleges that the cut will be equivalent to 5 per cent. However, it will be equivalent to more than that, as heating and weekly utility costs will add about &#163;7 per person, which is about 20 per cent. of income support for under-25s.
<P>
We can play with the figures as much as the hon. Gentleman wishes. However, his 5 per cent. figure and his attempt to measure a 15 per cent. cut are highly dubious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's attempt at a careful explanation. I shall draw a veil over his comments on the 1996 Act. It is always good to resist&#151;[Interruption.] Well, if I am to be provoked, I shall just say that the Minister's comments would have been slightly more convincing if large parts of the 1996 Act had not been re-enacted in the Bill and if he had not relied on them in his argument against the Liberal Democrats. However, I shall not be dragged down that road.
<P>
It is important to read the provisions in these clauses. Clause 75(1)(c) allows the supported person to be provided with support
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to meet what appear to the Secretary of State to be expenses (other than legal expenses or other expenses of a prescribed description) incurred in connection with his claim for asylum and any appeal which may be made in relation to it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the Secretary of State may provide support for that purpose. However, if he does, clause 76(6) states that any support of that kind
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is to be treated as if it were the provision of essential living needs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the support that the Secretary of State provides to someone to bring an asylum claim or any appeal will come off the essential living needs in the cap. Such support will be treated as essential living needs along with food and other everyday expenses.
<P>
The Minister says that the Secretary of State will have a lot of discretion. To be fair, we do not know what the prescribed description mentioned in clause 75(1)(c) will be. We know that legal expenses will not be included, but many other expenses could be incurred. The Minister gave the example of someone travelling from Manchester to Croydon, and he said that the Secretary of State may provide support to a person in that position. If he decides to provide such support, will that be treated as an essential living need for the purposes of clause 76(6)?
<P>
<b>Mr. O'Brien</b> indicated dissent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is the meaning of the Bill, because clause 76(6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any support of a kind falling within section 75(1)(c) is to be treated as if it were the provision of essential living needs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If such support is treated as an essential living need, the cost of getting from Manchester to London would blow almost everything that an asylum seeker would receive for a week. On my calculations, a couple will receive &#163;78.05. It would be very difficult not to blow all that on the fare from Manchester to Croydon. Even by the cheapest route possible, the journey involves two rail journeys and travel by tube, so I do not imagine that one would get much change out of &#163;78.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 74 enables the Secretary of State to provide for essential living needs and clause 76 says that he will be able to provide funding that will be treated as that. However, there is discretion in the provisions for exceeding the cap and large travel expenses will be considered as an exception to the cap if they are incurred for the purposes that I have described.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is a lawyer, and I understand why he has read the clause in a certain way. The parliamentary draftsman reads it somewhat differently. He believes that the Secretary of State can make prescriptions for making payments and will be able to exceed the cap in order to provide essential living needs. That support may go well beyond the provisions if, for example, we choose a level of 70 per cent.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is caught on a technicality. He has suggested that the Bill will prevent us from making one-off payments for travel expenses, whereas the parliamentary draftsman has assured us that, under these provisions, we can make those payments. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point. Following his logic, I can see why he has arrived at his conclusion, but it is a misreading of the Bill and the way in which it will operate.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> With respect, I do not think that it is a misreading. It is what the Bill says. The Minister is saying that he will rely on the Secretary of State's discretion to override what is on the face of the Bill. I am not sure that this is a happy situation. What worries me is the use of the word ``any'' in subsection (6):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any support of a kind falling within section 75(1)(c) is to be treated as if it were the provision of essential living needs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The only way out of that is if it relates to expenses that may be prescribed, but we do not know what those will be. That is what the Bill says. It may be a technicality to read the Bill and give it its ordinary meaning, but that is what the Bill says and how ILPA has interpreted it.
<P>
I invite the Minister to consider IPLA's submission to the Committee. It says that subsection (6)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Provides that expenses met in connection with a support person's asylum appeal are to be treated as essential living needs for the purposes of the expenditure cap under 75(5). This is pernicious''.&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 248.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to give examples of cases in which it would be pernicious. I welcome what the Minister said about discretion, but I am not happy to be told that we must rely on the Secretary of State's discretion to override what is in the Bill and give the clause its ordinary meaning.
<P>
I simply repeat my initial argument. I find it difficult to put supported people in the position of having to choose between bringing their claim or their appeal and feeding themselves or their families, which the Bill makes them do. They will know that if they claim expenses in connection with bringing their appeal and the Secretary of State does not exercise his discretion to pay them, but treats them as falling within the cap, the sum concerned comes off their essential living expenses pound for pound. That is what the Bill says and that is how ILPA has interpreted it. I consider that to be an unhappy state of affairs.
<P>
We have spent some time debating the provision and I hope that the Minister has taken the point. Will he look at it again in the light of the ILPA submission? The Minister is moving in the right direction, but he still has a long way to go. He must ensure that people will not have to choose between bringing their claim and their appeal and feeding themselves and their families. People with families may think ``I don't mind going hungry myself, but do I want my children to go hungry?''
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): That is right. The Bill is concerned with families and children, and it is difficult to expect one's children to do what adults will do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I welcome what the Minister has said, but it is at odds with the Bill. He is setting more store by the exception and the discretion than by the content of the Bill. I appeal to the Minister's better nature, and I know that he has a better nature. I ask him to look at the clause again and think about what ILPA has said, perhaps consulting it if necessary, and produce something better than this which will not apparently put parents and families in the dilemma that I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman repeated the phrase about choosing between feeding children and pursuing a claim, and again I repeat my reference to his vote on the 1996 Act which denied them the ability to do either. However, let us not get into that argument.
<P>
There is a discretion to limit the cap. Big travel expenses will be considered as an exception to the cap. The hon. Gentleman is aware of Pepper v. Hart. I make it clear that that is how we intend the Bill to be interpreted. The discretion in the Bill is as plain as a pikestaff. Subsection (5) contains the word ``may'', which is clearly a power giving discretion to the Home Secretary, and I have said how that discretion can be used.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and ILPA are misreading the provisions. They have not understood that clause 74 confers a particular power, which is further described in clause 75, and that clause 76 sets out the detail of how the regulations will operate. If those clauses are read together, the effect becomes clear.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman obviously has a different interpretation and I can follow his logic. However, I was initially perfectly clear about the meaning of the provisions, the policy and what the wording was intended to achieve. If it proves necessary to amend the wording for technical reasons, we are prepared to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister at least for that. I hope that he will consult ILPA: my arguments were based on the expert analysis of the immigration lawyers. I shall not press the Minister too hard, as he has agreed to consider the issue further.
<P>
I want to return to travel expenses. I chose the most extreme example&#151;as one often does for the sake of argument&#151;and pointed out that someone travelling from Manchester or Leeds to Croydon would blow nearly all his weekly income. What might be a small travelling expense for us could, for supported persons, be a large proportion of their income. Travelling by train just from central London to Croydon could take out 10 per cent. of a supported person's weekly income. I ask the Minister to cast his net slightly wider than big train journeys and consider the problem from the perspective of the supported person.
<P>
In order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Something should be said about clause 76. The Minister's final comments were revealing in demonstrating how far the Government have travelled in the direction of praising the 1996 Act and its impact. The Minister referred to the Act's success in deterring asylum seekers from making claims in this country. That sent me into a looking-glass world in terms of trying to work out from which side the comments were coming. The Government seem perfectly content to cut the 90 per cent. income support level&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> May I make it clear that I do not praise the 1996 Act, which removed all benefits from asylum seekers? Indeed, I condemn that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, but the Government are applying the same logic to the potential beneficial effects of moving away from a cash-based system. They have been explicit about the virtues of a voucher system. We have been told that asylum seekers cannot use the cash-based system because the voucher-based system more effectively deters people from entering this country and making unfounded claims. The Minister cited the 1996 Act&#151;after the courts had ruled in favour of a voucher system&#151;and quoted figures to demonstrate its effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is aware that the voucher system developed not as a result of the provisions of the 1996 Act, but after court decisions to the effect that the intentions of the Act&#151;and the Government who introduced it&#151;were unreasonable. It was decided that the intentions could not be those of a reasonable Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> In order not to be inaccurate, let me say that the Minister was praising the beneficial deterrent effects of the 1996 Act, as interpreted by the courts, in providing a voucher system, while maintaining his fundamental opposition to the 1996 Act itself when it came before the House. That is an important distinction. However, the Minister is content to cut support from 90 per cent. of income support to 70 per cent. and has raised the spectre of the problem that could be caused if an asylum seeker were perceived to receive more than someone on income support.
<P>
From recent experience I would query that. It has a lot to do with the public attitude at the time. A place for Kosovan refugees is being set up in my constituency. My mother goes up there regularly to report on progress. Offers of support are flooding in even though people are perfectly aware that those Kosovans will be on income support. They do not seem to have a problem with the fact that these individuals will receive a comprehensive package.
<P>
The question is whether one is responding to a public conception that the vast majority of asylum seekers are scroungers who should be deterred by being treated in a way that is less than satisfactory, or whether one is prepared to treat all asylum seekers in the period before a judgment has been made in a genuinely humane way and accept that at the end of that process a proportion of them will have to leave. I accept that a judgment has already been made in the case of the Kosovans by giving them exceptional leave to remain.
<P>
I am not sure that my constituents are sitting there calculating the cost of the support package and feeling that an individual would be over-generously treated if his total support package worked out at a few pounds more than income support for those six months if at the end of that period he is to be removed from the country because his claim was unfounded. That period of up to six months on a slightly better than income support level followed by administrative removal is not something that my constituents who are income support would envy but they would accept that it could happen. The public climate is important in terms of the context of how we provide the support.
<P>
The clause seems flawed from the very beginning. Clause 76(1)(a) says that the whole basis of the support system is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the accommodation is to be temporary pending the determination of the asylum-seeker's claim''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister has continually stressed the fact that the whole basis of the package depends on it being temporary and that is the justification for these levels of income support and for not including certain items. We have referred repeatedly to the situation at the IND. We heard compelling evidence from the unions that suggests that the backlog will continue to grow.
<P>
Many of the earlier attempts to reform the appeals system failed comprehensively. There were reforms under the previous Government throughout the 1990s: they set out to reform the appeal system, put targets in place and comprehensively failed to meet them. We may face the same prospect. I hope that we do not, but all the evidence suggests that we will fail to meet the six-month target. In that case, clause 76(1)(a), the whole foundation of this support system will be flawed from the beginning.
<P>
The second major flaw is in subsection (1)(b) which states that the support system will be based on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the desirability, in general, of providing accommodation in areas in which there is a ready supply of accommodation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That effectively means providing accommodation in undesirable areas. By definition, areas where there is a ready supply of accommodation are areas where no one else wishes to live. We shall move into the detail of this when we discuss how local authorities will make the accommodation available, but there is a major problem there which may be exacerbated by the current situation. The less undesirable accommodation in areas such as mine will be taken up rapidly over the next few months, quite properly, for a particular refugee problem that has arisen. Tens of thousands of places could be taken up by Kosovans, yet if they stay for a while the area where there is a ready supply of accommodation will be shunted further and further into the netherlands where no one else wishes to live.
<P>
Subsection (1) is flawed in its inception. The Minister knows that we oppose this part of the Bill in principle, but the subsection gives me no comfort at all. The only useful concession we have had concerns the travel costs but that still leaves us with the question of the extra bureaucracy that will be needed. The Asylum Support Directorate will have a hell of a job on its hands. Kent county council has wished it luck because it found the situation difficult to deal with it on a local authority basis. The nationalised Asylum Support Directorate will arrange contracts for the replacement of light bulbs and household utensils in accommodation from Glasgow to Penzance and try somehow to administer it and check up on it, as well as having to process individual travel claims from people attending interviews. While it is proper that people get the additional support, all this is starting to add up to a significant work package for the Asylum Support Directorate, and I suspect that the system will be extremely costly. The Bill provides for capping, and for limited budgets. If the system proves too costly, asylum seekers will suffer as the amount of direct support that they receive is reduced. The Government are capping the total amount that will be spent while planning to spend X thousands of pounds processing travel claims from people who they will send to various parts of the country and who will have to make the journey to Croydon.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 76 generally, and our debates about it, add to my fears about the proposed system. The Government will not be allowed to get off the hook by claiming that the 1996 Act was much worse, and completely different. This is a nationalised version of the system introduced after the 1996 Act and the court judgements. It will be no significant improvement for asylum seekers already here and it may bring about additional hardship for a new category of people.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I did not vote for the 1996 Act so I feel able to comment on clause 76. It touches on a vexed issue in my part of London&#151;accommodation. I know what I know about the pressure on housing in inner cities throughout the country, and the clause gives rise to concern on account of some of the issues that it raises.
<P>
Clause 76(1)(a) provides that the Secretary of State must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the fact that . . . accommodation is . . . temporary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not clear about the meaning of that. I suspect that it means that the quality of accommodation provided does not have to be as good as permanent accommodation. That is worrying. Some of the accommodation of a permanent nature that is offered to my constituents is poor enough. It is wholly unacceptable that asylum seekers are to be offered accommodation that is even below that standard because it is deemed to be temporary. The Government's claim to be able to complete asylum applications in two months, and claims and appeals in six months, is built on sand. I will not weary the Committee with the details of the claims backlog at Lunar house which has been climbing recently rather than reducing.
<P>
Clause 76(1)(b) is bizarre. It refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the desirability, in general, of providing accommodation in areas in which there is a ready supply of accommodation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does that mean? There is a ready supply of accommodation in Belgravia but I do not imagine that Ministers will send refugees there. What it really means is areas where there is a ready supply of dirt cheap accommodation. Where is such accommodation to be found? It is in areas where other people do not wish to live. I am taking of estates throughout the country where people cannot be persuaded to take up accommodation because of crime and desolation and a lack of transport links. Subsection (1)(b) refers to sink estates which have no transport or community facilities where no one else will live, but, if the provision can be taken to mean anything, it is to such places that asylum seekers will be sent.
<P>
Under subsection (2)(a), the Secretary of State may not have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any preference that the supported person or his dependants . . . may have as to . . . locality''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have never seen such a provision in any housing legislation with which I have been associated since becoming a Member of Parliament. For asylum seekers coming from abroad who are on the Government's support system, so will be living on 70 per cent.&#151;or 90 per cent., as the Minister now tells me&#151;income support, the most important thing is contact with the extended family, with people from their village, or with people whom they know. However, the Bill contains a provision which states that that precise preference cannot be taken into account.
<P>
As a result, we will submit asylum seekers to poverty and&#151;if the Bill's reference to housing means what it says&#151;to physical isolation. We may also ensure that asylum seekers are cut off from their faith community, their extended family and their village community, all of which provide important economic and psychological support.
<P>
Those who work with asylum seekers say that many of them are now showing symptoms of psychological distress. I can think of nothing calculated to create more psychological distress than isolating people on a sink estate far from anyone who speaks their language or knows their community, and expecting them to live on the levels of support suggested by Ministers.
<P>
The provisions are an extraordinary part of a regrettable Bill, so I could not let a vote on clause 76 take place without raising such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I shall deal first with the matters raised by the hon. Member for Hallam.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am not praising the 1996 Act or the local authority system which introduced vouchers. Indeed, that system needs to be changed, which is why we are changing it.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about the Government having an asylum seeker-scrounger agenda. He well knows that that is not our position, nor has it been in the past. Over the two years that we have been in office, the number of people recognised as refugees has increased, as has the number of people granted ELR. People are received favourably when they have a good cause and good reason for being here.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman appears to suggest that there are no asylum seekers abusing the system. However, he knows as well as I do that some asylum seekers make abusive claims. Indeed, he is indicating that he agrees with that.
<P>
The Bill is all about restoring integrity to the asylum system, which is currently a shambles. Abusive asylum seekers are the worst enemy of genuine refugees. When I drew attention to the 1996 Act, I highlighted the clear and incontrovertible fact that a change in the benefit rules impacted on those seeking to make claims.
<P>
However, that does not mean that what happened under the 1996 Act was right. I voted against that Act, and would vote against its type of provisions again. I did not support the Act's provisions on the removal of benefits. However, some of its provisions have merit, as do other measures.
<P>
Evidence relating to the 1996 Act suggests that there is a level of abuse which will be raised by restoring benefits. We are not taking up the Liberal Democrat position as to do so would undermine the integrity of the asylum system, raise the level of abuse within it and diminish public support for genuine refugees.
<P>
The British people have a warm heart for genuine refugees, as they have shown with the Bosnians and are now showing with the Kosovans. The Government wish to ensure that we give a warm reception to genuine refugees who need our help. However, we must also ensure that our asylum system does not take advantage of the warm heart of the British people. People in my north Warwickshire constituency rightly want to help those in genuine need, but they are not prepared to have their hospitality and good will abused, as has happened all to often in the past.
<P>
We must restore public support for refugees, which has been undermined by unacceptable levels of abuse. Therefore, we must create an asylum system which does not restore benefits to the level sought by Liberal Democrat Members. Such restoration would have the opposite effect to that intended and would undermine the integrity of the asylum system.
<P>
Let me deal with accommodation. Under present arrangements, asylum seekers tend to congregate in London and the south east, where they put substantial pressure on the stock of accommodation. They often end up in sub-standard or expensive accommodation. Increasingly, they put pressures on the supply of accommodation needed for local homeless families. The London Research Centre attributes part of the increase in the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless households to that cause. Yet, nationally, there is no shortage of accommodation. The latest Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions figures suggest that there are approximately 750,000 empty homes in England alone. We want to use some of the available accommodation. Most of it is outside the south east; we expect to relocate most asylum seekers outside that area. Subsection (1)(b) provides for that. It is inevitable that using accommodation in the midlands and the north will not fulfil the expectations of all asylum seekers, especially those whose motives owe more to desire for economic gain rather than desire for safety. We shall not provide for them to pick and choose their destinations. We are committed to providing proper support pending the outcome of asylum applications. Genuine asylum seekers' prime concern will be the speedy outcome of their applications, not where they live in the interim.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall give way in a moment, after I have tackled my hon. Friend's points.
<P>
No existing regimes, such as that under the National Assistance Act 1948, or those under homelessness legislation, allow choice. All operate on the basis of one offer.
<P>
We shall establish a new and separate welfare system that will provide basic but decent support for destitute asylum seekers. Clearly, we shall take account of asylum seekers' needs when calculating the support that is due to them. However, we must also consider what is provided under the domestic benefits regime.
<P>
The asylum seekers support information document, which we published in March, suggests that support will be set at 70 per cent. of income support levels. However, a direct comparison cannot be made because asylum seekers will not pay for specific items, such as the cost of utilities, out of that figure. We aim to provide basic support that will meet asylum seekers' needs for the brief period when they are supported under the new arrangements.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) makes derogatory remarks about the idea that accommodation will be temporary. She claims that temporary means lower quality. It means no such thing. Temporary simply means ``not permanent''. It refers to the sort of accommodation that will adequately house people while their claims are being considered. The arrangements will include systems of contracting and quality control.
<P>
The arrangements may well provide for better accommodation than that of some asylum seekers in parts of my hon. Friend's constituency. Accommodation outside London is often less expensive, simply because it is not in London. It is not of lower quality. If my hon. Friend visits North Warwickshire, she could find excellent accommodation for the price that is charged for a small flat in Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. If she travels further north perhaps to Sheffield, to the constituency of the hon. Member for Hallam, the cost of accommodation is less, while its quality is greater than accommodation of the same price in London.
<P>
My hon. Friend rightly claims that we are trying to find more cost-effective accommodation. However, that does not mean that it will necessarily be of a lower quality. It means that we will be able to provide suitable temporary accommodation for people who will be given furniture, cooking facilities and utensils such as kettles. Our intentions are clear; the hon. Lady's criticisms do us an injustice.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend that asylum seekers' main concern is not the location of their accommodation but how quickly their claim is dealt with. However, something that is even more important to an asylum seeker is his personal safety. I am aware of the pressure on my constituents and I accept that I should be grateful that asylum seekers are shovelled here, there and everywhere. However, I am anxious that although they may have better accommodation than they would have in Hackney or in inner-city Birmingham, they will not feel safe in other places and will therefore beg, steal and borrow their way back to my constituency, where they will be destitute.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There is a danger in the hon. Lady's argument, which has been advanced by several organisations. I was concerned in earlier sittings that there was a metropolitan arrogance about the safety issue. As the hon. Member for Hallam will testify, people have been going to the Leeds and Bradford area and to my constituency in the west midlands in safety for many years. They are probably at less risk of attack from vicious, frightening racist thugs than they would be in London. Some of the provincial cities and metropolitan areas are probably much safer than the constituency of the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. I suspect that a comparison of the relevant crime records and figures for racist attacks would show that to be the case.
<P>
We accepted recommendations for cluster areas made during consultation. The voluntary agencies are trying to accommodate the Kosovans in cluster areas in the north and in Scotland so that they have support from their local community. It is easier to meet people's needs for language support, for example, and to help them with problems resulting from their being traumatised if, like the Kosovans, they are accommodated in cluster areas. I am not aware of any criticism of the way in which that has been done; the matter has been handled exceptionally well. We must guard against metropolitan arrogance&#151;the attitude that if it is not in London, it is not good.
<P>
As Minister with responsibility for race equality I have met many race equality councils throughout Britain, many of which are doing exceptionally good work. Relationships with the police and local authorities are often much better than they are in the London area. We can create good cluster areas&#151;not only for the Kosovans&#151;where people can be accommodated safely and well assisted. Those who, in due course, seek asylum and who are granted refugee status can choose to remain in a cluster area if they believe that it is the best place for them. They may decide to stay because their children attend a local school and have established relationships with the local community&#151;usually their own ethnic minority community. Those who are refused asylum will be removed.
<P>
We have no wish to take the risk that the hon. Lady fears; we will create a system that works for those to whom we intend to grant refugee status. We do not want to create even greater trauma for those who have suffered already. Our system will create the basis for adequate accommodation for a temporary period that will allow people to pursue their asylum claims.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall respond to the Minister's comments. If it is the intention of the Asylum Support Directorate to pay London prices for accommodation in Sheffield, I can guarantee a supply of very good accommodation to the directorate. My only concern is that I do not think that the directorate will be prepared to pay as much for accommodation outside the metropolis as it is for accommodation in it.

I hope that the Minister will find my amendment attractive and one that could be incorporated in a new clause 77. It is very much in keeping with the spirit of the Minister's remarks and those made in the previous debate about our desire to protect people from racial attacks.
<P>
It is open to doubt whether this clause will come back in the same form. If an asylum seeker ceases to reside in the accommodation with which he has been provided, the current subsection (2) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``he ceases to be a person for whom support may be given under section 74 in respect of essential living needs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Once again, the wording is important. If a person leaves a property, it is not just that the Secretary of State ceases to be under a duty to rehouse him. Under the Bill, it is forbidden for the Secretary of State to provide him with any other accommodation.
<P>
The Bill takes no account of a person's reasons for leaving accommodation. It would not matter if the claimant were the victim of a racial attack or racial harassment. I am sure that such cases will concern the Government, and I know that the process manual is considering the problem. However, the Bill takes no account of such circumstances.
<P>
Under the Bill, a person will have to remain in the accommodation and endure the racial attacks to which he has been subjected. Not enough thought has been given to the risk posed by racial attacks. I concede that the Government have thought about the problem, but they have not thought about it sufficiently.
<P>
Under the Bill and the administrative provisions in the process manual, the only avenue open to a claimant facing such a dilemma is to make a request for an internal review to the Asylum Support Directorate. However, in that review, the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the directorate. The process manual states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A request by an applicant for a review should be considered substantively only where clear and demonstrable material changes in the applicant's circumstances have been advanced by the applicant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although an asylum seeker's claim that he has been subjected to racial discrimination or harassment could amount to a change in circumstances, the onus is on the asylum seeker to establish that fact. If he is not believed or, for any other reason, he is not able to satisfy the directorate, there is no way for him to get the issue to the asylum support adjudicator or to any other forum.

<P>
It is a serious issue and we want safeguards built into the Bill because there is a risk of such problems. The Minister was right about the nature of the British people. They are warm-hearted, but even so, under the new system there is a risk&#151;particularly with the dispersal that is to take place&#151;of racial harassment and racial attacks. A number of organisations that have given evidence to us say that they want better safeguards built into the Bill.
<P>
The Refugee Council says that it wants proper safeguards to be built into the primary legislation to ensure that asylum seekers are not left homeless when they have a compelling reason for having left their accommodation, such as to escape harassment or violence. The Commission for Racial Equality argues that that should be taken into account. It says that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as highly visible newcomers without cash housed in areas which may be relatively racially homogenous, there is a real danger that they will be scapegoated by other disadvantaged groups and targeted in racial attacks''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the last debate the Minister made some remarks that were helpful in forming the background to this debate. He spoke of the way in which applicants for asylum support were housed in parts of the country away from London. It is true that property prices are cheaper in other parts of the country and that in many places asylum seekers will be received by warm-hearted people in England and Scotland, but experience shows that there are risks.
<P>
I invite the Minister to look particularly at the evidence from the Chartered Institute of Housing, which conducted a survey of asylum seekers' experiences of being housed on certain estates. Chapter and verse is given of a number of examples. I shall cite one from Glasgow, but that is not to cast aspersions on that city, because I could give examples of other places too. The institute says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Over the last 30 years the council has had a lot of experience in housing asylum seekers. During the 1970s and 1980s Glasgow housed Vietnamese and Chilean refugees in surplus and difficult to let housing. Isolation, lack of support, subjection to racial harassment and the nature of the deprived communities within which they were placed meant that none stayed. Many of these refugees drifted back to London.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	During the Gulf War a number of Iraqi students were stranded in Glasgow and were housed in low demand, high rise flats. Glasgow describe this experience as `a disaster'. These Iraqi refugees were subject to continuous harassment and were eventually forced to leave.''
<P>
That is no reflection on Glasgow&#151;Glaswegians are among the most warm-hearted people anywhere&#151;but there is a risk that such problems will arise in any part of the country when highly visible new people are brought in, particularly if the local people are not used to newcomers of that nature.
<P>
Therefore, the Bill should contain strong protection for asylum seekers from racial harassment. The Minister mentioned his responsibilities for race relations, and I invite him to consider particularly carefully the evidence from the Commission for Racial Equality. It says that the clause provides
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the withdrawal of support if a supported person leaves provided accommodation or a notified address. The Commission is especially concerned that support should not be withdrawn if an asylum seeker leaves accommodation because of racial harassment. There should be a duty to make the regulations described in clause 77(6) specifying when support would not be withdrawn, and these regulations should include steps taken to avoid racial harassment or violence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We would like to see it put into the Bill. There is an opportunity to do that, given that the Government intend to withdraw the clause. I am sure that the Minister, who is alive to the risks presented by racial harassment, will want to give his reassurance on this and seriously consider incorporating such a provision in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I helped to draft the amendments to the initial draft for the crime and disorder provisions in relation to racial harassment and racial violence, to ensure that we crack down hard on those who might perpetrate racist attacks. I am sure that every member of the Committee will join me in condemning the dreadful racist attacks to which asylum seekers are sometimes subjected.
<P>
The Government do not intend to disperse asylum seekers around the country solely on the basis of available accommodation. The hon. Member for Hertsmere described what has happened in the past and spoke about the social exclusion of asylum seekers and the community relations problems that can arise.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
We do not want that to happen. Instead, we have listened carefully to organisations such as the Refugee Council, who suggested that if asylum seekers are to be dispersed, it should be to cluster areas where suitable accommodation is available and a significant ethnic minority population exists, along with associated support from community groups. If, however, asylum seekers are forced to leave as a result of harassment, we will seek to re-house them elsewhere. There is thus no need for amendments Nos. 368, 369 and 370.
<P>
In any event, we do not intend to replace the clause, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere put it, but that it should fall and clause 78 should become operational and be amended. If the hon. Gentleman examines Goverment amendment No. 763, he will see that we propose to set out criteria for the Secretary of State to take into account when deciding on accommodation. We intend to discuss with the Commission for Racial Equality and other organisations how to ensure that we provide satisfactory, sufficient and effective support to those who might become the victims of harassment.
<P>
We aim to ensure, by locating asylum seekers in cluster areas, that harassment does not occur. However, the hon. Gentleman rightly drew our attention to what might happen in a small minority of cases&#151;hopefully none&#151;and we intend to be able to deal with it adequately and quickly by providing alternative accommodation when necessary: We do not want to be forbidden to provide other accommodation&#151;that sort of inflexibility is precisely the reason that we propose to delete clause 77. The hon. Gentleman highlighted some difficulties with the wording: we broadly agree, which is why we are removing it.
<P>
Government amendment No. 763 will allow us to respond effectively to racial harassment. When we have consulted relevant organisations, including the Commission for Racial Equality, we will bring forward regulations to enable us to do so. I hope that, in view of our intention to delete the clause and in the light of my assurances that we share the concerns of the hon. Member for Hertsmere and others about the victims of racial harassment and about the importance of providing alternative accommodation, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. The Government are proceeding rather chaotically with the clauses, but there we are. I took the clause at face value. As I said at the outset, we appreciated that the Government were going to withdraw it, but we did not know that they were going to leave it out altogether and not replace it. I would be happy if the Minister would give an assurance that the regulations in amendments Nos. 763 and 764 will contain a safeguard for someone who leaves accommodation because of racial attacks. There must be such a safeguard.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman that we will want to ensure that victims of racial harassment can move to alternative accommodation and that they will continue to receive proper support. I hope that with that reassurance, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will study the regulations when I see them. However, on that basis and in order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 829, in page 48, leave out lines 10 to 12.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take clause stand part and Government amendments Nos. 763 and 764.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased to see that the Minister has added his name to amendment No. 762, which proposes to delete clause 77. I tabled that amendment with my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. I suspect that it will be the only amendment to the Bill to gather such an eclectic group of supporters. However, it is a shame that the Minister did not add his name to amendments that I tabled seeking to delete clauses 73 to 76. One cannot have everything.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 762 and 829 were tabled because clause 77 prohibited the Secretary of State providing asylum seekers with support under certain circumstances when they ceased to reside in notified accommodation. However, subsection (6) allowed regulations to be made to overturn that prohibition.
<P>
The Minister has taken the sensible course of coming up with a different set of regulations. I understand that he will now make a set of regulations prescribing the circumstances under which support is withdrawn. Those regulations will replace the automatic withdrawal of support and there will be further regulations specifying exceptions to that. Government amendments Nos. 763 and 764 state that there will be a set of regulations describing possible processes involving the withdrawal of support on leaving accommodation.
<P>
Our anxieties were expressed to some extent by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. Certain circumstances applying to asylum seekers&#151;such as harassment&#151;may explain why they may wish or need to leave accommodation.
<P>
However, a matter of principle is also involved. The Minister has often said that he would like asylum seekers to get support from their own communities and to turn to family and friends. There may be a number of reasons why asylum seekers may change their accommodation fairly regularly during the period in which they are claiming asylum, especially if that period is slightly longer than that envisaged by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Clause 77(4) specifies that, once asylum seekers cease to reside at a notified address, they must go back to square one and lose support that is provided for essential living needs. I assume that such people would have to re-apply at that point. That is the wrong approach.
<P>
Will the new regulations will take into account the factors mentioned by the hon. Member for Hertsmere? Will the regulations be framed in such a way that the Asylum Support Directorate or the Secretary of State's officers who make the judgment will examine why people have changed their accommodation? Will the Minister confirm that there will not be a presumption in favour of the withdrawal of support unless there are certain reasons for that?
<P>
The Minister outlined the reasons which may be applied and which relate to conditions, damage to property and so on. Liberal Democrat Members do not necessarily agree with that, but it would be helpful to know whether the regulations will set out rules allowing a case-by-case approach.
<P>
Such an approach contrasts with clause 77's general presumption that a person leaving a notified address would have to start again. That has the potential to create tremendous additonal work for the Secretary of State when reassessing someone. If someone did have a genuine reason for moving from one place of accommodation provided by family and friends to another, it would seem a nonsense to go through the whole process again when he or she had only gone from Uncle Fred's to Auntie Jane's down the road. Such a change of address would not involve the fundamental material change of circumstances which would merit re-examination of a claim.
<P>
Is the presumption of authomatic withdrawal of support for living needs on the change of notified address to be reversed? Will cases be examined individually, instead of blanket assumptions being made?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The essential purpose of the clause is that suport under part IV is to be available only as long as the person in question is in contact with the Secretary of State. The reasons for that are obvious. We want to know that the person is occupying the accommodation supplied to him and observing the terms under which he is supported&#151;for example, that he is not working and would be at risk of destitution, or has not won the lottery and suddenly come into a lot of money. We want to keep in contact with him in the context of his asylum application and we cannot accept anything along the lines of amendment No. 829.
<P>
For all those reasons we need an amendment that contains many of the provisions that were in the clause. We listened with care to the representations made to us in the Special Standing Committee and elsewhere about the way in which we should operate this support and unfortunately the clause does not do the job. We therefore decided to seek more flexibility, which the hon. Member for Hallam asks us to do, to deal with the person who leaves an address, perhaps temporarily, to visit a relative and with the different behaviour of different members of a single household&#151;for example, where an asylum seeker moves out but his or her spouse remains in the residence because the family have broken up or for whatever reason.
<P>
We believe that those intricacies are best dealt with not in the Bill, because they are too complex and require detailed circumstances to be set out, but in regulations&#151;hence the provisions contained in new subsections (3B) and (3C) in Government amendment No. 763.
<P>
Amendment No. 763 also places beyond doubt our ability to withhold support in the event of non-compliance with various conditions, because it would be absurd if a person removed from accommodation for creating a severe nuisance could simply demand to return there forthwith. We want to be able to suspend someone's entitlement temporarily or permanently. There may be circumstances in which it is done permanently, but we are more likely to say, ``We are suspending your entitlement for the moment and you will have to move elsewhere.'' We will then have to decide where the person moves to and provide alternative accommodation.
<P>
The sorts of circumstances in which people's entitlement would be permanently suspended are difficult to imagine, but clearly there are circumstances now in which council house tenants find their tenancy permanently ended. Indeed, I had to deal with a couple of such cases in my area this weekend. That causes great upset to council tenants, but it occurs if a person has been drinking, is involved in drugs or has otherwise severely breached the tenancy rules, as occurred in my area.
<P>
Government amendment No. 764 addresses a different issue. The basic power in part VI is to provide accommodation and essential living needs for asylum seekers. Quite properly, the latter are quite narrowly defined, but the Bill limits what else we can provide in support of asylum seekers. We want to provide a number of other important things. As part of the way in which we set up the cluster areas, we may want to provide books in asylum seekers' own language&#151;not strictly an essential living need&#151;or a hostel might offer to provide certain basic leisure facilities as part of its overall contract and we may feel that such facilities in a hotel or other accommodation should be available. Whilst it is arguable that such leisure facilities could not be defined as essential living needs, we would not want the Secretary of State to be acting ultra vires in making a contract payment that included leisure facilities. That is why we need that power.
<P>
If the asylum seeker finds his own accommodation and receives vouchers only, it is open to him to move as and where he wishes. We suspect that many asylum seekers will decide to continue to live in London, and they can do so, provided that they keep us informed of their address. I think that all hon. Members will accept that that is a reasonable requirement. There is no veto on where a person provided only with support can choose to live; he can be wherever he wishes in the United Kingdom. He has merely to inform us of his address. If people decide to leave where they were living, we shall suspend support until they inform us where they have moved, and then reactivate it. The process will be simple and straightforward and need not cause concern because the gap in support will be only as long as it takes someone to inform us of his address.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also asked whether regulations will allow the Secretary of State to consider certain changes in circumstances. They will. We shall consider individuals on a case-by-case basis, examining their circumstances subject to the broad principles that we have set out.
<P>
Before the hon. Gentleman asks me for the detail of how regulations will work, let me say that we have tried to operate on the basis of consultation throughout our consideration of the Bill. Asylum and immigration is always an enormously controversial subject. We said when we published the White Paper that we would listen. We have done so throughout, and have made substantial changes at different states. We continue to listen to what people, including members of the Committee, say, and we are being flexible. When we prepare regulations, we shall consult properly about how they should operate. We shall publish them, get back some views and amend them where necessary prior to their going before the House. That broad approach will allow the Government the degree of discretion that the hon. Gentleman for Hallam is seeking while ensuring that there is firmness in the way that we deliver the support mechanism. People will be obliged to stay in contact with the Immigration and Nationality Department because that is how we shall ensure that their claims for asylum are processed speedily.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am living proof of the Government's openness and their willingness to accept suggestions from the Committee and elsewhere. I have added the word ``reasonable'' to the Bill in the context of force. The Government accepted that and now we are to delete a whole clause. That is not bad going. The Minister rightly said that all will be in regulations and we always retain concern about the extent to which provisions are made through secondary legislation. I am sure that the Minister is sincere in his commitment to consult on the detail of what will be quite a sensitive matter. He has promised regulations and said that there will be genuine willingness to amend the regulations if necessary in the light of consultation with the groups who work with asylum seekers day in and day out. I accept the Minister's sincerity on this occasion and I will not press the amendment, whose proposals seem to have been met by the Government's approach to the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 77 disagreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 78</center></H4>
<H4><center>Secretary of State's scheme</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 375, in page 48, line 36, at beginning insert `Subject to subsection (3A) below'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 376, in page 48, line 42, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) Regulations made under subsection (3) above shall require the Secretary of State not to take into account the work of charities, churches, faith groups or religious organisations in taking the decisions referred to in subsection (3).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Clause 78 contains powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations governing the operation of the support scheme. We have concern about subsection (3) in relation to the regulations, which may make provisions requiring the Secretary of State to take into account whether to grant support, and the amount to give. Under subsection (3), the Secretary of State may take into account
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``support (or assets) which is (or are), or might reasonably be expected to be, otherwise available to the person concerned or to his dependants (if any).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase ``or might reasonably be expected to be'' caused concern to some of the people who gave evidence to the Committee. The idea that the Secretary of State might take into account not support that a person has, but support that might reasonably be expected to be available to him as an important proposition. Several of the amendments are related to that.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 375 and 376 arise from particular concerns expressed by ILPA about the wording of the Bill. It is worried that the provisions of subsection (3) run the risk of churches and other charitable organisations becoming barriers to statutory support because claimants might reasonably be expected to turn to them or that such charities or churches will be inhibited in their work for fear of that effect.
<P>
It is inconceivable that the Government would intend that effect so I am looking for an assurance from the Minister that the work of charities, churches, faith groups or religious organisations will not be taken into account in decisions taken under subsection (3). Can he assure us that a person who is applying for support will not be expected to turn to them and they will not be given as a reason for support being withheld?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Hertsmere. This could be a significant issue because many of the faith groups have shown themselves to be exemplary in their support for asylum seekers. Many of them are quite fiercely opposed to many of the provisions in the Bill. There is a political dimension here and I am sure that when the Bill reaches the other place, representatives of those faith groups will have a lot to say on the support system in particular and the Bill in general. It could be a battleground.
<P>
In a sense, these provisions, which expect people to find other reasonable means of support, take us back to a pre-welfare state era. We seem to be having a crack at setting up a Victorian poor law system where people are expected to turn to the good parishioners before being able to claim anything from the state. The wording of the clause could quite straightforwardly be interpreted in that context. We do not wish the Secretary of State to get himself into trouble over this.
<P>
I am sure there was no intention to turn to charities and faith groups as a primary means of support for asylum seekers when this elaborate alternate system was set up, but it could be suggested that the Secretary of State was acting ultra vires in awarding support to someone under these provisions if there was an active local support group. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) is involved with a number of groups who give direct support to asylum seekers. I have also referred to the people in Sheffield who are putting their hands in their pockets and providing all sorts of things for the Kosovan refugees.
<P>
An initial reading might suggest that an asylum seeker in Oxford could reasonably be expected to get support from such groups because they are there and are willing to provide support. We do not want to end up in a situation where those groups are set against the state provision or for there to be any conflict between the two. I hope that when the Minister makes regulations under this provision such groups will be excluded.
<P>
I should also like to push the Minister a bit further and refer to some of the ethnic groups such as, for example, the Kurdish support groups who are very supportive of individual Kurds who come here. They may have other pressing needs as well as simply providing support to asylum seekers. They may be set up on a charitable basis. While we expect people to go for a reasonable level of support, we do not wish the Secretary of State to abuse the willingness of such groups to assist members of their own community by requiring them to provide a level of support from charitable donations that ecludes them from his scheme.
<P>
On a more positive note, could the Minister tell us the extent to which he intends to use those kind of organisations for the delivery of services? Rather than seeing them as an alternative, something that one can use to avoid the Exchequer's responsibility to provide for asylum seekers, they would be good, co-operative and willing partners in delivering services. That, however, would require the Secretary of State to make a judgement that they are not the alternative to the support system but a partner in its delivery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hallam spoke about the voluntary sector participating in organising the proper delivery of services. When the tumult and shouting about the Bill dies down, I hope that the voluntary agencies will consider an active role in ensuring a high standard of support for asylum seekers. It will be an opportunity for people such as those in Oxford West and Abingdon to provide local support for asylum seekers. I would encourage them to continue to provide support and perhaps to extend it, but also to consider whether they might want to contract with the Government to provide good quality accommodation for asylum seekers. We take note of the suggestion and actively pursue the matter.
<P>
As to the extent to which charities are expected to assist, we do not intend to follow the previous Government's line in the 1996 Act and remove support, saying that it will be for charities to pick up the tab. That is not a suitable way to proceed; we cannot expect charities, which already have many commitments, to deplete their resources to undertake what is a Government responsibility.
<P>
Amendment No. 376 would prevent the Secretary of State from taking account of the available support from faith groups and the voluntary sector. We all pay tribute to the valuable work done by the voluntary sector in supporting asylum seekers. The success of the new arrangements will depend, in no small part, on their continuing with and building on their excellent work. We do not expect charities to deplete their resources to assist asylum seekers, but it is only sensible to take account of the assistance and facilities that they can offer asylum seekers and their help in assessing asylum seekers' level of destitution.
<P>
There are many specialist groups in the refugee communities which have been set up precisely to assist the group that we are discussing and which attract charitable donations for that purpose. It would be wrong to ignore the fact that asylum seekers will be able to take advantage of help from the voluntary sector. In areas where we do not provide direct support, but where we need to build up cluster communities of asylum seekers and people from ethnic minorities already in the area, we shall examine whether to provide voluntary organisations with the means to provide some local support facilities. I do not want to commit the Treasury at this stage, but there is some provision to encourage voluntary organisations to provide various services to asylum seekers in cluster areas; for example, language teaching, social and cultural support, organising social events and other activities which can build up a spirit of community. We want to encourage that development.
<P>
Charities and the voluntary sector have a key role to play. We want to encourage them and I hope that we will be able to do so. We will take charitable provisions into account, but it is unlikely that charities will be able to provide the same support as the Government. As I said, we do not expect charities to fund the long-term support costs of families or individuals.
<P>
With those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will withdraw the amendment. It would prevent us from taking support into account, which is undesirable. I understand the hon. Gentleman's ideas, but we set out our views clearly in the White Paper. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister, but I am still unclear about what he said. He is confusing two issues: the possibility of charities and voluntary groups being contracted to provide services under the support system, and the idea of charities and informal support groups as an alternative to the support system. Those are two different matters. We all agree that it would be good if voluntary groups could be contracted to help provide services; but that is different from viewing them as an alternative to the support system.
<P>
Greater clarity would be helpful. Clause 78(3) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``support (or assets) which . . . might reasonably be expected to be . . . available to the person''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that include support or assets that might be available from faith groups, community groups or charities?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Some people coming into the country could be put in contact with a voluntary group, which could provide them with some support and be able to accommodate them for some time. In those circumstances, if an application for support were made to the Asylum Support Directorate, it could not be expected to fund costs that asylum seekers do not in practice have to pay. The Asylum Support Directorate would have to consider whether the person was destitute&#151;we have already discussed its meaning&#151;and circumstances would be assessed in the normal way. A decision on whether to provide support would then be reached.
<P>
We could get wrapped up in technicalities here, but the basic idea is that if asylum seekers can gain adequate support from elsewhere, they are free to do so. If not, and they wish to receive support from the Asylum Support Directorate, they are able to do so. That is our approach. As I said earlier, many asylum seekers come from communities where wealth may be stored in jewellery or other financial bonds&#151;and it is right for us to take account of that wealth. That is what is meant by ``assets''.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Is the Minister suggesting that asylum seekers should sell their jewellery, perhaps their wedding rings, as an alternative to the Government meeting their moral and international responsibilities to provide a reasonable level of support?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I certainly am suggesting that.&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Is the Minister going to strip the rings off their fingers?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Lady will listen for a moment, I will explain. I personally met an asylum seeker who had bought large amounts of gold so that she could enter and stay in the UK and have a substantial sum amounting to several thousand pounds. The gold could be exchanged easily. No one is suggesting that asylum seekers should sell their wedding rings. That would be complete nonsense. However some communities decide to store their wealth in the form of jewellery. When people possess jewellery that is worth thousands of pounds, they are clearly not destitute.
<P>
I spoke to an asylum seeker who had &#163;4,000 worth of jewellery that she had purchased for the trip. In such circumstances, it is proper for the Government to consider whether she is able to support herself only when her resources have been depleted. Destitution has been defined in such a way that people with &#163;50 in their pocket or &#163;50 worth of jewellery will not be regarded as able to provide for themselves. However, I suspect that people with &#163;5,000, or even &#163;4,000, are well able to provide for themselves for the next 14 days. They should be encouraged to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister is beginning to clarify the issue slightly. I was told the story of someone who asked the Refugee Council for advice after he had sought support under the National Assistance Act 1948. He had been turned away because he had a watch that looked as though it might be worth a hundred, or a couple of hundred, quid. That is a fairly typical case. Would such people be expected to sell their watches, as they currently are?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We shall have to look to the detail of the regulations to determine how things are interpreted. Possessing a watch that is worth thousands of pounds is one way of storing wealth, and that can be done to avoid investigation. However, if someone has a watch of the same value as mine, that will not keep him for a day, let alone two weeks.
<P>
We must be reasonable and sensible. No one wants to be unduly onerous or repressive. Our aim is to be proper. The assets of people applying for income support are examined. If their assets are large, they should rely on them. However, if they do not possess many assets and they are destitute, there is no suggestion that we will want to interfere so that they have to sell their watches or wedding rings. However, we cannot ignore it if they are storing valuables or holding jewellery as an alternative to cash.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbot:</B> I am grateful to the Minister because I wanted him to say what he meants by assets. I accept the point&#151;and this applies to all types of welfare legislation&#151;that if people have large sums of money in bank accounts, they are not necessarily eligible for support. Clearly, gold bullion is the equivalent of money in a bank account. However, the clause will be interpreted by immigration officers and whoever else runs the support system. They will not be those experienced in welfare and social security matters, but Home Office officials. It will be open to them to say, ``That's a nice watch. Go away and sell it. Come back again if you want support.'' That prospect is rather distasteful.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend is worrying unduly. The clauses should be interpreted in a reasonable and sensible fashion, and the detail of how they should be interpreted will be set out in regulations. I have given what reassurances I can to show that we are not in the business of preventing someone from having the reasonable amounts of jewellery that my hon. Friend and I no doubt possess. However, we want to ensure that, where people have substantial assets on which they could live for some time, that should be taken into account in deciding whether support should be provided. I fail to see how that can be an unreasonable position to take. The hon. Lady rightly says that jewellery can in certain forms be equivalent to gold bullion.
<P>
A person who comes into this country with hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of jewellery could fund themselves for a long time. It is right that the Asylum Support Directorate should be able to take people's alternative sources of finance into consideration and that will include looking at their assets. If their assets are reasonable and of the kind that ordinary people have, I hope that the ASD will adopt the same approach as the income support provisions and enable people to keep what is reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister said something quite disturbing in his response. He said that if a person who comes into the country becomes supported by a faith group, support group or whatever and then goes to the Asylum Support Directorate, it will say, ``You are being supported. You are not destitute.'' Presumably the same ruling would apply as on income support, so that if the person then left that support, he would be regarded as having voluntarily made himself destitute and presumably would not qualify.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman touches on my concern. I heard the Minister's words, and it goes further than that. Under the clause, the person does not even need to be receiving support, he might simply be reasonably expected to receive such support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. It is very disturbing. The only logical outcome is to say to a church organisation or a charity, ``If an asylum seeker presents himself, do not under any circumstances offer him ordinary, humane suport. Send him straight down to the Asylum Support Directorate, because as soon as you offer him somehting you will be in trouble.'' If that person subsequently presents himself to the Asylum Support Directorate, it will say ``You're not destitute. You don't qualify for anything.''
<P>
That strikes me as a receipe for enormous conflict between the orgainsations that the Minister was praising for doing such wonderful work and the Asylum Support Directorate. If we do not clarify this crucial point before we move on, we shall end up with the Minister talking the language of co-operation but the organisations with which he wants to co-operate feeling that they are being taken for a ride to save the Treasury some cash or not being able to offer the kind of support that they would naturally offer, for fear of disadvantaging the asylum seeker.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> There is a danger that the churches, faith groups and voluntary groups will feel that they are being taken for a ride. Clearly, churches and other groups give help to the elderly, the disabled and those with mental health problems, but all those people have a statutory right to provision, which is not undermined by additional help that the churches may give.
<P>
We believe that, in the case of asylum seekers, the statutory right to support will be undermined to the extent that the churches and well-meaning people, like the hon. Member for Hallams and people in Hackney, choose to offer them help. That is quite different from any other group that presents itself for support. It seems that the more that the churches and well-meaning people do for asylum seekers, the less the state will be willing to do, and people will feel that they are being taken for a ride.
<P>
The Minister has spoken warmly about church and voluntary groups, but there is a danger that their resources and their good will will be stretched to breaking point under the regime that he seems to be outlining.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I opened this debate on the amendment in a fairly non-contentious way because, although I have not had many concessions this morning, I was hoping that I would obtain one from the Minister on this amendment. I thought that it was inconceivable that the Government would not want to give an assurance on it, because, at least in ILPA's mind, it is such an obvious point.
<P>
The Minister has apparently said that when the Asylum Support Directorate is deciding whether to give a person support and, if so, how much, it will consider whether he is receiving support from a church, charity or faith group, or might reasonably be expected to receive such support, which may disqualify them from receiving support. I found that inconceivable and I thought that the Minister would want to give me the assurance that I seek. It will put the churches, faith groups and religious organisations in a difficult position, because if they start to give help to a person, or hold themselves out as giving help, that person may be disqualified from receiving asylum support. It is not a question of the churches working in co-operation or being given work to do by the Government and so forth. It affects the decision whether to give the person support and, if so, how much.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will row back from what he said originally, because he cannot leave matters where they stand. I thought that he would want to give an assurance on this matter, to make it clear that the work of churches and charities would not be affected by the provisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is guilty of grave cant in his comments. He voted for the 1996 Act, which removed all support from asylum seekers and would have thrown all the burden on churches and charities. The Government at that time openly said that that was what they were doing. He now seeks to present himself as the champion on a white horse for the churches and charities in a way that I find most hypocritical and unacceptable.
<P>
We must ensure that those who have support from their own resources or from their community, their relatives or other sources, including organisations that may wish to support them, cannot also claim from the Asylum Support Directorate, as that would mean that they were claiming from two sources at once.
<P>
Support from the voluntary sector will not be a bar to receiving support under the scheme, but it is right to take into account in certain circumstances&#151;these will be set out in regulations on which we shall consult fully with the churches, the charities and all the other organisations&#151;how we will operate this system. It is difficult to envisage circumstances in which a charity says ``We have all the resources. We shall support you voluntarily for the next 14 days, and therefore you will not need to claim from the Asylum Support Directorate.''
<P>
Let us look at the practicalities. What charity currently constituted is likely to jump up and say, ``We are quite happy to deplete all our resources on funding long term a group of asylum seekers, so that they do not have to fall on the Asylum Support Directorate.''? The hon. Gentleman seems prepared to recommend to me someone who will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I just wanted to point to the kind of area to consider. For example, the Refugee Council has been operating schemes in response to the 1996 Act, under which it has provided people with meals, toiletries and all kinds of provisions that would come under essential living needs. Therefore, somebody who is using the Refugee Council's facilities at the moment is already acquiring some of their essential living needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Bill's purpose is to create a national system that will prevent the ad hoc provision that we now often have to rely on. The 1996 Act removed access to support for those whose initial application had been refused and for those who had claimed asylum in their own country. As a result, a system grew up, including much of this provision by the Refugee Council, as a substitute for a state system.
<P>
We are restoring not a benefits system but a system of basic support if people are otherwise likely to be destitute. The definition of destitution that we have proposed is fairly liberal: the asylum seeker must be in a position to support himself for more than 14 days; otherwise he can make a claim on the support system. If he is ever in a position where he cannot provide himself with support for more than 14 days, he can come to the state system. It is as simple and straightforward as that. If a voluntary sector organisation wishes to support a person for a time, we shall not say that not only should it support the asylum seeker but that the support directorate must, perhaps retrospectively, provide funding to that person. That is not on the Government's agenda. The aim is to provide a safety net. The amount is open to debate; the intention is to provide a net that would enable people who would otherwise be destitute to come to the state for support. That is a fairly straightforward position.
<P>
We hope that the voluntary sector will be actively involved in partnership in providing much of the support. When the tumult and the shouting have died, some parts of it may decide to put their great experience into effect. They may decide that not only can they provide what the Government want with the resources that we shall provide but that they wish to top up in various ways the services available to asylum seekers from other sources and other funding. We would encourage that. The method of operation was flagged up in the White paper and it is clear insofar as we can make it so in the Bill. As to the detail&#151;the hon. Member for Hallam wants the detail, such as how much jewellery people will be allowed to keep and how much support they can get from other groups or other sources&#151;all that is a matter for regulations in due course. The Bill sets out broad provisions, as did the White Paper. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It would be kinder to the Minister if I drew a veil over the generalised part of his comments because it seemed to me a sure sign of an argument being lost. The Minister smiles. He knows that that is so.
<P>
I agree with the Minister's general proposition. I would not expect the taxpayer to support an asylum seeker who had the wherewithal to support himself. The amendment does not relate to that; it deals specifically with the position of churches, charities, faith groups and religious organisations. It was put forward fairly uncontentiously to elicit an assurance from the Govenment that those organisations would not be taken into account. The Minister has not given that assurance. I am concerned, as the charities will be when they consider the implications of the Minister's comments this morning. The implications are profound. We want to come back to this issue later&#151;we shall certainly want to come back on Report, and I am sure that it will attract a great deal of attention in another place. I am not prepared to let the matter pass. The Government have enjoyed our support on many aspects of the asylum support system. We examined the detail but, as I made clear at a previous sitting, they have our general support. We shall go through the detail again and, if we come to a provision that will cause difficulties or is, as ILPA described it, ``objectionable'', we shall press amendment No. 376 to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Briefly, my main concern is what the Minister said about subsection (3) and the reference to support or assets. One of the problems is that it does not just mean the support or assets that the asylum seeker is currently taking advantage of, but the support or assets that might reasonably be expected to be available to him. An asylum seeker who does not know about the accommodation available in the church could be turned away because he might reasonably be expected to take advantage of it. The phrase ``reasonably be expected'' is a worrying part of the clause.
<P>
On the question of jewellery, I understand what the Minister is saying, but he must also understand that some of these asylum seekers will come from cultures where a woman's jewellery is not hers to sell. It will be peculiarly humiliating for them to be forced to take it off and sell it. I do not think that the Minister quite takes that point.
<P>
That is not my main concern, however. My main concern is that in this area, and in this area alone, Churches and charities have been presented with a situation that to the extent that they show good will, Christian charity, help and support, they are undermining people's ability to get statutory provision. That is detrimental and undermining and it places far to much on the good will of volunteers and Church members. This will doubtless be returned to, if not in the Chamber, in the other place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> One area that I want to return to on clause stand part is assets. In an earlier debate, I tried to amend the Bill so that we would precisely follow the rules that are used for income support determination in assessing the level of assets. If that were the case it would be less of a problem because income support regulations provide people with a &#163;3,000 floor for assets. They are only taken into account above that floor.
<P>
In trying to defend the clause, and having spent a long time earlier pooh-poohing my suggestion and asking whether the taxpayer should pick up the tab if asylum seekers come into the country with &#163;3,000, the Minister referred to making an income support type assessment of their assets. Although I recongise that it will be done in detail in regulations, it is important to establish what we are talking about. There is a huge difference between the &#163;100 watch and the &#163;500 piece of family jewellery, which as the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) pointed out may have some cultural meaning beyond its cash value and &#163;5,000 in gold bullion.
<P>
We could probably all agree a contribution may be required if someone has &#163;5,000 in gold bullion, but not when we start falling below that, particularly below the &#163;3,000 limit which we apply to income support recipients. There is a good reason for that limit: we expect people on income support at some stage to revert to normal life not supported by the state, and we do not try to make them destitute by removing any fixed assets during that period. It was done before the welfare state was introduced, but under our current modern welfare state, we do not believe that it is for the public good to make a person destitute.
