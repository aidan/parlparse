<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000379"></a>The
Minister for the Environment (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
I was in mid-stream, having just returned from a 48-hour conference
session in Korea, debating with the G8 and G5, and attempting to
convince them of the virtues of our policy on a 2° C cap and the
mid-term goals to achieve that, only to arrive back in our country to
face criticism from the Opposition that I was not committed to that.
The ironies of political life are great.</div>
<a name="0806259000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000380"></a><b class="B">Gregory
Barker</b> (Bexhill and Battle) (Con): How did the Minister
get
on?</div><a name="0806259000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000381"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The significant breakthrough at the weekend was
that the G5 countries tacitly accepted the need for a 50 per cent. cut
by 2050. Some of the G8 countries were not happy with that, but as
ever, the United Kingdom played a pivotal role. Mr. Cook,
you are frowning, so I shall move on.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="0806259000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
attempting to persuade the Committee, with the greatest integrity, I
think, that clause 2, the 50 per cent. obligation, provides the surety
that the Committee seeks, through the limit of a 2° C increase
in temperature on pre-industrial revolution figures. Therefore, clause
1 is not only unnecessary, but unworkable. The Committee is looking for
assurances, so having reflected during the break, I shall answer the
questions that were asked of me, and then put my argument.</div>
<a name="0806259000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northavon described his amendment as being &#147;as
ever&#148; intended to be helpful. I urge my hon. Friend the Member
for Mitcham and Morden to make a note of that, so that we can come back
to it. The hon. Member for Northavon, displaying terrific research,
referred to the purpose clauses that were included in the Sustainable
Communities Act 2007 and the Environment Act 1995. It is no
coincidence, of course, that I was the Minister during the passage of
the former, and the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal was the
Secretary of State during the passage of the latter. I congratulate the
hon. Member for Northavon on his research.</div>
<a name="0806259000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the time of
the Sustainable Communities Bill, I was advised that it was better not
to include a purpose clause. When I asked whether it did any harm to
the legislation or whether it was just repetitive, I was advised that
it did no harm, so I took the bold decision as a Minister to accept
one.</div><a name="0806259000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the 1995 Act, I think the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal will
back me up&#151;it was his Bill&#151;when I say that the purpose
clause was for the Environment Agency. It was not specifically a
purpose clause for the legislation. The hon. Member for Northavon will
press me and say that the Government have accepted purpose clauses in
other Bills. He makes a reasonable point, but I would say in defence
that, where legislation places an obligation on the Government of the
day to act in a certain way, such as in the fuel poverty legislation,
it places that legal obligation for as long as the Act is in existence.
In that sense, a purpose clause is beneficial to the judiciary in
defining the
Act.</div><a name="0806259000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is my explanation why a purpose clause is not appropriate in the Bill.
The crucial point is that clause 2 places a legal requirement not just
on Ministers, but on civil servants, who can advise on policy decisions
only within the law. Given that clause 2(1) is based on a 2°
temperature limit at 2050, I urge Opposition Members to consider my
intention. My argument is that clause 2(1) does exactly what
it says on the tin, exactly what they want to do in clause 1, without
the disadvantages of clause 1, which I am trying to
explain.</div><a name="0806259000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say clearly that the Government and I agree with the points made by
hon. Members on both sides about the trajectory&#151;about the
mid-term. The point about 60, 80 or 100 per cent.&#151;whatever the
long-term target&#151;is that it is not important, compared to the
mid-term target. Greenhouse gases accumulate in the air. How one gets
to the target is more important than the target itself. With just a
long-term target of 60, 80 or 100 per cent. reduction, one could
increase emissions for the next period, through to 2049, then decrease
them in the last year.</div>
<a name="0806259000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would be
analogous to my saying that I intend to give up alcohol by Christmas
day. I will drink a bottle of wine each day until 24 December, but on
Christmas day I pledge not to have a drink. I will have reached my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>target of no alcohol on Christmas day, but I would probably have killed
myself by then. Seriously, there is an analogy with greenhouse gases.
What matters is not just the target, but what we say in the United
Nations talks below the curve. What is the amount of greenhouse gas
emissions below the curve? That is why, on clause 6, amendment No. 31,
tabled by the hon. Member for Northavon, is important. It is about the
mid-term
target.</div><a name="0806259000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the point made by the hon. Member for Northavon about historic
greenhouse gas emissions. The firm policy of the United Kingdom is to
accept the responsibility that comes with that. I repeat that in this
important Public Bill Committee. We accept that we are one of the
countries with that historical moral responsibility. There is no
question about
that.</div><a name="0806259000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the progress of
developing countries in increasing their prosperity. It would not be
tenable politically, economically or morally to say that developing
countries cannot develop because we have discovered that greenhouse
gases are damaging. My argument is that, in the long term, developing
countries will increase prosperity through a low-carbon economy, which
is in our mutual interest. It follows that the amount of overseas
offsetting of carbon emissions must take into account not only the
benefits that accrue to our country, but the benefits that can accrue
to developing countries. However, we will come to that debate on other
clauses and
amendments.</div><a name="0806259000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal placed me in a difficult
position. He has enormous experience. When I saw his name on the
Committee, I admit that I worried. Not only does the right hon.
Gentleman have great experience&#151;he had more experience in
Cabinet than virtually anyone else&#151;but he is an
environmentalist. Therefore, the charge he makes against the Government
has to be taken very seriously indeed. He said that we cannot adopt an
&#147;After you, Claude&#148; policy, and he is right&#151;we
cannot do that.</div>
<a name="0806259000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we
are ahead of other countries, and the Bill, particularly clause 2,
underlines that. Basing our target for a reduction in carbon emissions
on the premise of a 2<span class="Sup">o</span> increase and making that obligatory
on the Secretary of State&#151;which means the
Government&#151;further enhances the policy in legislation and means
that we are not in an &#147;After you, Claude&#148;
situation.</div><a name="0806259000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not accept the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that not
accepting clause 1 puts me into that category. I can see that,
presentationally, it will do so, and I have to find an answer to that,
but I hope he accepts that the United Kingdom is not in an
&#147;After you, Claude&#148;
scenario.</div><a name="0806259000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000382"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Gummer</b> (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con): I totally accept
that the Minister and the Government have produced a Bill that is
designed to put us ahead of other countries, not behind them. There is
no question about that. However, there is a difficulty if we start by
removing from the Bill something that people see as adding to it, even
though the Minister explained that there are those who believe that it
involves a legal obligation. I still find that difficult to accept. I
do not believe it to be the case, but that is the advice that he was
given. I am not a lawyer and I do not want to be
one.</div><a name="0806259000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that there is nothing of substance in the clause to which
the Government do not accede. What is wrong is the legality of the way
it is expressed. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>In those circumstances, would it not be reasonable to ask him for an
undertaking that he will genuinely&#151;I know that he will do it
genuinely&#151;look at whether there is a way of putting into the
Bill, in some other form, somewhere, something that does what we all
want done, without causing difficulty? We genuinely do not want
disagreements between us on legal matters. Lawyers are the curse of the
intellectual classes, and we should not allow them to destroy the
proposal.</div>
<a name="0806259000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000383"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b><b class="B"> </b>I hope that Labour Members support my
saying that the right hon. Gentleman has just shown that his motive is
not party political&#151;I am grateful to
him.</div><a name="0806259000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I go through the answers to the questions, with your permission,
Mr. Cook, I would like to enter a cul-de-sac and read out
the advice that I was given on a preamble, because it is worth
reading:</div><a name="0806259000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Preambles
are a rarity in modern Acts of Parliament. We are not aware of any for
many decades, although they were more common back in the 19th Century.
I understand the desire of politicians to make clear statements of
principle, but I must remind the Committee that Bills are about making
laws&#148;.</div><a name="0806259000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is good advice. I know that the right hon. Gentleman has seen it
before&#151;he will have seen it during his 17 years in
ministerial office&#151;but I am teasing him. Let me return to the
argument.</div><a name="0806259000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise that European Union policy, to which the UK is a signatory,
does not put clause 1 into European law, although it is well known
around the world that the EU is the strongest advocate of the 2°
increase. It does not put it into law for the same reason that I have
advocated that we should not put it into law. That does not deny the
objective of capping at 2°, but it does deny that clause 1 is
the best way to do
it.</div><a name="0806259000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000384"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): Is not the underlying
problem that the European Union objective of 2°, strongly stated
by all leaders, has been around since 1996? I believe that that was
when it was first adopted. The problem is that we are not making any
progress towards it, yet each year it costs us a great deal. Is not the
underlying problem the lack of political accountability for the goal?
It is easy to talk about it, but there is no accountability on
delivering
it.</div><a name="0806259000341"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="0806259000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000385"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I do not accept that point entirely. The EU is
well placed internationally, because a number of EU countries,
including the UK, are on course to meet the Kyoto targets. Indeed, it
is interesting that in the international debate the objection to
2° C is sometimes that some European countries are on course to
do better in their contribution. The EU policy is a 20 per cent.
reduction in the medium term. A 30 per cent. reduction is on offer to
the international community, if we can achieve an international
agreement premised on 50 per cent. by 2050, which is the 2° C
target we are talking about. As one of the few countries within the
EU&#151;bearing in mind that we have one of the biggest economies and
are therefore one of the biggest emitters&#151;the UK is committed to
the point that hon. Members from both sides have urged the Government
to put in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806259000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman has teased me about resisting &#147;better
not&#148; advice. He is right, and I am a signatory to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>that policy. However, the statutory obligation that clause 2
puts upon the Secretary of State, the Government and future Governments
meets his point. My problem with clause 1 is not the principle, the
goal or the 2° C target, to which we in the international
community are wedded night and day, but that it could jeopardise what
the Committee seeks to
do.</div><a name="0806259000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on the London Eye, a comment
which is, of course, within our remit because the south bank is part of
the defence against floods, and is therefore part of adaptation to
climate change. I understand that it is also British Airways&#146;
only profitable cost
centre.</div><a name="0806259000041"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000386"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I want to bring the Minister back to a possible
way through. He has said that there is nothing here with which he
disagrees in principle, but I commend to him a discussion that I had
with lawyers in the Department of the Environment when I arrived there.
I brought them in and said that while I was Secretary of State I did
not expect them to find reasons why I could not do what I wanted to do;
their job was to find out how I could do what I wanted to do, but do it
legally. Will he undertake to ask the lawyers, &#147;In this Bill,
how can I express it so that in removing clause 1 I do not give any
quarter to those who would suggest that I am in some way undermining
the Bill?&#148;? If he were prepared to do so, I for one would be
happy to support him, because I know he would do it honestly, and the
Committee would be perfectly happy with that&#151;even those who do
not feel too unhappy about leaving out clause
1.</div><a name="0806259000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000387"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The right hon. Gentleman has made a fair point. My
considerations are partly domestic, in that I need to show the
Opposition, Labour Members and other interests that the
Government&#146;s opposition to clause 1 is not in any way based on
an opposition to its objective. As the right hon. Members for Suffolk,
Coastal and for Penrith and The Border know, it is very important that
as our deliberations are followed in the international forum we do not
signal a lack of commitment to that objective. I will come on to what I
intend to do about that in a
moment.</div><a name="0806259000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000388"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): The Minister has said
that the Government are committed to not more than 2° C above
pre-industrial levels. What benchmark are they going to use to ensure
that they and the rest of Europe do not go above it? That is the
purpose of clause 1&#151;we are not at cross purposes; we are all on
the same side. The Minister is trying to make out that the two targets
are mutually exclusive, but I believe that they are
not.</div>
<a name="0806259000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000389"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The answer is the point that my hon. Friend the
Member for Bury, North made: the Government&#146;s target concerns
carbon emissions in the UK, which is commensurate with our contribution
to an international effort to cap at 2° C&#151;or to hope to
cap at 2° C. There is agreement about that, but my point is that
it is within the power of the Secretary of State&#151;I should say
&#147;Secretaries of State&#148;, collectively, because that is the
legal meaning of &#147;Secretary of State&#148;&#151;to do what,
within our carbon account, we have the power to do. My only difficulty
with clause 1, as I have said three times, concerns subsection (2),
which states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div><a name="0806259000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
functions under this Act must be exercised with the objective of
achieving the principal aim of this

am trying to avoid a problem for a future Government not for the
existing Government, as I hope I have explained. If I can finish my

Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): Will the Minister indulge a
slightly cynical lawyer? He has discussed the 60 per cent. reduction
target being sufficient, but clause 3 gives Ministers the
power to amend it up or down. It may be amended upwards, but it could
be amended downwards, and the impact assessment mentions changes, such
as significant increases</div>
<a name="0806259000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the price of
gas on international markets, or the pace of development in a new
technology&#148;,</div><a name="0806259000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
there are ways in which Ministers will be able amend the target. Is
there not an argument for maintaining clause 1 because it provides for
the principal aim of the 2° C reduction, irrespective of what
happens to the target?</div>
<a name="0806259000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000391"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on an ingenious
argument, but the answer is the same&#151;in my view, it would be
folly for the British legislature to pretend that it can legislate on
something that it cannot control. That is my simple point. The
proponents of the clause say that the Bill does not do that, but the
advice that I have received indicates that it does. I cannot envisage
circumstances in which the emissions target would be reduced, but the
point of clause 2 is to set the carbon budgets to provide a target and
trajectories, which we will come on to.</div>
<a name="0806259000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cheltenham asked about the contraction and convergence
policy. I was interested to note that the hon. Member for Vale of York,
on behalf of the Opposition, accepted it as their policy. In Delhi and
Beijing, they will be very interested to read that. To be fair, there
is a different interpretation of contraction and convergence. It is
normally taken to mean the coming together of per capita emissions, and
in Delhi the Prime Minister made it clear that in international
negotiations, the Government would be open to arguments that lead to
such a policy. However, it would be pre-emptive to accept it now. The
hon. Member for Cheltenham is right in the sense that we accept the
historical responsibility of industrialised countries such as our own.
The hon. Gentleman also discussed the cumulative impact, on which he
was absolutely right. It is important that we understand and explain to
the public that the most important factor is not the end target but the
trajectory to get there. He also asked about the amendments on carrier
bags, and they will be available tomorrow. I am sorry that they will
not have been available before.</div>
<a name="0806259000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying to
draw my arguments to a conclusion, because time is running on and my
hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden is frowning at me. The
simple point is that there is a difference between UK emissions being
the responsibility of the United Kingdom and the temperature in the UK
being the responsibility of not just the United Kingdom. That is the
main
point.</div><a name="0806259000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000392"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): I will try not to labour the
point yet again but the action mandated in clause 1 is still a
reduction in UK emissions, and not in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>global temperatures, which would clearly be implausible. Will the
Minister not take up the invitation of the right hon. Member for
Suffolk, Coastal and return to the lawyers to see whether there is a
way through this problem, especially as we seem to be more or less
united in what we are trying to express? In particular, we should
consider whether the principle of convergence should be reflected in
clause 1, because that seems to be a get-out in the sense that we can
only converge if other people are doing likewise, which means that we
would not be unilaterally bound to international
targets.</div><a name="0806259000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000393"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Given the stage that we are at, and in answer to
the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal, I undertake&#151;I have
already started&#151;to find a way to achieve what we all want to
achieve, which is to make the 2° target our
target.</div>
<a name="0806259000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000394"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> On that point, I wonder whether the Minister and his
advisers will turn to clause 33 and the Committee on Climate Change for
a possible way in which to make the link with 2°, the importance
of which everyone agrees on. The Committee will be required to advise
the Government on the adequacy of the target in December. I do not know
whether the terms of reference are public, but I assume that they will
be. The Committee on Climate Change could be required to make some form
of judgment on the compatibility of the target with the 2° goal,
which could be made explicit in clause
33.</div><a name="0806259000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000395"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a very interesting
point. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test made the
suggestion, which was backed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury,
North, that we could include the 2° in the long title of the
Bill, but other hon. Members have urged another solution. My answer to
the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal is that I undertake to try
to find a way to meet the objective for reasons not only of domestic
politics but of helping the UK&#146;s standing in international
negotiations. As I understand it, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood
has suggested placing a cap on the remit of the independent Committee
on Climate Change.</div>
<a name="0806259000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000396"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> My understanding is that the Committee on Climate
Change will be required to give some form of judgment or advice on the
adequacy of the targets and the carbon budgets. All I am suggesting is
that part of its terms of reference for that public advice should be a
judgment on the compatibility of the target and the budget with the
2°
goal.</div><a name="0806259000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000397"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am more than happy&#151;the hon. Gentleman
knows me well enough to understand that when I say that I mean
it&#151;to consider a way in which we can satisfy the demands of my
hon. Friends and the Opposition to achieve the point about the
2°. I repeat my simple point that clause 2 enshrines 2°
but does not express it. I know that people both domestically and
internationally will be looking for that.</div>
<a name="0806259000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">As ever, our
policy is based on science. That is why I wish to achieve a
satisfactory way forward. The hon. Member for Vale of York asked about
the policy of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>Reform, but I do not accept her point. The Department has looked at how
we can make the targets real, and I believe that we have shown good
leadership on that. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North, to whom
I owe a great debt for my education in life and politics&#151;he was
my tutor in geography and other matters, and I have listened to him
ever since&#151;is absolutely right on this point and has made a very
powerful argument.</div>
<a name="0806259000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="0806259000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
I was worried that my hon. Friend would not support my point of view,
because if he had not supported it, he would have destroyed my
arguments, so I was very grateful that he accepted my point. He said,
and he is right, that we cannot legislate on the temperature. We can
pass a law to control emissions, but we cannot pass a law to control
the temperature&#151;I wish that we could. He made the point that the
Bill legally obliges the Government to act towards meeting a target on
emissions that is commensurate with the 2° C policy that hon.
Members have asked for.</div>
<a name="0806259000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
also pointed out that we could not pass a law that obliged us to
protect polar bears, and he is right. Let me use an analogy&#151;I
see that the hon. Member for Cheltenham is scratching his head; I had
to listen to him, so he has to listen to me now. We could pass a law
that said that we must protect polar bears. However, it is possible
that in the future the Governments of the United States of America, of
Canada and of Russia could decide to kill polar bears, perhaps on the
grounds of protecting other species or for another reason that we
cannot predict. Because the Bill places a legal obligation on the
Government and on future Governments to act in accordance with the
target in clause 2, under any circumstances it would be illegal for the
Government of the day not to act in protection of polar bears.
Therefore, if the United States of America, Russia and Canada were to
decide to cull all polar bears, the legal obligation on the Government
of the day would be to declare war on Russia, Canada and the United
States of America.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000399"></a>Mr.

valid.</div><a name="0806259000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="0806259000063"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000402"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Will the Minister accept that his analogy is not
only extreme but wrong? The obligation would be to look after the
interests of polar bears within the UK, in other words within zoos and
breeding programmes, and not in the wild, just as this obligation to
look after 2° C relates to the UK and not the
world.</div><a name="0806259000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000403"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is my point. Clearly, we could not do so. I
will stop the analogy there, Mr. Cook, because you are
getting fed up. However, my point is that the implication of clause 1,
which is unintended but nevertheless real, is that it would do exactly
what I said it would do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div><a name="0806259000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000404"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The Minister has said that he does not believe
that the Government can legislate against temperature rising. However,
this experiment with laptops in Committee might contribute to rising
temperature, and the Government could change people&#146;s behaviour
by legislating to stop such experiments, if we were to reach that
conclusion. So there are mechanisms that the Government can use to
achieve the Minister&#146;s aim of a temperature rise no higher than
2° C, and I am not convinced by the Minister&#146;s
argument.</div><a name="0806259000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000405"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I will not be drawn into laptops, Mr.
Cook, because you will not let me. I have been advised that the total
carbon footprint of UK personal computers is greater than the total UK
carbon footprint of aviation&#151;I just note that for a later
debate.</div><a name="0806259000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me put on the record an argument based on an understanding of the law
and what clause 1 is trying to do. I urge hon. Members to look at
clause 1(2), which concerns &#147;functions under this
Act&#148;:</div><a name="0806259000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
functions under this Act must be exercised with the objective of
achieving the principal aim of this
Act.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
aim is expressed in clause 1(1). That means in law that all functions
of the Act must be subservient to that principal purpose. For instance,
because of part 5 of the Bill, a local authority would need to consider
the impact on global temperatures when deciding to introduce a waste
scheme.</div><a name="0806259000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, let me look at the role of the Secretary of State and
their decisions on carbon budgets. Under part 5 of the Bill, in 2016
the Secretary of State will need to set the carbon budget for 2028 to
2032. Let us suppose that in eight years&#146; time, between now and
2016, the UK has made good progress in reducing our emissions by
setting and meeting ambitious carbon budgets. However, suppose that
over the same eight years emissions in the rest of the world have
increased significantly. Let us suppose for the sake of
argument&#151;I believe that this is a realistic
assessment&#151;that the science has got more pessimistic, which my
hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test has referred to. In such a
situation, because of the point eloquently made by the right hon.
Member for Suffolk, Coastal that this is an epoch-making piece of
legislation that sets a new paradigm, we would be responsible for the
future. Even with the addition of the amendments, which were tabled
with the good intent of trying to meet some of the points, clause 1
would still require us to set that 2028 to 2032 carbon budget with the
aim of achieving a 2° C cap, because&#151;this is the crucial
point&#151;it is an ongoing
duty.</div><a name="0806259000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
duty must be met every time a function is exercised under the Bill, no
matter what the rest of the world has done, which is a fundamental
point. Either one has a target for the Bill that is within one&#146;s
control&#151;an emissions reduction based on a 2° C
objective&#151;or one has a target that is dependent on others in the
world and on science.</div>
<a name="0806259000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have convinced the Committee that clause 1 is an intention that we
wholeheartedly support&#151;indeed, the UK&#146;s investment in the
international community and the European Union is based on
it. The European Union itself has a policy based on that, but not a
policy that is enshrined in EU law for the same reasons.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="0806259000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
invitation from hon. Members to find a way to enshrine 2° C
within the Bill, if I can. Suggestions have been made, and I am
grateful for the positive way in which they have been put. My argument
is that clause 1, as Lord Rooker said in the other place, would serve
to undermine that intent in practice, because it would create
difficulty for future Governments&#151;I am talking about some time
in the future&#151;in meeting the exact point that people are trying
to
reach.</div><a name="0806259000075"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000406"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I welcome what the Minister is saying, if that is
an olive branch that he is holding out. That is a very sensible way
forward. I am mindful of the precedents for a purpose clause in the
Legal Aid Act 1988 and the Family Law Act 1996. Even though I have not
been in Parliament for nearly as long as other Committee members, I
have enough experience in Committee to know that blandishments offered
in the spirit of consensus somehow melt like spring snow by the time we
get to Report or Third Reading. I press the Minister to be more
specific on how he anticipates solving the problem, which we have been
wrestling with all
day.</div><a name="0806259000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000407"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman has asked a fair question. I
reject the implication that Ministers make statements in Public Bill
Committee that are not followed through&#151;it may be that the
Opposition fail to push such issues in the future months and
years&#151;and I am not aware that I have ever done that. In any
event, the Third Reading and Report stages of this Bill will be
scrutinised, I suspect, over and above other Bills passed in this
place.</div><a name="0806259000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
advice that I have received states that there are potential problems in
incorporating 2° C in the long title, but it is one suggestion
that I am going to take away and look at. Another suggestion is that we
have a preamble. I have to tell the Committee that David Renton MP
looked at the question of preambles in his influential report on
legislation in 1975, so I am not coming up with this off the top of my
head and there are precedents. The bottom line is that as much as
politicians like to put manifesto commitments and so on in Bills, we
make law in Committee. Although I do not rule out the first two
suggestions, other suggestions have been made. It is clearly in the
interest of the Bill that we find a way of stating clearly that a limit
at 2° C is our objective. I just remind the Committee that not
everybody in the world is content with that and that there are those
who say that that goes too
far.</div><a name="0806259000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000408"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The Minister has mentioned the preamble and the
long title, but he has made no reference to the precedent of a purpose
clause, as I mentioned with reference to the Legal Aid Act 1988 and the
Family Law Act 1996. Is he therefore ruling out the possibility of
returning with a reworded, reworked purpose
clause?</div><a name="0806259000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000409"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> There are always such arguments in Standing
Committee. I remember the then Member for Kensington and Chelsea,
Michael Portillo, a former Transport Minister with many years&#146;
experience, being appointed to the Transport Bill Committee and
pointing out, rather like the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal
did, that where civil servants say &#147;better not&#148;, one
should be brave and stand up to it. The important point is that the
preamble to a Bill must not diminish its legislative
coherence.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000411"></a>Mr.

does not need to intervene. If I can find a way of meeting the
objective without damaging the coherence of the Bill in its legal
terms, of course I will do
so.</div><a name="0806259000082"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000415"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I do not think the hon. Member for Cheltenham has
made a fair comparison&#151;his example relates to what this country
does to influence another country. What I am arguing here is that it is
irresponsible to legislate on things over which one does not have
control.</div>
<a name="0806259000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have given a
commitment to the Committee, and I must draw my remarks to a close.
Amendments Nos. 33, 43 and 44 would not add to the Bill, and I believe,
as my right hon. Friend Lord Rooker argued in the other place, that
they would create
problems.</div><a name="0806259000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000416"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I want to help the Minister, because I want us
to coalesce around a form of words and a way forward. The long title of
a Bill has legal status and is legally binding, although that is
possibly not the case with the preamble. Is he therefore minded to
change the long title rather than the
preamble?</div><a name="0806259000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000417"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> A long title of a Bill is a descriptive title as
to what the Bill is. It is not there to set out the Bill&#146;s
purpose, but I am happy to investigate whether we could do that. One
could argue that limiting global temperature increases to 2° is,
in common-sense terms, the purpose of the Bill. Common sense is not a
bad policy, so I shall continue to consider
that.</div><a name="0806259000321"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
arguments of my hon. Friends the Members for Bury, North, for
Southampton, Test and for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North,
are very powerful, and none of us wants to do something that would
jeopardise the UK&#146;s ability to implement the Bill. My advice is
that clause 1, even if it were amended&#151;I accept the intention
behind the amendments&#151;would do that, and I therefore urge the
Committee to reject
it.</div><a name="0806259000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="0806259000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000418"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I shall not detain the Committee long. We listened
carefully to the Minister and we do not accept that there cannot be a
principal aim or a purpose clause in the Bill. We think there is room
for that, but we are open-minded about working with the Government to
improve the clause further and ensure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>that it complies with the best legal advice. If there is another way in
which the intention in the principal aim can be incorporated, in a
preamble or otherwise, we shall consider it constructively. We
therefore do not intend to obstruct the Minister.</div>
<a name="0806259000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall work
constructively with the Government, but we will hold them to their
word. They must return with a workable solution that does not water
down the intention behind the principal aim. If they cannot, we shall
bring forward our own solution on Report. I hope that we will be able
to work with the Minister to achieve broad
consensus.</div><a name="0806259000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000419"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> All that talk about bears has been slightly
polarising, so I shall try to identify common ground.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Perhaps I should stop there. I think I have lost
them.</div><a name="0806259000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a serious note, there is far more agreement in the Committee than one
might have imagined from listening to the debate for the past three or
four hours. In logical sequence, we accept that there is scientific
evidence that there is a global figure for emissions consistent with a
2° change; we accept that the UK needs to play its part; and we
accept, as the Minister has confirmed that the Government accept, that
the UK&#146;s part needs to be more than the global average because
of our history, as amendment No. 32 states, and because of the desire
for other economies to grow. The debate is therefore about whether the
clause helps to establish how we can move from a global to a national
figure.</div><a name="0806259000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate has been constructive. I shall not go through the contributions,
but we have benefited hugely from those of two former senior Ministers.
I have not heard the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood speak on the
subject before, but he made a well informed and well considered
contribution. The hon. Members for Bury, North, and for Southampton,
Test, raised the matter of whether there is a better way to meet our
goal than is provided for in the clause. We appreciate the
Minister&#146;s willingness to consider that, whether through the
long title of the Bill or another
mechanism.</div><a name="0806259000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would like to keep the clause, in case the Minister makes a lot of

2.</div><a name="0806259000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000437"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> Of course. The history of the
amendment&#151;the debate about 60 per cent. and 80 per
cent.&#151;has been well rehearsed. It has been well argued in the
Environmental Audit Committee, of which I am a member, and I imagine
that the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee has also debated
the matter at length. It was debated at enormous length in the Joint
Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill this time last year, and of
course, it was given consideration in another place, so we do not need
to go over the arguments in great detail. It is also not necessary to
reinforce the urgent need for action and, in the context of the
amendment, more stringent action on climate change, because of the
damage that it is causing and is increasingly likely to cause. We are
all familiar with those effects and predictions.</div>
<a name="0806259000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important, first, that as my hon. Friend the Minister said, the
Government&#146;s decision and the Bill reflect the scientific
evidence, and secondly, that it has credibility. I shall come to the
different kinds of credibility, if necessary, in due course.</div>
<a name="0806259000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the debate
on the previous clause, the Minister expressed concern that I would
undermine his arguments. I am delighted that he was relieved that I did
not. I want to reassure him that I do not intend to undermine his
arguments in defence of the wording in the Bill. I want to strengthen
the case that will underline some of his arguments and may get him to
reconsider them, if not today, then before the Bill comes back on
Report.</div>
<a name="0806259000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Government first expressed their intention to establish a 2050 target,
it was framed in terms of 60 per cent.&#151;the wording in
the Bill is &#147;at least 60%&#148;&#151;owing to the landmark
2000 report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. That
report concentrated the minds of many policy experts and the
Government, and helped to generate a wider debate on climate change.
The important thing is that the report based its judgment on the
scientific evidence presented in the second assessment report by the
intergovernmental panel on climate change, which was published in 1995.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>We are now in 2008 and the scientific basis for the figure adopted by
the Government is therefore 13 years old. It is time that we reviewed
the state of the scientific
evidence.</div><a name="0806259000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
years ago, the intergovernmental panel on climate change published its
fourth assessment report, in which it made it much clearer that the
evidence base had changed and that the likely reduction in emissions
needed to remain within the 2° had increased. To be precise, the
report stated clearly that if annexe 1 countries wish to keep to the
guideline carbon concentration of 400 ppm by volume, we need to aim for
cuts in the range of 25 to 40 per cent. by 2020, and 80 to 90 per cent.
by 2050. Even if we keep to those guidelines, there is no guarantee
that the temperature increase will remain below 2°. However,
they represent our best chance.</div>
<a name="0806259000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
scientific evidence undermines the Bill&#146;s content, we need to
base our judgment on the fourth assessment report. The Government
recognised that to some extent by replacing their original formulation
of a 60 per cent. reduction by 2050 with a reduction of &#147;at
least&#148; 60 per cent. That provides a certain flexibility, but of
course it could include 61, 62, or 60.003 per cent., and according to
the fourth report that would not be
enough.</div><a name="0806259000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000438"></a><b class="B">Tony
Baldry</b> (Banbury) (Con): As I understand it, the
Government&#146;s position is slightly broader than that.
Essentially, they are telling the Committee that the decision cannot be
taken by MPs, but by the Committee on Climate Change. On Second
Reading, the Minister was asked twice whether the Government would
accept and implement the Committee&#146;s recommendations. I was
concerned, because on both occasions he replied no. Even if the
Committee comes up with a recommendation of 80 per cent. or more, we
have no guarantee that Ministers will accept it, unless we get a clear
undertaking. Surely that raises another issue of
credibility.</div><a name="0806259000344"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="0806259000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000439"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> That is an important point, but the Bill provides
opportunities elsewhere to debate the role and significance of the
Committee on Climate Change&#146;s advice. I know that that was
discussed in another place.
</div><a name="0806259000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to have credibility, we must stick with the Government&#146;s
position, which is that the final judgment on the 2050 target should be
based on the most up-to-date scientific evidence. I need to say at this
stage&#151;I think I said it on Second Reading, and perhaps this
morning, as well&#151;that we have to avoid the assumption that the
science is precise. We have to avoid the danger of getting hung up on
an absolutely precise percentage, because the world is not like that;
the knowledge that we have is not yet sufficiently advanced and may
never be so. We are always going to be looking at figures within a
range. To set a minimum, when we know that the latest evidence clearly
indicates that we need to go significantly beyond that minimum, is the
very least we can do. I also do not accept that, if the Climate Change
Committee came up with a specific percentage or if a fifth assessment
report from the IPCC suggested another percentage of 82 per cent. or 85
per cent., that should be the only factor, because those figures are
not absolutely precise; it is not possible to predict what
circumstances will be in 2050.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="0806259000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Simply because
of the competing interests in any large, industrialised democracy, how
the issue can best be managed has to be a matter of political judgment.
In one sense, that answers the intervention from the hon. Member for
Banbury. It is important that the voice of those who are generating
wealth in our economy are listened to. It is important that consumers
are listened to and the impact on their standard of living and way of
life is reflected. It is crucial that the survival of the planet is at
the centre of our considerations. However, it is also important that we
listen carefully to those who have the skills and the knowledge to
develop the new low-carbon technologies that are going to get us out of
this deep
problem.</div><a name="0806259000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has to be credibility. There has to be a balance of credibility within
those four different competing interest groups, but there also has to
be credibility at international level. Again, I shall try to reflect
the essence of the argument put by the Opposition on clause 1. If the
Government are going to retain international credibility, it would be a
contradiction if, having established such a lead internationally and
having been the first country in the world to introduce a Climate
Change Bill with binding targets, one of those key targets fell well
short of what was proposed by the latest scientific evidence. In order
to maintain credibility domestically, and internationally, it is
crucial that we stick with the
science.</div><a name="0806259000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, it is not just the IPCC report; the United Nations Development
Programme has also been very clear that an 80 per cent. reduction by
2050 from annexe 1 countries is necessary. In addition, on 21 January
this year, the Government received a letter from the chairman of the
Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and, I think, two former
chairmen. It may be as well for me to read it into the record again
just to reinforce its importance. The letter was addressed to party
leaders from the former chairman, the former chief executive of the Met
Office and the past president of the British Ecological Society and
former chairman of the RCEP. The letter said very clearly that
the</div><a name="0806259000134"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;UK
Climate Change Bill targets are based on out-of-date science. In
tackling the global challenge of climate change, governments must
follow the latest science that clearly shows the need for the UK to
reduce its C0<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions by at least 80 per cent. by 2050.
This will require much more substantial action by 2020 than the
Government is currently considering. The UK Climate Change Bill
proposes a reduction in C0<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions of at least 60 per
cent. by 2050. This target is based on a report of the Royal Commission
on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) from 2000. Since this time,
developments in climate change science show that this target is
insufficient to avoid the worst impacts of climate change for people,
species and
habitats.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to argue the case for an increase in the target at this stage from
at least 60 per cent. to at least 80 per cent. I also want to deal with
some of the objections that the Government have raised when this point
has been made previously.</div>
<a name="0806259000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
said, rightly, that the target in 2050 is not necessarily the
determining factor in whether we avoid a rise in temperature of more
than 2° C. The interim targets for 2020 are equally if not more
important. The Minister said earlier that it would be possible
significantly to increase the stringency of the targets by 2020 and
suddenly to decrease the targets in 2050&#151;highlighting the point
that 2050 was perhaps a little bit arbitrary. In theory that is so, but
in reality that would not happen. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>We need two sets of targets&#151;interim and longer term&#151;and if
the interim target is sufficiently stringent, the technologies deployed
to achieve that target will continue to generate emissions reductions
as we move to 2050. I recognise that 2020 is crucial. In fact, the IPCC
fourth assessment report argued clearly that, in the advanced
countries, CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions need to peak by 2015 and then start
on a downward trajectory, so there is no dispute about the urgency of
the situation. Of course, that message was reinforced by the Stern
report.</div><a name="0806259000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have said that the at least 60 per cent. reductions formula
is not necessarily the definitive one, because the Climate Change
Committee is charged with the task of reviewing the existing science,
considering the first carbon budgets and reporting by 1 December. That
is true, but, returning to the question of credibility, it would seem
contradictory if the Bill completed its progress through the
House&#151;perhaps not before the recess; it will probably come back
in October on Report and Third Reading&#151;with a target of at least
60 per cent. and the Climate Change Committee published its review four
or six weeks later, suggesting a target of at least 70 per cent. or 75
per cent. It would be uniquely embarrassing if the target figure on
which the Bill was based were immediately made obsolete by the Climate
Change Committee&#146;s report on 1
December.</div><a name="0806259000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power to amend the targets cuts both ways. If the Climate Change
Committee came up with a higher figure, it would be easy to amend the
existing formula of at least 60 per cent., but if a formula of at least
80 per cent. was included in the Bill now and the Climate Change
Committee on recommended a 70 per cent. target, it would be possible to
amend the Bill downwards to mention 70 per cent. It is unlikely that
the powers proposed under the Bill as it stands would enable us to do
that.</div><a name="0806259000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point of crucial significance has not yet received the debate it
deserves&#151;not in the Joint Committee on the draft Climate Change
Bill last year, in the other place, or on Second Reading in this place.
Let me quote briefly from the Prime Minister&#146;s statement to the
House yesterday, reporting from the European Council meeting in
Brussels over the weekend, in which he reminded us
that,</div><a name="0806259000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
time last year the price of oil was about $65 a barrel. At the last
European Council in March it stood at $107. At the June Council, the
oil price had risen further still to more than $135 a
barrel.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 June 2008; Vol. 478,
c. 23.]</div><a name="0806259000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
conclusion that we can draw from the relentless rise in the oil price
in the past 12 months is that that may achieve as much if not more than
any targets that any Government set, because the price of oil will
drive a fundamental change in our use of fossil fuels, our lifestyles
and our
technologies.</div><a name="0806259000141"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000440"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the reference to the
carbon budgets in the final impact assessment, where it specifically
mentions rising oil and gas prices as a way that the Government can
lengthen the time frame for meeting the reduction target, whether it is
60 per cent. or 80 per
cent.?</div><a name="0806259000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000441"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> The short answer is no, because I have not yet
looked at the final impact assessment, but the hon. Gentleman makes a
very important point. The argument here is the same one that has
previously been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>deployed against the diminishing group of professional climate change
deniers. Even if one does not accept the science of climate change,
which a majority of the world&#146;s scientists do<b class="B"> </b>accept, it
makes good sense to increase our fuel efficiency in order to conserve
what everybody understands is a finite
resource.</div>
<a name="0806259000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even though
the Government may have difficulty at this stage in accepting the
figure of at least 80 per cent., and even though I know that they
genuinely want to see the report of the Climate Change Committee, it
makes good sense to adopt the most stringent targets for 2050 now,
because nobody believes we are going to go back to the era of cheap
oil. That fact is going to drive change of a sort that we have not seen
for 150 years, since the beginning of the oil era and the end of the
age of steam. The sooner the Government, the Opposition and we as a
society start to understand and adjust to that, the less painful the
transition will be. It makes good sense to adopt a higher target now
for 2050 and, of course, for 2020&#151;though that will be debated
later&#151;in order to preserve and conserve our finite supplies of
fossil
fuels.</div><a name="0806259000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s defence is that the figure should be determined by an
outside expert body, rather than plucked out of the air. I hope that he
does not think I am plucking it out of the air, but that I have
demonstrated that it is a conclusion drawn from the latest science. I
would be completely persuaded by his defence&#151;I see the value of
that point of view&#151;but it is slightly undermined by the fact
that there is already a figure in the Bill. If the argument that we
have to delegate the decision to an external body of experts is sound,
there should be no figure in the Bill. If there is to be a figure in
the Bill, it has to be based on the latest scientific
evidence.</div><a name="0806259000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000442"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I pay tribute to the very knowledgeable speech
made by the hon. Member for Bury, North, with whom I had the pleasure
of serving for some years on the Environmental Audit Committee. I know
he is a great expert on these issues. I find no fault with any of his
analysis of the problem, nor do I doubt for a moment his sincerity in
wanting to tackle it urgently. I share his ambition to get on and start
doing, rather than just talking and providing a framework. However, I
find that the tables have been turned rather strangely.</div>
<a name="0806259000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the last
debate, his colleagues did not argue against the principal objective of
clause 1, but said instead that it was not consistent with the rest of
the Bill. I am afraid that, in this case, that is my view and the view
of the official Opposition, and I suspect it is also the view of the
Government. We do not disagree with any of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
analysis, but we believe it is not consistent with the spirit of the
Bill, which, most importantly, establishes the independent Climate
Change
Committee.</div><a name="0806259000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000443"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> There is one very important difference between the
view of the official Opposition and the one espoused by the Minister in
the Chamber on Second Reading. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member
for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) will give me an undertaking
that when in due course he becomes Secretary of State for the
Environment, the Conservative Government will implement, and not
ignore, the report of the Climate Change
Committee.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="0806259000345"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000444"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> My hon. Friend has made an important distinction.
We attach the highest importance to the full implementation of the
Climate Change Committee&#146;s recommendations. We have always
stated our belief in the primacy of science over politics in the
debate.</div>
<a name="0806259000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000445"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Will my hon. Friend not go even further than that?
Surely the key feature of the Bill is that Governments will have to
carry out the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee. That is
the point of its independence. We would be happy for the Climate Change
Committee to make recommendations to the Government and for the
Government to accept them, rather than beginning a
debate.</div><a name="0806259000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000446"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b><b class="B"> </b>Indeed. The only thing that stands between
the Climate Change Committee and its conclusions becoming law is the
democratic seal of approval of its conclusions through the
parliamentary process. As my right hon. Friend says, the intention is
not to start a debate, to consider, to ruminate upon, to deliberate or
to take other soundings. That is certainly not the intention or the
modus operandi of the next Conservative
Government.</div><a name="0806259000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why we have consistently argued for a strong, independent committee
on Climate Change, which is empowered to make recommendations on the
basis of science, not politics. That is why we successfully argued in
the House of Lords for the independent committee to have the power to
review the 2050 commitment, and report to the Secretary of State in
advance when the first five-year carbon budget is set. That is why the
official Opposition in this place have tabled further amendments to
enhance Government accountability and transparency in their dealings
with and heeding of the independent Committee.</div>
<a name="0806259000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like my right
hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal, I was disappointed to read
at the weekend of the Ipsos MORI opinion poll in <i class="I">T</i><i class="I">he
Observer</i>, which showed that there was considerable public
reservation in the UK about taking action on climate
change.</div><a name="0806259000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000447"></a>Steve
Webb:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am trying to follow the logic of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s position. I understand the argument that the Bill
should not contain a target. Through the Bill, we create a committee,
the committee advises and politicians decide. But why have a target in
the Bill at all? If we are to have one, why not have the right
target?</div><a name="0806259000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000448"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I shall come to that, if the hon. Gentleman will
allow me. We should recognise that there is still widespread scepticism
about the causes of climate change, and there is still a big education
job to be done. One of the reasons for the reluctance shown in the
opinion poll was the considerable public cynicism about the Government
using the veneer of green objectives to impose further regulation or,
particularly, further taxation. There is a good deal of public
scepticism out there about the imposition of green taxes. We must be
clear when we make the
case.</div><a name="0806259000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
order to win back that trust, and to ask the British people to join
together to meet the challenge of climate change, we must make it clear
that we are being led not by the demands of some political lines in the
sand, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>by the demands of science. If we are to raise our 2050 reduction target
from 60 to 80 per cent., we must be sure that we are taking people with
us. There is a broad consensus around the 60 per cent. figure. I do not
doubt for a moment that we will need to move much higher, and 80 per
cent. is probably the right figure, but we cannot take it for granted
that everyone will fall in behind us.</div>
<a name="0806259000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">When that
figure is raised to 80 per cent., we must be able to say that we are
not underestimating the challenges and difficulties that that may
impose. As alive as we are to the opportunities that a low-carbon
economy will bring, we must be able to turn to the country at large and
say why it is being called upon to make that additional effort. It is
not because the Prime Minister wants to look greener than my right hon.
Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), or vice versa,
or because we are trying to outdo the Lib Dems. It is because the
clear, independent, scientific and expert opinion is for 80 per
cent.&#151;although I do not know why 80 per cent. should be such a
magical number, rather than 79, 81, 85 or 90 per cent. It is because
the scientific committee has come out with a clear recommendation that
that is what we must do in our struggle to contain dangerous climate
change. Public cynicism is our greatest
enemy.</div><a name="0806259000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000449"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Weir</b>: The hon. Gentleman said that in a future
Conservative Administration, a Minister would accept a figure given by
an independent committee. Would he also, therefore, do away with the
power to amend the figure in clause
3?</div><a name="0806259000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000450"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> No. I can hear my right hon. Friend the Member for
Suffolk, Coastal, who has experience in Government. That power needs to
be held in reserve. However, I can give the clear assurance that the
next Conservative Government have a huge ambition to lead the country
into a low-carbon economy and make the fight against global climate
change a No. 1
priority.</div><a name="0806259000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000451"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Surely my hon. Friend would agree that we need a
mechanism in the Bill for the Government to accept the recommendation
of the Climate Change Committee and to enact it. That is why the power
is there. Without that, the Government could say, &#147;Of course we
will&#148;, but they would have no mechanism for doing that. There
ought to be no argument over
that.</div><a name="0806259000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000452"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I am grateful for that first-rate
clarification.</div><a name="0806259000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
preparation for today&#146;s discussion, I thought that it would be
insightful to see how many climate scientists sit on the committee. To
the best of my knowledge, there are none. I, for example, am not a
climate scientist. I have a degree in history and politics. The
Minister, able as he is, has a degree in philosophy, and the hon.
Member for Northavon, I believe, read politics, philosophy and
economics&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">] </i>The
Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the
hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford has a science qualification. Later
in the debate, our treat will no doubt be to hear what that
is.</div><a name="0806259000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
serious point is that we politicians should not be the ones to decide
on the 2050 target, having gone to such lengths to set up the
groundbreaking, unprecedented 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>and globally authoritative body that is the Climate Change Committee. It
will include such international luminaries and authorities on climate
change as Sir Brian Hoskins, from the Grantham institute at
Imperial college, and Professor Lord Robert May, from Oxford
university. Having brought together such a distinguished collection of
experts, it is crucial that we respect their opinion. Our first act
under the Bill ought not to undermine the very reason for which they
were brought together or prejudge their most
important decision. I therefore do not support the amendment,
although I understand the motivation, impatience and ambition
of the hon. Member for Northavon in tabling
it.</div><a name="0806259000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
conclude by addressing some remarks to the Minister. Can he assure us
that the Government will not ride roughshod over the evidence of the
expert panel? On Second Reading there were those of us who detected a
glimmer of hedging&#151;just a
hint.</div><a name="0806259000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000453"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> That was not a glimmer. The Minister spoke in
plain terms. Would the Minister give an undertaking to accept the
recommendations of the Climate Change Committee? In turn, the Minister
said no. That is not a glimmer. That is a huge
spotlight.</div><a name="0806259000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000454"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> My hon. Friend is spot on. I was trying to be
consensual and not too partisan&#151;most out of character for
me&#151;but he is right. That leads to obvious concerns. I can assure
him that a future Conservative Administration would have no such
reluctance or hesitation. That will reassure many people about the
future.</div><a name="0806259000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not an ephemeral issue of the day. Politicians should not trump the
primacy of science. There is an overarching necessity to respect it
over politics. If we do not listen to the experts, if we undermine them
before their first sitting, if we prejudge what they will say, if we
inform them that we know better than they do, we
will&#151;</div><a name="0806259000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000455"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am sorry for interrupting my hon.
Friend&#146;s peroration. One can easily find sceptics who will
debate the exact rise in global temperature, and people who will argue
for years about what it may reach by 2050, but we know for certain,
almost to the hectare, the millions of acres of world forests that are
being destroyed and lost, never to be recovered. We know exactly the
amount of diversity that is being lost, all of which has an immediate
impact on climate change and world health. The World Health
Organisation makes that clear. So, yes, the sceptics and scientists may
argue, but there is already a huge body of
fact.</div><a name="0806259000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000456"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> That is a sound point, but it does not detract
from my party&#146;s essential tenet. We believe that the Climate
Change Committee is an important innovation&#151;it is, perhaps, the
most important tangible part of the Bill&#151;and that all support
should be given to it. Therefore, we urge the Government to allow it to
produce its preliminary recommendation as soon as possible. I have no
doubt that it will advise a significant raising of the target, but we
believe that the target would have more impact, importance and
authority if it were set by that committee rather than by politicians
in this Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div><a name="0806259000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000457"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> As the hon. Gentleman went on with his remarks, I
became more and more concerned. He is trying to argue against the
formulation of &#147;at least 80%&#148; by saying that it would be
based on a political judgment, not on scientific evidence. My argument
is that it is based on the latest evidence from the most authoritative
international body of climate scientists. Why does he not accept it? Is
it simply that he prefers a British committee to an international one?
That is rather like the point earlier that the guillotine is not
particularly British. A guillotine is a guillotine, regardless of the
nation in which it is used. Why does the hon. Gentleman not accept the
clear, overwhelming, substantial consensus that the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change expressed in its latest report, which was its
fourth assessment
report?</div><a name="0806259000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000458"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns,
but, having brought the new committee into being, having invested it
with such authority and having asked it to make important decisions, we
should, on this most important of decisions, defer to it. That would
involve only a matter of months and would not materially affect our
ability to hit the long-term 2050 target. Allowing the committee to
make the judgment call on what the target should be would, I hope, have
a significant effect on public opinion and the authority and
credibility of the target&#151;far more so, I am afraid, than if the
decision is made simply by politicians, on whatever basis we make our
judgment.</div><a name="0806259000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not doubt the science that informs the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument. All I am saying is that to win the support of the public,
whose good will we must win if we are to be successful in the battle
against climate change, it is vital that the higher target, which will
be stretching and incredibly ambitious, enjoys the utmost authority. We
would invest it with greater authority if we were to allow the experts,
not politicians in this Room, to come forward in the next few months
with a
recommendation.</div><a name="0806259000346"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

Walley</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, North) (Lab): It is a great
pleasure to serve on this Committee, to have the opportunity to
influence what will be Government policy for many years to come, and to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I am sure that you
will keep us in order and ensure that we make the best possible
contribution to the Bill today. I am grateful for the opportunity to
speak in favour of amendment No. 2 in a probing way. It was moved by my
hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North, who has served for many years
on the Environmental Audit Committee, as has the hon. Member for
Bexhill and
Battle.</div><a name="0806259000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall speak briefly, because it is important to give the Minister the
best possible ammunition so that when he is dealing with civil
servants, Governments and his Cabinet colleagues, he knows the strength
of feeling among my hon. Friends who have signed the amendment tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths),
who spoke in the Chamber
earlier.</div><a name="0806259000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is most important to get this right. The hon. Member for Bexhill and
Battle said that it is important to leave the matter to the Committee
on Climate Change 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>and scientific evidence. My perspective is that our starting point
should be the scientific evidence, which initially led to 60 per cent.
and then to &#147;at least&#148; 60 per cent. as being so
importantly the starting point for this Bill, and being put in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806259000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Bill, when it has completed all its stages, is to be up to date
with the latest science, it will not be about leaving it to the
scientists, but about the marriage of politics and science, and
ensuring that we have informed legislation that is fit for purpose and
that will stand the test of time. We all know that time is running out
for dealing with the matter, so it is all the more urgent to get the
starting point
right.</div><a name="0806259000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that 60 per cent., or &#147;at least&#148; 60 per
cent., is not enough. There may be worries that if we do not go further
we will send the wrong message and dilute the Government&#146;s
credibility, which they deserve for having introduced such an
innovative Bill. I wonder whether some of the opposition from the hon.
Member for Bexhill and Battle, who speaks for the Conservative party,
is on account of not wanting the Labour Government to have the credit
for introducing the best possible Bill. He said that we should leave it
to the scientists, but we already have that
here.</div><a name="0806259000177"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000460"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> May I say on behalf of Opposition Members that we
want the Government to get on as quickly as possible with all these
measures? We are not in the business that the hon. Lady suggests. It is
a tough enough time, and we are wholly supportive of the Government if
they are prepared to do what they say. To suggest otherwise is not only
untrue, but not in the Labour&#146;s party political interest. Please
will she not say that to the
Committee?</div><a name="0806259000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000461"></a>Joan
Walley:</b> I am heartened to hear that, and I take note of
what the right hon. Gentleman says. He has a long-standing record on
the environment.</div>
<a name="0806259000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">My perspective
is that we need the strongest possible targets in the Bill. The Stern
report makes clear the difference between a 2<span class="Sup">o</span> C temperature
rise and an even higher rise. If we do not get our targets right at the
start of the Bill, we could experience all sorts of unwanted
consequences that we could have prevented simply by having the
strongest possible targets at this
stage.</div><a name="0806259000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later
this week, I shall chair a meeting on public health to consider the
international threat of malaria and other public health issues. All
such public health problems will be exacerbated if we do not set the
right target.</div>
<a name="0806259000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Minister takes a close interest in the work of the Environmental
Audit Committee. In the past couple of years, we have concentrated our
work on the issue of climate change. In an earlier report, the
Committee highlighted the incoherence of the 2° C aim and the 60
per cent. target. We feel that there is a real gap between the
two.</div>
<a name="0806259000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
record, may I remind the Committee of the previous recommendations of
the Environmental Audit Committee? The majority of evidence that we
considered suggested strongly that the 60 per cent. target was
inadequate. The target was based on a recommendation made by the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution in 2000. The royal
commission&#146;s overarching aim in making the recommendation was
that global warming 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>should be limited to a rise of no more than 2° C, according to
the science at the time. That was adjudged to require stabilisation of
the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide at 550 parts per
million by
mid-century.</div><a name="0806259000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the evidence that we have received points to the fact that, on
scientific evidence alone, we now know&#151;in June
2008&#151;irrespective of what the Committee on Climate Change may
come up with later, that our starting point should be at least 80 per
cent. rather than the more conservative 60 per cent that we have in
front of us
today.</div><a name="0806259000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Victorian times, a colliery in my constituency was the first to produce
more than 1 million tonnes of coal a year. We have a huge debt of
honour to deal with that legacy of carbon that our industrialised
nation has produced. We cannot waste any more time in starting off with
80 per cent. I know that the Minister cannot say to the Committee today
that that is what he will now accept, but many of my colleagues
genuinely believe that, in signing this amendment, they wish the
Government to get the best possible credit for the best possible
target.</div>
<a name="0806259000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
business and the business community, it is important that we establish
from the outset the certainty with which we expect industry to meet our
objectives. The sooner that we have included in the Bill targets that
are consistent with scientific knowledge but realistic enough for us to
meet, the sooner we will be able to make progress towards getting to
where we want to be. That will mean that all of us&#151;not just us
in the UK but over the planet as a whole&#151;will not feel the worst
effects of failure that were outlined in the Stern report. I ask that
the Minister take into account the genuine desire and the responses
that many of my colleagues have given to the non-governmental bodies
that have fought so strongly on this campaign. We do not want to
achieve the impossible, but we want to ensure that what we do is right.
If at least 80 per cent. is right, we should be working towards that
now.</div><a name="0806259000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000462"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> We have heard two well-informed, thoughtful and
persuasive contributions. The debate has been unusual in that we have
the hon. Members for Bury, North and for Stoke-on-Trent, North arguing
against the Government&#146;s position and the Conservative party
supporting it. I slightly wonder which way I am leaning. It is striking
that, printed on the amendment paper today, we have the names of more
than 80 Labour Members who have endorsed the 80 per cent.
cut.</div>
<a name="0806259000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you will be
well aware, Mr. Cook, the parliamentary arithmetic is such
that, with 80 Labour Members, every single Liberal Democrat MP and all
the nationalists, who I believe support the 80 per cent.
target&#151;I do not know what the Democratic Unionists
think&#151;that coalition alone, plus the Conservative Party, would
guarantee 80 per cent., so the only thing that stands between this
country having a scientifically up-to-date 80 per cent. target is the
Conservative Party. That is a statement of fact. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>]
I say that because the Government&#146;s reluctance to endorse the 80
per cent. target would not matter if the Conservatives were to back it,
because there are enough on their own side to carry it anyway. It is
therefore the position of the Conservatives that is pivotal, so, in a
moment, I want to focus on the logic, to the extent that there is any,
of the arguments used by the Conservatives.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div><a name="0806259000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The starting
point must be science and the 60 per cent. figure was not a political
number but a scientific one. It is just an old scientific number and
the people who came up with the old number now think that using the
same sequence of logic that gave us a figure of 60 per cent.
would now give us a figure of 80 per
cent.</div><a name="0806259000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Angus points out, the Bill still gives the
Government the power to vary the figure up or down, so the figure is
not definitive but indicative. That is the point. There is a perfectly
legitimate argument for saying, &#147;Let&#146;s not have a number
in the Bill at all.&#148; The Government could have introduced a Bill
to create a committee that was given a remit and told to come back with
a number that would then be considered, but that was not the avenue
that the Government went down.</div>
<a name="0806259000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer again
to the infamous long title of the Bill. The first handful of words
are:</div>
<a name="0806259000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A Bill
to Set a target&#148;.</div>
<a name="0806259000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tempting though it is to
argue that another strategy could have been adopted, given that the
wording of the Bill starts
with:</div><a name="0806259000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
Bill to Set a target&#148;,</div>
<a name="0806259000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">we cannot fail to have a
target.</div>
<a name="0806259000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
question is, do we have what seems to us the right target, or a number
that we all think is the wrong target? I find it incredible that the
one person who has spoken for retaining the wrong number himself
accepts that it is the wrong number. I fully accept that we do not know
definitively that 80 per cent. is the right number, but the latest
scientific evidence is that, indicatively, 80 per cent. is
closer to the right number than 60 per
cent.</div>
<a name="0806259000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000463"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I was not arguing against the number. All I was
saying, with the greatest respect, is that the international experts on
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change would have rather more
locus on public opinion than even the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="0806259000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000464"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Okay, we have started. However, what about 60 per
cent.? We have all just accepted that 60 per cent. has an origin. The
hon. Gentleman is backing 60 per cent., I suppose in small
&#145;c&#146; conservative fashion, because, like Everest, it is
there. However, 60 per cent. had a logical basis and that logical basis
now lends itself to a different number but he is not prepared to follow
through the logic of how the 60 per cent. figure came
about.</div><a name="0806259000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000465"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Surely it is perfectly reasonable to say that the
Government produced the Bill at a time when the 60 per cent. figure was
sensible. When it became clear that there was a real reason for
change&#151;I am committed to 80-plus, I make no argument about
that&#151;the Government took two steps that seem perfectly
reasonable. I am loth to fall out with the Government when I do not
need to. There were two steps: one was to say &#147;at least&#148;,
which made sure that we knew in which direction the target was going;
the second was to turn to the committee of experts that the Government
were setting up to say, &#147;What should the figure be?&#148; It
seems to me that that is a perfectly reasonable way to proceed. One
could go down a way that says, &#147;We will put it up to 80&#148;,
but having asked the committee of experts to come up with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>a figure, to choose another one would be to undermine the committee
itself. Therefore, although the hon. Gentleman can say that it is a
pity that we do not all agree, it is not reasonable to say that those
who take the view that the committee of experts should fix the figure
are somehow
unreasonable.</div>
<a name="0806259000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000466"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes a number of points,
none of which I agree with, but I will address them in
turn.</div><a name="0806259000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman raises the issue of the standing of the committee
of experts and that is clearly important. The first thing to say is
that that committee has got a socking great amount of work to do. It is
not just advising on the 80 per cent. Figure, but has a long list of
things that it has to do and on which its opinions are vital. Aviation
and shipping is one, but there are many others. It has got a huge
programme of work on which its views will be taken incredibly
seriously.</div>
<a name="0806259000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="0806259000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
if we were not asking the committee to look at the 80 per
cent.&#151;&#151;in fact, we are still asking it to look at the 80
per cent., that is the important point&#151;it would have a huge
amount of work to do. I understand that it has a part-time chairman,
which I find worrying, but we will come back to that point. The
committee has a critical role to play, a very short time in which to do
its work and I do not see anything in what we are saying that would
undermine its standing. Everyone knows that it has a very important
part to play, but we are still asking it to look at the question of
having an 80 or 60 per cent. 2050 target.</div>
<a name="0806259000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody is
suggesting that we tell the committee that we have made its mind up for
it. We are simply saying that when it is asked to think of a number,
there will be a number in the Bill. The question is whether the number
in the Bill should be our best guess, based on what we know, which is
where the 60 per cent. came from. That is the only question on these
amendments. The committee will still be asked for its advice, and so,
for example, if it comes back with 83 or 77 per cent., I would expect
the Government to take that seriously. There is nothing, in arguing for
moving from 60 to 80 per cent. that undermines the standing,
status or validity of the
committee.</div><a name="0806259000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is, however, a reason for putting 80 in the Bill&#151;&#151;one of
timing. The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, who is no longer in his
place, said, &#147;It&#146;s only a few weeks, what is a few weeks
among friends? The Bill comes back in October, gets ping-ponged, Royal
Assent in November, four weeks later, they say 80, Bob&#146;s your
uncle, we have got 80 per cent.&#148; We have not though, because, as
the hon. Member for Banbury says, the Government have not said they
will accept 80&#151;or anything&#151;if the committee comes up with
it. If the Minister were to tell us that if the committee says 80, the
Government will accept it, that would take much the steam out of this,
because it would then be a matter of weeks.</div>
<a name="0806259000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite
honestly, and with no disrespect, when I intervened on the Minister on
Second Reading, I expected a lot more wriggling and we did not get it.
It was absolutely clear that the Government do not guarantee up front
to commit to 80 per cent., even if that is what the committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>says. A general election could be two years away. If we allow 60 to
remain, even if the committee, which I respect, came up with 80, the
Government are not bound to accept it, so 60 could run for another two
years. We are talking about 2050, but the interim targets are also
critical and losing two years is a huge risk. It matters enormously
what number goes in the Bill. This is not a matter of weeks or of
gestural whatever, but of fundamental
importance.</div><a name="0806259000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman said that the insertion of the words &#147;at
least&#148; is progress. It would be progress if the Bill prohibited
downward revisions, but as I read it, it does not. It can be &#147;at
least 60&#148;, but the 60 can be changed to a lower number. As far
as I can see, there is nothing to prevent the Government from changing
it to &#147;at least 50&#148;, or &#147;at least 40&#148;.
There is nothing in the &#147;at least&#148; that binds them to go
upwards, so the words &#147;at least&#148;, rather as the words
&#147;better not&#148;, do not reassure me at
all.</div><a name="0806259000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
is this so important? The latest evidence that DEFRA itself has been
given is that to achieve the 450 ppm that is being talked
about, 80 per cent. is not fine but actually the bottom end of the
range. The range given by the Ecofis report to DEFRA in May 2007, just
a year ago, is 80 to 95. There are many who think, and I am one of
them, that 80 per cent. is not enough. I would love to be proved wrong
on that, but my reading of the science is that 80 per cent. is probably
not enough either. If we are going to have a number in the Bill, it
needs to be our best estimate of the right number, especially as that
number might hold for two
years.</div><a name="0806259000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key question is how do we convince the Conservative Opposition to back
80 per cent., since that is what it will take to get this number
through. I am not sure whether feeling their pain and saying that we
understand that it is all very difficult is the best way of doing it or
whether it would better to slag them off and say &#147;You say, vote
blue and get green, but actually that is not so.&#148; I would quite
like to take any old Conservative Member outside for a quiet drink and
get them to explain Conservative thinking to me. My working assumption
is that the reason the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle does not
support 80 is because his hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey
(Mr. Ainsworth), who speaks for the Conservatives on these
matters, wrote to all his colleagues saying, &#147;We think the Bill
is tough enough. Do not worry, do not frighten the horses, do not
frighten business. We will not beef it
up.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is important, because we are talking about targets that will have to be
implemented by Governments of all parties. The hon. Member for Bexhill
and Battle said that he would take very seriously what the committee
said, but I do not think he pledged himself to implement what it said.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The right hon. Member for Suffolk,
Coastal says that he did, but the hon. Gentleman is not in his place to
confirm either
way.</div><a name="0806259000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000467"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> The hon. Gentleman will see that my hon. Friend
said that a future Conservative Government would accept the figure as
proposed by the committee. The question is, will this Government accept
it? The argument is not&#151;could not&#151;be that the
Conservative party is in some way resiling from this. It is a question
of whether one thinks it more likely to gain the support of the public
if presented by a committee made up of experts or if presented by
politicians who are not at the top of the tree of popularity at this
moment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div><a name="0806259000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000468"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Again, the right hon. Gentleman makes a distinction
that is not there. Even if we amend the Bill to say 80 per cent., that
would not stop us asking the committee, as we should, for a number and
taking very seriously what it says. He is creating a false antithesis
between making the Bill as accurate as we can and asking the committee
for advice. We can do both. There is no problem with doing both. That
would be the point. I am happy to accept his assurance that the hon.
Member for Bexhill and Battle said that the Conservatives would
implement 80 per cent. I thought he said that they attach the highest
importance to it. Perhaps that is my misunderstanding. I am very
pleased to hear that they would do so.</div>
<a name="0806259000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the evidence, we heard that the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution argued for 60 per cent. eight years ago but that
the key figures on that commission, then and now, have argued that 80
per cent. is the up-to-date best figure. There are two avenues. There
is an argument that says there should be no targets and we should let
the committee do it, but the Government have chosen not to go down that
route, so that avenue is closed. We have a Bill that sets a target. I
cannot see why we should want to have a target that we all agreed was
the wrong number. We ought to have our best estimate, recognising that
we are politicians who read what scientists say, not scientists.
Surely, we ought to take, for example, what the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution said, what advice to DEFRA said, what the IPCC
has said. That is enough to be going on with to give us the right
ballpark figure. Surely, we want the right one not the wrong
one.</div><a name="0806259000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000469"></a><b class="B">Linda
Gilroy</b> (Plymouth, Sutton) (Lab/Co-op): It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook, and to have been
selected to serve on the Committee.</div>
<a name="0806259000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is already
evident that everyone is motivated to make this Bill workable. I want
to explain why I have not signed the early-day motion that this
amendment reflects. As I understand it, there is a more stringent
baseline target which is the subject of the amendment. It would demand
more aggressive policies. These policies need a great deal
more technical detail to know whether they are deliverable. The body of
fact on science, which is important, is not yet matched by the
body of technical detail necessary to ensure that the more stringent
budget that this amendment seeks is achievable.</div>
<a name="0806259000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is vital
that we do not set ourselves up to fail in the early years in the first
carbon budget cycle that is set. That would be the worst, most
irresponsible thing that we could do and would undermine the
credibility of the framework that this legislation seeks to set
up. It would be very bad for the work that the
Minister for the Environment will have to do in
international negotiations to bring others around to using a
similar framework.</div>
<a name="0806259000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is for
those reasons that I have not signed the early-day motion and stood
firm in explaining that position to my constituents, some of whom are
members of my climate change panel and many of whom are among the 1,600
students who study marine and environmental science at Plymouth
University and the 450 marine scientists who are very knowledgeable
about climate change and keep me on my toes in the position that I have
been taking and will continue to
take.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000470"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> That last speech led me to be very worrying
indeed. If we are proposing that the targets we set should be affected
by our ability to meet them rather than by the danger posed to the
future of the world, we may as well pack up and go home. The target has
to be set on the basis of what we need to do if we are to protect the
climate for our children and grandchildren. There ought to be no
argument in the Committee as far as that is concerned. We can argue
about where to put the target and how to reach it, but the Committee
must be united on the basis that the target is unconnected with our
ability to deliver it, because it is forced on us by the effects of
climate change. To say otherwise would be like saying we will fight a
war when we know we have enough guns, but in the meantime, if we are
overrun, we cannot fight the
war.</div><a name="0806259000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000471"></a>Linda
Gilroy:</b> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for giving me the
opportunity to clarify my point. It was rooted in his earlier
observation that the credibility of politicians is low, while the
credibility of those on the Committee on Climate Change is much higher.
The people who need to be persuaded to take action will therefore be
much more likely to sign up to doing so if target setting can be
accompanied by a delivery
plan.</div><a name="0806259000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000472"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> That is all right as long as the hon. Lady agrees
with me that the two things are separate and that we need to have an
accredited body give us the figure at which we have to aim
seriously&#151;rather than aim with the thought that we might not get
there&#151;and which would deliver our real purpose. We already have
such figures, and most of us think it will be something in the region
of 90 per cent., though it might be more than that. Our real purpose,
which we have had a long discussion about, and which we have agreed on,
is to keep the temperature rise below 2° C. We recognise that
the UK has to give more than its fair share, for all kinds of historic
and moral reasons. The question is how we deliver that target. I am
instinctively an enthusiast for getting down to it, pushing up the
number and telling people exactly what we are going to do. That is the
way I work.</div>
<a name="0806259000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
concerned, however, about the nature of this committee. If the
Government had not done what they have done, I would have been wholly
happy with putting in a new target. But they have put us in a very
difficult position by saying that they think the committee ought to fix
the target, showing that they recognise that the target is likely to
require upward revision by putting these changes into the Bill, and
giving the committee as its first task the need to review the target in
the Bill.</div>
<a name="0806259000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northavon said clearly that, even if we were to agree with
him, the Committee on Climate Change would still have to look at the
target figures, so I do not think that any argument about the committee
being very busy holds up. It will have to do that anyway. If I were
chairing a committee of that sort, the very first thing I would want to
do would be to review the terms under which we were working and see
that we were on all fours. Otherwise, we might find that we were
halfway through some serious discussion and discover fundamental flaws
in the understanding of this very eminent committee as to where it
started from and where it was aiming. I do not think we can avoid that
discussion, and as we are all agreed that it is going to take place, we
ought not to give the committee any more to
do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div><a name="0806259000348"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="0806259000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem for me is this: we know that the 60 per cent. figure is in the
Bill because all those years back, when the Bill was first read, that
was the most sensible figure to put in according to science. We could
have given no figure at all. The hon. Member for Northavon is right
about that. Most of us would have been unhappy with that, because it
would have introduced a degree of vagueness. I would not have liked it
much, but we could have done that. However, we did not.</div>
<a name="0806259000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill has
been discussed throughout with the figure of 60 per cent. in it. As the
Minister said, it has gone through the full parliamentary procedure on
that basis, and here we are now. The question is how we think the
target should be revised in future, given that we all agree that
revision upwards is necessary. We now have provision for a committee,
which we did not two years ago when the Bill was first drafted. By some
sleight of hand&#151;I do not know what, and I shall not criticise it
because I am very pleased about it&#151;it appears that the chairman
has already been selected, even though we have not got the Bill through
yet. Nevertheless, that seems perfectly reasonable because we all agree
that we want
it.</div><a name="0806259000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have the committee and it can get on with its job. As its first task,
it could produce a clear figure for the target. There would be great
advantages to that, and they were presented well by my hon. Friend the
Member for Bexhill and Battle. Now that we have a committee, it is
sensible for it to be the body that fixes the target. If we did not
have a committee, we would have to do something else. In the past,
because there was nobody else, politicians did their best. Now that we
have a committee, I am happy with the Government&#146;s proposal for
it.</div><a name="0806259000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am less happy&#151;indeed, dismayed&#151;that that there is not a
natural, full part of that proposal that states, &#147;When the
committee that we have had the confidence to appoint decides what the
target ought to be, we, the Government, guarantee that we will
implement it.&#148; That seems to me a clear distinction between the
position that I hold and the Minister&#146;s position. I want him to
understand how serious the situation is. There are those who want to
put the 80 per cent. target in the Bill, and many of us would normally
be happy to do that. We are held back from feeling that way because the
Government have instituted what could be a perfectly proper procedure
that we would like to follow. This will be not be the only time when
the figures need to be revised. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton,
is right that we should have a system that people recognise as a proper
one for such revisions.</div>
<a name="0806259000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Angus pointed out the problem that, if the Government are to
be able to make changes as we go along, it is conceivable, although
unlikely, that they could make changes downwards, against the science.
The best protection against that&#151;on this point I disagree
strongly with the hon. Member for Northavon&#151;is to have a very
clear process whereby the Government ask the committee to set the
target and then agree to make the order for a target change to take
place.</div><a name="0806259000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000473"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am sympathetic to the argument that the right
hon. Gentleman, who is very experienced, is making. We have been
arguing that the setting of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>initial baseline target is not a simple scientific judgment but a moral
and political matter, especially in the light of our voting to remove
the broader 2° outcome target from the Bill. Surely it is vital
that an appropriate and fair initial percentage reduction target is set
by the Government, not the
committee.</div><a name="0806259000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000474"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman on that point
and I shall explain why, because there is an important distinction to
be made. We have a real problem in this country understanding and
supporting the battle against climate change. Those of us who believe
that this is the most important physical threat to
civilisation&#151;I think that every Committee member does&#151;are
clear that, once we have taken that view, we are bound to do something
about it, not just for scientific reasons and not even just for
personal reasons and to save our families, but for moral reasons. If
this threat exists, we have to do our bit to defend the future against
it.</div><a name="0806259000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
setting targets, we are giving people the best indication of the
scientific demand. The morality arises in respect of the need to take
the measures that are necessary to meet that best indication. In other
words, the figure has to be fixed on the best science that is
available, because we have to be able to tell the doubters, who are not
in any particular party. One of the most vociferous believers in what I
shall call, for the sake of shortness, the Lawsonian thesis, is a
Liberal Democrat.</div>
<a name="0806259000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000475"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Give us his name and
address.</div><a name="0806259000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000476"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I will not name that person, because it would
embarrass both him and
me.</div><a name="0806259000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figures will have much more power if they are clearly the result of the
scientific assessment of the situation. We are the people who will then
say, &#147;If that is what the science says, we as politicians will
make it the political figure.&#148; I hope that we, as moral
politicians, believe that we have a moral imperative to ensure that the
measures that will ensure that we meet those figures are passed and
carried through and acted on by business and individuals. If the figure
is to have the proper effect on the public as a whole, its
establishment must be regarded as untainted, if I may use a biased
word, either by politics or some moral order. The figures should be as
scientifically clear as possible, although we are dealing with a
complex
science.</div><a name="0806259000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000477"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I share the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that
the Government should listen to and follow the expert committee, but he
said that we are afraid that they may not do so. In the event that they
do not listen, does he accept that the number in the Bill is our only
insurance policy? He said himself that the number should be based on
the latest
science.</div><a name="0806259000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000478"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I am trying hard to create the best circumstances
to ensure the success of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman tempts me to
become cynical, but I will not be cynical because I have been impressed
by the fact that the Government have moved further than I thought they
would on a number of issues, although there are many things on which
they have not done enough. I shall not talk about hydrofluorocarbons
and a range of other things that I could list, because I know that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>almost every Labour Committee member agrees that those things should
have been done. We draw a line under that. However, we accept that a
range of things have been done, including this
Bill.</div><a name="0806259000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee has a duty to try to make this as good a Bill as possible and
to enable the Government to give as much as they can to it. I have done
the job that the Minister is doing, in effect, and I know that it is
not always easy to win even one&#146;s immediate friends over on some
of the essential issues. I accept the Minister&#146;s argument, which
is that the Government have already shown that they have tailored the
Bill to use the committee to proper extent and that they are asking it
to set a new target and to indicate that a new target is likely to be
necessary. The one thing that remains is an assurance that, when that
is done, the Government will accept that
target.</div><a name="0806259000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000479"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> Is not the difficulty with the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument simply that he puts enormous emphasis on
the importance of following the most expert scientific advice but that
the most expert scientific advice actually comes from the IPCC? The
Committee on Climate Change is not made up entirely of scientists. In
fact, as his colleague pointed out, the chairman is a part-time
chairman who was previously a director of the Confederation of British
Industry. The committee is made up of some scientists, some economists
and others with whose specialisms I am unfamiliar. If he really
believes that the target must be based on the best available science,
it must be based on the advice of the IPCC. It really is not good
enough to say that because it is an international committee of experts,
it is somehow less important than a British committee of people who are
not entirely experts on climate
science.</div><a name="0806259000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000480"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I will not go too far down that road, but it seems
that what we have is an argument about the nature of the committee. As
I understand it, we have set up a committee that has a strong
scientific membership, a strong economic membership and a strong
membership who can look at such things in the round. Some of the things
that it will be asked to do will not primarily involve science but the
interpretation of science within the economic sphere, so the committee
has to have a balance of people. When the committee comes to make
decisions on the science, it will, of course, draw properly and
entirely on the best available science. The fact that Lord May is one
of the members makes that absolutely clear. It will then make its
considered
judgment.</div><a name="0806259000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be difficult for the public to argue in any sense that the
judgment is a political one. It will be difficult to make the argument
that some newspapers will try to run that it is a decision of the
Government, or of enthusiasts. It will be seen as being as good a
statement of the science as can be made, not just by scientists but by
those who are looking at the science from an economist&#146;s point
of view. That is actually rather important, because some people
attacked the IPCC for saying that the science was very good but the
economists were very bad. That is one reason why Nick Stern was asked
to do the job. He upset the sceptics because they thought that he would
say the opposite of what he said. As a result, what he said was
stronger.</div><a name="0806259000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government proceeded in a sensible way but I seriously say to the
Minister that they have now put themselves in a difficult position.
Having presented a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>sensible proposal that commended itself to the only other party likely
to form a Government&#151;let me put this most delicately&#151;and
gaining the agreement of all parties likely to form a Government, they
have now suggested that there is a possibility that the
committee&#146;s decision would not be
accepted.</div><a name="0806259000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
find it difficult to believe in that possibility. Imagine this: the
Government ask the official committee, which they set up, to produce
something, and then they say, &#147;We are frightfully sorry, but we
will not accept it.&#148; Do the Government really think that that is
a political possibility? It is a further step down the slippery slide
that they have been going down. I cannot believe that they really mean
to suggest that they want to hold in reserve the ability to say to the
Committee on Climate Change, &#147;We asked you to give us a target.
We have accepted that the target in the Bill is wrong, but we will not
accept your target.&#148; That appears to be what the Minister
said.</div><a name="0806259000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
me, the key issue is that that approach has put the Opposition, and, I
believe, Labour Members, in a difficult position. There are Labour
Members who would be perfectly prepared to go along with this
arrangement&#151;many would have some sympathy with what I have
advanced as the philosophical basis for what is being done. They are
going to have to come to terms with the Minister explaining to them
that, despite all that, the Minister will still retain the choice. That
would not even be a theoretical choice. He has not said, &#147;We
cannot conceive of occasions in which we would not.&#148; Such a
phrase is possible, but he has not said that. He said no. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Banbury said, that was not a glimmer, but a
spotlight&#151;no.</div><a name="0806259000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="0806259000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
much as I am pleased that the Minister&#146;s reply was not a
wriggle&#151;he does not wriggle and said he cannot, which fascinates
me physiologically&#151;I must say that he now has an untenable
position. I do not think it possible to say to the Committee, &#147;I
want the independent committee to make that judgment, because it is
better made there than by politicians. I have asked it to do that, and
I have amended the Bill so that its making that judgment would be a
natural consequence of adding &#145;not less than&#146;,
but I am not necessarily going to accept
it.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000481"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes a strong case for
Labour members of the Committee feeling uncomfortable with the scenario
that he has described, but a lot of Labour Members do not support that
scenario. They say that we should have a tougher target of 80 per cent.
in the Bill Surely the Members who are in a difficult position are
those in the Conservative party who are tempting Liberal Democrats and
others to say that the Labour Government are being rescued by the
Conservative
party.</div><a name="0806259000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000482"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> No. Being frank with the hon. Gentleman, I am keen
to make sure that our commitments are clear, because we will have to
carry them through. To be blunt, it is all right for the hon.
Gentleman, because he will not have to carry them through, but we will.
We are committed to carry through what the Climate Change Committee
asks of us, and we have made that absolutely clear. Therefore, it is of
considerable importance that we put the Government in the same
position. It does 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>not matter, frankly, what the Liberal Democrats or other people think
about it. What matters is whether the succession of Governments commit
themselves to do what the body that they have set up asks, or are we
going to treat it as a kind of advisory council? If the Government mean
that the committee is not the one that we all fought for, that goes way
beyond the goal of 80 per cent. and to the very heart of the Bill. That
is the real issue for all of
us.</div><a name="0806259000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Climate Change Committee is merely an advisory committee with no
other strengths, the Bill is not the one that I fought for, that
Friends of the Earth drew up and that the Conservative, Liberal
Democrat and other parties stood behind. The Minister is putting
forward a solution that ought to be a joint solution&#151;a solution
of the consensus. Frankly, if he were to say that the Government agree
to implement the committee&#146;s decision at once, some of his hon.
Friends would not be too unhappy, even though they would like to change
the wording in the Bill, and the Minister would find that any revolt
would at least be reduced. However, if he repeats that he is not
prepared to implement a committee decision, it seems to me that it is
extremely difficult&#151;not for the Conservative party, the Liberal
Democrats or the Labour party, but for the Bill&#151;because that
would mean that the committee we believe in would not be the committee
that the Government think that they are setting
up.</div><a name="0806259000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the Minister thinks that we are buttering him up in the hope
that we will get a bit more out of him, but that is not the case. He
has shown himself to be one of the good Ministers. When people ask who
the good Ministers in government are, we put his name on the list. I
know that that is embarrassing for him, and it will probably stop any
possible promotion, but there is no doubt that that is what we say. We
say it because he has always been as good as his word. That is what
worries me, because his word in this case is pretty frightening. I am
not keen on this at all. It seems to me that he has given us reason to
doubt something that is much more fundamental than the 70, 80 or 90 per
cent. What we are doubting here is that the Government have the same
view of the Committee on Climate Change as the rest of us. We therefore
need a reply from the Minister not only to this debate, but to that
deep concern.</div>
<a name="0806259000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even those
Labour Members who want to vote with the Minister&#151;the case was
beautifully presented by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton, who is
just returning to her place&#151;will ask themselves, &#147;What
has happened to the Climate Change Committee?&#148; When the hon.
Lady talks to all those students, they will say, &#147;This
Government are not going to listen to the Climate Change
Committee.&#148;</div>
<a name="0806259000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have now said that the committee is merely advisory. If that is the
case, the members of the committee will wonder why they are members.
Why do we have such a good committee? Like us, its members thought that
the committee was going to be, in a real sense, the setter of the
course for this country to give a lead in the world on how to deal with
climate change. That does not mean to say that the Government would
have to sign up to every jot and tittle, but they would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>have to sign up to the target. If the committee cannot even set the
target, what is the Bill
about?</div><a name="0806259000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition parties, along with Friends of the Earth and others, agreed
that we needed to set a target when we compiled the &#147;Quality of
Life&#148; report, which I had the honour to chair&#151;my hon.
Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood was a member of the central
committee, if that is not too socialist a phrase. We saw the target as
the driving force in our battle against climate change.</div>
<a name="0806259000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I came to this
Committee believing that the Government had the right answer. I was
willing to support the Government, because I believed that they were
offering us the right way forward. I hoped that this Committee would
provide another example of the consensus that I am trying to build.
However, I am afraid that my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury has
caused the trouble. His accurate memory of what the Minister said means
that the Minister has either got to change what he said and
re-establish our belief in his belief in the primacy of the Committee
on Climate Change, or we will have to consider very carefully not only
this part of the Bill but every other part. Unless the Government are
bound into the consensus that caused the Bill to be created, we are in
a really difficult
position.</div><a name="0806259000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806259000483"></a><b class="B">Anne
Snelgrove</b> (South Swindon) (Lab): It is a pleasure to serve
under you again, Mr. Cook. I apologise to the rest of the
Committee for not being able to be present for the whole of the
sitting, because I had an unavoidable constituency commitment. I have
signed the amendment, and I believe that the solution to the
difficulties described by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal is
in amending the Bill to make the target 80 per cent. rather than 60 per
cent.</div><a name="0806259000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman has mentioned the Ipsos MORI poll in <i class="I">The
Observer </i>at the weekend, which apparently showed that a large
number of people are sceptical about climate change. I have looked up
the results of the poll, which asked people to agree or disagree with
the statement that many scientific experts still question whether
humans contribute to climate change. Six out of 10 people who were
asked that question agreed with the statement. Rather confusingly,
however, later in the poll three quarters of people who were asked
professed to being concerned about climate change, and we can take
comfort from that finding. I must also say, Mr. Cook, that I
am grateful to my portable computer for that
information.</div><a name="0806259000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, I take comfort from that finding, and I also take comfort
from the fact that the 80 per cent. coalition includes not only
well-respected NGOs such as Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and WWF,
but the women&#146;s institute and indeed Eurostar, from which I
received a briefing. The combined membership and influence of the vast
number of NGOs that have come together in that coalition will help to
drive understanding in this country on the importance of climate
change. I believe that there has been a sea change since the election
of 2005, which has put the environment and climate change right at the
top of our agenda. That is another reason why, as a Government, we must
show our understanding and commitment to upping the climate target to
80 per cent., because the people and groups in that coalition will be
looking to us for a very strong signal that we take this issue
seriously.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="0806259000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
Committee members have discussed the basis for the 60 per cent. figure,
which is a 2000 report from the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution. That report is already eight years old, and it was based on
IPCC evidence from 1995, which has been updated twice since then. It is
13 years since the scientific evidence was published, and we know that
the scientific data and our understanding of them have vastly improved
since then. Rightly, the Government have said that the 60 per cent., 80
per cent. or whatever target must be based on good science, but I
wonder whether basing a target on evidence from 13 years ago is good
science. We need to re-examine that issue. If we are going to put our
faith in the Climate Change Committee, which I thoroughly support, we
should set it stiff targets, because the scientific evidence
exists.</div><a name="0806259000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
the upper limit must be changed. I do not want to speak too long on
this issue, Mr. Cook, because many Opposition Committee
members have been waiting patiently to speak, and I have jumped in
ahead of them. I believe that the science is there, and our
constituents up and down the country, as well as the NGOs, expect us,
as a Government, to back the higher target. Also, 82 hon. Members, many
of whom are Labour colleagues, have signed the amendment, and more than
400 hon. Members signed a previous amendment and early-day motions. The
will in this House is there to make the target stiffer. Like Opposition
Members, I know that this is a good Minister who listens and takes
action. I hope that he will listen to the arguments about upping the
climate change target to 80 per cent. and take appropriate
action.</div><a name="0806259000253"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000484"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> It is a pleasure, Mr. Cook, to serve
under your chairmanship on this
Committee.</div><a name="0806259000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Climate
change is obviously an issue that has huge resonance with the public,
and I have probably had more letters and e-mails on it than on any
other subject over the past two years. Many organisations, including
Friends of the Earth, Christian Aid and Oxfam, have encouraged their
members to lobby on this issue. It was fairly apparent from the cards
that I received that some of my regular writers are members of numerous
organisations, and they sent me cards from them all.</div>
<a name="0806259000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
states that the target is &#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148; I
acknowledge that that gives scope for setting a higher limit after the
report from the Climate Change Committee is received, but why the delay
in agreeing the inevitable, which is that 60 per cent. will not be
sufficient? It is also worth noting that the Bill places no obligation
on the Government to accept that recommendation, although I accept that
politically it would be very difficult for them not to do
so.</div><a name="0806259000350"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="0806259000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an inherent contradiction in the Conservative party&#146;s
position, which was ably put by the right hon. Member for Suffolk,
Coastal. The argument seems to be that a scientific committee will
carry more weight than politicians and that people will accept it more
readily. The Ipsos MORI poll has been mentioned, but on many other
occasions&#151;we could all come up with our own examples&#151;the
public have remained utterly unconvinced of an argument, despite the
weight of scientific evidence. It is a fallacy to assume that a
scientific committee will carry much more weight than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>this committee or Parliament would. As I understand it, the Committee on
Climate Change has been asked to recommend a target, but responsibility
for formulating and implementing policy to meet that target remains
with us. I suspect that putting the matter to a scientific committee
will not necessarily get around the
problem.</div><a name="0806259000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a further inherent contradiction: we might put in the Bill the
committee&#146;s recommendation for 80 per cent., or whatever
it comes up with but, as has rightly been noted in interventions, the
Bill provides the Secretary of State with the power to amend that
target by order. I should perhaps ask the John Bercow question: will
that be subject to the affirmative or negative procedure? In any event,
however, there is no guarantee that the committee&#146;s
recommendation, if accepted, would remain unchanged. Furthermore, the
final impact assessment makes it quite clear that economic factors
could be brought into play when deciding whether to amend the
target.</div>
<a name="0806259000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also
makes it clear that economic and social factors can be taken into
account when deciding upon the target. Under the Bill, therefore, the
decision will not be based purely on scientific evidence. That is where
the argument seems to fall down. The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle
said that the Conservatives would accept the recommendation, but I
suspected that he was slightly hedging his bets even on that, because
of the provision allowing it to be amended. There is no guarantee that
it will not be amended. Everyone seems to be hedging their
bits.</div>
<a name="0806259000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that
we have to opt for the 80 per cent. target. Much has been said about
the report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which is
eight years old. Its chairman, and two former chairmen, have written to
the Government saying that they support the 80 per cent. target.
Friends of the Earth has also pointed out that although the
commission&#146;s target included all sectors, the
Government&#146;s proposal excludes aviation and shipping, which
accounts for between 7 and 10 per cent. of current emissions. If that
is correct, the target eight years ago would have been higher, if those
emissions had been included. However, we will come to that
later.</div><a name="0806259000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
WWF pointed out in its briefing that the IPCC concluded that to keep
increases below 2° C, worldwide emissions must be reduced by 50
per cent. by 2050, and a study by Ecofys concluded that the UK needed
to achieve a reduction of between 80 and 95 per cent. If that is
correct, even if we accept 80 per cent., we will be at the very bottom
of the recommended range, so we might have to go higher. Even the
Minister would probably accept that 60 per cent. is unlikely to be
enough. I wonder if, like the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, the
Minister is waiting for someone outside the political process to say,
&#147;This is the target that you need to go
for.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not seem to make any sense to put the figure of 60 per cent. in
the Bill when we all realise that the true figure must be much higher.
Whatever the figure in the Bill, it must be regarded as a floor to be
exceeded. I would argue that we need a realistic figure for that floor
to make a real attempt at tackling climate change.</div>
<a name="0806259000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has already
been said, we need to send out a clear signal that we are serious about
tackling climate change. The Government are rightly proud of the fact
that this is the first Climate Change Bill with targets and that the UK
is showing leadership on the issue, but that will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>true only if we show clearly that we are aiming for targets that truly
tackle the problem. If we incorporate into law a target that is clearly
inadequate, we will be seen to have shied away from tackling climate
change head on, which would be disastrous. We should recall that one of
the reasons why countries such as China and India would not sign up to
Kyoto was that they took the view that, given that the industrialised
nations of the west had created the problem, they should not have to
pay the price. We must show that we are prepared to pay the price of
tackling climate change and encourage those countries to do more to
tackle it.</div>
<a name="0806259000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although this
may be the first Bill to have a target in it, others are committing to
targets for their own economies of at least 80 per cent. Norway, an oil
and gas-producing nation like Scotland, had proposed a commitment of
100 per cent. Germany has proposed 80 per cent. and France 75 per cent.
The Scottish Government are to introduce a climate change Bill with an
80 per cent. target, and even several US states, despite the
Americans&#146; status as the bogey man of climate change, have set
an 80 per cent. target. Whoever is the next President of the United
States is likely to be much more amenable to setting targets for the
whole of the United States than the present one, and I understand that
Barack Obama has committed himself to an 80 per cent. target.</div>
<a name="0806259000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we do not
set this 80 per cent. target, we might find that rather than leading,
we are at the back of the pack. Whatever target we set, however, we
have to accept that measures will have to be introduced to meet that
target, and we face the real challenge of persuading business and our
constituents to take the actions necessary to achieve it. I suspect
that, in the long run, that will be much more difficult than agreeing
on what the target should be in the first
place.</div>
<a name="0806259000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000485"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> It is good to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Cook and I know that you will show your usual tolerance.
I am not a climate change scientist, but I am a lawyer and I have spent
the last 35 years of my professional life construing Bills. This Bill
has been very cleverly drafted to make it almost certainly judicial
review-proof. Whoever drafted it provided the fewest possible
opportunities for anyone to seek judicial review against the Government
for not delivering on the terms of the Bill. Interestingly, the bits of
the Bill from the Lords that the Government want to take out are the
measures that would actually provide some opportunities for judicial
review.</div>
<a name="0806259000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite
clear that the Government are seriously concerned that there should be
nothing in the Bill that would ever provide opportunities for judicial
review. It is a process Bill; a Bill that is about a target and a
committee. That committee has to have credibility. Ministers say that
so far as the targets are concerned, the Government will simply take
the advice of the Climate Change Committee, but they will not. All of
us have been Members long enough to understand the concept of the line
to take. On Second Reading, the Minister was asked whether he would
accept the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee. As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal said, there was absolutely
no dissembling, and the Minister was perfectly clear that the line is
to take was, &#147;No, there is no undertaking.&#148; If there is
no undertaking, we are pushed back to the question of the extent to
which we trust Ministers. As 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>my right hon. Friend also indicated, we have to be concerned about
credibility, but I shall come on to that in a second.</div>
<a name="0806259000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The longer I
am in this place, the more I become crabby, liverish and bad tempered.
I find that Ministers want more and more wriggle room. Let me give the
Committee a very simple example of that, based on my experience today.
I apologise that I was not here this morning. The reason&#151;it is
relevant to trusting Ministers&#151;was that I was visiting a site of
special scientific interest in my constituency on which the Government
wish to build an eco-town. I was there with the shadow Minister for
Housing and representatives of the local wildlife
trust.</div><a name="0806259000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister for Housing had told Members of Parliament that none of these
eco-towns were to be built on green belt, but 25 per cent. of this
proposed eco-town is on green belt, so I have been chuntering to her a
fair amount. Earlier this week, she wrote to me to
say:</div><a name="0806259000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have previously stated that no homes will be built on green-belt land
as part of these eco-town proposals.&#148;</div>
<a name="0806259000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The shadow Minister for
Housing thus said to the developers this morning, &#147;I understand
you are not going to be building any houses on the green belt.&#148;
They said, &#147;We are not going to be building any houses, but we
are going to be building commercial development on the green
belt.&#148; The line to take was totally accurate&#151;there will
be no building of houses on the green belt&#151;but there will be
commercial buildings on the green belt, so is it any wonder that I am
becoming increasingly liverish, crabby and distrusting of Ministers? In
the just over a quarter of a century that I have been in the House, I
have learned that one needs to tie Ministers down to the line to take
so that there is no wriggle room
whatsoever.</div><a name="0806259000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000486"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I wonder whether my hon. Friend remembers the
definition of truth that Cardinal Newman put forward: truth is measured
by what the audience hears, not the words that the individual utters.
In other words, it is what something means to the person who hears it.
That Minister meant my hon. Friend to believe that there was to be no
building on the green belt. I want to know from this Minister that the
Climate Change Committee will be able to recommend what it thinks right
and that this Government will accept
it.</div><a name="0806259000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000487"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend. I
think that the Minister has probably been doing some maths during this
debate. Between now and Thursday, when the Committee next sits, I hope
that he will reflect that it might be sensible to review his line to
take on this, because this addresses the whole integrity of the Climate
Change
Committee.</div><a name="0806259000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to echo the points that my right hon. Friend the Member for
Suffolk, Coastal made: the whole thrust of this Bill relates to targets
and the work of the Climate Change Committee. This is a process Bill.
If Ministers are effectively going to say, &#147;We are only going to
treat the Climate Change Committee as an advisory committee&#151;no
more and no less,&#148; what is actually left in the Bill? If the
Climate Change Committee is simply going to be some advisory committee,
the recommendations of which Ministers may or may not follow, it seems
to me that this is a pretty hollow Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div><a name="0806259000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">All members of the Public
Bill Committee can quote endlessly from the organisations that have
said that the target should be over 80 per cent. Practically every
moment, we see something from yet another organisation on our e-mail
systems. Let me give one example, chosen totally randomly from the
papers that I picked up this morning. The Royal Institute of British
Architects, the UK body for architecture, which has 40,000 members,
states:</div><a name="0806259000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
evidence does suggest our greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by
80 per cent. We strongly believe that it is essential for the UK to
achieve an 80 per cent. reduction by
2050.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="0806259000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that not a single member of the Committee believes that we will
not need a reduction in emissions of at least 80 per cent. by 2050.
There is no dispute about the target; the debate is simply about the
mechanics. Unless Ministers are prepared to give an undertaking that
they will implement the recommendations of the Committee on Climate
Change, I cannot see how this Public Bill Committee, or the House as a
whole, can put trust in them. We will have only a process Bill that
allows Ministers maximum wriggle room to wriggle out of making any
difficult decisions. We should not have such confidence in
Ministers&#151;this is too important for that. Unless the Minister
for the Environment is prepared to change the line that he takes on the
respect that he will give the Committee on Climate Change, the House
and this Committee will have to reflect on that when deciding how to
vote.</div><a name="0806259000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000488"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I apologise for being absent from the Committee
for part of the sitting. I was attending an event involving older
constituents who had travelled all the way from Gloucestershire. I
thank you for being tolerant of that, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="0806259000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
difficult arguments are being made. The hon. Member for Banbury has
just made a strong case for the need to remove wriggle room. I was
disappointed by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal, who
normally makes a very strong case for the toughest green measures
possible, with which I agree fully. I believe that he is co-author of
the Conservative quality of life commission report, which
stated:</div><a name="0806259000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
our view, the existing 60 per cent. goal is likely to prove inadequate.
Therefore our policy work will be guided by the premise that UK
emissions will have to be reduced by at least 80 per cent by
2050.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000489"></a>Mr.
Gummer</b> <i class="I">indicated
assent.</i></div><a name="0806259000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000490"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is nodding. If that is
still what he believes, I find it amazing that he has essentially
argued that we should have in the Bill a target that he knows to be
wrong. The hard-won progress in the opinion polls made by the right
hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) for the Conservative
party has been based at least partly on the proposition that voting
blue means going green. That proposition could die in this Committee
Room if this critical test of our commitment to combating climate
change is failed by the majority of Conservative members of the
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="0806259000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000491"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I am sorry to say this, but the hon. Gentleman
will search for every means of trying to make party politics out of
things. I know that he will, because I have heard it before. I am not
prepared to do that, but I am prepared to say to him that the
Government have revealed a far more important issue: the nature of the
Bill. It does not matter what figure we put in the Bill. We will need a
reduction of about 80 per cent, and that is what the committee will
say, so the issue is marginal.</div>
<a name="0806259000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fundamental issue is whether the committee will be merely advisory, or
whether its decisions on key issues will be taken as a clear fiat that
the Government will implement. Unless the Government tell us that they
will treat the committee properly, two things will happen. First, they
will find it difficult to get support from Conservative Members on many
other issues on which we might otherwise be prepared to support them.
Secondly, and in a sense more importantly, I do not think that they
will have a Climate Change Committee. Its members will not sit on it if
they think that when they make decisions in the areas that are supposed
to be their competence, those decisions will be ignored by the
Government. That is much more important than anything
else.</div><a name="0806259000282"></a>

making that important and well considered point, with which I have a
lot of sympathy. We might need to look at stiffening the role of the
Committee on Climate Change in other clauses, but clause 2 is about the
standing target in the Bill. If he wants to reduce the wriggle room for
Ministers and toughen the Bill, this is precisely where he has an
opportunity to do so. I will try to avoid playing party politics. If I
were doing that, I would have mentioned Henley as well as Witney and
Banbury.</div>
<a name="0806259000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is not simply why we need the 80 per cent. figure in the Bill, which a
lot of the Committee&#146;s discussion has been about. The other
question, which those who support the current wording have to answer,
is, as the hon. Member for South Swindon started to point out, why we
have the 60 per cent. figure in the Bill. The explanation is quite
clear: it came from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution,
which reported in 2000 and, as the hon. Member for South Swindon
pointed out, based its science on the second assessment report of the
IPCC in 1995. Given the lead times in the IPCC, the science itself is
probably even older. Since then, we have gained a huge body of further
scientific evidence and the third and fourth assessment reports of the
IPCC itself, which have moved on the thinking of most scientists about
this question.</div>
<a name="0806259000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Forgive me,
Mr. Cook. I have just realised that I have locked myself out
of some of the evidence that I was about to quote from my computer
screen. We will need some kind of induction in this new
technology.</div><a name="0806259000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2000, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution assumed that a
concentration of 550 ppm was sufficient to defend us against climate
change of more than 2° C above pre-industrial levels. A
ClientEarth briefing
states:</div><a name="0806259000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
report to the UK Government by consultants Ecofys indicates that at
average climate sensitivity, the EU must aim for a CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
concentration below 450 ppmv CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-equivalent. Even at this
level, the report&#146;s authors say we have a roughly 50/50 chance
of staying within 2°C. At 550 ppmv
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-equivalent&#148;&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div><a name="0806259000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">in other words, at the
level on which the 60 per cent. figure is
based&#151;</div><a name="0806259000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
are unlikely to meet the 2°C. Only at 450 ppmv
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-equivalent (370ppmv CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) are we likely to
meet the 2°C (with a 2 per cent. to 55 per cent. risk of
stabilising
above).&#148;</div><a name="0806259000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
briefing goes on to
say:</div><a name="0806259000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the UK, the Ecofys study shows that for a stabilisation target of 450
ppmv CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-equivalent, the UK needs to be aiming for 80 per
cent. to 90 per cent. cuts by 2050...Even at 550 ppmv
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-equivalent, the UK&#146;s contribution would require
cuts of 70 per cent. to 90 per cent., more than the current
2050
target.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is quite clear that the science has simply moved on from the numbers
that the Minister is talking about. The RCEP report assumed that 550
ppm would be sufficient, but it is clearly not
sufficient.</div><a name="0806259000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000493"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I understand both the point that the hon.
Gentleman is making and the evidence. That was one reason why we
announced a change in policy. Does he agree, however, that the
long-term goal to which he refers must take into account the trajectory
of the medium-term goals of carbon budgets in the meantime, because it
is the cumulative amount of gases that counts? One could have tougher
medium-term goals and a looser end target. Secondly, does he agree that
all this is based on a contribution to an internationally agreed
long-term goal that we do not yet know? In the context of those two
arguments, is this not a very interesting debate, but an academic
one?</div><a name="0806259000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000494"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The debate is far from academic. It is crucial
because it determines exactly how we are to construct the trajectory
and what it will be. If the targets are lower for both 2020 and 2050,
the trajectory will be smoother. If we tolerate higher targets and
allow decisions such as those on the Heathrow runway and Kingsnorth
power station to go ahead, and then find ourselves in need of making
more drastic cuts to meet the carbon budget, we will probably find that
the realistic target by 2050 is closer to 100 per cent. The starting
target is
crucial.</div><a name="0806259000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
international contribution is interesting and goes to the heart of why
the percentage matters. This is not simply a scientific question. It is
not simply about the UK&#146;s interpretation of the science, but
about the share of the overall international contribution that the UK
chooses to make. As we have said repeatedly, that decision is political
and moral, as well as
scientific.</div><a name="0806259000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2000, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution made assumptions
in addition to saying that 550 ppm would be sufficient. It also assumed
that all sectors would be included in that 60 per cent. target, so
aviation and shipping must be added. The 60 per cent. target in the
Bill does not include aviation and shipping, so clearly the reductions
will have to be greater. What is more, the commission was talking in
2000, and there has clearly been an increase in CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>emissions since then. The 60 per cent. that it was talking about
must now, by definition, be greater, because CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions
have risen in the meantime. The commission also clearly advocated that
the target should be kept under
review.</div><a name="0806259000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
are we now? We are in a position where even members of the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution and numerous past chairs who have
been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>cited are clear that the target, using the methodology from back in
2000, should now be 80 per cent. or greater. They
said:</div><a name="0806259000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;UK
Climate Change Bill targets are based on out-of-date science. In
tackling the global challenge of climate change, governments must
follow the latest science that clearly shows the need for the UK to

by 2050. This will require much more substantial action by 2020 than
the Government is currently
considering.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the authors of the original figure&#151;60 per cent.&#151;are not
convincing enough for the Minister, perhaps he should listen to the UN
Development Programme&#146;s report on human development 2007-08,
which
says:</div><a name="0806259000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Emission
targets in the Climate Bill are not consistent with the objective of
avoiding dangerous climate change. Our sustainable emissions pathway
suggests that developed countries need to cut emissions of greenhouse
gases by at least 80 per cent. by 2050 against 1990 levels, not 60 per
cent.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div><a name="0806259000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the rest of the developed world followed the pathway envisaged in the
United Kingdom&#146;s Climate Change Bill, dangerous climate change
would be inevitable. It would lead to approximate atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases in excess of 660 ppm
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>e, and possibly 750<span class="Sub"> </span>ppm CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>e.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
point that UNDP is making is that this is not simple science, but a
political judgment. It is about the share that developed countries,
including the United Kingdom, take of the successful trajectory to
reduce carbon emissions. That is not a scientific judgment, but a
political
one.</div><a name="0806259000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000495"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Why does the hon. Gentleman argue for 2° C?
The scenario that he paints would make it
worse.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000496"></a>Martin

me.</div><a name="0806259000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000497"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman asked the
question, because what he is arguing does not make arithmetic sense. If
he is arguing that a 60 per cent. contribution from the UK, if it were
copied by all countries in the world, would not be enough, he cannot
argue that 2° C is
satisfactory.</div><a name="0806259000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000498"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The UNDP report on human development from which I
am quoting says that if everyone followed our example and put 60 per
cent. in their legislation,
that</div><a name="0806259000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
correspond to a rise in average global temperatures of
4&#151;5°C, well beyond the dangerous climate change
threshold.&#148;</div><a name="0806259000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is perfectly consistent to argue for a higher percentage of carbon
emissions reductions and for 2° C, which would mandate a
similarly high percentage for
reductions.</div><a name="0806259000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other person I want to quote, briefly, is Sir Nicholas Stern.
Subsequent to the vote in the House of Lords, when he may have been
sympathetic to the Government&#146;s position, it has become clear
from what he has written that he has reflected and changed his
position. In <i class="I">The Guardian</i> on 30 November 2007 he explicitly
supported an 80 per cent. target for richer countries. He
said:</div><a name="0806259000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
a 50% reduction in global emissions by 2050, the world average per
capita must drop from seven tonnes to two or
three.&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0806259000305"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000502"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I took the decision to suspend the sitting for
15 minutes for one Division or 25 minutes for two Divisions. We were
informed during the first Division that there would be a second one,
but we were told later that we had been misinformed, so we are starting
three minutes late. We reconvene on amendment No. 2., and we are in
mid-stream with Mr. Martin
Horwood.</div><a name="0806259000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000503"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Thank you, Mr. Cook. I was quoting Sir
Nicholas Stern&#146;s new point of view that a 60 per cent. reduction
in carbon emissions is no longer sufficient and that we need something
in the Bill committing us to a reduction of at least 80 per cent. from
pre-industrial levels. For the benefit of the Committee, I shall
restart the
quotation.</div><a name="0806259000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Writing
in <i class="I">The Guardian</i> on 30 November last year, Sir Nicholas
stated:</div><a name="0806259000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
a 50% reduction in global emissions by 2050, the world average per
capita must drop from seven tonnes to two or three. Within these global
targets, even a minimal view of equity demands that the rich
countries&#146; reductions should be at least
80%&#148;.</div><a name="0806259000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
crucial phrase is the one about equity, because, again, the judgment is
not simply scientific. Sir Nicholas himself now accepts that a
political and moral judgment based on equity must be made. Others talk
about burden-sharing and international co-operation, but those are
political judgments that need to be reflected in the target that we put
in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806259000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
the target is in the Bill, it will set the framework&#151;the
methodology&#151;in stone. It would be the equivalent of taking the
methodology of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and
setting it in the Bill. The framework could then be varied by the
Committee on Climate Change, which could say that the science had moved
this way or that way and adjust the target accordingly, but the
parameters have been set in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806259000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to decide in this clause what a fair baseline figure is, based on
the most appropriate science and the previous methodology. We have to
choose a figure that sends the right signals to business, to NGOs such
as Friends of the Earth, which has campaigned so hard to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>get us to this point in legislation, and to other countries. We must
send a signal to them, because it is clear that they are beginning to
send a signal to us. France is setting a target of 75 per cent. by
2050. Germany is setting one of 40 per cent. by 2020 and 80 per cent.
by 2050. We have heard that Scotland is about to commit to 80 per cent.
California has committed to 80 per cent. by 2050, and Norway has
committed to 100 per cent. by 2050.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I think that the Minister is
saying from a sedentary position that those countries are using a
slightly different baseline date, but nevertheless their clear ambition
is to reduce emissions by far more than the 60 per cent. in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806259000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
overall picture is simply one of our taking as our critical baseline
figure the one in the Bill, which we all know to be wrong, which simply
cannot be a sensible way to proceed. It prompts the question why on
earth the Government are so keen to preserve a figure that is
universally regarded as incorrect. It raises the suspicion, which has
been set out by the hon. Member for Banbury, that it is intended to
allow the Government, rather than Parliament or the Committee on
Climate Change, some wriggle room to allow the Treasury, the Department
for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the rest of the go-slow brigade
the room to counter the arguments of the Committee on Climate Change.
The Government could say on a particular occasion that there was some
overwhelmingly important political, economic or other consideration,
and, despite what is in the Stern report, they would like on that one
occasion to moderate the target and the ambition. The figure allows the
wriggle room for the Government collectively to do exactly what the
right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal has described, which is to make
the Bill much less effective than it should
be.</div><a name="0806259000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000504"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I must point out to the hon. Member that he is
being relentlessly repetitive on points that have been made not only by
other Members but by him. I ask him to move his statement
on.</div><a name="0806259000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806259000505"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Cook.
I am drawing my remarks to a close in any
case.</div><a name="0806259000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal at great length and with great
eloquence asked us, in effect, to trust the current Labour Government.
The Minister and, indeed, Conservative Front Benchers are asking us to
trust both the Labour Government and a hypothetical Conservative
Government. I hope that the Committee will forgive those of us who
support the 80 per cent. target if we think that the safest option is
to have it in the Bill for future
reference.</div><a name="0806259000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debate
