Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Illsley, for today&#146;s proceedings.</div>
<a name="08110628000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had quite
a full debate on this group on Tuesday afternoon and I want to reflect
a little on the Minister&#146;s response to it. Before I do so, I
should like to refer to the comments that my hon. Friend the Member for
Gosport made about who should pull the trigger. He made them in the
context of the debate about the code and we will pick up on that in
clause 7. My hon. Friend and I share the same viewpoint on this. For a
variety of reasons we believe that the best body to pull the trigger is
not the Financial Services Authority but the Bank of England.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div><a name="08110628000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
gave a clear elucidation of those reasons on Tuesday. If we concentrate
on the efficiency of the regulatory system, there is a danger that we
forget about its effectiveness. The responsibilities of the tripartite
authorities are so clearly delineated in each other&#146;s minds that
sometimes there is no overlap or any form of check or scrutiny or
engagement in other aspects of their arrangements. That is why giving
the Bank of England the power to pull the trigger will give it a much
greater role in the supervision of the banking system.</div>
<a name="08110628000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
get the balance right. We do not want to have two regulators, but we
need to ensure that there is an effective check and there is no risk of
regulatory forbearance by one regulator. My party&#146;s policy is
that the Bank of England should pull the trigger but, as the Minister
knows, in the interests of passing the Bill speedily, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) indicated that we
would not be pursuing this matter now. We will leave this one for
another time. It is very much on our agenda to look at
this.</div><a name="08110628000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to go back to the Minister&#146;s remarks on Tuesday afternoon
and to focus on two points. The first is about flexibility. We
appreciate the need for flexibility in the code and the way in which
the powers are operated. The Minister talked about flexibility in the
context of making a statement on the use of powers and my amendment on
&#147;comply or explain&#148;. I understand the point he makes, but
there is a risk attached to flexibility that we need to bear in mind.
The code is being put out to consultation today and will be redrafted.
If it is too vague or opaque, or the need to comply with it is too lax,
it will undermine confidence in the way in which it is meant to
circumscribe the exercise of powers in the Bill. I will come back to
the comments made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall about the
benefits of that circumscription.</div>
<a name="08110628000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point is on the threshold conditions. The Minister indicated that the
FSA, in the light of the Bill, will look again at the threshold
conditions to ensure that the two things dovetail. When will the FSA
consult on a revision of the threshold conditions? Will there be fewer
conditions? I mentioned a couple of the conditions on Tuesday. Will the
adequate resources condition be the key condition in the context of the
Bill, and how much guidance will the FSA give on the conditions? One
concern is that too much opacity on how the conditions can be met or,
indeed, breached, will undermine confidence in the use of powers in the
Bill.</div><a name="08110628000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to go back to the central purpose of having the code in the
Bill and why the code is important. The Bill includes some quite
invasive powers: it gives the tripartite authorities powers to
interfere with the rights that creditors and investors would normally
enjoy. For example, it gives the tripartite authorities the right to
take control of the bank and to transfer part of its assets into a
bridge bank. The code is meant to provide confidence to creditors and
investors about how the powers will be exercised. Increased uncertainty
about that means that there is high risk in the eyes of investors and
creditors. Higher risk means an increase in the cost of capital, which
will make it harder for banks to raise capital, which will have an
impact on the wider economy. If the cost of capital of a bank
increases, so will the cost of the loans it makes to households and
families.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div><a name="08110628000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that
the Government recognise that, which is why they have accepted that it
is important that the code sets out the limitations on the exercise of
powers in the Bill. However, to give confidence to the sector, the code
needs to be explicit about the circumstances in which, and when, the
powers will be exercised. The Government must therefore produce a much
more detailed code if they are to allay any fears about the use of the
powers. They need to provide clear guidance to the tripartite
authorities rather than produce a rewrite of the explanatory notes, and
to set out, in the context of clauses 10, 11 and 12, the hierarchy of
the stabilisation options, and what is the preferred
option.</div><a name="08110628000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
only the code but the threshold conditions need to be more specific to
avoid the sense that they can be used in an arbitrary fashion. The
Government will argue that they need flexibility; that an overly
restrictive code will constrain the freedom of action. However, if the
use of invasive powers in the Bill is perceived to be unconstrained,
markets will make their own judgments on whether they should invest in
British banks. If the code as redrafted does not provide significantly
greater detail on how and when the powers will be used, there will be
demand for the constraints to be in the Bill rather than the
code.</div>
<a name="08110628000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government need to reflect on the tension between flexibility and
reassurance. At the moment, the code errs on the side of flexibility.
If that continues, the cost of capital will rise, and families will pay
the price through higher interest rates. Moving forward, the Government
need to think carefully about how the code should be redrafted to give
confidence to banks and their investors and creditors. Certainly,
conversations that I have had in the past few days with external
parties suggest that the code as currently drafted does not do the job
that people expected it to
do.</div><a name="08110628000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000179"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It is a
pleasure to welcome you to the Chair for this sitting, Mr.
Illsley. I spoke at some length on the proposed amendments to clauses 5
and 6 on Tuesday afternoon, and I do not intend to do so
today.</div><a name="08110628000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to say two things in response to the hon. Gentleman, the
first of which is on his point about the FSA and the need to explain
the situation. The FSA is looking at the guidance on threshold
conditions, not the conditions themselves, and plans to consult on it
in December. However, as I made clear earlier, I can confirm that
adequate resources and management suitability are key conditions for
assessment of the trigger.</div>
<a name="08110628000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
always decisions about what to put in primary legislation and what is
more naturally secondary legislation or required in codes of practice.
Those decisions are fairly straightforward in many instances, but in
others they are matters of judgment, with fine distinctions. We always
have debates about those
issues.</div><a name="08110628000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s general support for the Bill and I
note his comments on the code. As he says, we are consulting on it,
starting today, and also consulting on the secondary legislation. We
have been working closely with the expert liaison group and others to
ensure that we get the details of the secondary legislation right. I do
not think that there are any differences on intention or principle
other than on who exercises the trigger. There is genuine willingness
on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div>both sides of the Committee to have legislation and a code of practice
that does the job that we all want it to do. With those brief comments,
I hope that we can move
on.</div>
<a name="08110628000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000180"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s remarks. It will be
important for the Bill&#146;s progress through the other place, where
their lordships will be looking carefully at the revised code and how
it interacts with the powers, to get the balance right. My main concern
is that the balance between the constraints, which the code imposes on
the exercise of powers, is not right. I recognise the tension between
primary and secondary legislation and the code. I, and others, would be
more comfortable, if the code was beefed up, but people will make their
views known clearly through the consultation process. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="08110628000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="08110628000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
7</h4><a name="08110628000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">General
conditions</div><a name="08110628000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110628000181"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I beg to move
amendment No. 75, in
clause 7, page 4, line 27, leave
out &#145;not reasonably likely&#146; and insert &#145;highly
unlikely&#146;.</div><a name="08110628000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. The amendment is
also in the name of the hon. Member for Fareham, who will no doubt want
to say a few words. The clause, which covers general conditions, is
another important part of the Bill. The amendment is in tune with some
of the previous amendments discussed, which concern how and when the
powers, and the stabilisation powers in particular, are used, and their
effect on the enterprise that they are used upon. On the face of it,
the amendment may seem semantic, in that we are seeking to delete the
words &#147;not reasonably likely&#148; and replace them with
&#147;highly unlikely&#148;. In the Bill, we are attempting to
consider not just current conditions but conditions in the future when
this legislation may be used in different circumstances. Hopefully, it
will not be used in a general sense, but in the specific case of a
particular banking operation. The amendment refers to the timing of the
use of such powers, which is
crucial.</div><a name="08110628000151"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08110628000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
proposed regime should be invoked only when it is clear that all other
possibilities for retrieving the situation in which the bank finds
itself have been properly explored. Moreover, the board and the
advisers must have made every effort to prevent the failure and have
been given the necessary period of time to pursue such opportunities.
In fact, everything possible must have been done and must have failed
before the regime can be invoked. In such a situation, it is not just
&#147;reasonably likely&#148; but highly unlikely that they will
meet those threshold conditions.</div>
<a name="08110628000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, such a measure is all about timing. If at all possible, we
should try to maintain the integrity of the whole business. We should
consider the value of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>that business and the opportunity for it to continue. We should not take
precipitate action that would jeopardise that possibility.</div>
<a name="08110628000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving
action too late could jeopardise the possibilities for protecting the
depositors, which is the principal thrust of the Bill. None the less,
exercising those powers too early could jeopardise the interests of
other stakeholders in the business, so the timing is critical. Just as
we discussed the opportunity of exercising the powers in a flexible
way, so, too, the authorities will want as much flexibility as possible
in determining exactly when they introduce the powers.</div>
<a name="08110628000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is designed to raise the bar to protect, to a certain extent, the bank
and its directors in their efforts to maintain the enterprise. We do
not want action to be taken too early in the interests of depositors
without necessarily taking into account the interests of other
stakeholders. We are talking about pre-solvency situations. The
enterprise at that stage may be solvent, but it may not reach the
threshold conditions. There is a period of time in which there are
opportunities to save
it.</div><a name="08110628000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government should seriously consider the amendment, particularly in
light of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Fareham during our
debate on the last clause. The amendment will provide some measure of
confidence to those who are being asked to invest substantial sums in
the banks. It is likely that part of any operation to try to meet the
threshold conditions will inevitably involve recapitalisation or the
raising of additional capital. Going out to seek fresh capital when
there is a possibility that the trigger will be pulled because it is
&#147;not reasonably likely&#148; that the bank will meet the
threshold conditions is a whole lot different from going cap in hand
with a clear indication that it is highly unlikely that the trigger
will be pulled. To a certain extent, it will give a view on whether a
capital-raising exercise is a possibility. It may even jeopardise the
capital-raising exercise, thus defeating the whole purpose of trying to
maintain the entity as a whole.</div>
<a name="08110628000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although, it
may seem merely semantic to change the words, they are highly
significant. If we are moving the bar, or having the bar set at such a
low level as &#147;not reasonably likely&#148;, it will affect the
efforts of any bank under threat of not being able to meet its
threshold conditions to retrieve the situation. An awful lot of things
may not be reasonably likely at any one stage, but that does not mean
that they will not happen. Efforts can be made and negotiations can be
undertaken, but once they have been completed and it becomes clear that
any rescue measure seems to be beyond redemption, in that sense, it
then, of course, becomes highly unlikely. At that stage, it is
inevitable that the threshold conditions will not be met, and the
powers can be exercised.</div>
<a name="08110628000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, we should seriously consider those points because, as we noted
when we discussed the last set of amendments, confidence in the
marketplace, the cost of capital and the ability to maintain a
competitive operation within the general marketplace should not be
jeopardised. I have referred to the measure being just for depositors
and they are, of course, an important part of the legislation, but so
too are other aspects of the whole banking business. That includes
those who provide the capital for banks and the way in which banks
generally operate in the competitive marketplace. With those factors in
the mix, we should be careful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>before exercising the powers and we should ensure that the conditions to
be pursued are set at an appropriate level. The bar should not be set
too low. In addition, the authorities should not be brought in too
early as that could even be to the jeopardy of
depositors&#151;although not necessarily. However, it could certainly
be to the jeopardy of other
stakeholders.</div><a name="08110628000052"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000182"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I do not have much to add to the comments of the
hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, who highlighted the challenge
posed by the wording of the Bill. It certainly seems that there is a
low hurdle for the FSA to jump to trigger the powers. I
shall touch on the issue of time scale, which the hon. Gentleman also
mentioned. An institution might have a short-term funding problem for a
week, but the position might be resolved in a month. What is the time
scale for the exercise of the second condition? It is not clear how
much leeway the authorities would give a business in that situation. We
need to probe that matter. In part, it might be dealt with in a revised
code. The hon. Gentleman and I have opted to strengthen the constraints
in the Bill, but that might not be the best way, so we need some
clarity about when the condition applies. The Bill
states:</div><a name="08110628000141"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Condition
2 is that having regard to timing and other relevant
circumstances&#148;.</div><a name="08110628000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly
timing is a key factor. I am not sure what &#147;other relevant
circumstances&#148; those who drafted the Bill have in mind, but we
need to understand the context in which the power would be exercised
and how the regulator would define &#147;not reasonably
likely&#148; in relation to that
area.</div><a name="08110628000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000183"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Nobody wants precipitate action taken when a bank
gets into difficulties, but I also hope that nobody wants the situation
to be left so that it is too late to exercise stabilisation powers in a
timely manner. The question is what balance needs to be struck and what
judgments need to be made in that area? I fully understand the points
made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall; he wants to probe us
on the conditions and establish whether the bar is being set at the
right level. We believe it is and I shall explain
why.</div><a name="08110628000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110628000184"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Can my hon.
Friend explain why the FSA should be the one to pull the trigger and
how he wants the FSA to operate because there has been failure in the
regulatory regime? I want assurances about what the exact expectations
and the justifications
were.</div><a name="08110628000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000185"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall happily cover that point, although the
hon. Member for Gosport has raised it and we have discussed it on a
number of occasions, including on Second Reading and in debate on other
parts of the Bill.</div>
<a name="08110628000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
explain why the tests we are putting in place with these two general
conditions are the right ones. The purpose of the clause is to make it
absolutely clear that the authorities will not&#151;indeed,
cannot&#151;use the stabilisation powers until it is clear that a
bank is failing and that voluntary or regulatory action is no longer
appropriate to resolve the situation. Clause 7 has two conditions that
need to be met. The first is that</div>
<a name="08110628000142"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the bank is
failing, or is likely to fail, to satisfy the threshold
conditions&#148;.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div><a name="08110628000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second is
that</div><a name="08110628000143"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having
regard to timing and other relevant circumstances it is not reasonably
likely that (ignoring the stabilisation powers) action will be taken by
or in respect of the bank that will enable the bank to satisfy the
threshold
conditions.&#148;</div><a name="08110628000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
point of &#147;reasonably likely&#148; has been raised by the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall with his amendment and the word
&#147;timing&#148; was discussed by the hon. Member for Fareham in
his contribution. On timing, it is not appropriate to set in the Bill a
future time limit by which the bank has to demonstrate that it is
reasonably likely that it can turn the situation around. The two
conditions are to ensure that the bank is put into the special
resolution regime at the right time. The cumulative effect of both
conditions achieves that, as they cover a decision based on, in the
first instance, the current situation of the bank regarding
quantitative and qualitative conditions, and a decision about whether
the future turnaround of the bank is unlikely. Those decisions are
designed to ensure that the SRR powers can be exercised before the
banks enter insolvency. One reason for that&#151;as we have discussed
in relation to other clauses&#151;is to preserve whatever residual
value there may be in the failing bank, which is a point that the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall made strongly on Tuesday. Acting at that
time increases the chance of a private sector solution or a swift
resolution through a bridge bank. Given that fact, the reasonable
likelihood for the second test provides the right level of assurance
for stakeholders that voluntary or regulatory action will no longer
work, while increasing the prospect of a successful
resolution.</div>
<a name="08110628000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of
any of the stabilisation options also includes a strong public interest
test which we will debate in clause 8. As Lord Turner recently said to
the Treasury Committee, things can move very quickly when a bank is in
a failing situation. These are matters of judgment, but I do not think
that the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall
would help. We believe that the two conditions set the bar at the
appropriate
level.</div><a name="08110628000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North asked the familiar
question about why the FSA should pull the trigger rather than the Bank
of England. We believe that the FSA, as the regulator of firms, should
be the lead authority in deciding when a bank is failing. That position
was supported by respondents to the January and July consultations.
Giving the trigger to another institution would be likely to lead to
dual regulation of financial firms, which would be wasteful and costly.
Obviously&#151;I have made this point on a number of
occasions&#151;at such a time the tripartite authorities would be in
close contact, as they are
now.</div><a name="08110628000152"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="08110628000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Gentleman feels that he has to press the amendment, I will
encourage the Committee to oppose it. We believe that the test of
reasonable likelihood&#151;the two conditions in clause 7 and the
public interest safeguards in clause 8&#151;sets the right level, but
I appreciate the probing way in which he has pursued the
amendment.</div><a name="08110628000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000186"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I thank the Minister for his response. During the
debate on the last two or three clauses, I and the hon. Member for
Fareham have pointed out some potential unintended consequences of the
Bill. The principal thrust of the Bill is to protect depositors; it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>obviously designed to prevent runs on individual banks, and that is
absolutely right in today&#146;s situation. In many respects, it is
hard to disagree with the Minister, because if the principal thrust is
to protect depositors we want as much flexibility as possible to enter
into an arrangement to achieve that objective at the most appropriate
time. The hon. Member for Fareham and I were saying that that has
consequences regarding perhaps how capital can be raised&#151;the
cost of that capital&#151;the wider institutional market perception
of the Government&#146;s proposals and how deposit-taking
institutions undertake their business. We do not know the consequences
of course; we are trying to predict them. So often in this place we
rush headlong into legislation, with the right intention&#151;to
achieve a speedy response to an unfortunate event&#151;and then we
live to repent, because of consequences that we had not thought
of.</div><a name="08110628000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not press the amendment because the matter has been well
highlighted and ventilated in the Committee. However, I urge the
Minister and the Treasury officials to think about the consequences
that may unwittingly be brought about because of the fundamental desire
to protect in all possible circumstances the interests of depositors.
There are other interests that sometimes need to be
balanced.</div><a name="08110628000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is difficult to argue against what has been said on the main thrust of
the Bill. We were probing the Minister, and also pointing out that
there might be unintended consequences and that those might not be in
the greatest interest of the UK economy and the banking network as a
whole. That is the danger. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08110628000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="08110628000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000187"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in
clause 7, page 4, line 38, leave
out subsection
(6).</div><a name="08110628000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to probe how the special resolution objectives that were set out
in clause 4 interact with the power to pull the trigger. We will look
at the interaction between the objectives and other parts of the
legislation under clauses 8 and
9.</div><a name="08110628000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful to think about how the sequence of events is covered.
Clause 7 gives the FSA the power to pull the trigger, which will
determine whether the Bank or Treasury can exercise the stabilisation
powers referred to in clause 1(4).</div>
<a name="08110628000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
presents that as a linear process. The first step is either that the
FSA will determine that the Bank, under clause 8, may exercise the
stabilisation powers to enable it to sell a bank to a private sector
purchaser or transfer it to a bridge bank, or that the Treasury will
put the bank in temporary public ownership. The second step, if no
financial assistance is given, is that the Bank of England will decide
whether it should transfer the bank to a bridge bank or a private
sector owner. The FSA, having said that the trigger can be pulled, may
delegate the responsibility for what powers and options are used when
no financial assistance is given. If financial assistance has been
given, either the Treasury can take the bank into temporary public
ownership, or the Bank can use the stabilisation powers to transfer the
bank to a bridge bank or a private sector
provider.</div><a name="08110628000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
clause 7(6) appears to suggest that the FSA will act within a different
framework of objectives from the Bank and the Treasury. The objective
that will drive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div>the FSA in that context will be the need to meet conditions 1 and 2, but
it also appears that it will be driven by the objectives set out in the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. There is not a complete match
between those two sets of objectives, and after the FSA has pulled the
trigger the Bank of England or the Treasury might decide not to
exercise the stabilisation powers because they do not believe that to
do so would be appropriate in the context of the clause 4
objectives.</div>
<a name="08110628000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FSA might
pull the trigger, and the Bank and the Treasury could say, &#147;No,
we will not bother doing that because we do not think that we can
achieve our objectives after you pulled the trigger.&#148; So what
happens then? That might be part of the problem about the sequence of
events, but I am not sure that the process is as linear as the Bill
suggests. The Minister has said that the tripartite authorities will
discuss resetting all those things, but will they get to the point of
saying together that they would pull the trigger and take action so
that the decisions are made virtually at the same time? That way, the
FSA would in effect only pull the trigger if it believed that the Bank
or the Treasury would use their stabilisation
powers.</div><a name="08110628000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth pointing out that subsection (4) relates to our old friend
financial assistance. Given the debate we had on Tuesday about
financial assistance, it would be helpful to understand what sort of
financial assistance the Government envisaged in the context of the FSA
being able to pull the trigger. It would be helpful if the Minister
expanded on how the FSA&#146;s objectives under the Financial
Services and Markets Act interact with the objectives under clause 4
and how the decision-making process will work in practice, as opposed
to how it appears to work
legally.</div><a name="08110628000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000188"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendment looks at the FSA&#146;s decision
on whether the general conditions are met and proposes that that should
be subject to the SRR objectives, and I would like to explain why I do
not agree with that. A fundamental distinction needs to be made between
whether the SRR should apply and what actions should be taken. Deciding
whether the general conditions are met is an exercise in determining
whether the SRR should apply, not what actions should be taken in
pursuance of it.</div>
<a name="08110628000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SRR
objectives are relevant to what actions should be taken, and they
stipulate them clearly, but they should not condition whether it is
appropriate for the SRR to apply to a bank in the first place. The
general conditions relate specifically to regulatory and voluntary
action outside the SRR rather than action under it. That is important
in providing confidence to stakeholders and the market that
stabilisation powers cannot be exercised before other, non-SRR options
are deemed not appropriate. That was the point made by the hon. Member
for South-East Cornwall. It is right to consider what steps can be
taken before the trigger is pulled and stabilisation options are
considered.</div><a name="08110628000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
general conditions in clause 7 are linked to the threshold conditions
set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Therefore, in
exercising such decisions, the FSA will be acting according to its
objectives and principles under the Act. That is the point referred to
by the hon. Member for Fareham, and it is absolutely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>right that that should be the case. In deciding whether the general
conditions in clause 7 are met, the FSA would have regard to the rules
and guidance in the threshold conditions section of the FSA handbook,
which has regard to the statutory objectives set out in the
FSMA.</div><a name="08110628000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
conditions have been designed to give the market confidence that
regulatory and voluntary options have been explored before a bank is
put into the SRR. Given that, to impose a different set of objectives
over and above the principles and objectives that guide the
FSA&#146;s decisions under the FSMA would provide confusing and
possibly conflicting guidance to the FSA in exercising its discretion.
There is clearly a distinction to be made between the actions taken
under the SRR and whether the SRR should apply, which will depend on
the conditions being met and the FSA&#146;s exercising its
decision-making power in accordance with the rules and guidance in the
threshold conditions in its handbook.</div>
<a name="08110628000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, I hope that the hon. Member for Fareham will feel able to
withdraw his amendment. He raised an interesting point about whether
the FSA would pull the trigger if the Bank did not want to act. As I
have explained on a number of occasions, the decision to pull the
trigger is taken by the FSA, but it will be taken after close
consultation with the Bank of England and the Treasury. As various
consultations have made clear, it is not a linear process. Very few
things in real life are; I think that Einstein said that even a
straight line was not necessarily linear. Authorities would consult
each other on all decisions, as is set out in the Bill. In practice,
the intention would be that the decisions would all be taken and
announced together.</div>
<a name="08110628000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000189"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The clause goes to the heart of some of the
problems that we saw in the Northern Rock debacle. My hon. Friend has
described how he thinks the procedure will work in practice. How much
scenario planning&#151;war games or whatever&#151;has there been or
will there be to test how the procedures would work in
practice?</div><a name="08110628000153"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="08110628000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000190"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We can probably say that the relationship between
the Bank of England, the FSA and the Treasury has been forged in battle
over recent months. Extensive and close consultations have been held. I
do not think that circumstances could arise in which the FSA would pull
the trigger without knowing what the Bank or the Treasury was going to
do. There is close co-operation, and I do not doubt that it will
continue.</div>
<a name="08110628000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000191"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The issue about the working of the tripartite
authorities is critical, and Opposition Members and some Labour Members
have been critical of it. The mechanism was supposed to resolve some of
the difficulties that arose last time. Will the Minister be clearer and
say exactly what steps have been taken to check or work through how the
mechanisms would resolve some of the current difficulties, and how they
would operate in
practice?</div><a name="08110628000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000192"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As my hon. Friend knows, we have consulted widely
on the Bill. We have talked extensively to the Bank of England and the
FSA, so it is not as if there has not been an enormous amount of
discussion 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>on how the tripartite authorities will work together. There is consensus
on the legislation that it is an appropriate way forward. In the
evidence-taking sessions that we had at the beginning of the Committee,
there was widespread acceptance, when the FSA and the Bank of England
were asked questions by members of the Committee, that this was a
workable and sensible way forward. We are following that in the
Bill.</div><a name="08110628000083"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000193"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I think that the hon. Member for Northampton, North
is alluding to the lack of clarity. The Bill is actually quite
straightforward in that it offers the possibility of pulling the
trigger and deciding on the stabilisation options. In that respect,
there is a clear legal process. However, the implementation of the
measure is more sophisticated, because there will be a debate or
dialogue between the tripartite authorities about the problem bank.
There could be a situation in which the Bank and the
Treasury decide that they cannot use the stabilisation powers because
they do not think it appropriate. Their conclusions will inform a
decision by the FSA to pull the trigger. Effectively, they will have a
veto over the trigger, but the Bill suggests that they would not have
such a veto. There is a tension between the practical ways in which the
powers will be exercised and the legal form. Actually, the practical
implementation gives rise to some of the uncertainty and concerns that
people have about how the tripartite authorities operate, particularly
in the context of a situation such as Northern
Rock.</div><a name="08110628000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000194"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a clear and
sophisticated approach is being adopted to the legislation. Of course,
the authorities will work extremely closely together on these matters.
As we all appreciate, we are talking about exceptional circumstances.
We have experienced such circumstances, and we have the examples of
Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley. We have learned lessons from
those and the legislation that we have designed would have been
appropriate in those circumstances. It will put a permanent regime in
place that gives confidence to the financial markets that there is
clarity in our approach. At the same time, our approach recognises that
we cannot put the minutiae of future discussions between the three
organisations in the
Bill.</div><a name="08110628000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110628000195"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): The Minister is seeking to
reassure us about the procedures for consultation in relation to the
pulling of the trigger&#151;I should certainly like to be reassured
on that. The procedure will work only if the Bank is sufficiently
tasked and staffed so that it is capable of staying close enough to the
situation for the consultation to be worth while. It is no good for the
FSA to have the staff or monitoring capacity if the Bank is slightly
divorced because it is unable to participate through a lack of
resources. Will the Minister reassure us that the Bank will be
resourced sufficiently to remain close enough to the situation to be
worth consulting over such
matters?</div><a name="08110628000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000196"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I agree that the Bank of England needs to be
resourced to perform the tasks required of it, particularly the
responsibility for financial stability under the powers
given to it in the Bill. That is right and proper.</div>
<a name="08110628000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a final
word on the matter, because we are treading on the ground of a stand
part debate, I want to make it clear that we are not designing a
zero-failure regime. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>There might well be circumstances&#151;who is to say?&#151;in which
the Bank or Treasury decide not to use a stabilisation power where the
threshold conditions have been triggered. In those circumstances, the
bank might go into a normal insolvency, but it might also go into the
bank insolvency procedure detailed in the Bill to ensure fast payout
through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. It is not a
zero-failure regime, but we believe that the lead responsibilities
among the different parts of the tripartite arrangement that makes up
the authorities are the right lead responsibilities. Of course they
will work together closely. That is the normal and expected way of
things.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000197"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> One suggestion made in the context of the code was
the need for a decision tree to set out the various steps of the
process in order to enable users to understand what happens when and in
what circumstances.</div>
<a name="08110628000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000198"></a>Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000199"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed, that is part of the problem. I tabled my
amendment to delete subsection (6) because I interpreted the clause to
mean that the general conditions would be exercised very differently
from the powers exercised by the FSA under the Financial Services and
Markets Act. However, the Minister says that there is a boundary or
demarcation line, and that the FSA will consider the threshold
conditions in the context of the FSMA and its rulebook. That will be
one part of the boundary, and then it will flip over into the powers
granted by the Bill to the Bank and the
Treasury.</div><a name="08110628000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
that demarcation line does not actually exist. There is no clear line.
It is more of an iterative process among the tripartite
authorities&#151;I do not think that one can have a circular decision
tree&#151;that will affect how the FSA exercises its powers under the
FSMA and how the powers in the Bill will work. We are trying through a
legal process to impose clarity where clarity does not necessarily
exist, and part of the challenge is reassuring people about how the
powers will be exercised when that degree of clarity is
lacking.</div>
<a name="08110628000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is part
of the Government&#146;s challenge in communicating how the Bill will
work in practice. The explanatory notes do not make the process clear,
so it is again up to our old friend the code to elaborate on that
slightly circular process. We need to work a bit harder on explaining
how the initial process will work in practice. However, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000200"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to make a few brief remarks about clause 8
and to probe the public interest point that the Minister mentioned in
our brief discussion on clause 7. The clause sets out the conditions
that enable the Bank to use its share transfer or property transfer
powers to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>transfer a bank to a bridge bank or a private sector purchaser.
Condition A is that the exercise of the power is necessary having
regard to</div>
<a name="08110628000144"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the stability
of the financial system...the maintenance of public confidence in
the stability of the banking system...or the protection of
depositors.&#148;</div>
<a name="08110628000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those three points
relate back to the objectives of the special resolution regime in
clause 4. I can understand why that is the case. What surprises me
about those powers&#151;given the nature of the stabilisation, the
share transfer and the property transfer powers&#151;is that they do
not have regard to objective 5 in clause 4 (8), which is</div>
<a name="08110628000145"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to avoid
interfering with property rights in contravention of a Convention
right&#148;.</div><a name="08110628000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are talking about the Bank exercising the stabilisation powers, then
it would have to consider objective 5. Will the Minister expand a
little on
that?</div><a name="08110628000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110628000201"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): We are now returning to
an earlier argument that we had in which we said that the Government
have some super-objectives, and that all the objectives listed in
clause 4 do not balance each other. Now we have this clause, which
states only three of the objectives rather than the five. Therefore the
Government have, in effect, three super-objectives. I do not understand
why the Government will not admit to
that.</div><a name="08110628000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000202"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. We debated
the priority of the objectives, and we were told that there was no
priority. However, we have a situation in which one of the objectives,
which is relevant to the powers the Bank can exercise under clause 8,
has been excluded. We must consider whether objective 5 in clause 4 has
any value both in the Bill and in the context of the share and public
transfer rights.</div>
<a name="08110628000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition B
is phrased rather differently. It comes into play when the Treasury
notifies the Bank

have provided financial assistance in respect of a
bank&#148;.</div><a name="08110628000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
we have debated this matter. We have considered what financial
assistance means and what types of financial assistance can trigger the
special resolution regime. We know that the Government will come
forward with secondary legislation on that. Again, we have a situation
in which the objectives that condition B relates to are much more
limited. Subsection (5) (a) says
that</div><a name="08110628000147"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Treasury have recommended the Bank of England to exercise the
stabilisation power on the grounds that it is necessary to protect the
public
interest.&#148;</div><a name="08110628000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not clear whether that is the same public interest that is referred
to in subsection (2), which is effectively in the first three options.
Subsection (4), however, refers to the financial stability objective.
The Treasury, through condition B, recommended that the Bank should
exercise its stabilisation powers, but there is no reference to
objective 5, which is about property rights. Given that those rights
effectively effect a partial transfer, why is objective 5 not listed
there? Concerns have been expressed about the impact of such powers on
creditor rights. Therefore, it is surprising that objective 5 has not
been included in clause 8.</div>

if it is the Bank&#146;s opinion that that is the best way to

Treasury&#146;s request or is it one of those areas where we are back
to the non-linear decision tree in which there is a general discussion
and all the steps are announced at the same
time?</div><a name="08110628000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether the Minister will take the opportunity to explain which
definition of financial stability applies in the clause. We have the
broad definition in the code and the one set out in the evidence given
to us at the start of Committee by Nigel Jenkinson of the Bank of
England and provided in evidence to the Treasury Committee. The
Bank&#146;s working definition, supplied to us in the evidence
session, is narrower than the definition in the code. I raised that
with the Minister on Tuesday, but the question did not get a reply. It
will be helpful to understand how the tripartite authorities will
reconcile the two definitions of financial stability.</div>
<a name="08110628000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
this slightly non-linear process, I think that clause 8 is subordinate
to clause 7, whereas the language in clause 8(6) suggests that it is in
addition to it and that the two work together. The provisions in clause
8 can be exercised only if a decision under clause 7 has
been reached, but the language in clause 8 does not reflect
that.</div>
<a name="08110628000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000203"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The authorities recognise that the stabilisation
powers can alter or remove property rights and involve public
authorities taking control of commercial institutions. Therefore, the
special resolution regime stabilisation powers should be used only when
they are justified in the public interest. To that end, in addition to
the general conditions provided in clause 7, the Bill requires further
specific conditions to be met before the authorities can deploy
particular SRR stabilisation options, and those are set out in clause
8. The clause requires the Bank of England to be satisfied that
specific conditions have been met before exercising a stabilisation
power to transfer the whole or part of a failing bank to a private
sector purchaser or a bridge bank. I draw the attention of the
Committee to the structure of the conditions, which require that one of
two specific conditions be met before the Bank can
act.</div><a name="08110628000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition
A ensures that, before the Bank of England can exercise the powers to
transfer a bank to a private sector third party or a bridge bank, it
needs to be satisfied that exercising the powers is necessary, having
regard to the public interest in the stability of the financial systems
of the UK, in the maintenance of public confidence in the stability of
the banking systems and in the protection of depositors. Those specific
conditions provide a higher test than a public interest test framed in
wholly general terms. Effectively, they set out in the Bill those
elements of the SRR objectives, which the hon. Member for Fareham noted
we discussed under clause 4, to which the Bank of England must have
regard before deploying its resolution tools. Before determining that
the conditions are met, the Bank of England must consult with both the
Treasury and the FSA.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000204"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000205"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> May I reply to the points raised by the hon.
Member for Fareham? I will then happily give way. The hon. Member for
Fareham asked why the specific conditions cover all the SRR objectives,
but ignore the SRR objective of protecting property rights. The aim of
the stabilisation tools is to protect depositors and to maintain
financial stability and confidence in the banking system, or to protect
public funds if they have been invested in the bank before the SRR
powers were exercised. The authorities must have regard to the
objective of protecting property rights when exercising the tools, so
it is not appropriate for it to be a public interest test that
justifies using the tools.</div>
<a name="08110628000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000206"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Towards the end of his speech the Minister said,
&#147;the stability of the financial systems of the UK...and the
protection of depositors.&#148; It says in the Bill
&#147;or&#148;. If it is &#147;and&#148;, all the conditions
will have to be met; if it is &#147;or&#148;, only the protection
of depositors. I wonder which it is&#151;the collection of the three
or the single one. If it is as it says in the Bill, not as the Minister
said, it could be just the protection of depositors, irrespective of
the other two
conditions.</div><a name="08110628000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000207"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding is that it could specifically
refer just to the protection of depositors. It could refer to all three
of them but singly would be possible.</div>
<a name="08110628000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition B
in clause 8 applies to the situation where the Treasury has provided
financial assistance to a failing bank</div>
<a name="08110628000149"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the purpose
of resolving or reducing a serious threat to the stability of the
financial
systems&#148;.</div><a name="08110628000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
such situations, to protect public funds, the Bill requires the
Treasury to lead in judging that a stabilisation power is necessary to
protect the public interest but the Bank of England will still lead in
deciding that an exercise of a stabilisation tool best protects that
public interest. This arrangement ensures that both authorities
exercise powers under their mandates.</div>
<a name="08110628000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham also asked about definitions of financial stability.
One definition of financial stability relates specifically to the
Bank&#146;s exercise of its powers under the SRR. There is also a
wider definition of financial stability. That explains why there are
different definitions. It might be helpful if I write to the Committee
and explain the difference and the reasons for
it.</div><a name="08110628000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an important clause that ensures that the stabilisation tools are
used only when it is necessary to protect financial stability,
confidence in the banking system or
depositors.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000208"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, which
reinforced the intervention about the hierarchy of objectives made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough during my earlier remarks.
It appears that the principal objective is the protection of
depositors. Whenever we debate what the Bill seeks to achieve it
appears that the interests of investors and creditors rank pretty low
down the list of priorities. That is reinforced by this clause, which
enables the Bank to disrupt traditional property rights because it
gives the Bank the power eventually to have partial transfers. The
message that comes through clearly is the relatively low 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>priority given to the rights of creditors. That goes back to the concern
people have about this Bill&#151;that the power given by the Bill to
the tripartite authorities is not well constrained when it comes to the
interests of people other than depositors. The Government need to think
carefully about how that protection of creditors is expressed or
given&#151;we will come on to that again in clauses 42 and 43. I do
not get the impression at the moment that creditors are given a
particularly high priority. That is why I would expect to see the
Government take the interests of creditors more seriously. The Bank
could have had regard in clause 8 to objective 5 in the same way as it
has regard to the other objectives. There is a gap that the Government
need to
address.</div><a name="08110628000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="08110628000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000209"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I shall not go over the ground that I covered under
clause 8, but the same sorts of concerns arise. There are two examples
of temporary public ownership that we can refer to. One is the way that
the Government dealt with Northern Rock, which is still in temporary
public ownership and will be for some time. The other is the rescue of
Bradford &amp; Bingley, which, as I understand it, involved that
institution going into temporary public ownership to enable deposits to
be transferred and some of its residual activities to be acquired by
Abbey
Santander.</div><a name="08110628000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
guidance does the Minister have for the Committee on how long an
institution will be allowed to be in temporary public ownership? The
example of Bradford &amp; Bingley would suggest a relatively short
time&#151;it was a very temporary measure&#151;whereas Northern
Rock could be with us as the people&#146;s bank for some time.
Temporary is an elastic term, but it would be helpful to know where
temporary public ownership fits in the stabilisation options hierarchy,
alongside private sector purchasers and bridge
banks.</div><a name="08110628000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000210"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As we debated under the previous clause, the
stabilisation powers can alter or remove property rights, and they
involve public authorities taking control of commercial institutions.
Therefore they should be used only when they are justified in the
public interest. I wish to take issue with the hon. Gentleman. He said
that we are not taking the interests of creditors sufficiently into
account; clause 8 provides a higher-level test with regard
to the public interest, which is why we included
it.</div><a name="08110628000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whereas
clause 8 deals with the specific conditions for transferring a failing
bank to a private sector purchaser or a bridge bank, this clause
provides specific conditions that must be met before the Treasury can
take a bank into temporary public ownership. Those conditions are that
the exercise of the power is necessary to resolve or reduce a serious
threat to the stability of the UK&#146;s financial systems, or that
it is necessary to protect the public interest where the Treasury has
provided financial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>assistance in respect of the bank for the purpose of resolving or
reducing a serious threat to the stability of the UK's financial
systems.</div><a name="08110628000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
specific conditions in clause 9 are in addition to the general ones in
clause 7, and are the same as those in the Banking (Special Provisions)
Act 2008. Hon. Members will note that they therefore provide a higher
test than those in clause 8. They signal that the power for the
Treasury to take a bank into temporary public ownership is a
last-resort SRR tool, and reflect the situations in which doing so may
be the most appropriate option. Examples of those situations are: where
the Treasury has provided a failing bank with a significant amount of
public money to stabilise it; where wholesale and long-term
restructuring is required to return the bank to the private sector; and
where the bank is subject to an extremely fast-burn or complex failure
such that there is insufficient time or means to effect a property or
share transfer to a private sector purchaser without significant risk.
The clause provides a strict test, and makes it clear that temporary
public ownership is a last
resort.</div><a name="08110628000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked how temporary &#147;temporary&#148; is. It
would not be sensible to put a time limit in the Bill. The Government
would not intend the option to be a long-term one, reflecting how the
word is normally interpreted. We try to make it clear in clause 9 that
we consider temporary public ownership only if it is appropriate. It is
certainly a last-resort option. We would always want in the first
instance to prevent a bank from entering the SRR. If it was necessary
to do so we would look at the private sector purchase route. We would
look to use the bridge bank tool. The temporary public ownership tool
should be seen very much as one of last
resort.</div><a name="08110628000155"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="08110628000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000211"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful for that clarification. It is very
much one of last resort, but I am not sure how clause 9 demonstrates
that. It does not say that if we are unable to achieve the options set
out in clause 8 we can move into temporary public ownership. Clause 12
talks about the &#147;third stabilisation option&#148;. I am not
sure whether that means that it is the third preference, so I am not
sure where this proof that it is a last resort appears in
legislation.</div>
<a name="08110628000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000212"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The higher tests for temporary public ownership
than for a bridge bank or transfer to a private sector purchaser
clearly demonstrate the Government&#146;s intention. We believe that
taking ownership of the whole of a bank must be justified only on the
basis of a higher public interest test that reflects the specific
reasons why such action will be taken. We think it important that this
is an option to address financial stability risks, including when
financial assistance has already been provided, as I have explained. It
is important to have the ability to protect taxpayers&#146; interests
by taking full control of a failing bank. I am happy to repeat that the
higher test levels and the fact that the authorities would always want
to look for another solution first, very much reflect the way in which
we have designed the Bill overall.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div><a name="08110628000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000213"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I understand that the Minister is stating the
Government&#146;s position, which is that if circumstances
necessitate it, partial public ownership will be the last resort. That
is their intention. But it does not bind any future Government to that.
The next Government may be very keen on nationalising things. That is
very unlikely, but the Bill does not rank it. The Minister is stating
the current Government&#146;s position if such an event
occurred.</div><a name="08110628000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000214"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is certainly this Government&#146;s
position. But I refer the hon. Gentleman to some of the detail of the
clause. It makes it clear that a high level of test needs to be
satisfied before action can be taken in this area. There would have to
be a systemic threat to financial stability. There would have to be
some significant Government investment in the failing bank already. A
medium-sized bank that got into financial difficulty and which the
Government had not supported previously could not suddenly be
nationalised. That is not the Government&#146;s intention. Clause 9,
as I understand its construction, would not allow that to happen. We
are trying to make the Government&#146;s position in this area as
clear as possible. That is why I have indicated very strongly that this
is seen as an option of last resort which might be needed in certain
circumstances.</div><a name="08110628000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110628000215"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): Just to be absolutely clear,
and I think I understand the logic of the position, the Minister is
saying that the Government wish to keep open the possibility of
temporary public ownership, even if the option of private sector
purchaser and bridge bank is also open at the same time. In other
words, it could be a tool of preference. That is clearly what the
legislation says at the moment. Even though the preference would
normally be to use it as a last resort, it would not inevitably be used
as one, and it could be used in circumstances where there was still a
private sector purchaser in the wings or the possibility of a bridge
bank.</div><a name="08110628000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000216"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I was trying to explain, the higher public
interest test means that it could be used only when financial
assistance had been provided or there was a systemic threat. It could
not just be generally used. If either of those conditions were met, it
would be a matter for the Treasury, in discussions with the Bank of
England, which will take the lead responsibility in exercising
stabilisation tools, to come to some agreement about the best way
forward. I used the term &#147;last resort&#148; because it
announces the Government&#146;s intention clearly, but it would not
be appropriate to put that in the Bill. It could certainly be an
appropriate course of action depending on the circumstances, but as I
have outlined, the higher-level tests provide a significant assurance
about how the power might be used in
future.</div><a name="08110628000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000217"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am still not entirely clear that the clause
includes a higher public interest test. It provides a public interest
test where financial assistance has been provided, but financial
assistance is also one of the precursors to condition B in clause 8. It
is not clear where the crossover point is between condition B and the
higher tests in clause 9. The Minister may say that the language in
subsection (2) about &#147;a serious threat&#148; beefs up the
provisions beyond clause 8. That might be his justification that the
test in clause 9 is a higher test, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>but I am not sure that that is what he is saying. We have not heard
clearly on the record what specifically about the wording of clause 9
makes it a higher test than clause 8 and a power to be used only in the
last
resort.</div><a name="08110628000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110628000218"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> On the principle behind the clause, I understand
entirely the Government&#146;s position that Government ownership of
a bank is the last resort, but that is not what the Bill says. Under
the Bill, even though a private market opportunity might be available,
the Government could decide that nationalisation, even temporary
nationalisation, was more in the public interest.</div>
<a name="08110628000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
what the Government mean&#151;if they want to leave it open for a
Government to decide that nationalisation is an option although there
is a market solution&#151;that is fine. However, that is moving a
long, long way from the position at the start of the crisis, when the
Chancellor was almost apologetic about nationalising Northern Rock,
saying that it was the last thing and that we could not find any other
market solution. We may have to come back to this on Report, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>but I ask the Minister: what are the Government really saying? Are they
saying that in all cases, they want a market solution if
possible?</div><a name="08110628000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110628000219"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): There is one
conceivable circumstance in which pursuing an available market solution
might not be regarded as appropriate or in the public interest. We have
seen an illustration of that in the dilemma involved in the permissive
approach to the merger of Lloyds TSB and HBOS. A judgment might be made
that that was such an uncompetitive move in the marketplace that it was
not in the public interest to pursue it, even though it could be
conceived as a solution to that particular banking crisis. That is an
illustration of why the tools might be used slightly
differently.</div><a name="08110628000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
