&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): I am grateful for the
clarification that the Minister provided. However, one concern remains,
to which he could respond now or, if necessary, in writing. Will he
provide clarity on the question of whether the guidance is binding or
advisory, as it would be useful for the Homes and Communities Agency to
know what is expected of it? I am not putting him on the spot: if he
wants to consider that question, and respond in writing, or later in
Committee proceedings, I am comfortable with
that.</div>

it.</div>
					<a name="08011811000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich made a point about
guidance to the regulator. Clause 40, which we agreed this morning,
places a duty on the agency to co-operate with the regulator. We expect
that to ensure that the two bodies can work together and exchange
information where appropriate. A reciprocal arrangement is provided for
in clause 102, which places a similar duty on the regulator to
co-operate with the agency. I hope that that reassures hon.
Members.</div>

clarification on the question of whether guidance could go up from the
HCA to the Secretary of State in the manner that I described. That sort
of communication is important. The HCA should be free to give such
guidance and advice, but that is not made explicit in the

hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. However, the free exchange of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>ideas and opinions will certainly be important to
the Secretary of State and the agency. I hope that that reassures the

Nick Raynsford (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab):
						</b> In an
earlier debate, I expressed concern about whether the definition of
&#147;a project&#148; in clause 47(1) was unduly restrictive. I
hoped that the amendments that I tabled at the end of our discussions
on Tuesday would be considered today, but I was working on the basis of
older procedures under which a one-day notice period was acceptable. I
had forgotten that two days are now required, so my amendments were not
eligible for selection today. Nevertheless, the issue remains
important. I know that we discussed the matter earlier, but my hon.
Friend the Minister undertook to consider further whether the tight
definition of a project, although important to emphasise the time
limit, might be unduly restrictive geographically if a group of
projects are part of one initiative. Has he reflected further? We may
need to return to the issue if it is not possible to provide
satisfactory
assurances.</div>

						</b> I am pleased that my right hon. Friend caught your
eye, Mr. Gale. I wish to put on record the fact that
references to &#147;a project&#148;, which we discussed in an
earlier sitting, will not prevent the agency from providing services to
a project that is under way in a number of locations across England. In
that respect, it is not geographically constrained. Equally, the clause
does not mean that the agency can provide support services only to a
single project at any one
time.</div>
					<a name="08011811000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of the
word &#147;project&#148; is intended to identify circumstances that

identified later in the clause. I hope that that reassures my right

you were in the Chair, Mr. Gale, when we discussed clause
10. In that debate, markers were put down for our discussion of clause

The context of the debate was the disposal of land at less than best
price, and the Minister said:</div>

					<a name="08011811000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I will touch upon that

					<a name="08011811000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are now debating
clause 50, will the Minister define slightly more clearly than he did
in the debate on clause 10 the circumstances of any general consent
that the Secretary of State might give the HCA to dispose of land at
less than best price? He will recall that the Committee spent some time
on that, and there was concern about an over-restrictive approach to
such disposal. Will he do what he said he would do, and discuss the
matter further
now?</div>
					<a name="08011811000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000420"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As the right hon. Gentleman said, we had an
in-depth discussion on the matter when we debated clause 10, and I
undertook to do additional work to reassure hon. Members on clause 50.
The point is important, and I was rightly challenged on best
consideration and the agency&#146;s wider
objects.</div>
					<a name="08011811000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 50
empowers the Secretary of State to grant consent to the Homes and
Communities Agency when it proposes to exercise powers that are subject
to that consent, such as the giving of financial assistance, forming or
acquiring companies or&#151;this was the point mentioned under clause
10&#151;the disposal of land for less than best consideration.
Consent may be given with or without conditions, and generally or
specifically, as circumstances require.</div>
					<a name="08011811000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following our debate on clause
10, I should like to set out in more detail the way in which general
consents for the disposal of land at less than best consideration are
operated by local authorities, the role of English Partnerships and an
indication of the nature of general consents that we plan under clause
50. First, I shall first set out the situation for local authorities.
They have sought, and been given, the Secretary of State&#146;s
consent to dispose of land at less than best consideration under the
Local Government Act 1972 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
The most recent guidance on general disposal consents was issued in
2003 under the 1972 Act. It sets out measures whereby local authorities
can dispose of land at less than best consideration if the disposal
meets a &#147;well being test&#148;, as well as the difference
between the open-market value on disposal and circumstances in which
its value, subject to conditions imposed by the local authority, is
less than &#163;2 million. The provisions have been used by local
authorities on several occasions, but as I told the Committee on
Tuesday, consent is not required, so we do not hold records of
disposals carried out under the general
consent.</div>
					<a name="08011811000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">On disposals
above the &#163;2 million level, approximately eight consents are
given each year under the Local Government Act 1972 and the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990, and I can give the Committee examples to
illustrate the point and drive the debate forward. In October 2003, in
the London borough of Brent, there was a freehold disposal of land on
the Chalkhill estate in Wembley for the purpose of housing. It was
disposed to the Metropolitan Housing Trust, and the under-value was
&#163;2.04 million. Similarly, in August 2004, Basingstoke and Deane
borough council disposed of the freehold of undeveloped land at
Foxdown, in Hampshire, to Westbury Homes Ltd; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div>the land was for residential development, and the under-value was
&#163;2.5 million.</div>
					<a name="08011811000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that I made earlier about the wide definition of well-being is not
confined to housing. The London borough of Greenwich disposed of the
leasehold of a school site in Abbey Wood to St. Paul&#146;s Academy;
the land was for a city academy school, and the under-value was
&#163;7.39 million. Ipswich borough council disposed of land to
University Campus Suffolk for the development of a university campus,
and the under-value was &#163;9.32 million. The important point is
that there are precedents, and the definition of well-being, as set out
under the general consents in the Local Government Act 1972, is
incredibly wide. That shows what the agency could do when disposing of
land at less than best consideration.</div>
					<a name="08011811000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011811000421"></a>
							<b class="B">Margaret
Moran</b> (Luton, South) (Lab): As it was I who asked for the
evidence base, I feel compelled to ask my hon. Friend what proportion
of all requests those eight consents represent&#151;I guess that they
are a tiny number in relation to the number of permissions that were
needed or asked for. Given that we are talking about a mix of
residential and other permissions, what is the percentage of
residential permissions, particularly for social housing
purposes?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000422"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point, but she
will appreciate that I do not have that information to hand. However, I
will endeavour to provide it to the Committee as soon as possible. As I
said, we are in the dark in some respects, but I will do my best to
find out the precise proportion of residential permissions in terms of
the general consent above  &#163;2
million.</div>

						<a name="08011811000423"></a>
							<b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): The Minister mentioned
Chalkhill estate in Wembley and a figure of &#163;2 million. I
actually stood for election in that estate under the unusual election
slogan of &#147;Vote for us on Thursday and we will knock down your
house on Friday&#148;. It was a disastrous &#146;60s estate, and
the proposal turned out to be quite popular, as I missed out by 60-odd
votes on taking what had previously been a very safe Labour seat. The
point, however, is that it took an awfully long time to get housing
development in that area going; in fact, it was only many years after
that election in 1994 that a project got under way. Is the Minister
suggesting that his proposals will make it more or less likely that
such projects will take place? As he rightly said, it is a question of
getting the right deal and the right valuation in place and of getting
the whole thing moving. As I said, it was very complex to get that
development going. Does he believe that what is described in the Bill
will make that process easier? I am sure that that is an easy question
to answer.</div>
					<a name="08011811000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000424"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am intrigued. The hon. Gentleman seems to have a
knack and panache for slogans. I do not think that &#147;Vote for me
on Thursday and I&#146;ll knock your house down on Friday&#148; is
as good as &#147;No way to 10k&#148;, but it is still a good
slogan. I think that the hon. Gentleman knows the answer to his
question, which is that the whole point of the Homes and Communities
Agency is to remove as many barriers as possible and to facilitate,
smooth and lubricate the processes. Notwithstanding the statutory
planning framework in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div>which it will operate, it will ensure that developments are accelerated
as much as possible, that difficulties are analysed quickly and that
possible solutions involving partnership with the relevant authorities
are introduced as quickly as possible.</div>

Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):
						</b> My hon. Friend the
Minister has reassured us on the question of compliance with the
objects of the HCA, and he is right to reassure us about continued
well-being and the fact that that provision is widely drawn. May I
raise with him an issue that an Opposition Front-Bench spokesman raised
yesterday? What would happen if improvements that are needed to an
estate resulted in a reduction in the number of housing units? Does the
well-being definition that the Minister is considering include such a
situation?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000426"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> It could well do. I return to the point that I
made about referencing to the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire
with my hat on as Minister with responsibility for housing market
renewal. The density of an area, with two-up two-down housing and large
tracts of terraced housing, for example, may mean that we need fewer
affordable housing units on the site. The circumstances that my hon.
Friend mentioned would be entirely reasonable, so I hope that that
reassures him.</div>
					<a name="08011811000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">English
Partnerships does not have the general consent to dispose of
land at less than best consideration, and if it wanted to do so, it
would need to seek the consent of the Secretary of State. We touched on
the following issue in clause 10. English Partnerships disposes
of land with attached specifications that meet its regeneration
objectives through an open-market competition and it then accepts the
highest bid. Such specifications may need the consent of the
Secretary of State if they include matters of wider
public benefit.</div>

							<a name="08011811000427"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> My hon. Friend has pointed out that English
Partnerships does not have the benefit of the general consent, so will
he make it absolutely clear to the Committee whether he intends the
general consent to apply to the new agency? If so, first, will it
specify the categories or circumstances in which the power may be used
and, secondly, will a financial limit apply, above which the consent of
the Secretary of State will be required?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000428"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As ever, my right hon. Friend focuses on the key
point. He is right to point out that English Partnerships does not have
the general consent, but we need a step change, a culture change, and
it is right that it applies to the agency. The specific circumstances
in which the general consent will be made, and the limits on it, will
be subject to the tasking framework, but I shall come on to what I
think will be the parameters, and perhaps illustrate the type of
circumstances to which the general consent will apply. I hope that I
have reassured Members about that.</div>

right framework, I mentioned on Tuesday the Goldilocks principle
regarding clauses 10 and 50. It involves providing the right
legislative basis to ensure that the new agency can dispose of land at
less than best consideration in order to achieve its objectives of
improving housing supply and driving forward regeneration, while
ensuring that the public purse is as protected as much as possible. I
do not think that further amendments are necessary.</div>
					<a name="08011811000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
mentioned today that the Committee has sought reassurance about how,
underneath the legislation in the Bill, we will give the agency the
framework to deliver the necessary housing and regeneration that all
Committee members have emphasised. I have also already said that we are
committed to issuing the general consent under clause 50 to enable the
agency to act without having to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s
consent for every disposal. In response to my right hon.
Friend&#146;s point, we need to consult stakeholders about the terms
of the general consent. We are examining the local government model,
but we must consider whether the levels are
appropriate.</div>

Moran:
						</b> I am pleased to hear that the Minister wants to
consult more widely on general consent; that is helpful. However, when
he does so, and when he considers the local government model, will he
remember that we are trying to reach a practical outcome in order to
meet the objectives? Currently, the general consent is narrowly defined
and administratively onerous. When one looks at the form, which is 36
pages long, one can imagine local government and the HCA being put off
from considering such consents. Consequently, the opportunities for
social housing from the disposal of land may be missed if the sale goes
to a private
developer.</div>
					<a name="08011811000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000430"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My hon. Friend is spot-on in her analysis. We do
not want the procedure to be too onerous, and the point of general
consent in many respects is not to have to go to the Secretary of
State. If my hon. Friend will allow me, I will give an example of where
general consents might be used, because that is pertinent and a good
illustration for the Committee. They tend to involve the disposal of
land, and the agency might be disposing of many, similar plots of land
throughout England. In such circumstances, I do not think it is
unreasonable for the Secretary of State to issue a general consent
stipulating that so long as the land to be disposed of is worth less
than a specified amount, the agency could do so without having to seek
separate consent from the Secretary of State on each
occasion.</div>
					<a name="08011811000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
important, because there will be a step change in housing supply and
quality in England if a local authority or registered housing landlord
can use infill when it has a bit of land on an estate or a bit of
wasteland that could be used for five, six or seven houses. I am not
talking about garden-grabbing, so the Opposition need not get excited,
but about pieces of land that might be on estates and could be used for
six or seven houses. Going to the Secretary of State to dispose of that
land would be onerous in many respects, and I do not think the numbers
would stack up if it was at less than best consideration. If we agree a
certain amount, which could be &#163;2 million or whatever, I think
that would help to free up and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div>accelerate the use of land for infill development&#151;I see hon.
Members nodding. I think it would be reasonable for the agency to do
that, and it is a reasonable framework in which general consents could
be considered by the Secretary of
State.</div>

							<a name="08011811000431"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I caution the Minister that the market for land is
not an even or homogenous market throughout the country. For example,
the price of land in some villages overlooking the sea in Cornwall
command very high prices for small levels of development. I want to
probe the Minister on the specified consent available to English
Partnerships. It is presumably specified that it may dispose of land if
that would provide employment on that land. Could the Government extend
that in the Bill to the HCA and specify that such land must be used for
affordable housing? English Partnerships currently has that general
consent to specify that land can be used for employment, so could the
principle not be extended to the HCA specifying that the land must be
used for affordable
housing?</div>

							<a name="08011811000432"></a>Mr.

						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point and
has emphasised the importance of English Partnerships&#146; work on
regeneration throughout our proceedings. That is not unreasonable. We
have established the legislative framework in the Bill, and I want to
consult on the framework below that for what can happen operationally.
His suggestion can certainly be considered. I draw the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s attention yet again to the point that I made earlier
about the well-being test, which is broadly defined so that it can take
account of social, economic, environmental and regeneration objectives.
I hope that that satisfies
him.</div>
					<a name="08011811000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s earlier point, I am keen to see the culture
change and the step change that the new agency can offer. I want to
ensure that we accelerate the supply of housing in England, and this
could be a means of doing so. English Partnerships, the Housing
Corporation and a number of authorities are already forging ahead with
innovative projects such as those that I mentioned, and we want to do
everything we can to encourage that in future. I give way to my hon.

							<a name="08011811000433"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> I will give my hon. Friend a breather and reiterate
an earlier point. Will he consult on the extreme complexity of the
current consent requirements? My point is not just about length: the
requirements are extremely technical and I can imagine that both the
HCA and local government might be put off by the resources involved in
putting them forward to the Secretary of State. That slows down the
whole process and risks affecting the speed of development that we are
trying to achieve.</div>

and I apologise if I made her do so, but she makes a good point. I have
asked my officials to work with existing bodies and stakeholders to
consider this issue and what the terms of consent should be, as well as
considering the issue more widely in relation to the opportunities,
challenges and barriers to disposal of less than best consideration.
Her point about the length and complexity of guidance is a valid one,
and I shall ask that that be included.</div>

like good common sense to think about having a limit of &#163;2
million or so. However, we ask that it be future-proofed, so that we do
not end up with a figure that has not been uprated. Hon. Members have
made similar points about regional differences, and more work probably

					<a name="08011811000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that I have reassured the Committee today and with the points that I
made on Tuesday about clause 10 and the Goldilocks principle. Clause 10
is not too onerous on the selling of land and is not so flexible that
the public are not reassured that they are getting good value for
money. It is just right, and that is the right approach to take. We are
taking the right approach by introducing clause 10 in conjunction with
clause 50 and the framework behind it, which I have explored today, and
which hon. Members have probed.

George Young:
						</b> I would like a short debate on this clause,
which gives the Secretary of State powers by order to appoint the date
of the abolition of the Commission for the New Towns. I thought that it
had already been abolished. It is rather like going to the House of
Lords and finding that someone whom one thought had died some time ago
is still around.</div>
					<a name="08011811000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a press release from 1995 from the National Audit Office, which
states:</div>
					<a name="08011811000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
July 1993 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced his
intention to wind-up the Commission itself by the end of March
1998.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that English
Partnerships was created in May 1999 as a merger between the commission
and the Urban Regeneration Agency, it is unclear to me why the
commission has survived. What is it doing? No new towns have been
created since 1970 and I think that most were wound up in 1980. I
remember going around the country winding them up and meeting local
authorities that pleaded to be allowed to go on for even longer, to
invest in their areas, although they had all opposed their
establishment at the beginning. What assets does the commission have?
As I recall, all that it was given were some roundabouts that the
original new town had not been able to pass on to the local
authority.</div>
					<a name="08011811000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we are abolishing the commission in  clause 52, it is being

myself&#151;is still around? What is it doing and how much has it
left to do? When will he finally put the gravestone on top of
it?</div>

						</b> The right hon. Gentleman might be disappointed to
hear that it is still in operation; it is still technically alive.
However, he is correct that all new towns have been wound up. The CNT
calls them residuary assets, which were not transferred back to the
local authority at that time. He mentioned roundabouts&#151;I imagine
that it is that sort of thing. I have not got details to hand, but
could provide the Committee with them if it wishes. However, given that
the residuary assets will be held by the agency, which will have
responsibilities towards them, it will take over the
commission&#146;s functions in respect of those assets.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in
clause 54, page 23, line 17, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) The
Secretary of State shall make provision for the continuation of the
functions of the Commission for the New Towns in respect of workshops
and industrial building, through the transfer of those functions to
another
authority.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
listened to the debate on clause 52, I feel that my amendment is
deficient in some respects. However, I shall use this as an opportunity
to probe the Minister, who is aware of my concerns. The clause should
be made more explicit to protect the valuable work of English
Partnerships, which otherwise could easily be lost or submerged in the
clear objectives set out in clause 2. English Partnerships has always
supported the provision of employment floor space, which is one of the
outputs against which it has been measured since it was established.
The agency has progressed specific programmes on, for example, priority
sites and network space, designed to deliver employment floor space in
areas where the private sector is reluctant to invest.</div>
					<a name="08011811000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">That key
provision could easily be neglected in the Bill. Perhaps unbeknown to
some, English Partnerships has developed workshops in communities where
no social housing remains&#151;communities in which the HCA might not
be interested. None the less, such communities have a need for
employment opportunities and the prospect that local businesses could
flourish, but the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>private sector might find that it is not commercially viable or
attractive to set up workshops and employment space in such places. In
those circumstances, English Partnerships has made a significant
difference, and its work should not be overlooked. From the perspective
of those concerned about the future of rural areas, it is important
that that important work is not
lost.</div>
					<a name="08011811000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statutory
background to English Partnerships&#146; support for employment floor
space can be found in section 159 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and
Urban Development Act 1993, which sets out the objects of the Urban
Regeneration Agency. Section 159(4)(b)
states:</div>
					<a name="08011811000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by developing,
or encouraging the development of, existing and new industry and
commerce&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
that the Bill includes powers to allow the HCA to support existing or
new businesses and these are set out in clauses 31 to 33 which were
debated earlier. The Bill, in clause 42, would also allow the HCA to
provide advice. What concerns me is that in those clauses, particularly
clause 33, the provision of work space in the context which I described
earlier is not sufficiently explicit. If a list is going to be made
then something could easily be overlooked or submerged in the future
work of the agency. I urge the Minister, therefore, to look very
carefully at this issue and see whether he could bring forward
proposals or perhaps work together on a proposed amendment which would
allow this to be more explicit.</div>
					<a name="08011811000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Targets are set through English
Partnerships&#146; corporate planning process and agreed with
Ministers. English Partnerships&#146; core targets cover housing
units and other issues but also employment floor space and
private-sector investment attracted. In 2006-97, English Partnerships
provided 326,000 sq m of employment floor space which matched well
against their target of 300,000 sq m. I do not see anything in the Bill
where such a target would be permitted or required of the HCA to ensure
that employment floor space of this type is produced and that is why I
hope that the Minister will consider carefully the need to make more
explicit that important function, which I fear otherwise will be lost
and
submerged.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000442"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman who has been
tenacious in this line of questioning. He has been so throughout the
debate, from oral evidence sessions onwards, in a very sincere manner.
I suggest that such a provision is not necessary in respect of his
concerns because the powers of the agency are already sufficiently wide
to provide industrial building or workshops, should the regeneration or
sustainability of a community or area warrant such development. I draw
his attention to clause 33 which contains the
phrases</div>
					<a name="08011811000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;encourage or
develop existing or new businesses...provide business or
employment
services&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
specifically and sufficiently refer to encouraging or developing the
matters to which he
alluded.</div>
					<a name="08011811000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are reiterating and rehashing some of the earlier debate but it is
important to reassure the hon. Gentleman that, while the focus of the
agency may be towards increasing the supply of housing, it is also
tasked with ensuring that any housing developed is supported by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>the necessary infrastructure, which will include the provision of
adequate employment facilities for the area in question should it be
needed.</div>
					<a name="08011811000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made
the point on a number of occasions that I do not think that plonking 3
million homes in a field will be adequate. We need to ensure there is
sufficient infrastructure, and an employment base is essential. The
agency may facilitate the provision of these developments rather than
develop itself but it has the power to do so which will be important in
helping to fulfil its objects.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000443"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> The Minister used the expression that the
provision of housing is supported by other infrastructure. The question
that I raised in my opening remarks was that there are some communities
where English Partnerships has developed its workshops where no social
housing has been provided at the same time. In some villages, social
housing has been lost because it has all been sold but English
Partnerships still provided those workshops. If the Minister is saying
that industrial floor space and workshops will only be provided in
circumstances where there is also some housing development, I remain
concerned.</div>

							<a name="08011811000444"></a>Mr.

about the importance of regional development agencies, the sub-national
review and the explicit requirement for local authorities to be
involved in economic development. That triumvirate&#151;local
authorities, RDAs and the agency&#151;will be essential in reassuring
him with regard to the importance of that regeneration of necessary
industrial floor space. I hope that he asks leave to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

George:
						</b> Having listened to what the Minister said, I still
seek some further reassurance. I hope that he will take on board the
concerns that I have raised, particularly in respect of rural areas,
which are not necessarily scheduled to receive social housing of the
type that we all want to see across the country in future. However,
from a drafting and placing point of view, the issue that I am raising
could be more appropriately drafted. I hope that the Minister will take
this matter on board and consider the need for a more explicit
statement in the Bill to reassure rural areas that these objectives
will be met.</div>

						</b> I am pleased to hear about the interim
arrangements and the progress. I represent two new towns, Welwyn Garden
City and Hatfield. One of them, Hatfield, has had a new town centre
promised for a very long time. It has proved to be a difficult and
much-delayed project, the building of which should finally get under
way in 2009, or perhaps at the end of 2008. The project falls under the
auspices of a partnership between the council and English Partnerships,
which will take over from the Commission for the New Towns.</div>
					<a name="08011811000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that when people learn
about the Homes and Communities Agency, they will seek the kind of
reassurance that the Minister has been providing, because the last
thing they want in a project with a time scale that runs to 2011 or
2012 is to feel that there could be another six months&#146; or
year&#146;s delay while the HCA gets up to speed. I am grateful for
the Minister&#146;s comments. They will be important for Hatfield and
many other projects around the
country.</div>

						</b> On the point that the hon. Member for Welwyn
Hatfield made about Hatfield town centre, I mentioned earlier the three
broad work strands: organisational design and development, investment
plan and finance, and intervention policy and stakeholders. Under those
three work strands, there are 20 further discrete ones that are
intended to ensure that the establishment of the agency does not
disrupt the continuing work of the Housing Corporation or English
Partnerships, or the delivery functions of the Department for
Communities and Local Government. Therefore, in respect of the
particular example that the hon. Gentleman, as a good constituency MP,
refers to&#151;obviously, it would be better if there were a Labour
gain&#151;I hope that I have reassured him that we are moving forward

						</b> On that very point, I do not know whether
inspiration has reached my hon. Friend the Minister, but it strikes me
that there is an interesting curiosity in the Bill, in that we have
already dealt with clauses 51 and 52, which abolish respectively the
Urban Regeneration Agency and the Commission for the New Towns, but we
have not yet reached clause 66, which provides for the dissolution of
the Housing Corporation. It occurred to me that there may be some logic
in making interim arrangements for those bodies that have already been
abolished but not yet making such arrangements for the one that is due
to be abolished in the next hour or so, if we proceed

							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): I beg to move, That
the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="08011811000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
uncommon for attempts to be made to ask a new agency or Government
organisation of some significance to lay an annual report to
Parliament, to give Members the opportunity to raise matters concerning
it and find time for a debate. I am keen on the new clause, even more
so following the events of last
week.</div>
					<a name="08011811000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose behind the new clause is obvious. A number of the debates that
we have had have centred around the concern that the agency&#146;s
powers will be extensive. As we have said more than once, the sum of
the parts will be rather greater than the extent of the individual
parts. An agency that combines the power to acquire, deliver and build
will be extensive. We have discussed conflicts of interest; guidance on
the extensive powers to be given; local authorities&#146; concerns
about the circumstances in which powers might be used to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>take over their planning functions; compulsory purchase; whether the
agency will be driven by the numbers game, and whether it will
concentrate fully on wider regeneration issues. All those matters have
been raised both in the Committee and by a number of the outside bodies
that have been interested in the creation of the new agency and
beyond.</div>
					<a name="08011811000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">On those
grounds alone, there is more than good reason for the HCA to produce a
report such as we describe in the new clause. I am tempted to think
that the Minister will be sympathetic to it, because it is not in his
nature to restrict information. From how the matter has been handled on
all sides, he will have seen a genuine interest in the agency&#146;s
work from Members who, in many instances, have seen things in their own
constituencies that will relate to its activities. Many hon. Members
have a real interest in both housing and regeneration, and would want
the time and attention of the House directed towards those matters. I
would have thought that the Minister was sympathetic to and interested
in allowing such scrutiny, and that it might just have been missed out.
It seems to me that creating such a large body and not providing for an
annual report to Parliament is an
oversight.</div>
					<a name="08011811000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now
relate the clause to the written statement last week, in which for the
first time we had a chance to see how extensive the agency&#146;s
powers would be and what new things it would take from the Department,
which the Minister for Housing was able only to hint at when she gave
us evidence. She fleshed them out in that statement. We now have an
even stronger right to demand that the Bill include a clause requiring
the production of a report on the agency&#146;s activities. I do not
want my arguments to be too wide, but I can fairly draw attention to
two matters in the written statement for which responsibility is to be
transferred from the Department to the new agency: housing market
renewal and the Thames
Gateway.</div>
					<a name="08011811000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, if
things go wrong with housing market renewal&#151;it has been
known&#151;we can question the Minister and the matter is dealt with
in Parliament. The transfer to the agency of powers on pathfinder
schemes and housing market renewal does not negate the
Department&#146;s ultimate responsibility, but the matter will be
handled by the agency with its extensive powers. We need a mechanism by
which the agency can inform Parliament how such a major project is
going. I will not linger on pathfinder, but the recent NAO report on
the pathfinder programme said in one of its
conclusions:</div>
					<a name="08011811000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no guarantee that intervening in the housing market in this way will
address the causes rather than the symptoms of the problems experienced
in these
neighbourhoods.&#148;</div>

development is coming on
now.</div>
					<a name="08011811000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can put on
record my views about pathfinder. I am not wholly negative about the
concept. I have seen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>pathfinder areas. I have been to east Lancashire and seen Max
Steinberg&#146;s work up there in very difficult areas such as Nelson
and Burnley. My concern about pathfinder has always been that it is a
very blunt instrument. The housing market moves very quickly, and I
think the NAO report exposed that. I do not think that the
Department&#146;s response has been very good. But if the
responsibility goes to the agency, what chance will there be for
Members of the House to burrow into the issues that concern us, like
those exposed by the NAO, and the pathfinder and housing market renewal
programme is not showing more signs of being responsive to the housing
market and the appropriate changes are not being
made?</div>
					<a name="08011811000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry to raise the Thames Gateway again, but I feel I must. I raised
it in business questions and Members of the Committee will know how
concerned I am about the handling of it. I was not best pleased with
the stage at which the written statement was produced, for reasons that
we discussed last week. This is a project for which the Department has
had responsibility and has recently received very extensive criticism.
Three conclusions from the PAC&#146;s report were,
first:</div>
					<a name="08011811000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Department does not know how much the regeneration of the Thames
Gateway will cost the
taxpayer.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly:</div>
					<a name="08011811000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Department has not translated the vision for the programme into
comprehensive and measurable objectives, nor are there robust systems
to measure
progress.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly:</div>
					<a name="08011811000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Department's management of the programme has been weak, and has not
demonstrably added value to the
programme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
pretty damning criticisms, but now, conveniently, the whole thing is
passed, as a result of the Minister&#146;s written statement, to the
Homes and Communities Agency. That seems to me to be a pretty big
responsibility on its own, so why not report to Parliament? Why not
take the opportunity today of saying, yes, these are big things, we
want the agency to be required to report to Parliament, we think by
statute, on matters as important as this. It would be sensible to have
the report in the terms that we have suggested. If the Minister takes
up our suggestion, I suspect that the report will be more extensive.
But we are asking specific questions through the new
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000459"></a>Mr.
Love:
						</b> I have been listening to what the hon. Gentleman has
said about the renewal areas and the Thames Gateway. What makes him
believe that setting up the HCA will lessen the scrutiny and auditing
arrangements that he has talked about that are carried out by the NAO
or by those investigating the Thames Gateway? Surely they will continue
and if there are problems, they will be
exposed.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000460"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> Yes, there will still be scrutiny by those bodies,
but I am troubled by how much attention is then paid to them and how
they are brought to light. We have had no response from the Department
to the two reports that I have mentioned on pathfinder and the Thames
Gateway. There has been neither a written nor an oral statement
defending the Department&#146;s position in relation to those. If we
want information, it is difficult enough at the moment to get it from a
Department that is responsible directly to the House of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div>Commons. How much more difficult might it be to obtain information from
an agency? The Minister shakes his head. If he would like to commit to
a written statement from his Department about both reports as soon as
possible, I would be pleased to hear it. However, the point is that we
do not have the opportunity for scrutiny that we would really like now.
This afternoon, I asked the Leader of the House for an urgent debate
about the Thames Gateway.</div>
					<a name="08011811000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is a
belt-and-braces measure, offering a report in particular terms so that
we might examine the information brought forward by the agency without
requiring the scrutiny of those bodies in order to bring information to
the House&#146;s attention. We have not heard much from the
Department, and I doubt that we would if those bodies had not been
doing their
job.</div>

							<a name="08011811000461"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Housing market renewal is an area for which I have
ministerial responsibility, and about which I feel passionately. On the
Opposition&#146;s scrutiny of the Government, will the hon. Gentleman
tell me how many oral questions the Opposition have tabled on
communities and local government and HMR, and how many Adjournment
debates his colleagues have requested on HMR? There are mechanisms in
place to scrutinise the Executive, and I suggest to him that they have
not been used.</div>
					<a name="08011811000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000462"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> That is not entirely fair. I have asked oral
questions on the housing market renewal initiative. I remember one
exchange with the former Deputy Prime Minister, the right hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), in which the
whole issue was swatted away. He said, first, that the Tories did not
understand the north of England, and secondly, that we had got it all
wrong. Some months later, the fallacy of his position was laid bare for
us all to see in the reports.</div>
					<a name="08011811000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The response
from Ministers was extraordinarily patronising and arrogant, and it
turned out to be completely wrong. I am delighted that the hon.
Gentleman has responsibility for the issue, because I expect a complete
change of attitude in all those respects. The issue was raised, and the
concerns were dismissed as scaremongering, which was connected with
groups in towns, such as Liverpool, Salford and other parts of the
north-west that were making trouble because of demolitions. It was
suggested that that was our interest, but it was not. I have gone on
record and tried to maintain a balanced opinion about pathfinder,
saying that there are reasons for it, but that there are also places in
which it is breaking down and not working.</div>
					<a name="08011811000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the situations in
Liverpool are a scandal. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the
right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), at a public
inquiry, described some of the practices as social cleansing. My
concern that there were problems that needed scrutiny and discussion
still stands. There are of course other mechanisms, but I am talking
about an opportunity for the HCA to recognise that up to now, the
scrutiny has not been as good as it could be. With a balanced approach
and an acceptance that some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>criticism has been valid, it would be good to offer more information to
the House in order for the Government to say, &#147;We recognise the
things that might have been wrong, and here is a way in which,
annually, we can present our view on the issues, so that there is no
reliance on people burrowing into information, finding things out and
producing them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why the new clause
talks about looking for</div>
					<a name="08011811000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;value for money and
efficiency...how the HCA is achieving its objects and exercising
its powers...how the HCA is co-ordinating and consulting with
government departments and other public
authorities&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">In both
areas of departmental interest that I have mentioned, there have been
complaints that such work has not been done effectively. That is my
point.</div>
					<a name="08011811000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
nothing to lose; the work will be done. It seems admirable to bring
more information to the House rather than less, and I cannot see a good
reason against the measure. Already, there is a series of annual
reports to Parliament. Some are on massive, world-shaking events such
as climate change, some are on constitutionally important issues such
as judicial appointments, some are on socially important issues, such
as the annual report of the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and
some are on rather more obscure issues such as the pharmaceutical price
regulation regime. I cannot see that the work of the HCA does not fit
somewhere into that spectrum as also requiring a report to be presented
to Parliament and I humbly ask the Committee to support the new
clause.</div>

that the Government say they want it to do, there are some issues about
which Parliament is going to have a view. One such issue would be
equity. How fairly are the resources of the HCA being spread across
England? The hon. Member for St. Ives asked about rural areas and the
balance of resources going in. Will the agency be centred on our
cities, or will it pay a lot more regard to the real problems of
homelessness and the provision of homes facing people in rural areas?
So I do think that there are issues on which Members might like to
contribute, and I think that that is
relevant.</div>
					<a name="08011811000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also&#151;value
for money and efficiency was mentioned earlier&#151;one of the issues
raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire was
not only who was going to run the agency, but where it was going to be
based. We know that the Housing Corporation is in Tottenham Court road.
It is as if we are saying to the agency, &#147;Here is an envelope
with &#163;2,300 million to spend on doing the very worthy things
that you are going to do&#148;. There may well be an argument that it
could be more efficient to put this agency somewhere else, not
necessarily in central London&#151;maybe on the outskirts of
London.</div>

excellent place as is Poole or Montgomeryshire. This is of value
because the thrust of policy over the past few years has been to try to
ensure that there is equitable distribution of public bodies across the
UK. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>Much of the BBC, for example, has moved to Manchester. Therefore, where
the agency is based is an issue. Hon. Members might also wish to debate
the general issue of how the delivery agency resources are spent across
the UK. As with any kind of large scale regeneration scheme,

of Members who will have a view.</div>

							<a name="08011811000474"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Having said all that, I cannot let his comments
about housing market renewal and the National Audit Office report go
unchallenged. The National Audit Office report says that in pathfinder
areas prices have increased faster than comparable areas that did not
have housing market renewal initiatives. It has been a success but it
has been difficult 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>to quantify. That is entirely understandable, given the massive amount
of regeneration that has gone into these areas over the past decade or
so&#151;with Sure Start and so on. It is entirely reasonable that
that work has gone on.</div>
					<a name="08011811000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have spent the past couple of
months visiting these areas. East Lancashire was mentioned earlier, and
I am going there on Friday to have a look at Burnley and the Elevate
scheme, just to see what needs to be done before I make a decision on
the specific allocation of that &#163;1 billion for the next three
years. There has been real success in these pathfinder areas. More
needs to be done because we are suffering from generations of decline,
so I take issue with what was said.</div>
					<a name="08011811000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The views of the hon. Member
for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) are sincere. He gave early
warning that he would introduce a new clause dealing with the annual
reporting of the agency. I told him at the time that I did not think it
was necessary. I feel quite strongly that the reporting requirements in
the Bill are perfectly adequate. I draw the Committee&#146;s
attention to paragraph 11 to schedule 1, which
says:</div>
					<a name="08011811000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(1) For
each financial year, the HCA
must&#151;</div>
					<a name="08011811000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
prepare an annual report on how it has exercised its functions during
the year, and</div>
					<a name="08011811000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) send
a copy of the report to the Secretary of State within such period as
the Secretary of State may
direct.</div>
					<a name="08011811000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">(2) The
Secretary of State must lay before Parliament a copy of each report
received under sub-paragraph
(1).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a real
requirement to provide an annual report on how the agency has exercised
its functions and to prepare a detailed statement of accounts in
respect of that financial year. The Secretary of State must lay both
before Parliament and if, for whatever reason, the Secretary of State
considers it appropriate, she can require the Homes and Communities
Agency to provide any other information she requests about the exercise
and its functions.</div>
					<a name="08011811000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
short time ago we agreed that clause 49, entitled &#147;Directions by
the Secretary of State&#148;, would stand part of the Bill. Again,
the Secretary of State can direct what information is required. The new
clause sets out a number of specific areas that the report must cover.
However, I reiterate that it is quite unnecessary because the strong
expectation is that the agency will cover each and every one of those
areas in its report without the need to spell them out in the Bill. It
is that dreaded principle again. Indeed, specifying particular
areas&#151;as the debate we have had about the list principle
shows&#151;risks the omission of others.</div>
					<a name="08011811000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision is deliberately
unspecific in order to allow maximum flexibility and to enable the
agency to respond to changing circumstances, such as those that have
been mentioned&#151;housing market renewal and the Thames Gateway.
The detail of what we would expect reports to cover would be set out in
the tasking framework for the agency. As I have said before, the
tasking framework is an administrative tool that will set out many of
Ministers&#146; expectations regarding the way in which the Homes and
Communities Agency will conduct itself.</div>
					<a name="08011811000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I understand the view
of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire and accept that he is
sincere, I strongly urge the Committee to agree that the new clause is
not necessary and I ask that it be
withdrawn.</div>

					<a name="08011811000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am conscious of the fact that
my name sits in splendid isolation above new clause 16. I hope in the
next few minutes to galvanise some support across the Committee for the
need to press the Government to reach a judgment and possibly a
decision on a possible risk attached to the Bill&#146;s objective,
which my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire
correctly described as a step change in the output of housing in this
country. It poses a fundamental question of values for the Government
about the degree to which we are prepared to take risks with public
health in meeting that objective. The purpose of the clause is straight
forward; to impose a duty on the Homes and Communities Agency to
consider the risks to health arising from what are known as extremely
low frequency electromagnetic fields when carrying out its functions,
particularly in respect of the location and development of housing. I
do not know how many scientists or engineers are on the Committee, but
I needed some help in defining electromagnetic fields. In the
cross-party inquiry into childhood leukaemia and extremely low
frequency electromagnetic fields published in July 2007 on which I had
the pleasure of serving they
are</div>
					<a name="08011811000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;electric fields and
magnetic fields are created by the generation and transmission of
electricity. The term EMF is used to describe the mixture of these
fields to which people are exposed. Major sources of EMF in our
environment include High-Voltage Overhead Transmission
Lines&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>
					<a name="08011811000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;electricity
sub-stations&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thorny
problem facing us and the Government arises from growing evidence of an
association&#151;I use that word very carefully for the
Minister&#151;between an increased risk of childhood leukaemia and
the location of homes and, while we are about it, schools. The
Committee should be aware that childhood leukaemia is now the most
common childhood cancer, accounting for a third of all childhood cancer
cases. Around 500 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>children are diagnosed every year and, although survival rates have
improved, the incidence has been increasing; indeed, it doubled between
the 1970s and the 1990s. So, it is a big deal. As we pointed out in the
inquiry, there maybe many factors causing childhood leukaemia, we do
not know enough. The inquiry chairman, the hon. Member for Dartford
(Dr. Stoate), who, as the House is aware, is a practising GP,
states:</div>
					<a name="08011811000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Current
scientific thinking is that childhood leukaemia is likely to have more
than one cause and there may be many factors in the development of the
disease.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I will point
out, there is growing evidence for an association and therefore, we
should be very careful about the risks associated with pylons. I will
set out the key milestones in the accumulation of evidence. In 2004 the
Health Protection Agency recommended that the
Government</div>
					<a name="08011811000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consider the
need for further precautionary measures to reduce public exposure to
EMF&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, the
groundbreaking Draper report, of which the Minister will be aware,
funded by the Department of Health found that children living within
200 m of high-voltage power lines from birth, had a 69 per cent.
increased risk of developing leukaemia in childhood. That is a very big
number. In response to the Health Protection Agency, the Department of
Health set up the Stakeholder Advisory Group on Extremely Low Frequency
Electromagnetic Fields&#151;SAGE&#151;in 2005 to make
recommendations to Government on practical precautionary measures to
reduce public EMF exposure from sources such as high-voltage power
lines. It published its first interim assessment in  April
2007. It identified a ban on building new homes and schools within
specified distances of power  lines as
the</div>
					<a name="08011811000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;best available
option for obtaining significant
exposure&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">from
power lines. SAGE was followed by the cross-party inquiry, on which I
served, into childhood leukaemia and the association with extremely
low-frequency EMF&#151;defined as electromagnetic fields with a
frequency of between 30 and 300 Hz, which is the rate specified in the
clause that I have moved today. The inquiry also recommended a
moratorium on building new homes and schools within specified distances
of these transmission lines. In 2007 the Government referred the SAGE
report back to the Health Protection Agency for guidance. The HPA has
issued guidance on the report and our inquiry, stating that there are a
number of epidemiological studies showing an association between living
close to high-voltage power lines and a small excess of childhood
leukaemia. The Health Protection Agency recommended that the attention
of local authority planning departments and the electricity companies
be drawn to the evidence for a possible small increase in childhood
leukaemia that may result from siting new buildings very close to power
lines.</div>
					<a name="08011811000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
steady development of evidence and recommendations have been put before
the Government, which they are now mulling over. The Minister of State,
Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn
Primarolo), who deals with public health, is on the record as saying
that her Department will consider the advice in consultation with other
Departments, the devolved Administrations and the
HPA.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>
					<a name="08011811000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister here today, in
response to Children with Leukaemia, wrote
saying,</div>
					<a name="08011811000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
issue obviously needs serious thought and we will be in touch with you
once we have shaped our thinking in the light of all the advice that
has now emerged.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
aware that this is a highly complicated and thorny issue with
implications for some of the policy responses to the recommendations,
not least in terms of the implications for land values. I am aware of
that because we addressed those matters in our
inquiry.</div>
					<a name="08011811000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
provides an opportunity for adopting in a robust and real way the
precautionary principle. If the Minister has any doubt about the
popular support for that, I refer him to a series of early-day motions
tabled in this Parliament: early-day motion 403, which refers to
concern about the increase of leukaemia related to proximity to power
lines, was signed by 233 Members of Parliament and early-day motion
1784 was signed by 146
MPs.</div>
					<a name="08011811000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">We spent some
time in our inquiry gauging public opinion on this matter, with the
help of the Children with Leukaemia charity. A survey from Opinion
Leader research showed that three out of five people surveyed were
concerned about the effects of electromagnetic fields on health and
three out of four people surveyed thought that preventive action should
be taken to protect children from EMF
exposure.</div>
					<a name="08011811000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Minister to be bold. I know that he is a sensitive man: he and I carved
exotic animals out of blocks of ice one afternoon recently. Sensitivity
is not enough at this stage. In the face of growing evidence, we need
to take this issue seriously. It is time for the Government to take a
view and communicate it. The simple question is, do the Government
acknowledge the risk and, if so, why should we take
any?</div>

						</b> I should like to put on the record the Conservative
Front Bench&#146;s support in respect of the issues so ably raised by
my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I pay tribute to him
and to his colleagues from all parties for their work on this delicate
subject.</div>
					<a name="08011811000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is an odd phenomenon. I suspect that quite a lot of MPs have had the
odd occasion in their constituency when something has been raised with
them that has led to queries about the safety of exposure to EMFs. That
is demonstrated by the breadth of cross-party support for the early-day
motions. In supporting my hon. Friend, I accept that there seems to be
some substance to this matter, and that it is sensible to take action
now to try to ensure that nothing new is done that would add to the
number of children who have been affected. I appreciate that, again, we
are getting into lists and picking out specific examples, but the
Minister is interested in the matter and we want to see how far he
could
go.</div>
					<a name="08011811000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested in the block of ice business in which my hon. Friend and

development tool that I have not yet cottoned on to&#151;perhaps it
is something that I can introduce in my new role to see how it helps my
colleagues to develop. Perhaps the Minister could tell me more later.
However, this is a serious amendment that deals with a serious subject
for the families concerned. I hope that the Minister can respond in
some way to the matters raised by my hon.

&#214;pik:
						</b> It would not be reasonable to expect the
Minister to become an expert on electromagnetic fields, given that his
portfolio is housing. However, this is an interesting debate and I hope
that I will remain in order, Mr. Gale, if I highlight a
couple of thoughts. I have looked at this research myself. I come from
a scientific background and my father was a physicist. There is no
question but that when dealing with energy, there can be unintended
consequences on health, as intimated by the hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood. It is perfectly plausible to draw an association
between radiation and health, so it is reasonable to obtain the
Minister&#146;s perspective on how the Government perceive the
precautionary principle in relation to radiation sources. We have
probably all had some dialogue with individuals who are concerned about
mobile phone masts. Indeed, I participated in a conference in this very
room on that subject some time ago.</div>
					<a name="08011811000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have looked
at a lot of the research on this matter, and I think that much of it is
equivocal and circumstantial. One highly publicised research report
seemed to be based on a very small sample, and I wondered whether the
sample was sufficiently significant to provide reliable results.
Nevertheless, if there is not sufficient evidence, it is incumbent on
the Government to research the matter further. Will the Minister give
us his views on something that I have long regarded as the most
sensible way forward on this and other health-related housing and
accommodation matters? If we tabulated health data on a geographical
basis, we could see whether regular patterns are developing around the
country, perhaps around certain industrial sectors or concentrations of
radiation sources. That would greatly help us to build a more reliable
understanding of the causal links between such relatively new
technologies and the human
body.</div>
					<a name="08011811000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
there are risks to certain industries. If they were shown to be
significant polluters of health, the consequences would be very
expensive. Notwithstanding that, strides in technology have been so
great that we have probably wandered into a technological environment
in which there are unintended consequences on human health that we are
only beginning to understand. Will the Minister consider the case for a
geographical tabulation of illness around the country? If so, perhaps
we can discuss this issue further.</div>

							<a name="08011811000479"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I commend the hon. Gentlemen who have spoken to
the new clause on the manner in which they did so. They spoke with
sensitivity, which is to be expected from members of such a
high-calibre Committee. I pay tribute particularly to the hon. Member
for Ruislip-Northwood. I know that he is interested in this issue and
that, as he said, he participated in the cross-party inquiry into
childhood leukaemia and extremely low frequency electric and magnetic
fields. I think he said that the inquiry reported last July and made a
number of recommendations. I thank him and the other members of the
inquiry team for their work, which has made an important contribution
to the debate on exposure to electric and magnetic fields.</div>
					<a name="08011811000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
frequencies to which the amendment relates are known as extremely low
frequency electric and magnetic fields. For ease, I shall refer to them
as ELFEMFs. The main sources of those fields are power lines,
electricity substations, household wiring and electrical appliances
around the home. Let me be blunt about my approach 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>to the new clause. I do not believe that the proposed duty on the HCA is
necessary or appropriate, as there are already guidelines on the
exposure of people to ELFEMFs. The Government are considering the need
for additional practical precautionary measures beyond the adoption of
the guidelines. Any precautionary measures that are deemed necessary
will be implemented at a national level. That is a crucial point. As
such, a duty does not need to be placed on the HCA.</div>
					<a name="08011811000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might help hon. Members to
understand the matter better if I set out the current framework for
limiting exposure to ELFEMFs. Hon. Members may be aware that the
Government take advice from the Health Protection Agency on limiting
exposure to ELFEMFs. In 2004, following a comprehensive review of the
available scientific evidence, to which the hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood alluded, the then National Radiological Protection
Board, which is now part of the Health Protection Agency, recommended
the adoption of guidelines set out by the International Commission on
Non-Ionizing Radiation
Protection.</div>

guidelines, known as the ICNIRP guidelines, are based on the
established health effects of exposure to ELFEMF, and set values for
workers, building in a significant level of protection. The guidelines
for public exposure to power frequency magnetic fields incorporate a
further five-fold safety margin from those for workers in recognition
of the fact that the general population includes individuals who may be
more sensitive to adverse health effects than the working population.
However, as the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood eloquently said,
there are uncertainties associated with the health effects of exposure
below the guidelines, and in view of those uncertainties, the HPA also
recommended that the Government should consider the need for further
precautionary measures in respect of exposure to
ELFEMFs.</div>
					<a name="08011811000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to that recommendation, the stakeholder advisory group on
ELFEMFs&#151;SAGE&#151;was established. It brought together a range
of stakeholders, including academics, electricity industry
representatives and pressure groups, with a remit to identify and
explore the implications for a precautionary approach, and to make
practical recommendations for precautionary measures. SAGE reported in
April 2007, and made a number of important recommendations on power
lines, property, and wiring and electricity in
homes.</div>
					<a name="08011811000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps one of
the most pertinent recommendations to the Government&#146;s housing
delivery agenda was the option that an effective way significantly to
reduce exposure to ELFEMFs was to introduce a moratorium on the
building of new homes and schools within at least 60 m of high-voltage
overhead lines, and on the building of new high-voltage lines within 60
m of existing homes and schools. That is known as the corridor
approach.</div>
					<a name="08011811000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">SAGE
undertook a cost-benefit analysis of the proposal, and found that such
an approach would not pass a cost-benefit test by conventional Treasury
book rules. For that reason, SAGE could not recommend that approach,
but presented it merely as an option for consideration. SAGE asked the
Government to make a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>clear decision on whether to implement the option and, further to its
report, a cross-party inquiry, of which the hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood was a member, specifically recommended that that
option should be implemented. On receipt of the SAGE report, the
Government sought the advice of the HPA on the recommendations. In
November 2007, the HPA responded to SAGE&#146;s report. A key
statement in that response
was:</div>
					<a name="08011811000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HPA
supports precautionary measures that have a convincing evidence base to
show that they will be successful in reducing exposure, are effective
in providing reassurance to the public, and where the overall benefits
outweigh the fiscal and social
costs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The HPA
also noted that the corridor option considered by SAGE for separating
new dwellings from high-voltage power lines and vice versa, is not
supported by the cost-benefit analysis, even assuming a causal link
between exposure to ELFEMFs and childhood leukaemia, so a decision to
implement that precautionary option should, frankly, be weighed against
other health benefits obtainable from the same resources. Nevertheless,
HPA recommends that within the existing Government planning framework,
the attention of local authority planning departments and the
electricity companies should be drawn to the evidence for a possible
small increase in childhood leukaemia that may result from siting new
buildings very close to existing buildings.</div>
					<a name="08011811000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will recognise that the issue of exposure to ELFEMFs, which we are
considering, is vital. Hon. Members can be assured that we are
carefully considering HPA&#146;s advice on the recommendations in the
SAGE report in conjunction with other Departments and the devolved

Shapps:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale. We can broadly
welcome sustainability certificates, although we will be interested to
see how they work. There is a lot of detail in clause 242 and
subsequent clauses about how these certificates should operate. The
Government should be wary, following their experience of introducing
another kind of certificate in the form of HIPs. I know that 
the experience will be a scar borne by the Minister and his right hon.
Friend the Minister for Housing for years to
come.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>
					<a name="08011811000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The certificates do not appear
to have a cost or even an estimated cost attached to it. I imagine that
that is because it would vary widely depending on the kind of
new home. The scope of the sustainability certificate&#151;I do not
want to stray into clause 243&#151;is quite broad. There is a long
list of different areas that it may cover.</div>
					<a name="08011811000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to pick the Minister up
on clause 242(8) and the unusual drafting language. It says:</div>
					<a name="08011811000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The seller is not
required to comply with a requirement imposed by virtue of this section
if the seller has a reasonable excuse for not complying with the
requirement.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether the Minister could clarify&#151;I congratulate the
drafters for not writing this in gobbledegook&#151;what a reasonable
excuse would
entail?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000486"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> I share one of the concerns that we have just
heard, and it relates to certificates as a whole. The certificates
represent a comprehensive effort by the Government to enshrine
sustainability considerations in the housing market. It is worth
remembering that the overwhelming majority of property that
will accommodate the British population in 2050 has already been built.
As such, our real challenge is not to ensure that new housing stock is
sustainable, although that of course is important, but to bring
existing stock up to sustainability standards. This can be done at a
high price today, but hopefully at a much lower price in the future. My
worry is whether a certificate will really do what the Government want
it to do.</div>
					<a name="08011811000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
slightly confused, for example, by the wording of clause 242. It seems
to require compulsion, but also to allow mitigating circumstances. It
makes me believe that those people who have a good story to tell about
their houses will get a sustainability certificate, and the owners of
those houses which leak energy like a sieve will probably not seek such
a certificate.</div>
					<a name="08011811000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
two questions, therefore, for the Minister. First, how can we be sure
that the sustainability certificates will not be self-selected by those
who want to talk positively about their sustainable house and that
there will be no compulsion for those with less sustainable houses to
come clean about that. Secondly, how confident can we be that these
certificates will make a positive impact, given that the home
information packs have everything apart from solid data behind them to
prove their efficacy for the housing market and for a potential
purchaser?</div>
					<a name="08011811000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000487"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> This is an important part of the Bill. We have
spent a lot of time in Committee talking about more homes and better
designed homes. This part of the Bill talks about greener homes, and is
absolutely essential to achieve the world-beating ambition that my
right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing has set the industry of
making sure that all homes built after 2016 are zero carbon. It is an
important point. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said, we do
need to address the fact that homes &#147;leak energy&#148;
because&#151;as I have pointed out to the Committee already&#151;27
per cent of all of the UK&#146;s carbon emissions come from domestic
dwellings, and we need to address that.</div>
					<a name="08011811000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
look at this in the round, and the measures that we are introducing to
improve the sustainability of new homes will include a major
progressive tightening 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>of the energy-efficiency standards in building
regulations. This will mean a 25 per cent. improvement against current
standards in 2010, followed by a 4 per cent. improvement in 2013 and
then, in 2016, the zero carbon target that I mentioned earlier will be
introduced.</div>
					<a name="08011811000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">This will
improve the energy efficiency of both the fabric of homes and of the
type of energy supplied. In December last year, we published a new
planning policy statement on climate change. It puts climate change at
the very heart of the planning system by ensuring that new communities
are located and designed in a way that reduces the need for travel and
makes best use of low-carbon and renewable energy. In addition, since
October 2007, a stamp duty land tax exemption for zero carbon homes has
been in place, so that houses can act as an incentive for developers to
build zero carbon homes. We will also shortly introduce new minimum
standards in building regulations to make new homes more
water-efficient.</div>
					<a name="08011811000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 242
allows the Government to make regulations to ensure that anybody
building a new home has very clear information on the sustainability of
that new home. This will be in the form of either a sustainability
certificate showing that the home meets higher sustainable standards
than a home that has been built to minimum regulatory standards in
building regulations, or a written statement that the home does not
have a sustainability certificate. These certificates or statements
must be provided free of charge to the home buyer. It is important that
we are making sustainability assessments, and I stress the word
&#147;assessments&#148;, mandatory for all new homes. We are making
the provision of clear, transparent information on sustainability
mandatory and this can include statements of non-assessment, which are
self declarations and do not involve employing an
assessor.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08011811000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
England, it is proposed that the sustainability rating system will be
the code for sustainable homes. This code was introduced in April 2007
and is an assessment and rating system that provides a framework within
which house builders can improve the overall sustainability of
new-build homes. The Code provides a mechanism by which builders can be
recognised for going beyond the building regulations for energy and
other aspects of
sustainability.</div>
					<a name="08011811000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
lack of credible information on the sustainability of new homes is
limiting our efforts to encourage the market to provide more
sustainable homes. Home buyers currently have limited information on
the environmental performance and wider sustainability of new homes. I
strongly believe that this clause will ensure that information is
available on all new homes to allow purchasers to make informed
choices.</div>

I clarify one thing? I have been passed inspiration. I want to make
something clear, in case I have misled the Committee. We are not making
assessments mandatory, we are making rating mandatory. There could be a
statement of non-assessment where the property has not been given a
rating. I hope that that is
clear.</div>
					<a name="08011811000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I go on,
I would like to make a point that links in with the HIPs issue, which I
have debated on many occasions with the right hon. Gentleman.
Information for purchasers of new properties is absolutely vital to
drive up environmental standards. I draw the attention of Members to
fridge ratings. The market moved considerably when easy-to-understand
ratings for fridges and other electrical appliances were provided.
Everyone is very clear about what a fridge rating A means and what a
fridge rating C means and it is rare these days, because the industry
has responded to the system, to see a fridge rating E or whatever. I
think that the market will respond to the fact we are making
sustainability ratings for houses mandatory in a very positive
manner.</div>
					<a name="08011811000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000494"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> What I am concerned about&#151;the
Minister&#146;s inspiration has reinforced my concern&#151;is the
schizophrenic nature of this clause. He is saying that every new
property must have a rating, but it is not compulsory to have an
assessment. I do not understand how one can have a rating without an
assessment.</div>
					<a name="08011811000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000495"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That would be a zero rating. I will give him an
example. A buyer is choosing between two flats&#151;one with a code
certificate, showing a rating of, say, one, six or five stars; the
other with a statement of non-assessment, which would be a zero star
certificate under the code. That buyer will be able to see&#151;this
is the point that I was making about refrigerators&#151;that they are
choosing between a sustainable home that is more economical to run, and
will reduce their impact on the environment, and a home that was
probably built, as that zero star certificate indicates, to minimum
regulatory standards.</div>
					<a name="08011811000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
a big push towards sustainability assessments, because they will enable
that home buyer to make an informed choice and we hope that they will
choose a home that will have a minimum long-term impact on the
environment and&#151;probably more pertinent to them&#151;on their
wallet. There are also benefits from other sustainability improvements
that will be put into the code.</div>

Shapps:
						</b> We are all in agreement about the need to do these
things. At the same time, hon. Members on both sides of the House
recognise the necessity not to make things overly bureaucratic and the
balance may be there in clause 242. However, there is some concern in
the industry. I note that the Home Builders Federation has said that
there is scope for duplication between energy performance certificates
and the sustainability certificate. The federation is concerned about
whether there will be sufficient numbers of assessors to implement the
certificates, although I imagine that that is not a huge problem at
this stage, as the measure will come in over a period of time as new
homes are built. But the National Housing Federation is calling for
a</div>
					<a name="08011811000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sensible integration
of the EPC and the Code rating.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011811000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, it is difficult to see how that
could be achieved, given that one is a 1 to 6 rating and the other is
an A to F. It could be confusing to a potential purchaser, who might
have a sustainability rating of 4 but an energy rating of E. How would
they determine which one to
follow?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000497"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but the approach in the legislation was developed in close consultation
with the industry. For example, it is possible&#151;and this is
something that we raised in spring and summer&#151;that there would
be a need for a rating of zero, and an assessor would have to go out
and provide a zero-rated assessment on the property. We listened to the
industry, which said that such a requirement would entail a
disproportionate amount of cost and effort, so it was not necessary.
That is why it is possible to have a self-assessed zero certificate,
which reduces costs. Listening to stakeholders and the relevant
industry bodies has paid dividends, as we will see much greater
synthesis of EPCs and the code in future. However, I do not want to
pre-empt anything regarding future-proofing.</div>
					<a name="08011811000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to point out that we listened closely to the industry, which
raised concerns about costs. However, it is very much up for the
initiative, which is a means of achieving our ambitious target of
making sure that we have zero-carbon homes by 2016. We want to make
sure that we make as much progress as possible on improved
sustainability and minimising environmental damage, while addressing
the industry&#146;s very real concerns about
costs.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000498"></a>Mr.

						</b> I fully support the emphasis that the Government
have placed on higher energy efficiency standards for new homes.
However, I also back the concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for
Welwyn Hatfield expressed about the clarity of message to the consumer,
who is bombarded with messages on climate change. The psychology of
their reaction to such messages is now at quite a delicate stage. The
Minister spoke about the evolution and integration of the two measures.
Would it not be better to get it right now, and give just one simple
certificate and one simple message to the marketplace about
properties&#146; sustainability and energy
efficiency?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000499"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> In a perfect world, it would be great to be able
to do so, but the certificates assess the sustainability of new build.
That is important, because we cannot compare apples with pears. The
nature of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>the code is based predominately on new build, which could be
construction or off-site construction that is later brought to site.
EPCs and such things do not take that into account because they deal
with existing homes. As we move forward and more research is done, we
may be able to achieve greater synthesis. I am sure that the whole
House would accept that. In the meantime, new build and existing
properties must be dealt with separately if we are to address concerns
about how we calculate their impact on the environment. I hope that
that answers the questions of the hon. Members for Ruislip-Northwood,
Welwyn Hatfield, and

not buy houses very often, and they already have to deal with the
complexities of the home information packs. Why do the Government not
seek a more user-friendly approach consistent with, for example, the A
to F-rating on white goods? It does not matter how efficient a house
is, it is the absolute energy usage which determines how much carbon it
produces. We do not need to say, &#147;It is a huge house, but it is
efficient&#148;. We simply need to know how much energy it uses in
relative terms. Could the Government consider before the Bill&#146;s
Report stage whether it is possible to simplify the measure, as it
could end up a quagmire?</div>

						</b> I am always happy to consider matters raised by
the hon. Gentleman and other Committee Members. There may be a
communication issue; the code is very clear about the sustainability
rating, which ranges from one to six. One star means that a building
has just achieved code standards, and six stars are the highest
possible rating. People will acknowledge and appreciate the fact that,
as in the star rating for fridges, if they buy a
six-star home they are acquiring cutting-edge technology and an
exemplar in sustainability. &#147;Six stars are the best you can
get&#148; is a very simple message. I accept that there is an issue
communicating that, but we can do
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000502"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> That creates confusion in the consumer&#146;s
mind. The code and the EPC are almost working in opposite ways. Under
the code, six stars are the best result, whereas with an EPC, one wants
to go the other way, towards an A, to be excellent. Is confusion not
built into the
system?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000503"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> No, I disagree completely. If hon. Members talked
to any normal people&#151;I do so frequently, although not in the
House&#151;and asked them what an A meant, or what a star meant, they
would know that an A or a six-star rating, as opposed to four, three or
two stars, was a good thing. The hon. Gentleman would accept that that
is the case: it is not confusing, as it taps into the mindset of what
consumers think anyway. When people do GCSEs and A-levels and attain
A-grades, it is considered a good thing, so I do not think that there
is any difficulty with the measure.</div>

						</b> That was probably a useful exchange, as it
clarified which, in my view, was not clear. If the Minister thinks that
a six-star rating is as clear as an A, why not call it an A? People
would understand it. They have got used to such a rating with white
goods, and it would create a consistent message. However clever I
pretend to be, I am sure that I would be confused if one thing says
&#147;six stars&#148; , which is a lot, and something else says,
&#147;A&#148;, which does not sound like a lot. There is a simple
solution and I hope that the Government make a small housekeeping
change to create consistency in what they are trying to
achieve.</div>

							<a name="08011811000505"></a>Mr.

						</b> I am sympathetic to what the hon. Gentleman is
saying, but a six-star rating is higher than an A-rating under the EPC.
However, I concede that an important point has been made, and I will
look at it. The challenge is communicating the difference to consumers,
and making sure that they are fully aware of how the ratings work. May
I emphasise that the central point, which is that consumers tend to
believe that an EPC A-rating is generally a good thing, and that an F
or G-rating is generally a bad thing. As for the ratings for new homes,
one star is not particularly good, and six stars is the best one can
get. In that respect, I do not think there is any confusion, but I
concede that we may need to do further work on consumer behaviour. None
the less, I maintain strongly that the arrangement should
remain.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Raynsford</b>: May I support the Minister in saying that we
are dealing with a huge spectrum of housing? In the existing housing
stock, a substantial proportion of houses is sadly in poor condition,
and necessary but elementary improvements would only bring them to a
low level in comparison with what has been achieved with new housing.
For the best house builders, achieving code level 6 by 2016 is highly
ambitious.</div>
					<a name="08011811000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
timetable, I understand that clause 242 will be introduced at a time of
the Government&#146;s deciding&#151;I cannot see a date in the
Bill. How do the Government intend to plan the introduction of the
provisions to coincide with the ratcheting-up of standards between now
and 2016, and specifically the achievement of code levels 3 and 4? I
imagine that that would be within the time scale that the Government
envisage for implementation, and I would be grateful for guidance on
the timetable.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000507"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> We will continue to consider the timetable for
implementation. It is important that we continue to talk to the
industry about the matter to ensure that we hit those targets. The
targets for 2010, 2013 and 2016 were devised in full consultation with
the industry, and the industry is up for them. It has set itself
ambitious targets, and we want to ensure that they are achieved. We
will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that that is
the case.</div>

							<a name="08011811000508"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> Although some of industry leaders are
definitely up for it&#151;there is no question about that, and the
HBF is supportive&#151;some parts of the industry are dragging their
feet. They are not committed, and would be only too happy to have an
opportunity to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>renege on the commitments given on their behalf by industry leaders. It
is terribly important that the Government give a clear indication of
the commitment and the time scale for achieving it so as to allow those
who are reluctant little or no opportunity for
backsliding.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000509"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That is an important point. By giving the market
much more certainty over the direction of travel and what we need to
achieve with zero-carbon homes, developers, manufacturers and others
can make the investment decisions necessary for the industry to adapt
to the changing regulatory environment that will result from
improvements to building regulations and other measures. As a result of
the measures in the Bill, particularly chapter 1, the industry can make
those investment decisions now. However, I fully take on board what my
right hon. Friend said about providing certainty.</div>
					<a name="08011811000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">By applying technical guidance
in the code, people will have a better idea of how to attain improved
energy efficiency. The provisions underline our serious intent to make
zero-carbon performance a building regulation requirement from 2016.
The clause allows regulations to be made to ensure that a
sustainability certificate or a statement of non-assessment is given to
everyone who buys a new home, whether off plan, or after the home is
completed or newly constructed. People given an interim certificate
when buying off plan will be guaranteed a final post-construction
certificate confirming that what was designed was indeed
built.</div>
					<a name="08011811000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Homes and
Communities Agency will continue the commitment of the Housing
Corporation and English Partnerships to build homes to code level 3.
Houses built to that code will be 25 per cent. more energy-efficient
than those required under the 2006 building regulations. A typical flat
built to those standards will reduce carbon emissions by 450 kg a year.
I believe that I said on Second Reading that that is equivalent to
emissions over 1,500 miles from an average motor
vehicle.</div>
					<a name="08011811000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
devolved functions, the Minister for Environment, Sustainability and
Housing in the Welsh Assembly Government, recently announced the
adoption of the code for sustainable homes for Assembly
Government-funded social housing, although the level has yet to be
determined. Regulations to introduce a certification scheme for Wales
will be the subject of consultation when the Bill is introduced. The
hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield made a good point about clause 242(8),
which refers to &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;. His argument was
well reasoned, but it is impossible to foresee every possible
circumstance in which a duty holder might be prevented from fulfilling
the duty to provide a sustainability certificate or a statement to the
effect that there is no certificate. Any excuse offered to an enforcing
authority during a review of a penalty charge notice, or on appeal
following confirmation of a notice after such a review, is to be judged
objectively, in view of what is reasonable in the individual
circumstances and given the background to the case. I am sorry that I
cannot provide the further clarification that the hon. Gentleman
desires, but I hope that I have reassured
him.</div>

							<a name="08011811000510"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> The Minister has done so, and I thank him for his
explanation. I commend the draftsmen on the very sensible and clear
language in the Bill. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>However, I remain slightly confused about how  clause 242(8)
works in conjunction with subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b). Subsection (8)
states:</div>
					<a name="08011811000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
seller is not required to comply with a requirement imposed by virtue
of this section if the seller has a reasonable excuse for not
complying&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that
mean that they do not have to comply with the requirement in subsection
(1)(a) to produce a sustainability certificate, or with the requirement
in subsection (1)(b) to provide a written statement saying that a
certificate does not need to be produced? I cannot see why somebody
would not at least carry out the requirement under subsection (1)(b).
There seems to be a contradiction in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011811000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000511"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I think that I followed the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument, and I suggest that it is an either/or
situation. The seller is required to provide either a sustainability
certificate or a written statement to that effect. Subsection (8) deals
with non-compliance conditions, and it is either the sustainability
certificate or the written statement that need not be supplied.
However, I understand the logic of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument
about why a seller would not provide a written statement, which returns
to the point about &#147;reasonable excuse&#148; that he made
earlier.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000512"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> So effectively a seller could comply either with
subsection (1)(a) or with subsection (1)(b). If they failed to comply
with either of those provisions, they would simply need to comply with
subsection (8), in which case they would comply with subsection (1)(b)
in the process. That seems a circular procedure. Have I understood it
correctly?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000513"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> No, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman has not. The
onus is clearly on the seller to provide the certificate, or a written
statement to that effect. If they do not do so, they must provide a
reasonable excuse. That will be tested, perhaps by the enforcing
authority or through the courts. I hope that that answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question. It seems clear in my mind, but I apologise
to him if I have not articulated it correctly or well enough for him.
However, I hope that it provides him with
reassurance.</div>

to revisit clause 243 and subsequent clauses between now and Report

him to reconsider this group of clauses. I might even do some

about costs, but the cost of a sustainability certificate would vary,
depending on the size of the development, the services provided and so
on. So I cannot provide a great deal of reassurance to the hon.
Gentleman in that respect. We expect the average cost of a certificate
to be about &#163;210 or &#163;220 per home, but we have forecast
that it could be as high as &#163;1,600 for a single home on a single
site that was built in isolation. I imagine that, as the information
becomes clearer to the industry and there is greater awareness of what

I hope that he recognises the consequences of what he has said. As I
understand it, the certificates that we were previously discussing
incur a fee for the vendor, but the Minister has said that the
Government will resource the authorities for the extra burden. I
suspect that he may not have thought through entirely the relative
sharing of cost between the vendors, who require the enforcement
authorities to carry out the work, and the authorities. If he is honest
and says that he has not thought about it, that is fair enough, but we
need some clarity on the issue. This is important because it is
unquestionably at the cutting edge in the eyes of the public. The
answers to my questions will to a large extent define the cost of the
certificates to potential vendors. The more the Government pay, the
less the certificates will cost vendors, and vice versa. I highlight
this matter as being of strategic importance to vendors, if only of
tactical importance to the Government.</div>

						</b> I am slightly puzzled as to who, apart from a
potential purchaser, will want or need to see the certificates. The
clause is all about how to deal with someone who will not produce one.
If a certificate is not produced when required, surely the buyer will
not complete the sale, so I am puzzled as to why the
clause  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>is necessary, particularly as we shall go on to talk about enforcement
and penalties for people who do not produce certificates as required.
In what circumstances will the power be
needed?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000529"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> As we are making it mandatory to provide
information on the sustainability of new homes, we need an arm to
enforce that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000530"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> But my point is that if I were a purchaser and I
knew that I needed a certificate, my lawyer would not let me complete
the sale unless I had received it. Why would anyone else need to be
involved? If the vendor did not produce one, I would not go ahead with
the sale, so it is in their interests to produce one. Who else needs to
be
involved?</div>
					<a name="08011811000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000531"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I accept that it is in the vendor&#146;s
interests to produce it, but not all information is always provided.
Given that it is mandatory to provide a certificate, we need to have an
enforcement element. It is similar to the situation with HIPs. I am
sure that the hon. Gentleman wants to lead me down that route, but I
shall go down it anyway. Home information packs are mandatory on all
properties now, but in some cases they are not provided and we need
enforcement. It is a natural part of business, and it seems
reasonable.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000532"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The Minister is doing well, but he is struggling on
this issue. If, when buying a property, I need to see the HIP or the
sustainability certificate before I complete the transaction, but it
does not happen, I will not go ahead, so it is at the vendor&#146;s
expense if they do not comply.</div>
					<a name="08011811000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the clause talks
about</div>
					<a name="08011811000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an authorised
officer of an enforcement
authority&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011811000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who
is the authorised officer, what is he authorised to do, and why? I am
not trying to harass the Minister or chase him down the HIPs route.
That job is usually done spectacularly well by my hon. Friend the
Member for Welwyn Hatfield&#151;and has been for several months.
Genuinely, who will turn up on the doorstep of a new house, as an
authorised officer in a uniform, like Deryck Guyler in &#147;Please
Sir!&#148;, if the Minister remembers it from days gone by, and say,
&#147;I am from&#148;&#151;whatever it is&#151;&#147;and I
demand to see your sustainability certificate, and if not I have these
powers&#148;?</div>
					<a name="08011811000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
intrigued as to how far the measure goes, because as the Minister
knows, there are national newspapers that are very concerned about the
increasing powers of people who would do just what I have described,
and it may be that a word will have to be had with those papers,
because they might be very interested. That is not a threat at all, but
I am genuinely puzzled about the circumstances in which the Minister
sees an authorised officer wanting to do what I have described. Who
would ask them to do it?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000533"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I do not want to labour the point, but enforcement
is a natural and necessary arm of such a mandatory measure. I shall use
the risk-based approach and suggest to the hon. Gentleman that if a
buyer complained to the trading standards officer, and said, &#147;I
have not got a certificate,&#148; the officer would
investigate.</div>

Wright:
						</b> That might be true. I do not remember
&#147;Please Sir!&#148;, as I am far too young for that, but I do
not foresee armies of people with peaked caps knocking on doors or
getting people out of bed at 3 o&#146;clock in the morning to look at
their sustainability certificate. I do not anticipate
that&#151;certainly not in such a liberal democracy as the one in
which we live.</div>
					<a name="08011811000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
approach will be risk-based and prompted by the buyer perhaps
complaining to trading standards. It will be based on the risk-based
weights and measures approach that trading standards takes. There
could be spot-checks, but I do not think that the hon.
Gentleman will be knocked out of bed at 3 o&#146;clock in the morning
by somebody from &#147;Please
Sir!&#148;</div>

							<a name="08011811000536"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I have listened intently, and the Minister has
reassured me about what will not happen; however, he has not yet given
me a concrete example of what might happen and why. If a buyer cannot
get hold of a certificate, he will not complete the purchase, so it is
the vendor&#146;s problem, not the buyer&#146;s. I should not go
rushing off to trading standards office in those circumstances. I
remain to be convinced that there is a purpose in an authorised officer
seeking the certificate in certain circumstances, but if the Minister
were to find, on reflection, one or two examples and he wanted to send
them to the Committee, I would be interested. However, I have no wish
to press the case any more.</div>

						<a name="08011811000537"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Syms:</b>
						 My hon. Friend has got me interested. One is just
trying to think of circumstances in which a certificate would not be
given, and one can think only of a repossession, in which a house might
be sold, although the certificate still might be available; an estate;
or a situation in which somebody had died and the executors were
selling on something. It is difficult to think of circumstances,
different from those described, in which it is the interests of the
seller to provide a certificate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011811000538"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman talked about two specific
situations: a repossession and somebody dying. However, they would
probably involve existing stock, and we are discussing new homes, so
the situation would be slightly different.</div>
					<a name="08011811000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to my point about my
risk-based approach on trading standards. Somebody who is buying a
property may complain to trading standards, as happens on a daily basis
on a whole range of matters, such as the service provided in a shop or
by a door-to-door salesman. Such complaints can be initiated and will
not mean that we are living in a police state where people are knocked
out of bed at 3 o&#146;clock in the
morning.</div>

							<a name="08011811000539"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I am a little surprised about the inclusion of
this clause. As I read it, it essentially says that despite all our
efforts to define the benefits and purpose of sustainability
certificates, in the extremely unlikely event of the Opposition getting
into government by some mishap, they could simply use the clause to
suspend the scheme immediately without having to repeal the Bill. I do
not know quite why we should want to make life easy for the Opposition
in that way.</div>
					<a name="08011811000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Welwyn Hatfield has made frequent noises about doing away
with HIPs, which would be a great mistake because they are valuable and
useful and will be popular by the time he has the prospect of being on
the Government Front Bench, if that time ever comes. He would
undoubtedly have second thoughts at that stage, but given that he has
made that commitment it would be interesting to know whether the
Opposition would make use of the clause to repeal sustainability
certificates. I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister cannot
possibly answer for him, but it would be interesting to have an
indication of whether the Opposition would use the clause in that way.
It appears to have been prepared for their
benefit.</div>

					<a name="08011811000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot see
anything that we have said that would give the right hon. Gentleman the
concerns that he has. The provision is in the Bill not because of an
amendment that we have tabled but because the Government have put it
there. His suspicions would be far better directed towards his own
Front Bench. He should ask under what circumstances use of the clause
would be considered&#151;perhaps when as able and effective a
Minister as the one before us is moved to some other place, someone
else might come along and seek to make use of it. Perhaps the clause
would be suspended if new homes were flooded, as some presumably are in
the west country at the moment. I do not know, but nothing that has
been said by the Opposition either on Second Reading or in Committee
could give the right hon. Gentleman cause to raise the concerns that he
has mentioned. We rest our
case.</div>
