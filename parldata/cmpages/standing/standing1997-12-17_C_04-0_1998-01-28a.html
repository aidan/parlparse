<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): Good morning, Mrs. Michie, and welcome to your first 
sitting as Chair of this Committee. We look forward to working with you. Before I come to the detail 
of my speech may I also quickly express the hope that the Committee will join me in congratulating 
my daughter Hannah, who is enjoying her 10th birthday this morning? She would prefer it if I were 
with her at home and not in Committee.
<P>
<B>Dr . Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, North): Is she not here with my hon. Friend?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> No, she is not; she is at school, However, she will be pleased that we are discussing 
this Bill, because she has a keen interest in animal welfare. My bills for the website always show that.
<P>
I come to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. 
Bennett). I have been speaking in the final couple of minutes of each of our sittings, and at the 
beginning of the subsequent sitting. Last week, I had just begun to discuss the amendments when our 
allocated time elapsed.
<P>
I was making the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish was doing the 
Committee a great service. He has tabled many amendments and it may—we shall have to wait and 
see—take time to debate them thoroughly. Ultimately, the Bill will be better for that. On Report, we 
will be able to tell the whole House that the Bill is robust and that the House can confidently continue 
to support it in the way that it did on Second Reading and in a way that accords with the wish of the 
huge majority of people in urban and rural areas.
<P>
At 1 pm last week, when time was called—a phrase that always disappoints me when I hear it—
I had just begun to outline my concern that hon. Members opposing the Bill seemed to be reluctant to 
carry out their responsibility. They have yet to vote against an amendment, a fact that can be only 
interpreted as signifying their agreement to the Bill as it stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): Will the hon. Gentleman explain why the hon. Member for 
Worcester (Mr. Foster) tabled an amendment and then voted against it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> It is not for me to speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. Perhaps, he 
will deal with that point later on.
<P>
Last week’s debate showed that the great majority of the Committee’s members thought that it 
was important that we discussed different aspects of the Bill and took up the concerns that had been 
raised with us. If the opponents of the Bill are incapable of doing their job, it is important that 
someone does it. [Interruption.] I welcome the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) to 
the Committee. If The Guardian report is accurate, he is the new Paddy Ashdown.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit Öpik </B>(Montgomeryshire): Stories of my promotion have been vastly exaggerated.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> That was my conclusion, too. Nevertheless, if the story was in The Guardian, it 
must be true—as Labour Members are only too aware.
<P>
Last week, we had a serious debate on the Committee’s role. If opponents of the Bill do not table 
amendments and we do not seek to ensure that the Bill is robust and does what the House wants, we 
shall have failed in our duty. I welcome what has been done by my hon. Friend the Member for 
Denton and Reddish. We may yet reach Report in complete harmony. Who knows? Certainly, there is 
no discord to report to the House. Opposition Members cannot condemn the actions of a diligent 
Member, such as my hon. Friend, who has done so much by tabling the amendments that we are 
discussing. Those who fail in their duty cannot condemn those who do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I repeat, for the record, that I intend to make a constructive contribution, albeit one 
that might be opposed to the debate on many occasions. I apologise for the interruption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am happy to give way to the hon. Member. To be fair, last week’s debate about 
the inactivity of Opposition Members took place when the hon. Gentleman was not present. I am sure 
that he would have made those points if he had been there.
<P>
The amendments that we are discussing would allow certain wild mammals to be hunted with 
dogs. I want to consider the case of mink; those creatures inspire such passion that on Second Reading 
my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) voted against the Bill purely 
to allow dogs to continue to hunt mink. Only two of the 418 Labour Members voted against the Bill; 
that is a very low percentage. The other Labour Member who voted against the Bill was my hon. 
Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey). Neither of them represent a rural constituency. 
Opposition Members might say, therefore, that their views are not valid because they come from areas 
where rural life and the need for hunting is not understood. Both of them make important and 
valuable contributions to many debates, but in terms of the Bill they could be likened to the dogs 
involved, inasmuch as they seem to be barking on this issue.
<P>
Are mink a problem? If they are, do we need hunting with dogs to control their numbers? We 
can certainly agree that mink are not natural inhabitants of our countryside. They were brought here 
for fur farming in the 1920s. That was not a wise decision and proves that if animals are put into 
unnatural habitats and treated unnaturally, there is often a price to pay. I hope that the Government 
will announce an end to fur farming during this Parliament. The Mink Keeping Order has been 
renewed for three years. On 11 December last year, I was a member of the Committee that discussed 
that order. The two hours that I served on the Committee were two of the most interesting hours of my 
entire life.
<P>
Under the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932, the Mink Keeping Order regulates mink 
farms, which have to purchase a licence—unnecessarily, in my opinion—and are now monitored by 
the Government. It is said sometimes that the presence of mink in the countryside, which is not their 
natural terrain, can be blamed on the activities of people fighting for animal rights. I do not deny that 
that has happened and I condemn such activities. Mink keeping Orders ensure that the animals are 
not let out into the countryside. However, the regulations did not come into effect until 1962 and there 
was already an established feral population in the 1950s. That was almost certainly due to poor 
husbandry and sloppy keeping of the animals. Mink can cause problems—of that there is no doubt—
but control is not easy and, frankly, the use of dogs is utterly irrelevant.
<P>
A former Labour Government set out on the courageous and heroic, if foolish, attempt to 
eradicate all wild mink in 1965. That policy was pursued for five years but was then abandoned 
because the task was impossible. Targeted control of mink in the wild is now thought to be the best 
option. Hon. Members will have heard me speak previously of my belief that hunting with dogs is 
particularly ineffective for targeted hunting for the obvious reason that mink will go where they go. It 
is a random method which should play no part in the impossible task of eradicating mink.
<P>
It is difficult to see why the amendments should be passed. They would simply allow the 
continuation of hunting with dogs for wild mammals such as mink. Indeed, if the practice were 
allowed to continue, it would contribute to a decline in the environment inhabited by mammals. A 
pack of dogs and associated hunt would be far more likely than mink to upset the balance of nature on 
river banks.
<P>
In 1983 the Otter Trust issued a statement:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“We condemn mink hunting as it frequently disturbs otters and otter habitats.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Environment Agency shares those concerns and goes further:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“This is an ineffective method of control and there is concern that it causes indiscriminate 
disturbance to river habitats, especially where otters are beginning to re-colonise. The Environment 
Agency wishes to discourage mink hunting where otters and other wildlife may be disturbed”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is as damning as it can be, and no one seriously suggests that mink hunting is not taking 
place where wildlife may be disturbed. The Environment Agency’s strong language can be interpreted 
only as a call for a complete ban on hunting with dogs for mink. That is relevant to our debate 
because some of the amendments would allow that practice to continue.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—also my 
honourable neighbour down the road in Scunthorpe—when asked in the debate on the Mink Keeping 
Order 1997 about mink control through hunting with dogs, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Even people who pursue that course would not pretend that it is an effective measure of 
control. It is like taking a JCB to sort out the moles in the lawn, and a lot less effective.”—[Official 
Report, Ninth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, 11 December 1997; c. 13.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with the second part of that statement, but not with the first—rare though it be for me to 
disagree with my hon. Friend. Some opponents of the Bill will pretend that hunting with dogs is an 
effective measure for controlling mink and other wild mammals.
<P>
After all, the level of self-delusion and pretence since the Bill was published appears to know no 
bounds. Opponents pretend that the Bill will persecute ordinary dog owners; that it is an urban versus 
the countryside issue; that rural people are in favour of hunting with dogs; that huge numbers of rural 
jobs are at stake. Yet none of those claims is true. Opponents also pretend that 125,000 people turned 
up at Hyde park, which is not true.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> What is the figure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> According to the Metropolitan police between 70,000 and 80,000. Far be it from 
me to say that the Metropolitan police are liars, but that may be what the hon. and learned Gentleman 
is trying to say. I utterly condemn people who are so willing to use their positions to attack those who 
have done so much to defend and support us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Is my hon. Friend aware that up to a third of those present at the Hyde 
park rally in July were employees who were told that they would be sacked if they did not attend?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> During our proceedings last week, the hon. Member for Taunton said that it was 
easy to pull numbers out of the air, if like some members of the Committee, one was not willing to 
accept the word of the police.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask the hon. Member to return to the subject of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Of course. I intend to talk about mink hunting and the possibility of using dogs for 
that purpose. However, some claims for the amendments are false.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman find it constructive to indulge in character assassination of 
the Opposition? The key questions are whether hunting with dogs is the most humane method of 
controlling mammal numbers and whether it is justifiable to ban a practice that many people believe 
to be humane.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I shall come to that later. However, it is worth putting the amendments in the 
context of the overall arguments. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary was being too 
optimistic when he claimed that people did not pretend that hunting with dogs was an effective 
method of controlling mink. There has been much pretence. Indeed, those who oppose the Bill are, in 
the words of the song, “the great pretenders”.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I apologise for intervening again, but I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman 
tries to undermine the character of people who have a different view of the Bill. He should focus on 
the merits and demerits of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Of course. I welcome contributions from the Opposition Benches because, until 
now, the silence has been deafening. I do not know whether that is because those who oppose the Bill 
understand the issues, or because they have little to say. Their contributions this morning have been 
limited to attacking the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am a very patient fellow, and I have listened to the hon. Gentleman’s utterances. 
If he listened to others, or read last week’s Hansard, he would know that hon. Members on the 
Opposition Benches made several contributions to the debate. I am prepared to listen to a considerable 
amount of waffle if it is in the Committee’s interest, but personal abuse, childish remarks and silly 
behaviour achieve nothing. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could return to the subject of mink hunting. 
Does he believe that mink are pests? If so, what, in his opinion, is the best method of controlling 
them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I shall deal with those matters as I develop my argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not want to make the hon. Gentleman stray out of order, but he would help the 
Committee if he answered my questions now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman is probably beyond help, but I shall do all I can.
<P>
I agree that the Committee is not the place to indulge in childish abuse or personal attacks. The 
hon. and learned Gentleman is the only person to have indulged in a personal attack today. I have not 
referred to any hon. Member.
<P>
The effect of the amendments on mink would be to continue to allow unnecessary damage to 
riverbanks and wildlife. Do mink pose the same threat?
<P>
Mrs. Michie, in a delightful coincidence in a parliamentary question on 22 June 1995, you asked 
the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“what assessment he has made of the damage done to marine birdlife by wild mink?”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Sir Hector Monro, then a Scottish Office Minister, replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“My right hon. Friend has received advice from Scottish Natural Heritage on the impact of 
mink on Scottish wildlife. The species is an active predator and established itself in the wild after 
escaping from mink farms as long ago as 1929. Research results indicate that mink has not had a 
serious effect on wildlife, though there remains concern about its possible effects on some colonies of 
ground-nesting seabirds.”—[Official Report, 22 June 1995; Vol. 262, c.423.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
I agree with what the Minister said about ground-nesting birds; they are equally at risk from a hunt. 
No member of the Committee would argue that protection of ground-nesting birds, especially in some 
of Scotland’s offshore islands, would be effectively advanced by hunting in those areas with dogs. 
Hunting would have a detrimental effect on those sites and on the birds nesting there.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): There are no mink packs in the western highlands or, I 
believe, in the whole of Scotland. The hon. Gentleman’s point is therefore irrelevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> It is not irrelevant. The fact that there are no packs in Scotland now does not mean 
that there will be none in the future, unless we ensure that the Bill becomes law. I thank the hon. 
Gentleman for helping me to make my point, which he showed was far from irrelevant.
<P>
The simple truth is that in many cases the number of wild mink is self-regulating, so an 
amendment is not needed to allow them to be hunted with dogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> A different interpretation of the same point is to say that in Scotland—at least in the 
highlands—there is no need to ban dog packs hunting mink because the industry regulates itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make. To put it more 
simply, hunting mink with dogs is irrelevant; it could be damaging in some environments. The fact 
that there is no such hunting at present is no reason to ensure that it does not happen in future. 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Does the hon. Member agree that the Scots have been more civilised than the 
English in this matter? I understand that there is no fox hunting north of north-east Fife. Stag hunting 
was banned in Scotland in the 1960s and we have just heard that there is very little mink-hunting 
there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for Taunton. As the product of Scottish parentage, I 
accept that there is a lot to be said for the civilisation north of the border. I am sure that you would 
want to be associated with those remarks, Mrs. Michie.
<P>
In researching for the debate, I am indebted to English Nature, especially to one of its scientists, 
John Birks, who has written a paper on wild mink. His research shows that mink are territorial 
creatures which live in stretches of water only large enough for their own sustainability. Those who do 
not establish a territory, which includes most of the new-born in any year, die in the lean winter 
months. In other words, mink numbers are self-regulating in many parts of the country and only those 
that the natural world will support survive.
<P>
Otters have a part to play in that process. Until more recent and enlightened times otters used to 
be hunted too. If we had been here a few years ago no doubt Opposition Members would have told us 
that it was important and necessary for the countryside. But, as we now know, that is not the case. 
Otter numbers are now growing again after years of decline.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Salter </B>(Reading, West): Does my hon. Friend agree that when a pack of mink dogs is 
on the hunt it would be almost impossible for it to distinguish between the hunting of an otter, which 
is illegal, and the hunting of a mink. Given that otters are starting to show themselves in my neck of 
the woods in Berkshire, in the Kennet valley and elsewhere, is not the very existence of packs of dogs 
designated to hunt mink a genuine threat to the resurgence of the otter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> We have spoken at previous sittings about the need to have effective legislation that 
can be interpreted and used in the countryside at large. Clearly, if amendments such as those tabled 
this morning or later similar amendments are successful, the Bill will be much more difficult to 
interpret. We want to ban hunting with dogs. That is a simple message and one that will be easy to 
interpret.
<P>
The issue of otters in rivers is interesting. Otters returning to a river displace mink from those 
territories. Minks have been more effectively controlled by an existing ban on hunting with dogs than 
through hunting by dogs. Otters push mink out of the terrains. Mink that have no territory do not 
survive. The ban on hunting otters with dogs has had a reverse effect on mink, as my hon. Friend the 
Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) described. My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela 
Smith) made that point at a previous sitting and was immediately howled down by Opposition 
Members saying that that was not the case. I have spoken to officials at MAFF who told me that she 
was right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): I do not think that any Conservative Member has ever howled down 
anyone on the other side of the Committee.
<P>
Mr. Cawsey: That may be true of the few minutes that the hon. Gentleman has been present, but 
generally hon. Members have intervened robustly. That is part of the democratic process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> A moment ago, the hon. Gentleman was making the point that no Conservative 
Member intervened at all. He now argues that we intervene robustly and constantly. Which is it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I did not say “constantly”. That is an interesting addition to my words. I said that 
the only contribution from Opposition Members had been the occasional intervention, unfortunately of 
similar quality to the one that we have just heard. That is a matter for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I apologise for intervening yet again, but the hon. Gentleman repeatedly tries to make 
direct criticisms of the style and approach of the Opposition. I have repeatedly tried to make sensible 
points and it is apparent from their performance today that others are trying to do so too. I do not 
understand how it contributes to his argument to put down our points, which anyone can read in 
Hansard, and, more to the point, to digress into implying things that have not even been said, thereby 
prompting us to correct him in our own speeches.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am always happy to distance the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire from the 
Opposition Benches generally. I am not surprised that he wishes to be recorded in Hansard at regular 
intervals. I have no problem in allowing him to give way to make those points over and over again. So 
far attendance by Opposition Members has been spasmodic. I exonerate the hon. and learned Member 
for Harborough (Mr. Garnier).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be sensible if the hon. Gentleman stuck to the amendment before 
us and we did not have so much banter about what members of the Committee are doing or not doing.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am happy to comply. I was only responding to Opposition interventions.
<P>
The lesson is that nature will restore the balance on our riverbanks much better than humans 
seeking self-gratification in the countryside. Mr. Birks from English Nature concludes, as did Sir 
Hector Monro, that mink are not a great threat to wildlife. They are predators, but like all predators, 
their survival is linked to the availability of prey, not the proximity of other natural predators. In some 
cases prey numbers have fallen where mink are established, but interestingly, in many other sites they 
have not. In some sites in this country moorhens, water voles and crustaceans have coexisted perfectly 
happily with mink for more than 20 years. The mink are not different, so what is?
<P>
I want to quote from Mr. Birks’ report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The answer lies in the sorely degraded state of many of our wetlands, following decades of 
abuse by man. The impact of mink on wildlife pales into insignificance alongside the real problems of 
water pollution, over-abstraction, habitat loss and climate change. The way to safeguard our wetland 
wildlife is to tackle these issues urgently, not to vent our spleen on a scapegoat.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the real agenda for those of us who are really interested in and care about the countryside 
and it is one that those who oppose the Bill refuse either to understand or support. We all accept that 
there are many problems in the countryside, many of which are man made and can be solved only by 
our actions.
<P>
I mentioned earlier that I agreed with Sir Hector Monro on the issue of the threat to ground-
nesting birds from mink, but in such situations hunting with dogs is no use at all. The Committee has 
already been told that that is why there is no hunting with dog packs in those areas. The most efficient 
method in those circumstances is to use cage trapping. That does not disturb other wildlife. It allows 
the release of non-target species and can be used to protect areas such as those inhabited by ground-
nesting birds. It is much more effective than hunting can ever be.
<P>
Hunting with dogs is never an effective way of catching mink. In five years one man protecting a 
small stretch of Devon river trapped and shot 119 mink. Over the same period, over a much wider 
area, the Devon and Cornwall mink hounds killed only four mink. That is insignificant compared 
with those trapped in areas of special need and the natural culling process of the mink’s territorial 
system.
<P>
If wetlands are at risk, which is something that all hon. Members agree, it is caused by the 
activities of humans. Hunting with dogs in such environments is another unnatural burden on the 
countryside which those of us who support the Bill and class ourselves as true friends of the 
countryside seek to end. When my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish tabled these 
amendments, why did he wish to amend the Bill to allow hunting mink with dogs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> He did not. The hon. Gentleman knows very well, and the public should be told, 
that the whole purpose of the exercise is artificial. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish tabled a 
number of bogus amendments. He does not believe in them because he voted against the Bill. This is a 
debating exercise. As I have said on a number of occasions, I am happy to listen to the debating points 
that the hon. Gentleman is making, but he should not ascribe to his hon. Friend motives that he does 
not have. His hon. Friend wants to ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book unamended. I daresay 
that the hon. Gentleman wants that—but he must accept that no one is fooled by this exercise, which 
has been going on for the last three of four sittings. This is an entirely artificial exercise. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish is not here, I must correct 
the hon. and learned Gentleman. My hon. Friend did not vote against the Bill; he voted in favour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I meant that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish voted against hunting. I 
think that the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole knows what I meant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> That might be what the hon. and learned Gentleman meant, but I expect that my 
hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish would, as a matter of record, like it made clear that 
the hon. and learned Gentleman meant the opposite of what he said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is perfectly consistent for Labour Members to 
oppose hunting with hounds while being determined to have the issues aired and to establish effective 
legislation that cannot be misinterpreted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Of course. The purpose of a Committee is to ensure that the wishes of the House, as 
expressed on Second Reading, are carried out. We want the Bill to return to the House in a state that 
will continue to receive the overwhelming support shown on 28 November. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Denton and Reddish made his agenda clear when he moved the amendment—it was to 
secure robust legislation and also to take account of worries that have been communicated. If my 
memory is correct, he turned up last week with a collection of letters to show the Committee, from 
people concerned in various ways about how the Bill might work. He therefore tabled amendments to 
allow debate on those issues and let those points be made. Hon. Members who agree with the 
amendments would, in more normal circumstances, speak in their favour, but if they will not do that, 
they are the ones failing the democratic process—not we, who put the opposing arguments to 
amendments that have been tabled to enable the worries of some members of the public to be 
explored.
<P>
Why would we amend the Bill to allow such practices as hunting mink with dogs? Does that 
practice control mink numbers? Comprehensively, we have seen that it does not. Is there a need to 
control mink? Yes, there is a need in certain places; we would not disagree about that. But ironically, 
those are places without mink hounds, as was mentioned earlier. Even if mink hounds did exist in 
those places—as they could if the Bill is not passed—they would be more damaging to the 
environment than the mink are. Does such hunting improve the stewardship of the countryside? No, it 
does not; it makes matters worse. Is it true that there are no alternatives? Quite the reverse. Better-
targeted alternatives that do not affect other wildlife are available. Are mink a risk to wildlife? Not 
according to former Tory Ministers—whose word other hon. Members can surely accept if I can—or 
according to people who have studied the matter in depth, such as Mr. Birks, of English Nature.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish has given us an opportunity to discuss in 
detail the matters that I have outlined. I welcome that opportunity to expose myths and set out the real 
needs of the countryside. That is perhaps the first time in the entire debate that they have been 
mentioned. However, the amendments are not necessary, They add nothing to the Bill and would 
weaken it. This is not what the British public wanted when they supported us so overwhelmingly in 
rural and urban parts of the country. It is not the wish of the House, 411 of whose Members voted for 
the Bill. Therefore, I reject the amendments. I hope for contributions—for or against the 
amendments—from other hon. Members, because it was in that spirit that they were tabled.
<P>
Mr. Gray: Is not the hon. Gentleman ashamed that he has now spoken for 38 minutes against an 
amendment that would wreck the Bill, but which was tabled by his hon. Friend the Member for 
Denton and Reddish, who was among the 411 Members who voted against fox hunting on 28 
November? Is not the hon. Gentleman ashamed to take part in an absurd parliamentary charade, 
wasting parliamentary time when we are all busy, in opposing an amendment tabled by an hon. 
Member who does not believe in it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Most of that time has been spent answering interventions from the Bill’s 
opponents, for which I am not responsible. We could have made greater progress by sticking to the 
issues. I am pleased that we now agree that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish 
voted for the Bill. I do not know whether I have exposed a split among the Bill’s opponents, but my 
hon. Friend’s purpose in tabling the amendments was always perfectly clear. He wanted to allow 
doubts raised by members of the public to be debated in Committee. If they cannot be debated in 
Committee, where on earth can they be debated? That is the purpose of the amendments, even though 
I do not support them for the reasons that I have given. Some members of the Committee will support 
them. Those who think they are good amendments should speak in favour of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Earlier, I asked the hon. Gentleman a number of specific questions. He said that he 
would answer them. Will he please now do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman asked me whether I thought that mink were pests 
and how they should be culled. I have answered both those points. As I said, the evidence is that they 
are not a threat to wildlife—a statement that came from a former Tory Minister. However, when they 
need to be  controlled, such as when they affect ground-nesting birds, they should be controlled by 
trapping. I am sorry if the hon. and learned Gentleman has not been listening, but he will see from 
Hansard that I have answered his points. I am now repeating myself.
<P>
I have explained why I am against the amendments. I hope that those members of the Committee 
who think that they would boost the Bill will speak in favour of them rather than condemning those 
who want to ensure that we have robust and proper debate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I shall be brief. If one cannot make one’s point in a few moment, there is probably 
no point in making it.
<P>
Amendment No. 59, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, would 
insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“except, foxes, hares, mink and deer”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Last week, the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) gave us the benefit of his scientific 
advice when he took us through parts of the Bateson report. As Professor Bateson, the provost of 
King’s College, Cambridge, made clear, his report deals only with deer hunting. It does not touch 
upon mink or fox hunting or the hunting of hares.
<P>
Since the hon. Member for Norwich, North spoke last week, a letter has appeared in The 
Veterinary Record of 24 January. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has seen it, but it was 
sent to that respected journal for the veterinary profession by Professor Patrick Bateson and Douglas 
Wise, who is from the department of veterinary clinical medicine at the university of Cambridge.
<P>
It may be known to the hon. Member for Norwich, North, if not the Bill’s other supporters in 
Committee, that Dr. Wise strongly criticised the Bateson report in the July-August issue of 
Countryweek Hunting. He had two main criticisms. First, he said that the way in which blood samples 
were taken could have caused much of the observed haemolysis—the hon. Gentleman will correct me 
if my pronunciation is wrong—which is the breakdown of red blood cells. He said that Bateson voiced 
concern that haemolysis in the collected samples could have led to kidney problems and eventual 
death in deer that escaped a hunt. Secondly, Dr. Wise suggested that Bateson had incorrectly 
interpreted the behaviour of deer during a hunt, in particular by stating that hunts force deer to 
experience conditions well outside their normal limits.
<P>
In the letter that Professor Bateson and Dr. Wise sent to The Veterinary Record, they made 
statements that we should consider carefully before we move forward with the Bill. They said that.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“neither of us believes that any one study should be regarded as definitive, particularly when it 
was the first attempt to solve a particular problem.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the supporters of the Bill agree with that.
<P>
They added that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“release of muscle enzymes into the bloodstream might have represented increased permeability 
of muscles rather than actual damage. While minor muscle damage commonly occurs in human and 
non-human athletes, it quickly heals and is not regarded as a welfare problem . . . Haemolysis may not 
represent as severe a welfare problem as was originally supposed.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They said that plans were being made to extend the research and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Some or all of the conclusions of the Bateson report may be qualified by future 
research.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bateson report, on which the hon. Member for Taunton has relied in her remarks, is not 
regarded even by its author as the bible on the issue, as the hon. Lady may have sincerely believed it 
was in the past. Dr. Wise, one of Professor Bateson’s critics, co-signed a letter with the very man he 
criticised and they jointly decided that Professor Bateson’s conclusions were susceptible to further 
research. He is now somewhat resiling from the firm position that he took on the previous occasion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I have finished what I had to say.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I was not intending to speak, merely to intervene. The hon. and learned 
Gentleman may be able to answer my question later, if not now.
<P>
Last week, opponents of the Bill singularly failed to state a clear position on deer hunting, 
despite being asked a number of times to clarify their views. Am I to infer that because they have 
discovered a possibility that the scientific evidence in the Bateson report could be open to revision, 
they will now decide to come out in favour of deer hunting? If so, they are likely to find that most 
people who object to deer hunting used the Bateson report only to back up long-held views about its 
cruelty and long-held observations about its harsh effect on these animals. It is not a question of the 
Bateson report alone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not sure whether the hon. Lady was intervening or making a speech.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I was intervening, but the hon. and learned Gentleman said that he had finished 
talking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Let me help the hon. Lady. I oppose the Bill. My Opposition to it implies support 
for the sort of hunting that she and her hon. Friends want to ban.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> We are still on line 2 and I note that 208 amendments have been tabled. They are all 
in order—otherwise the Table Office would not have accepted them and the Chairman would not have 
selected them. We all understand the exercise that we are carrying out here and it is intellectually 
dishonest for proponents to deny what it is really all about—but that is a matter for them.
<P>
This is a criminal Bill affecting the criminal law of England. Last week members of the 
Committee who attended heard the hon. Member for Norwich, North eulogising the Bateson report 
virtually all day long—the Hansard report will confirm it—in support of criminalising a certain 
activity. I cannot think of any other instance in English legal history of a single academic report being 
prayed in aid to make a presently legal activity illegal. In Archibald’s criminal practice, the criminal 
law is all fairly self-evident. We all know that dishonesty and assault, for example, are criminal. We 
do not need scientists to tell us what is criminal. However, in Committee last week proponents of the 
Bill were trying to use the Bateson report to make a hitherto legal activity illegal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones </B>(Clwyd, South): Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> No, I want to make some progress. The hon. Gentleman will have weeks and weeks 
to wallpaper time in this Committee, as he well knows, so I would appreciate it if he could restrain 
himself for now.
<P>
We opponents of the Bill understand what it is all about. I do not know whether the hon. 
Member for Brigg and Goole has sat on a Government Bill before, but let me give him some friendly 
advice. If he seeks to be as prolix as a Government Back Bencher on a Government Bill as he has 
been in this Committee, he will end up having some interesting discussions with the Government 
Whip who is running that Bill. He may not yet have had the advantage of sitting on a Government 
Bill, I do not know, but he appears to believe that Committees are jolly affairs and that we can all 
come along and talk to our heart’s content. However, that is not how it works, as everyone knows. 
<P>
If one scientific report only is used to support a change in the criminal law, the gods intervene as 
soon as the change has been made, and, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough, 
has said, Professor Bateson has been obliged immediately to put what he said into a better context. His 
conclusions do not have the certainty, or anything like it, that the proponents of the Bill claimed for 
them last week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): Professor Bateson has stood by his findings about the deer 
that were shot and then tested. The damage done to those animals has been proved. The hon. 
Gentleman fails to take into account the point made by my temporary hon. Friend the Member for 
Taunton. She said that Professor Bateson’s report was used to back up the findings, and the general 
feelings of the British people. Other activities have been made criminal; for example, badger baiting, 
cock fighting and dog fighting. No Bateson report was used to back up evidence about those activities. 
Like hunting with dogs, they were considered to be cruel and immoral activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Anyone who was present at last week’s sitting or who reads Hansard, will realise 
that that was not the context for the debate. Furthermore, I have never heard that scientists back up 
feelings. If hon. Members pray in aid scientific evidence or reports to support changes in the criminal 
law, they have to stand by that. It is clear from the letter in The Veterinary Record that Professor 
Bateson accepts that his report cannot be definitive and that some or all of his conclusions might be 
qualified by later research.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I will not give way.
<P>
Professor Bateson is saying that in terms of science there is no certainty in his conclusions. They 
are part of continuing research and are not definitive. The report cannot, therefore, be relied on to 
suggest that something that is legal at present should be made illegal.
<P>
Over the weekend, we learned that Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, was 
prevented from publishing an article in which he explained his anxiety about the effects on 
conservation of a ban on field sports. The hon. Member for Brigg and Goole made great play of the 
fact that the Bill would assist conservation. It is bizarre that an organisation such as Friends of the 
Earth should prevent its own director from freely expressing his personal views. When I was a 
Minister, I was hectored constantly by organisations such as Friends of the Earth, which, 
understandably and properly, wanted as much open government as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Perhaps Friends of the Earth has taken some lessons from the League against Cruel 
Sports. Its two most recent directors wished to differ from the line taken by the league and were forced 
to resign.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Those examples support the view that the arguments are not as clear-cut as the 
proponents of the Bill suggest. I hope that by the time the Bill reaches Report we shall know what the 
director of Friends of the Earth has actually said on the matter.
<P>
The issue is not about supporting or not supporting the amendments. Hon. Members know that 
these amendments, and others, have not been tabled to promote serious debate, but to take up as much 
time as possible between now and the beginning of March. I do not believe that any hon. Member who 
supports the Bill would claim that the Committee will not sit until the beginning of March. I suspect 
that, by the end of our proceedings, a large number of extra amendments will have been tabled. Those 
who voted in favour of the Bill tabled 200 amendments. Many Members who have not been able to 
participate in the Committee proceedings look forward to discussions on Report, which will probably 
take several days.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Other worthwhile private Members’ Bills are being prevented from reaching the 
statute book by the conduct of the hon. Member for Worcester and his supporters. Committee time is 
being clogged up by the Bill. Other Bills, some proposed by Labour Members, will never be 
considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The hon. Member for Worcester will have to explain that to the proposers of other 
private Members’ Bills. When supporters of the Bill make 38-minute speeches on amendments such 
as amendment No. 46, to make points that require only two sentences, and table 200 amendments, it 
would not be surprising if other hon. Members—supporters and opponents of the measure—had a lot 
to say on Report.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I am confused. Does the hon. Gentleman support or oppose the amendments? I am 
sure that you, Mrs. Michie, were about to suggest that  the hon. Gentleman’s remarks were off track. 
He has not mentioned deer, foxes, hares or mink.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> When the hon. Lady has been here longer, she will realise that, if I am out of order, 
the Chairman will let me know. It is not necessary for the hon. Lady to assume the Chairman’s 
authority.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I asked whether the hon. Gentleman supported or opposed the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> If the hon. Lady had been paying attention, she would know that I made it clear that 
the amendments are bogus. Therefore, the question of support or opposition is irrelevant. She knows 
that she is engaged in a bogus exercise. She cannot look me in the eye and claim that that is not true. 
Hon. Members who support the Bill and have integrity know that they are engaged in a bogus 
exercise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Illsley </B>(Barnsley, Central): I can look the hon. Gentleman straight in the eye and say 
that I am not involved in a bogus exercise. I want the Bill to cover every aspect of hunting with dogs 
to ensure that all the issues are debated in Committee and do not clog up Report. I acknowledge that 
many other hon. Members would have liked to serve on the Committee, but the Bill’s opponents are 
not prepared to present their views.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was rather a long intervention. I ask hon. Members to stick to the 
amendments. I want to hear about foxes, mink, deer and hares.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I have made my point. We are involved in a bogus exercise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> No. I shall look the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) in the eye to say 
that I am prepared to put a large sum of money on the prospect of the Bill remaining in Committee 
until the last possible moment before Report. That is, as the hon. Gentleman knows, because until the 
Bill emerges from Committee, no other Bill can take its place. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. 
Friends are engaged in obtaining more days on Report than such a private Member’s Bill would 
otherwise receive. That is fair enough. Those are legitimate parliamentary tactics, but hon. Members 
should not be surprised if, having used those tactics in Committee, a great deal is said on Report.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I remind my hon. Friend, as I did last week, that the hon. Member for Basildon, 
who is not in her place this morning, said that the Bill is not long or difficult. She is clearly a woman 
of integrity and believed that. I wonder why it has taken us until now to reach the second line of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Also, my hon. and learned Friend last week wanted to move a change to the sittings 
motion. Hon. Members opposing the Bill had expressed willingness to sit more than one day.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We must stop discussing the progress of the Bill. I want hon. Members to 
speak to the amendments, please.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> I want to take up the matter of the attack on the Bateson evidence. I have not had 
the advantage of seeing the report that was mentioned, but I responded vehemently last week to 
attempts to discredit Bateson. I answered those with Professor Bateson’s full concordance. I have not 
had the opportunity to speak to him since, but I have had second-hand contact; I spoke to a colleague, 
Professor Sutherland, who met Professor Bateson at a conference last week. He said that the professor 
had full confidence in the reports and evidence concerning his scientific work that had been presented 
in Committee and on Second Reading.
<P>
I do not think that it is being claimed that Professor Bateson has made a retraction concerning 
his work. That work is now in the public domain, having been published in a peer review journal; it is 
now the property of the scientific world. The evidence about deer hunting stands. I have made the 
point that that work does not refer to the other mammals that have been discussed. No one has ever 
pretended that the biochemical, physiological or behavioural studies that are yet to be published have 
a bearing on work that will be done concerning other mammals. Professor Bateson continues to 
maintain his opinion that there will be physiological and biochemical differences. It is wrong to take 
one factor, such as blood cell haemolysis, as discrediting all that has been presented. Many other 
pieces of evidence have not been retracted and they show cruelty to deer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Banbury said that science and the criminal law had no correlation. As to 
science, I am 99.9 per cent. sure that the sun will rise tomorrow, but 0.1 per cent. of a scientist thinks, 
“Something out of the ordinary might just happen.” There might be a Tory majority at the next 
election—crazy things can happen. However, scientific evidence was referred to at the parliamentary 
and scientific Committee on Monday, where Lord Phillips, who has now been placed in charge of the 
BSE inquiry, said that the scientific evidence, DNA fingerprinting, can reflect on the guilt or 
otherwise of an individual. That evidence can be provided by one witness alone. It is a decision for the 
judge. He does not understand every detail of the scientific evidence. He accepts that expert scientists 
have something to say. Two experts may disagree. However, if he decides that only one is needed, that 
will do. The forensic science practitioner who was present concurred with that. Science is now 
absolutely important in criminal law. The DNA fingerprinting technique has opened a new avenue, 
providing criminal lawyers with a quantitative and qualitative assessment, as distinct from 
considering the colour of someone’s eyes, to support decisions in courts of law. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Judges in cases involving evidence given 
by conflicting expert opinions on scientific or forensic matters have to decide which expert’s evidence 
they prefer. Until recently the argument was dominated by Professor Bateson’s 1997 report: we had 
the views of only one veterinary expert and the criticism of his report by Dr. Wise. However, both of 
those eminent scientists now agree—I paraphrase letters to The Veterinary Record—that further 
research is needed. We should not allow ourselves to follow an argument merely because Professor 
Bateson reached certain conclusions in 1997. It appears that he is now prepared to accept the drift of 
Dr. Wise’s criticisms and to submit his findings to further challenge.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> I re-emphasise that Professor Bateson has not retracted the scientific evidence in the 
public domain. More research is always needed—that can be said infinitesimally. For example, more 
will need to be done about BSE in the future. The evidence available at the time must ensure that we 
make reasoned and balanced judgments. That is what we are doing in respect of the Bateson report. 
Yes, it is a shame that there is not more evidence at present, and more will come out. When we are 
considering an issue, we take the scientific evidence that we have and decide what it reflects. It cannot 
be implied that data has been fabricated, because it stands as the best, as many people have 
acknowledged. Bateson wants to carry on with his research because he has made an important 
judgment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> As the hon. Gentleman has not seen Professor Bateson’s letter in The Veterinary 
Record on 24 January, and to further the debate, I shall quote from it. The letter stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the Bateson report suggested that some deer escaping after a hunt might suffer from muscle 
damage and a small proportion of these might have died from myopathy. However, release of muscle 
enzymes into the bloodstream might have represented increased permeability of muscles rather than 
actual damage.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, Professor Bateson is going back on the evidence that he presented in his report.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> That is not true. Professor Bateson has always said that the mechanism causing 
those biochemical differences and changes has not been worked out, and research is needed into that 
matter. Professor Bateson did not purport to understand the mechanism in his scientific paper. He 
reflected on the biochemical measurements and said that there were dramatic changes between the 
controls—those animals that were shot—and those that were chased and then shot. The mechanisms 
that caused those differences require further research.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> First, I apologise for my absence last week. Judging from the way in which my hon. 
Friends have fired into life since my return, perhaps I should go away more often.
<P>
The somewhat childish criticism of the lack of participation by my hon. Friends can now be put 
to rest. I shall be disappointed if I need to intervene more in indignation than for any other reason to 
respond to hon. Gentlemans, trite and facetious personal criticisms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that comments made by my hon. Friends were not 
aimed at the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire but at Conservative Members who have been most 
vociferous in their opposition to the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I do not feel personally slighted; hon. Gentlemans need not worry that I have lost any 
sleep over it, but such comments should not be made. The Committee is digressing into pointless 
debates about motive and, more to the point, into criticism of the behaviour of individual members of 
the Committee. That is not helpful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Earlier, the hon. and 
learned Member for Harborough stated that because he voted against the Bill on Second Reading, he 
was therefore against the points raised by my hon. Friends on hare coursing, stag and deer hunting, 
mink and fox hunting. Would that same comment apply to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire or 
is he against deer hunting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I have made the point before, but I shall repeat it: I am not a supporter of hunting deer 
with hounds. I do not intend to pursue the point now as I have more considered views to present. We 
shall return to the issue, but I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman’s question for the 
moment.
<P>
During our long debate about mink hunting it became clear that the Bill’s supporters base their 
arguments on four issues: first, the effectiveness of the process of using hounds to hunt; secondly, the 
effect of the hunted mammals on other wildlife; thirdly, the damage to the environment caused by 
using hounds in hunting; and, fourthly, the humaneness of the process. I shall go through the four 
issues as one or two are bogus, or inappropriate, reasons to ban the activity.
<P>
First, the effectiveness of the process. There is no justification on earth for banning a process 
simply on the grounds that some individuals regard it as ineffective. On that basis alone, many things 
that we do in every-day life should be banned. The criminal system does not exist to guide individuals 
on how effectively they should use their time.
<P>
When I hear in our debates of the small number of animals caught by hunts using hounds, I 
believe that there is a misunderstanding. How, for example, can it be said that angling makes any 
effective contribution to society? Should it be banned because it has no effective or direct outcome? It 
could be argued that no sport provides an obvious, clear or effective outcome. From a philosophical 
point of view, we must nail the logical inconsistency of arguing for a ban on the basis of the 
effectiveness of the process.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman therefore saying that he accepts that hunting animals with 
hounds is not an effective method of control and that there are other reasons why it should be allowed 
to continue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> In some areas—once again, I relate my argument to Montgomeryshire—it is an 
effective means of control. But I am making a bigger point: it is irrelevant whether hunting is an 
effective means of control in considering whether it should be criminalised. I cannot be more explicit; 
we should not be debating the creation of further criminal law on the simple basis of whether a system 
is efficacious. That is a logical fallacy, which does not stand philosophical scrutiny.
<P>
My second point is about the effect of the mammals on wildlife, which perhaps adds a little more 
currency to our debate. Again, that is not a basis on which criminal law should be created. The hon. 
Member for Brigg and Goole argued that because mink are no threat to other wildlife they should not 
be hunted. In that sense, therefore, we should not kill many other animals. I draw the Committee’s 
attention to a crucial distinction: if the hon. Gentleman is saying that those animals should not be 
hunted and that the killing of mink, for example, should be criminalised, what is his view on domestic 
animals, which do not harm the environment? The cow in the field is not a major threat to other 
wildlife. Should it therefore be illegal to kill cows, which would be the direct, logical consequence of 
the hon. Gentleman’s point about mink?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The debate is about hunting, not killing. We had that debate last week when the 
hon. Gentleman was absent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I accept that, because I have read the report of the proceedings. However, my point 
relates to what the hon. Gentleman said earlier. Does he believe that it is acceptable to control the 
mink population but that it is wrong to criminalise the control of mink?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> As I said in response to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, there are 
situations in which mink numbers need to be controlled. However, when they need to be controlled, it 
should be done by trapping. That happens now, and it ensures that non-target species can be released. 
In addition, it does not cause the damage done by hunting with packs of hounds. Does the hon 
Gentleman disagree with the Environment Agency, which says that hunting mink with dogs greatly 
destroys the natural habitat?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. The issue was not as clear to me as 
it is now.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman leads me on to my third point, which is on the damage to the environment 
caused by the use of dogs. It is an interesting issue, which I intend to pursue in depth before our next 
sitting. I accept that the hon. Gentleman cited learned sources, but one travels down a dangerous route 
if one seeks to legislate on the basis of the environmental damage caused by dogs. One would then 
start to criminalise a host of human activities, which do far more damage to the environment than 
hunting mink or other animals with dogs.
<P>
I accept that there may be a case for regulation—for example, through licensing—to ensure that 
irresponsible packs that do obvious damage to a local environment or community are reined in or 
perhaps disbanded. However, surely the hon. Gentleman understands the danger of saying that, for 
some reason, the environmental damage caused by hunting with dogs is a special case. He would have 
to explain why driving a motor vehicle is not a special case and why he has made an arbitrary 
distinction between hounds and modern contraptions, such as goods vehicles, which damage the 
countryside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Worcester.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The purpose of the Bill is to make hunting with dogs a criminal offence. My hon. 
Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole made the point that hunting mink with dogs is not an 
effective method of pest control. As a by-product, it damages the environment. However, my hon. 
Friend does not want to make damage to the environment a criminal offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I will now give way to the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The point I made was on damage to the wetlands. I made it clear that many things 
damaged the wetlands and that most of them are man made. Those of us who are interested in the 
countryside believe that man must sort out its problems. The Bill is specifically and tightly about 
hunting with dogs. We should not amend the Bill in a way that would allow hunting with dogs to 
damage countryside. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a broad range of measures must 
be taken to protect habitats. That is exactly what I said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I am grateful to those hon. Gentlemans for their interventions.
<P>
My third point is the only one of the three that I have made so far that gives any currency to the 
case for introducing the Bill. However, it is a weak point. It is so weak that it is not sufficient to justify 
the criminalisation of hunting mink with dogs. I wish to investigate the issue at greater length and I 
invite the diligent readers of Hansard to send me their comments, either by e-mail or otherwise, before 
the next sitting.
<P>
My fourth point returns to the core of the debate—the question of humaneness. The hon. 
Member for—
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> For Brigg and Goole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> For Pringle?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> No, Brigg and Goole. The hon. Gentleman will never make it to be leader of his 
party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I am sorry; my ears are still blocked from my flight. Hon. Members must forgive me 
and remember that English is my second language. I occasionally make such mistakes.
<P>
It was argued that cage trapping was more humane. That comes to the core of the debate and the 
point that I made the week before last when I attended the Committee. How do we define cruelty and 
humaneness? We have had another long debate on Bateson, but we do not have sufficient scientific 
data to make an informed decision about hunting with hounds. We may have feelings about it, but 
hon. Members will agree that a Committee such as this should never make decisions about 
introducing new criminal legislation on the basis of feelings.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> What kind of science, other than that carried out by Bateson, would convince the 
hon. Gentleman?
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> It is almost a subject for a philosophical dissertation. As the hon. Gentleman’s 
question implies, we come to the question of the sentience of animals and whether it is justifiable for 
us to kill any of them. It is one of the most difficult issues facing us, but many members of the 
Committee have not faced up to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> One of the hon. Members who has not faced up to that issue is the hon. Member for 
Worcester. In an intervention on Second Reading, I asked him whether it was not difficult for 
someone to talk about the cruelty of hunting with hounds if he enjoyed coarse fishing and catching 
fish, playing them on a line, bringing them to the bank and releasing them back in the water to 
provide sport for someone else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> My hon. and learned Friend has made a powerful point, and it is one that I have made 
myself. I do not fish, but, on the face of it, there is a logical inconsistency between a ban on killing 
some animals in the wild while preserving the right to catch other forms of them. What is the 
justification for banning one specifically defined way of killing animals, but not tackling all the 
others?
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones:</B> To take the hon. Gentleman’s point to the extreme, does he not realise that he 
is arguing for the re-legislation of bear baiting and cock fighting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I am not arguing for the legislation of them. However, if this Committee’s decisions 
are to be informed, we must be able to answer profoundly important questions on how we define the 
rights of animals. Technically, a libertarian might want to do what the hon. Gentleman suggests. 
However, we will not make philosophically robust progress until we have defined what rights animals 
should have and explained why we ascribe some rights to wild animals and different rights to 
livestock. Most important, we must explain why some sports involving the killing and capturing of 
animals in ways that can hardly be regarded as healthy for the animal are acceptable while others are 
not.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> The hon. Gentleman has introduced the concept of logical inconsistency. Does he 
agree that there is a logical inconsistency in relation to wild deer? It is currently legal to chase wild 
deer for six hours, but farmers have to apply the same welfare standards to deer as apply to any other 
farmed animal. One is not allowed to chase farmed deer around a field for six hours before one kills 
them. If we follow the hon. Gentleman’s arguments through to their conclusion, it seems that he is 
arguing against any welfare standards for farm animals. Would he not agree that society has said that 
by and large it is all right to kill animals for food but that certain animal welfare standards must be 
adhered to because we do not want to be cruel to animals deliberately? Hunting falls within my 
definition of deliberate cruelty to animals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I hope that I may be able to convince the hon. Lady to change her view. We should 
have an objective system of licensing which creates consistency in our treatment of animals in the 
wild as well as farms because of the very points that she made. It is difficult to make such matters 
absolutely consistent but if we introduced a system of objective licensing by an independent authority 
in which hon. Members and the public could have faith, it could set about doing three important tasks. 
First, it would need to define what is cruel and what is acceptable, and provide a plausible rationale 
for those definitions. It goes without saying that to do so it would need to embark on significant 
additional research as well as making a few assumptions, perhaps sharing them widely through 
consultation, about how society judges animals and animal rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> On badger baiting, could the hon. Gentleman tell me what scientific or 
research work was conducted to enable that activity to be prohibited by law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I have a rough knowledge of what was done. I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman is 
asking that question. He may disagree with what I am proposing for other reasons but surely he would 
agree that what I am describing is a perfectly legitimate approach to ensuring that justice is done and, 
more importantly in response to the hon. Member for Taunton, that a consistency is applied to our 
treatment of animals which the Bill simply would not bring about.
<P>
To return to my proposed licensing authority, its first task would be to define cruelty and to be 
able to justify its definition with the right research. Its second task would be to share the licensing 
terms with the wider community so that people could see what standards would need to be reached to 
ensure that the activities of the hunt or the group which seeks to control animals were consistent with 
that. Its third task would be to enforce the licensing process to make sure that it had teeth. That would 
probably involve money and it could be self-funding through a licence fee.
<P>
I would like those three elements included in the licensing process. The biggest single advantage 
of doing so is that it takes the entire debate out of the realms of how we feel—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that amendments about licensing refer to 
later clauses so we should leave discussion of that until a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Michie, for your guidance. I shall bring my remarks to a close.
<P>
The crucial point is that such a licensing system would enable us to get to the core of the 
questions that have been raised in the debate today. Most importantly of all, the speculations that 
seem to infest our conversations would be replaced by much more robustly grounded objective 
research by experts. The very fact that we have had so much to-ing and fro-ing today highlights our 
need for a more solid foundation before progressing.
<P>
I do not underestimate the challenges of reaching some sort of accord on the issues, but it is 
remiss and irresponsible of us to talk about introducing criminal acts without taking on board that 
research.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I return to my earlier question. What specific research was carried out to 
enable badger baiting to be prohibited? If he does not know, does he agree that badger baiting should 
be a criminal offense?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Once again, I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer that I gave earlier. What I am 
saying is rather more important. He seems to have missed the strategic importance of my remarks. I 
emphasise one more time that we do not have sufficient objective data on which we can agree to make 
decisions on the matters that are before us. The hon. Member for Worcester implies, although 
probably not intentionally, that such objective data did not exist in relation to badger baiting. There 
might have been such consensus on that issue that people felt that one approach or another would be 
sufficient. If that data did not exist he is correct that there was a philosophical weakness in the 
approach to banning badger baiting.
<P>
I do not suggest for a moment that we should allow badger baiting. If we want the kind of 
consistency that the hon. Member for Taunton described earlier, we need a much more objective 
approach to the data. My plea is for us to get out of the sentiment and into the detail of the research. 
An absence of research may be frustrating, but it would be better to take a few years on this issue than 
legislate quickly and end up with bad legislation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eileen Gordon </B>(Romford): I hope that I can help the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire 
with his dilemmas and philosophical arguments. I want to discuss the plight of the hare and I am 
against the amendments. It would be a disgrace and a sacrilege to exclude the hare from the 
provisions of the Bill. I shall try to stick to the point with my explanation.
<P>
The hare is already threatened. Changes in farming methods have led to a decline in the hare 
population. Their natural habitat is being lost. Hares are most abundant in arable farmland but low 
diversity of crops, the presence of livestock and human settlement all reduce hare numbers. We should 
not add to the threat by hunting them as well.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall) said when moving his 10-
minute rule Bill to make hare coursing illegal the hair 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“is a spectacularly beautiful and magical animal”—[Official Report, 29 October 1997; Vol. 
299, c. 915.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not a pest unless found in huge numbers which is not the case at present. It must cause great 
sadness to my hon. Friend that the Waterloo cup is held each year in his constituency. That so-called 
spectacle attracts more than 10,000 people over three days and is the premier gathering on the hare 
coursing calendar. For 362 days of the year hares in that part of the world have a relatively quiet life, 
but for those three days they have to run for their lives. Points are awarded to the dogs for their skill 
in turning the hare.
<P>
In hare coursing hares are beaten out of the long grass one at a time and two greyhounds are 
released to hunt them. For the crowd it is a day out, a social occasion with betting on the outcome and 
perhaps the added frisson of seeing a hare being pulled to pieces by the dogs. There used to be 
“enclosed” coursing which meant that the hare could not escape, but the National Coursing Club 
banned it, not for the sake of the hare, but because the results were too predictable and betting and 
attendances fell.
<P>
There are disputed figures on how many hares escape. The National Coursing Club says that 
seven out of eight escape at the Waterloo cup. The League Against Cruel Sports says that it is one in 
five. For me one hare dying by being pulled to bits is one too many. Supporters say that the animal 
dies straight away but there is video evidence of hares screaming in pain and terror, caught between 
the jaws of two dogs. It is a shame that we cannot watch these videos in Committee.
<P>
I should like to quote a Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals inspector, who 
attended the Waterloo cup under cover. The fact that he could not make his presence known says a 
great deal about the people who attend the event and their lack of concern for the welfare of animals. 
Since 1984, the inspector witnessed 121 kills at the Waterloo cup and observed that few met with a 
swift death:
<P>
“If both dogs catch the hare, one gets hold of the head and the other grabs the back end and they 
will play tug o’war with it. The officials do run as fast as they can to get hold of the injured hare and 
kill it to prevent further suffering. But that can take up to 30 seconds, which might not sound a lot, 
but it is when you are being pulled to pieces.”
<P>
Coursers say that that is conservation in action and that hares are more abundant in coursing 
estates than elsewhere; but hares in some areas are netted and transported to coursing estates, so how 
can that be correct? Participants admit that hares are caught and transported to restock coursing 
estates—collapse of conservation argument, I suggest.
<P>
The hare population is about 20 per cent. of what it was 100 years ago, according to the 1996 
report of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. The UK Biodiversity steering group report of 
1996 included the brown hare in its list of 115 species that are in decline or under threat, yet 150 
packs of hare hounds annually kill about 6,000 hares.
<P>
Hare hunting is done by beagles, bassets or harriers and is followed on foot—on horseback only 
with harriers. A pack of dogs is considered “well bred” if it takes 60 to 90 minutes to run the hare to 
exhaustion and kill it. As Horse and Hounds said in 1980:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“It is probably better to have a good hunt of over an hour or ninety minutes, rather than 
overmatch the hare and pull her down in twenty minutes”.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hunted hares run in large circles, reluctant to leave their home range until they tire. The hare is 
then overwhelmed and killed by the hounds. I can only return to the premise that people hunt because 
of the thrill of the kill or potential kill, which is an unworthy emotion for a civilised country to 
support.
<P>
I should like to compare hare coursing and hunting with drag hunting. The so-called sports that 
we are debating can continue without involving a dead animal at the end.
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Does the hon. Lady include fishing in her list? What are her views on angling?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gordon:</B> We are not discussing that and I wish to keep to the amendments and the main 
subject.
<P>
In my constituency a successful greyhound racing stadium opened in 1929. It provides jobs and 
entertainment for many of my constituents, people from east London and, dare I say it, from the 
countryside of Essex.
<P>
I am not a betting person and, although it may be sacrilege for a politician to say it, I am not 
especially competitive either. I do not bet on horse racing or the weather: I do not care who wins. 
However, on the night that I was invited to the Romford stadium, I joined in the betting: I did not win, 
but that is another story. The stadium has a very good restaurant where diners can follow the racing 
and place bets. People get involved in the race, yelling and shouting for their dog to win. For most 
people, that is preferable to standing in a cold field.
<P>
Everyone seems to have a good time, including the dogs. Coral, which presently owns the 
stadium, spent in 1997 more than £120,000 on track improvements to improve the greyhound racing 
surface. In 1996 more than £300,000 was spent on installing heating and air conditioning within the 
new kennelling area. The stadium employs 320 people and 250,000 people attend it every year. 
Annually, it has a turnover of £1 million. Moreover, it raises that without using live hares and without 
the crowd waiting to see if an animal will be ripped to pieces at the end of the race. What is more, in 
1997, charity race nights at Romford stadium raised more than £100,000 for local and national 
charities.
<P>
It is therefore possible to provide pleasure without cruelty, and betting without blood. The 
example of Romford greyhound stadium shows that it is possible for an ancient, primitive so-called 
sport—hare coursing—to be adapted into an activity that is wholly acceptable in a civilised society.
<P>
There are other illegal activities that some people may still wish to pursue. Slavery was a 
lucrative activity for many people. It was not much fun for slaves, of course, but we would not 
condone it now just because it made economic sense—though I felt that the previous Government 
were heading that way.
<P>
Just as greyhound racing is the acceptable face of hare coursing, so drag hunting can similarly 
replace the barbarism of the kill in hunting. The number of drag hunts has increased from eight to 31 
since 1965. I know that drag hunting has been denigrated,. A letter that appeared in The Daily 
Telegraph on 3 April said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Most foxhunters I know regard Draghunting as similar to paying for sex—it lacks the 
uncertainty of the chase.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously, that letter was written by a sad person, but it makes the point that the chase and kill 
are crucial to such people’s enjoyment.
<P>
Some activities are just wrong and have to end, even if a minority of people is upset. The 
hunting with dogs of wild mammals, including the hare, is one of those activities. It must go. I oppose 
the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> May I, belatedly, welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Michie. I hope that we 
have an informative and interesting sitting.
<P>
I wish to speak to amendment No. 68, which was moved at our previous sitting. I should like to 
deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. He asked what 
would happen to hounds currently employed in the hunt. Opponents have made much of the claim 
that the Bill will result in thousands of dogs having to be put down. I want to tell the Committee what 
happens in the normal course of hunting activities and how dog welfare is affected. What happens to 
dogs is an integral part of the Bill and my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish 
specifically asked me to deal with the issue.
<P>
Approximately 20,000 hounds are used for the purpose of hunting with dogs. That figure 
includes some that are used for drag hunting but, by and large, that many dogs are used for hunting 
the four species to which the amendments refer. I also know that the Country Landowners Association 
estimated that 13,000 of them will be put down immediately if the Bill becomes law.
<P>
I attended the Worcester hunt, a fox hunt, to talk to kennel staff about their dog breeding 
programme. I wanted to find out whether the estimates were, as I suspected, scare stories. My research 
produced quite staggering results regarding the numbers of dogs that are specifically bred for the 
purpose of hunting but do not make the grade.
<P>
In June 1984, Robin MacKenzie, an official of the British Field Sports Society and master of 
foxhounds, claimed in the Shooting Times and Country Magazine that the average hunt bred six 
litters, with six pups in each year. Therefore, with approximately 300 hunts for the four species 
referred to in the amendment—
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. Although I am always willing to listen to the 
hon. Gentleman’s arguments, I seek your guidance about whether his comments relate to amendment 
No. 59 or to any of the other amendments in the group.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am also a little puzzled. I think that the hon. Member for Worcester said that 
he was addressing amendment No. 68, which refers to dogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> That amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“other than in the course of the activities of a registered hunt.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman can persuade me that his remarks are relevant to the amendment, I will 
resume my seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If I might be allowed to develop my argument—
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The point of order is for Mrs. Michie.
<P>
The Chairman: It may be that a mistake has been made and the amendment should not have 
been placed with this group. It is also grouped with amendment No. 67, which we shall discuss later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Are you saying that amendment No. 68 is not part of the group on the selection list 
for today, Mrs. Michie?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There are a number of amendments in the group that should not have been 
placed together. Apparently the selection list is only provisional.
<P>
Mr. Caplin:  Could you clarify, Mrs. Michie, which amendments should be grouped with 
amendment No. 46.
<P>
The Chairman: Yes, I will try to do that.
<P>
Mr. Garnier: Perhaps it would be convenient to suspend the Committee for a few moments.
<P>
The Chairman: I agree. The Committee will be suspended for five minutes while we sort this 
out.
<P>
<H5>12.17 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>12.22 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There has been a mistake in the provisional selection. The group consists 
of amendments Nos. 46, 59 and 74. The other amendments on the original list appear in other groups 
and will be debated later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> With that in mind, I shall point out that those figures have been produced 
as scaremongering tactics.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. I thought you said that amendments Nos. 68, 69 
and 71 were not now in this group. I suggest that any remarks directed to those amendments are out 
of order.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are debating amendments Nos. 46, 59 and 74.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Those amendments would nullify many of the Bill’s provisions. Many people are 
worried about the Bill’s effects on the dogs that are used in hunting. I want to reassure them that the 
figures being bandied about are complete and utter nonsense, and I will give the Committee facts 
about that matter at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martyn Jones:</B> The amendments were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and 
Reddish to ensure debate. Hon. Members who oppose the Bill have suggested that discussing the 
amendments is a ploy, but they would substantially alter the Bill. They would remove from the Bill 
groups of animals, which, in my opinion, should remain covered by the measure. They make the 
Committee consider the ramifications of the complaints of the Bill’s opponents who indulge in 
hunting and want their views to be discussed. The Bill’s opponents have not been involved in the 
debate, and those hon. Members who support the Bill are being honest to a fault by wishing to debate 
the amendments at length in order to tackle opponents’ views. It is invidious of hon. Members who 
oppose the Bill to claim that they will debate the issues covered by the amendments at length on 
Report, but not in Committee. The amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and 
Reddish tabled are valuable because they enable us to debate important issues.
<P>
The hon. Member for Banbury suggested that no scientific report was a basis for law. That is an 
astonishing statement from a former Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and 
Food. He knows that scientific reports on BSE resulted in major changes to the law, and the creation 
of severe penalties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman care to mention one legislative change that was based on a 
report on BSE?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Only three weeks ago, we banned beef on the bone on the basis of a scientific report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That change has no criminal aspects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Of course it has. I may be wrong, but I suspect that a fine is a criminal penalty. 
Anyone who sold beef on the bone would be fined. I am obviously right, because the hon. Gentleman 
does not wish to intervene again.
<P>
Amendment No. 46 refers to foxes. Evidence suggests that a majority of people who live in the 
country suspect that the Bill would ban fox hunting and do nothing else. Amendment No. 46 would 
remove foxes from the Bill. I hope to show that it should not be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman make new points or help us to understand points that 
were made earlier?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I intend to make new points. Correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think that foxes 
have been mentioned in the context of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> It may help my hon. Friend to know that, earlier, I had to make the same point 
several times before it was understood.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jones:</B> That is often the case, especially when dealing with opponents who make spurious 
points and refuse to participate in a debate on amendments. We want to ensure that the Bill is as near 
perfect as possible. We can do that only through full debate in Committee.
<P>
I want to explain why I believe that foxes, which are included in the amendment, should remain 
covered by the Bill. The public would be astonished if they were removed from it. Foxes suffer greatly 
from the hunt. They are natural predators, not prey. They are designed to chase, not to be chased.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that that is incorrect? On the mainland of Europe, 
foxes are hunted by wolves; they are part of their staple diet.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Perhaps that happens in Estonia, but I do not think that in most of mainland Europe 
wolves rampage in search of foxes or any other animal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend is aware that English Nature has said of mink—
about which subject I am reluctant to add a great deal today—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“No vertebrate predator from lions on African plains to kestrels over British farmland, is 
naturally controlled by higher predators.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> That is often the case in a landscape and ecology that humans have affected for 
thousands of years. As an apex predator, the fox has, over thousands of years, developed ways of 
controlling its population to a large extent.
<P>
The fox is designed to run in short, sharp sprints after a rabbit or a bird; not for a prolonged 
chase. When a fox is chased by a hunt it can be killed in one of two ways. First, because dogs run in 
packs, death is not by a quick nip to the neck, as has often been said—certainly in discussions outside 
the House, if not so much during our debates. I am sure that all hon. Members have received letters 
from constituents suggesting that the first hound that catches the fox does so by the neck—by some 
miracle, apparently, after running around it—and kills it stone dead in seconds. That cannot be true. I 
suggest that most foxes are caught by the legs, tail or rear, where the hounds are likely to reach them. 
The hounds then tear the fox apart. That seems self-evident.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon-Gentleman is obviously putting himself forward as a bit of an expert on 
fox hunting. What is the name of the hunt in his constituency? Has he visited it and discussed these 
matters with members or employees of the hunt?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I have four hunts in my constituency. One of them is Wynnstay hunt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> What are the names of the other hunts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> What is the name of the master?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I have no idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> Where does he live?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> He lives at Wynnstay hall.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Clwyd South (Mr. Jones) should proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I have no intention of taking up the Committee’s time unnecessarily by listing all the 
hunts in my constituency. However, I have spoken to hunt members. I have not attended a hunt, 
because I do not believe that it is right. I have not witnessed a murder either, because I believe that 
murder is wrong, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> If the hon. Gentleman has spoken to members of Wynnstay or other hunts—and I 
am sorry that he will not list them for other hon. Members’ benefit—no doubt he will have discussed 
with them the point that he has just made about the fox being ripped to pieces and caught by its tail. 
How did they respond?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I thought that I had said already that I have received representations from 
constituents and members of the hunts in my area, who have put to me the notion that a fox is 
immediately killed by a nip to the back of the neck from a hound. I have seen evidence from the 
League Against Cruel Sports and other sources, including videos, that shows the opposite.
<P>
I have also spoken to people I know well, who, though members of the hunt, were not promoting 
it or acting as its spokespersons, who confirmed that the fox is not caught by the neck every time. A 
so-called quick kill of that kind would happen in a minority of cases. It appears illogical to me—and I 
do not understand how it could appear otherwise—to assume that a dog can, with apparently super-
canine ability, overtake a fox that is running from it and catch it by the back of the neck.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of the post-mortems that have been performed on fox 
carcases, showing that death was not from a bite on the back of the neck? That point is not disputed. 
One reason that there is not more post-mortem evidence—providing scientific proof, of which the 
Bill’s opponents said they wanted more—is that hunts will not hand over the carcases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention which reinforces my belief and 
my, admittedly hearsay, evidence. I should have to attend quite a lot of hunts to be in at the kill and 
witness the manner of death.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> I am interested in the question of how the fox is killed, which has been raised by my 
hon. Friend—who, I hope, will shortly name all the hunts in his constituency, giving names, 
addresses and contact details for all the members. I attended a hunt after being criticised frequently 
for opposing fox hunting yet not having seen one. I ran behind a hunt—though not in my 
constituency, which is a town centre. My hon. Friend mentioned that he has never been in at the kill, 
and if he ran behind a hunt he would not be likely to either. The hunt goes one way, then another, and 
organised chaos prevails.
<P>
What evidence is there of anyone being in at the kill? If the pack of hounds runs in front of the 
horses, by the time the master of the hunt reaches the animal to kill it humanely after the dogs have 
snapped its neck, what will be left of it? The 30 or 40 dogs will have had a few seconds, or perhaps a 
minute, to chew it to pieces before the hunters arrive. What is the evidence, other than the 
photographs provided by people who have seen foxes ripped to pieces?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I am pleased that my hon. Friend has given that personal example of attending a 
hunt. It seems logical to me that someone following a hunt is not likely to be in at the kill. Even on 
horseback, as part of the hunt, it is unlikely, because the hounds run ahead of the horses. It seems 
highly unlikely that there should be many eye-witness accounts of kills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> On that basis, how does the hon. Gentleman know that foxes are killed by being 
ripped to pieces by hounds? Many animal lovers who hunt are present time after time at the kill, as I 
have been many times, and I have never seen a fox killed other than by the lead hound biting it on the 
back of the neck. What is the hon. Gentleman’s evidence to the contrary if, as he says, he has never 
been present at the kill and no one else has either?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> If no one else has been in at the kill—
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Apart from the hon. Gentleman. It is impressive that he is right at the front of the 
hunt all the time. However, unless one is at dog level I cannot imagine that one would be able to see 
all that clearly what happened.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> He is at dog level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Probably. Obviously the hon. Gentleman has not listened to the earlier part of the 
debate, when my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole told him about the post-mortem 
evidence and I told him about the video evidence that I have seen. There is good evidence to show that 
what the hon. Gentleman suggests does not happen every time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman has claimed that foxes are ripped to pieces by hounds. If that is 
the case, how can there be any post-mortem evidence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> There is a fox that has been ripped to pieces.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> You have lost it, dear boy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I have not. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that that is the point that I made? The remains that are 
left provide the evidence. I agree that in many cases it is not possible to see the remains because of the 
savaging that the fox has received. However, there are sometimes fox remains at the end of a hunt and 
they have been medically examined. The evidence that they provide does not support the points made 
by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire unless he has a remarkably well-trained pack of hounds. He 
has given the Committee no evidence other than personal opinion, but just because he says something 
does not mean that it is true. There is no evidence to show that those foxes are killed in any other way 
than by being savaged by dogs. He has made the point that carcasses are not available and that post 
mortems cannot take place, but that does not get him off the hook. When post mortems have been 
carried out, they do not show that a single bite in the back of the neck is the predominant cause of 
death.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> That is correct. It is a bit like doctors burying their mistakes. When hounds rip foxes 
to bits there is not much evidence either way, but, as my hon. Friend says, when there is evidence, it 
proves that the cause of death was not a bite on the back of the neck. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will hon. Members please stop having conversations between 
themselves? It would be helpful if they addressed their remarks to the Chair. It is sometimes difficult 
to hear what is being said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Michie, that I am responding to interventions made from a sedentary 
position. I have been told by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire that he has ridden to hounds and 
that every time that a fox has been caught he has witnessed that it was killed by a bite to the back of 
the neck. I ride, although I do not ride to hounds, and sometimes it is difficult to hang on when the 
horse is galloping. It might be even more difficult to see what is happening a long way ahead when 
the hounds catch the fox.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will help the hon. Member for Clwyd, South.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Perhaps we can ignore the childish comments from hon. Members who oppose the 
Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend might be interested to know that the canine species often attacks in the same 
way. Canines approach the legs or the arms of their prey. Cats stalk their quarry and attack its throat 
or its neck. Animals that pursue their prey attack the nearest available part of the body and it is then 
ripped or torn apart. That is shown in the veterinary evidence that I produced on Second Reading and 
was not disputed by the Bill’s opponents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. His point reinforces the fact that hounds are pack 
animals. They will pull down their prey however they can.
<P>
Foxes are not killed cleanly by hounds. Death might be relatively quick, but it is not as instant as 
a shot from a marksman. Furthermore, foxes are often killed underground when terriers are set on 
them. That is pretty grim for the fox and for the terrier and it is not a quick or humane death.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The suffering of a fox in such circumstances is unnecessary, for two reasons. First, foxes are 
predators: they are at the top of the food chain and are not hunted by other animals except, as I said, 
by wolves in Estonia.
<P>
<B>Mr. Öpik:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, who has given way many times, but he 
has made a serious point. I will happily provide him with evidence that foxes are not top of the food 
chain on the mainlands of Europe; it is only because there are no wolves in this country that they have 
no predators here.
<P>
On another point, does the hon. Gentleman believe that it is impossible to train terriers not to 
attack the fox underground?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I do not know whether that is impossible. Dogs can be trained, but there is no such 
evidence in respect of terriers. It is possible that some may be trained properly, but that is a separate 
matter. It does not relate to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. I am relatively new to the House but I believe that I 
am right in thinking that the principle of a Bill is considered on Second Reading. The joint effect of 
the amendments would be to render negative the purpose of the Bill. They therefore make a point that 
should have been made on Second Reading. Some hon. Members’ speeches are nothing to do with the 
Committee’s line-by-line consideration of the Bill; they are about a matter that should have been 
discussed on Second Reading, which is whether hunting with hounds is a good or a bad thing. The 
amendments are being used merely to prolong discussion in Committee so that hon. Members can 
fiddle around with the Bill on report. Does that not bring the process of the Committee into disrepute 
in the eyes of those throughout the country who are watching us?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. The amendments are related to the Bill and that is what we are discussing. I 
have asked hon. Members repeatedly throughout the sitting to stick to discussing what is written in 
the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> That spurious point of order shows that the hon. Gentleman has completely missed 
the point of the amendments. Even if the amendments are accepted, we would still be banning stag 
hunting. The point about the amendment as it concerns foxes is that in this country, although not in 
other parts of Europe, foxes are at the top of the food chain. I have no evidence either way on the issue 
except that I know that there are few areas in Europe where there are sufficient numbers of wolves for 
their to hunt anything, never mind foxes.
<P>
I reinforce my point about foxes in the United Kingdom by saying that areas such as the Scottish 
islands, where there is no fox hunting, are not overrun by foxes. There must therefore be some self-
imposed mechanism that controls their numbers.
<P>
If it transpired that there was a genuine need for control, as there may be in some cities where 
feral foxes have adapted to living on scraps from dustbins, the animals could be shot or trapped live 
and caged, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole suggested in relation to mink.
<P>
Supporters of hunting state that the fox is either killed quickly or it gets clean away. But it is not 
strictly true to say that it gets clean away; the fox is exhausted and sometimes crawls away hot and 
wet only to die later of hypothermia because of the energy that it has expended in the chase. “Hunting 
for All” states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“There was once a drain between the Pytchley and Grafton countries, and there was an 
agreement between the two hunts not to dig it. After a time they had to open the drain to lay it fresh, 
and within were the masks of thirteen foxes that had died of chill and cramp.”<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That happened in the 1930s. It proves that, for years, foxes have not got away, but died.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not want to be tedious, but the hon. Gentleman mispronounced Pytchley. What 
is the evidence for the deaths of the 13 foxes having anything to do with the activities of the Pytchley 
or Grafton hunts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting that the drain was the equivalent of an 
elephant’s graveyard, to which the foxes crawled and died together?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman’s point is unclear and flawed. It is unhelpful to quote 
selectively from 50-year-old books. The quote states that 13 foxes died of hypothermia in a drain. I 
could not deduce from that that they had been forced there by a hunt. The hon. Gentleman should 
make himself clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman cannot make such a point without suggesting an 
alternative reason for their deaths.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Foxes die all the time. The hon. Gentleman is not doing himself justice. He is 
presenting the argument, and the burden of proof is on him. It is not up to us to provide evidence for 
him. If he cannot make the case properly, he should not make it at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I will not give way if that is the standard of intervention. I admit that the example 
dated from 50 years ago, but I am trying to show that such incidents have occurred for years. It is 
absurd to suggest that 13 foxes collectively decided to go to the drain to die. The author of the book 
supports hunting. It is his theory, not mine, that they died of cold. The hon. and learned Gentleman’s 
intervention was spurious. Some foxes crawl away and die after being hunted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the hunt concluded outside the same ditch on 
13 separate occasions, and that, on each occasion, the fox was tired out and crawled away to die of 
hypothermia? That seems unlikely, Perhaps he is suggesting that a pack of hounds simultaneously 
hunted 13 foxes, all of which were exhausted and climbed into the ditch to die. Both suggestions are 
fantastic. Sadly, foxes die all the time. It is hardly surprising that they choose some quiet corner in 
which to die. Foxes’ bodies are found all over the place. There is no evidence that the deaths were 
caused by fox hunting. The hon. Gentleman’s point is spurious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I have never heard anything so bizarre. The hon. Gentleman suggests that 13 foxes 
decided to die of old age in the dame ditch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I fear that we may have discovered that foxes have strange religious sects, which 
involve committing suicide at the same time in the same place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Not at the same time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Yes, at the same time. It is a shame that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire did 
not belong to the hunt in my hon. Friends example. He would have been at the front on his horse and 
he could have told the Committee what happened.
<P>
Although foxes die all the time and they need to be controlled, there is not one registered hunt in 
my large rural constituency, which covers north Lincolnshire and the east Riding of Yorkshire. As my 
hon. Friend the Member for Worcester reminds me, my constituency is the pig capital of Britain. there 
is no problem with fox numbers in my constituency. When they need to be controlled, they are shot. 
They do not end up in drains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> My hon. Friend makes the point that I thought I had made earlier. There are no hunts 
in Scotland and there are no problems with foxes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Yes, there are many hunts in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman does not know what he is 
talking about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman care to name them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Yes. They are in the borders, and the hon. Member for Taunton talked about hunts in 
the north of Fife, which is as far north as foxes go. There are 10 packs of foxhounds in Scotland. Will 
the hon. Gentleman admit that he did not know about them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Perhaps I should clarify my point. There are Scottish islands where there are foxes, 
but no fox hunts. There, foxes control their own numbers in some mysterious way. Perhaps they die in 
one place at a set time. There might be a communal drain on the Scottish islands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Let me suggest a scenario in which 13 foxes all die at exactly the same 
place. It is accepted practice in a fox hunt for the foxes’ natural means of escape to be blocked up to 
stop the fox escaping. The drain mentioned could have been the only possible place that a fox could 
seek refuge. The hunt might not have been good at its job and failed to block up that hole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> That is very likely. The Pytchley and Grafton hunt obviously decided not to block up 
or dig that drain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> Further to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, the two 
hunts had agreed not to dig the fox out of the drain. There was an entrance into the drain, but the way 
out had been stopped. That is why 13 foxes got into the drain, but  could not get out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. The contribution of the hon. Member for Clwyd, 
South is chaotic, because he has not done his homework. If he wishes to take time to research the 
point, perhaps you, Mrs. Michie, would invite him to come back next week and try again. He requires 
the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) to read the very book from which he wishes to 
make a point. Although he had plenty of notice from the hon. Member for Worcester that he might be 
required to make a speech about fox hunting, he has not been able to do so. He should come back next 
week after he has done his homework.

<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair. However, I hope that the hon. Member 
for Clwyd, South will relate his remarks to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I have to say, Mrs. Michie, that my remarks relate directly to the amendment. I 
cannot see how they do not. The amendment would exclude foxes from the Bill. I might not be 
making a well-researched case—although I thought that the quote from 1937 showed an element of 
research—but I am trying to ensure that foxes will remain covered by the Bill. I was speaking against 
the amendment. I stand to be corrected, Mrs. Michie, but I thought that that is what I was doing.
<P>
Hounds are bred for stamina, not speed. They are designed for prolonged chase, which suggests 
that foxes will not survive because of the effort that they have to put into the chase.
<P>
The amendments would allow hunting to continue as a means of controlling the fox population. 
If hunts wanted to control fox numbers, they would not build artificial earths to encourage foxes to 
breed. Even in fell-pack country where hunts claim to hunt solely for pest control purposes, artificial 
earths are built. It is hypocritical to argue that hunts control foxes when they build artificial earths so 
that they have foxes to hunt.
<P>
One argument about fox predation holds water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. Before we conclude this morning’s sitting, will 
you consider the following point? We have reached the end of our fourth sitting, but we are still on 
line 6 of page 1 of the Bill and are still considering the second line of clause 1(1). A huge amount of 
the Bill has yet to be considered, so I invite you to encourage the proponents of the Bill to be serious.
