</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 5, line 41, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) A statement under subsection (1) shall include, in relation to any vote taken on any action other than intervention in financial markets, an indication of the number and names of the members of the Committee who voted in favour and those who voted against that action.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 14 deals with the publication of statements about decisions made by the Monetary Policy Committee. It takes us into the realm of the public's right to know and the accountability of that super-quango to Parliament, outside interests and the electorate. Given the committee's power and influence over interest rate decisions, it is important that there is a regular flow of information on a timely basis. There should be a presumption in favour of complete openness and a case must be made for any restriction that is placed on the publication of information about decisions. When we reach clause 15, we shall debate the publication of the minutes of the meetings, which is to be done six weeks after the date of the meeting in question.
<P>
Amendment No. 27 would provide for immediate publication, not only of the decision on interest rates that was made at a particular meeting, but the number of votes cast, the names of the members of the committee who cast them and the names of those who voted for the decision and who voted against it. We shall not press the amendment to a Division, but it is important to explore with the Government their reasons for the delay in the names being published. The people involved will no doubt be of a high quality; they will have been appointed to the committee by the Government for short terms, so there should be a countervailing openness about what they do, what actions they take and how they vote. On the face of it, there is no apparent objection to publishing the information immediately if it can be made available six weeks later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Does the right hon. Gentleman acknowledge that there could be market disruption if the names were published immediately, with the market perceiving that some members might have favoured a particular rise, while others favoured a different rise? Is that not a good justification for such matters being kept confidential?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman already behaves like a member of the Government. I hope that he will serve in the Government in the future but, at this stage in his career, he should be on the side of openness and the public's right to know.
<P>
We all know that it is in the interest of any Government--or any organisation--to keep information to themselves, but there should be a counter-influence that argues for the right to publish names. The hon. Gentleman is probably familiar with the United States, a country that I used to visit frequently. One of the refreshing things about America is its presumption of openness and the public's right to know. A clear reason must be given in that country why information concerning names and how people voted should not be released immediately to the public.
<P>
The Bill already deals with the problem of market disruption, and we shall be debating later this morning why intervention in the market should, in certain circumstances, remain secret at least for a time. However, given that the names will eventually be published, I see no good reason why we should not move rather more quickly, as suggested in amendment No. 27.
<P>
Amendment No. 28 deals with market disruption--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are dealing with amendment No. 27; it is not grouped with amendment No. 28.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do apologise, Mr. Butterfill. I misread the grouping. I see now that we shall be debating amendment No. 28 later this morning.
<P>
I rest my argument on amendment. No. 27, which seeks publication of the votes immediately after decisions are taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I shall speak briefly in support of my right hon. Friend's amendment. In answer to the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), it is necessary to be much more careful about openness and transparency when decisions about monetary policy are being parcelled off to a super-quango--the new, independent Bank of England--much more so than when the Chancellor was directly responsible for monetary policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain the term super-quango, a term used also by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)? It is a statutory body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> All quangos are statutory bodies. The Monetary Policy Committee will be a super-quango because it will take governmental decisions but--unlike Ministers--not be directly accountable to Parliament for its executive decisions. By definition, therefore, it is a quasi-autonomous national governmental organisation--a quango.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Where does the secrecy come in?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The committee will be in charge of one of the most important areas of policy. It will be the biggest ever shift of policy-making. We are talking about shifting the decision-making process on monetary policy to a quango. Monetary policy represents a sizeable chunk--more than half--of economic policy. It is a huge shift, and super-quango seems a perfectly suitable title for the Bank of England that will be created under the Bill.
<P>
Increasing openness under the previous Government led to the publication of the minutes of discussions between the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor. I repeat that there should be an extra level of openness, because the decision-making powers will have been parcelled off to a super-quango instead of the Chancellor being directly accountable to Parliament, where he could be questioned on those matters. We need as much openness as possible on how the committee's decisions are reached.
<P>
I wish to raise another matter, but I am not sure whether to do it now or on clause stand part. Clause 14(2) contains the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether immediate publication of the decision would be likely to impede or frustrate the achievement of the intervention's purpose.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to the Bill, there would be no need for the Bank of England to discuss or publish a statement. That phrase needs to be better defined to ensure that it is not too widely interpreted by the Government; otherwise they will be tempted not to publish details whenever it is expedient or convenient. That phrase is too widely drawn. The Minister should further define it, so that, in line with the Pepper v. Hart decision, people can know precisely what Parliament's intention was when it was enacted.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): The right hon. Member for Wells will be delighted to know that I agree with something that he said. It is important that there is a regular flow of information on a timely basis. The whole Committee would agree that openness and transparency are desirable in the policies of Government and organisations that have a massive effect on matters of public interest.
<P>
I must resist the amendment, however--I am pleased that the right hon. Gentleman will not press it to a Division--for the reason given by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North. I should say my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North--I was so excited at the prospect of his joining the Government that I almost made him a Privy Councillor. My hon. Friend made the point superbly. The Government cannot accept the amendment because it could be counterproductive to publish members' voting records immediately after the decision on interest rates is made. If the committee was divided and the subject of the division was market sensitive, that could be destabilising.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not quite understand why that should be so. The decision will have led to interest rates staying the same, going up or going down; it will be sacrosanct and will not change. However, it would be interesting as part of the general debate on economic policy to know the committee's thinking. Commentators will be interested to know when there is genuine disagreement about whether the economy is slowing down or speeding up, for example. I do not think that that would undermine the decision, which will have been taken and cannot be changed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman misunderstands the amendment, which would require only the voting record to be published. It would not require publication of the analysis to which he refers, which will be published in the mintues. It is conceivable that, when the committee is divided over monetary policy, some parts of the market could use that knowledge for their own purposes.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells mentioned the United States, but the federal open market committee releases the voting record not at the time of decisions but when the minutes are released several weeks later. That is for the same reason: that committee does not want to create disruption in the market.
<P>
It would be a different matter if there were a full and frank account of the meeting, which is why we propose publication of the minutes. Indeed, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee are published some weeks later. However, we must be prudent in the release of information, especially when it is market sensitive. That is why the Government cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> With that elucidation of the Government's position, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 6, line 13, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, but in any case publication of the decision shall take place within the period of 12 months, starting from the date on which the decision was taken.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to occasions when the Monetary Policy Committee decides not to publish any information about its decision to intervene in financial markets when it believes that publication would impede or frustrate the purpose of the intervention. The amendment would impose a longstop, ensuring that publication occurs within 12 months of the decision, so that the market, the House of Commons and the public will know that the market intervention has taken place. As the Bill stands, information may never be given out about an important action of the Monetary Policy Committee to commit large sums of foreign exchange to intervene in the market.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is an instinct in all organisations to conserve information. Governments possess that instinct; one could call it an instinct to secrecy. That instinct to be less than candid can become overwhelming when a mistake may have been made. For example, let us imagine that the Monetary Policy Committee decides to intervene in a market during a period of turbulence and its action fails--it turns out to be not only ill-judged but expensive. It may be decided not to publish the information at the time because that might create further turbulence.
<P>
	Under the Bill, although the committee will keep under consideration whether publication of that decision could cause further damage, it might find all sorts of reasons for never concluding that publication was justified. For instance, it might regard the fact that it had failed as itself undermining the authority and reputation of the Bank of England. So its market intervention could remain secret for all time, which would be damaging and wrong.
<P>
	Given that under their short terms of appointment the members of the committee are essentially creatures of the Executive, it is doubly important that at some time--I concede the case for delay in particular cases--we should be told about the committee's decisions. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to place a time limit of 12 months on how long such information can remain secret.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman explain what is the effect of subsection (5), which contains a statutory obligation for the fact of an intervention to be published as soon as practicable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> As I read it, that does not commit the Monetary Policy Committee to do what I am suggesting that it should do. Nothing in clause 14 as drafted will ensure that such information is published. If the committee continues to take the view that publication of the fact of an intervention would do further damage to the market, there is nothing to compel it to place that information in the public domain.
<P>
	My amendment would provide for that; it would ensure the public's right to know. It would not interfere with the Monetary Policy Committee's ability to keep information confidential for a period--in a time of market turbulence or crisis, there may be compelling reasons to do so. In order to be successful, market intervention sometimes needs to be undertaken outside the glare of short-term publicity.
<P>
	However, there may be a temptation for such information always to be deemed dangerous; that is a feature of Government organisations the world over. The Committee should insist that the information will eventually become public, as the amendment provides. That is a comparatively modest request, and is fully in line with everything that the Government said before they were elected about the need for a presumption of openness.
<P>
We are promised a freedom of information Bill. I always carry with me a copy of the Labour manifesto because it is becoming a little embarrassing to the Government. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Unnecessary secrecy in government leads to arrogance in government and defective policy decisions. We are pledged to a Freedom of Information Act,''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we have not yet seen that--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``leading to more open government, and independent National Statistical Service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are still waiting for that freedom of information Bill--certainly, there is no such Act. Meanwhile, we agree that there should be a presumption of openness. So we are moving the amendment because it fits neatly into everything that the Labour party promised us before the election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Can the right hon. Gentleman tell us when, during his long, distinguished career in government, he publicly supported a freedom of information Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Now the hon. Gentleman is trying to flatter me. I am a believer in greater freedom of information, but I do not believe that that is necessarily best delivered by a freedom of information Act. I was pleased that in many important ways the previous Government delivered on its promise routinely to publish more information which was not damaging. Indeed, our initiative on openness in the minutes of the deliberations of the Bank of England and the Chancellor on interest rates did not need a freedom of information Bill.
<P>
The Government are tempted by the headline that they will introduce an overarching, comprehensive freedom of information Bill. They are using that as an excuse to delay the much more important ad hoc delivery of greater information. Every time that is requested, they say, ``Wait for the freedom of information Bill.'' Frankly, it is beginning to be like waiting for Godot.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> Would it be worth asking whether the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is responsible for such a Bill which is imminent, has consulted Treasury Ministers? Is it not a matter of public interest to discover the relevant Minister has consulted Treasury Ministers and the Bank on these changes to monetary policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend has asked a good question. As he has asked it through you, Mr. Butterfill, and then through me, perhaps the Economic Secretary will respond.
<P>
Will we return to the matter of information from the Bank of England and the monetary policy committee when we debate a freedom of information Bill? It would be much better to address such issues and satisfy ourselves about freedom of information while debating the Bill, rather than waiting for a hypothetical Bill which might come limping along in a few month's time and which might, or might not, address such issues. The amendment deals with the matter of the public's right to know. We assume that the Treasury is being consulted on the terms of a freedom of information Bill. Will the Economic Secretary enlighten us about that?
<P>
My hon. Friend referred to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who soon after the general election, announced in a written answer that, pending a freedom of information Bill, the existing guidelines on disclosure would be interpreted liberally. In other words, there would be a presumption that the public could have access to information from Departments of State and quangos. Let us see a practical illustration of that. The Government should accept this extremely modest amendment, which would ensure that only in the long term--12 months after an intervention occurred--the public would be at least privileged to know that possibly large sums were expended on their behalf.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to make a few points about some of the phrases in the clause, especially the use of the word ``practicable'', which relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Dudley, North. The word ``practicable'' is a subjective one, and it would be helpful to people involved in these matters outside the House to have a more specific definition of it. Will the Economic Secretary, or the Chief Secretary, advise the Committee what is meant by ``practicable'' in these circumstances?
<P>
Clause 14(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``As soon as practicable after each meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the Bank shall publish a statement as to whether it was decided at the meeting that the Bank should take any action.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What time scale is envisaged for that?
<P>
Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``As soon as practicable after the Committee has decided that publication of a decision which has not been the subject of a statement under subsection (3) would no longer have the effect mentioned in subsection (2).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What time span do the Government envisage in that case? It would obviously be a different period from that referred to in clause 14(1).
<P>
Finally, I should like to repeat the request for explanation that I made when we discussed amendment No. 27. Subsection (2) includes the phrase.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would be likely to impede or frustrate the achievement of the intervention's purpose.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary, or another Minister, give us a further explanation of that phrase, to stop the provision being used too widely? That is always a temptation in Government, or in super-quangos. When legislation has been enacted and filed away in a drawer, such phrases deliver some reality and bureaucrats tend to rely on them to avoid openness.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> On a number of occasions this morning I have been intrigued by the right hon. Member for Wells. He referred to the Government's ``instinct to secrecy'' when they are being less than candid. I am aware that the right hon. Gentleman is much more experienced in ministerial office than I am. Which particular secrets is he keeping?
<P>
I have some sympathy, however, with the points that hon. Members have made about the time period that is desirable for releasing details of decisions. I should point out that the Government have such a wide commitment to the release of information that very, very soon--I stress that--we shall publish, quarterly, details of our own and the Bank of England's foreign exchange position, including the forward book. That is a much higher level of disclosure than has previously applied to policy decisions about foreign exchange interventions. Such matters have never been published in such detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> When publishing that information, will the Government also disclose their foreign exchange policy? Points were made earlier about priority when there is a conflict between the Government's exchange rate policy and the monetary policy of the Bank of England. One might require an interest rate rise and the other might require a reduction. Will the Economic Secretary tell the Committee which would take priority? Will the documents deal with that dilemma?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I can see that the hon. Gentleman was much stung by the Chief Secretary's remark last week that hon. Members had failed to read the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is now trying to prove to the Committee that he has got to parts of the Bill that we have not yet reached.
<P>
The Government are committed to stability in our economic dealings, and also to growth. There will be opportunities to discuss such matters later.
<P>
I have been asked about a freedom of information Bill. As the right hon. Member for Wells will be aware, the Treasury knows everything; that is enshrined in the mystique of Government. In that context the hon. Gentleman referred to ``Waiting for Godot'', which contains the memorable line, ``quaquaquaqua''. More than once during the debate it has occurred to me that perhaps we are waiting for Godot.
<P>
To return to the substantive point under discussion, and the points that the right hon. Gentleman made about sensitivity of information, I have much sympathy with his view that it would be inappropriate for the Monetary Policy Committee to keep a decision secret for ever. However, it is impossible to predict how long a decision might remain sensitive. That is the reason for our not specifying a time in the Bill. Nevertheless, the Bill requires the Committee to keep matters under consideration and, ultimately, to publish a decision to intervene in financial markets when the reason for the delay no longer applies.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) asked about the phrase ``as soon as practicable''. He would perhaps be more comfortable with the word ``appropriate''. With regard to decisions that are not sensitive, the Monetary Policy Committee has already established the practice of announcing interest rate decisions at noon on the same day. That is very welcome. However, with respect to sensitive matters, ``as soon as practicable'' means just that--as soon as they are no longer sensitive.
<P>
Given the hon. Gentleman's profession before he came to the House, he will know that financial dealings give rise to issues of great sensitivity, and that it is important to maintain appropriate treatment of them. The Government cannot accept the amendment. It is possible that the time scale that it would introduce would be longer than necessary, but it is impossible to assess how long decisions would in future need to be treated as sensitive. We want to make clear our desire for maximum disclosure of information, but also for that disclosure to be made in a prudent manner.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised points about subsequent clauses and referred to intervention, which I had intended to return to on clause stand part. It is possible that the Monetary Policy Committee would at some point decide upon market intervention rather than an interest rate announcement. It might, to give the most obvious example, want to influence market expectations indirectly, through foreign exchange intervention. The risk of publicity in such circumstances could jeopardise the success of the operation.
<P>
We are all aware of how the foreign exchange markets operate, and the difficulties that can be created when a certain spin is put on decisions. However, all decisions must eventually be announced. When there is no more reason to delay, those decisions must become part of the public domain.
<P>
If what I have outlined is taken together with my earlier comments about our decision with respect to the forward book in relation to foreign exchange dealings, it can be seen that the Bank's actions concerning foreign exchange interventions will be subject to much higher levels of disclosure than before. Because of the sensitivity of much of the relevant information, and the need to react prudently, the Government do not accept the need for a time limit of one year. That figure has been plucked out of the air and is not based on foreknowledge of how long decisions could remain sensitive.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That was a wholly unsatisfactory reply which takes us no further. The Economic Secretary says that there will now be a great quarterly publication on the foreign exchange position. That hardly heralds a revolution in open government. She will have to do much better than that if the Government are to fulfil all their promises about the public's right to know and open government.
<P>
We were rather disappointed when the Economic Secretary said that the freedom of information Bill was like waiting for Godot, but she will also know, as she has obviously seen the play, that Godot never arrives. We can therfore take it that there will never be a Freedom of Information Bill, though an apology of a Bill--some sort of gesture--might be published in due course. But from what the hon. Lady says, it seems that we shall never have a proper Bill to become an Act--yet another election promise gone up in smoke.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that information is eventually published. The hon. Lady said--I wrote down her words--that decisions must be part of the public domain, but that is not provided for in the Bill, which leaves it up to a super-quango to decide whether decisions about intervention in the market will be published. No one else can force the issue--not the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Treasury Committee, the House, the markets, or the electorate. None of those can make the Monetary Policy Committee disclose that it may have committed large sums of money to supporting the pound in foreign markets. Gigantic losses could be made and we want to know the details of why that money was committeed, the effect it had and whether it was successful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that members of the Monetary Policy Committee would break the law by failing to comply with subsection (2) which states that decisions should be kept confidential only if publication
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would be likely to impede or frustrate the achievement of the intervention's purpose.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is he suggesting that the Monetary Policy Committee will not comply with that statutory provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, but that is the very point because the interpretation is to be left to the Monetary Policy Committee. We could not challenge it because we would not know that the intervention had taken place. The interpretation of the provision might be stretched to breaking-point, but who would know about it? Surely the House has the right to ensure that the Monetary Policy Committee fails to produce information only when it would be injurious to make it known. We shall be in the dark forever.
<P>
A series of mistakes could be made and one could envisage circumstances in which the Committee is under attack for ill-judged interest rate decisions--ratchetting the rates up during a recession--perhaps under political attack from the hon. Gentleman's own party. In those circumstances, the Monetary Policy Committee would not want further to undermine its reputation and authority by admitting to another big mistake--spending &#163;5 billion in a failed attempt to influence the value of the pound. In those circumstances members could persuade themselves that publication of such information could further damage the purpose of the original intervention and undermine their own reputation.
<P>
Bureaucracies and Governments can find all sorts of ways to decide that publication of a mistake will not be in the public interest. I may be over-suspicious, but the amendment's purpose is to ensure that at some stage the relevant information will be published. After 12 months--long after the initial intervention--we should be able to know the truth about the decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Can my right hon. Friend--and subsequently the Economic Secretary--envisage any circumstances in which 12 months would need to elapse before a sensitive decision could be published? Information should no longer be sensitive after 12 months. Can my right hon. Friend--or the Government--conceive of any circumstances in which it would be a problem for the Government to publish after 12 months?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, indeed not. The amendment was tabled because it would be costless. It does not ask the Government to do something outrageous or to interfere needlessly in the independence or discretion of the Monetary Policy Committee. It would simply ensure that information is eventually revealed. I agree with my hon. Friend. In all normal circumstances, information will be published long before 12 months elapse. We are making a modest request for a time limit. It would reassure the markets, the public and the House that, in no circumstances, will we be deprived of information for longer than 12 months.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): When will we know how much was committed to the defence of the pound on black Wednesday? Was that day not more than 12 months ago? Does that not show that the 12-month long stop may sometimes not be enough time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Given what the hon. Gentleman has said, he will be voting with us. He is obviously concerned to ensure that the information is always published and can never be withheld for whatever reason. That was a most illuminating intervention. I confidently expect that not only will the hon. Gentleman vote for the amendment, but that we might even win the vote.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 6, line 43, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) Minutes published under this section shall also record, in relation to the deliberations of the Committee, the views expressed by members of the Committee and by an Treasury representative attending under paragraph 13 of Schedule 3 to this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to the publication of the minutes of the meetings. The clause follows a precedent set by the previous Government by stipulating that the minutes should be published within six weeks. The amendment would fill out the provisions for the minutes and it would ensure that they record not just the votes of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee, but provide more information on their views and those of any Treasury representative present.
<P>
The Bill provides that a Treasury official may attend meetings of the committee, so it is important that the minutes give a full account of the discussions that take place. That does not mean recording just the bald voting figures, but recording the views expressed by the Bank and the Treasury. That is important because, as we said last week, if we are to achieve a successful monetary policy it is vital that, as far as possible, everyone should be committed to the same objects and the same instruments.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We discussed the dangers of a split developing between monetary and fiscal policy; there is also a danger of divisions developing between the Treasury and the Bank. To some extent, it does not matter if they occasionally differ slightly--I believe that the term for that is creative friction--but any difference of emphasis should be known and reported so that the market-makers and the public can comment on and watch the development of that interchange. In the same way, the publication of the minutes in the last Parliament enabled outsiders to note any differences in approach or emphasis between the Bank and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), as the then Chancellor. It is healthy that differences should be recorded in the minutes rather than being covered up.
<P>
There is currently a difference between the Treasury and the Bank. The Chancellor's pre-Budget statement differed markedly in its inflation forecast from the view of the Bank. Rather unusually, and perhaps only temporarily, the Bank was noticeably more optimistic about the course of inflation over the next two years whilst the Chancellor, perhaps for his own purposes, had a different view. If that difference is discussed in Monetary Policy Committee meetings, it is important that that should be carried forward into the minutes.
<P>
The accountability of the members of that super-quango is also an issue. Conservative Members believe strongly--as did the Treasury Select Committee--that its members should be subject to confirmatory hearings by the Treasury Committee, to ensure that they are untainted by any party allegiance. That request was refused and in the absence of that measure, another safeguard is for the views expressed in the deliberations to be recorded so that we can judge whether members are operating independently, as we would wish.
<P>
As has been said, the members of some other central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve Bank, have occasionally aligned themselves with the policies of the Government of the day--a particular example of that is what happened under President Nixon. A safeguard against that developing here is best ensured through overseeing members' appointment and the term served, but the Government would not listen to us on that. As a modest substitute, therefore, we need to be sure that the discussions are fully and properly recorded so that we can judge members' independence and integrity--not only when they are appointed but in their continuing work on that important committee. The amendment would ensure that the views expressed in it are recorded in the minutes and I ask the Government to accept it in that spirit.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In supporting the amendment, I hope that Labour Members will regard my comments as helpful and as being offered in a spirit of co-operation. In offering them, I pray in aid the arrangements set in place by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe.
<P>
By comparison with what was put in place by the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Bill lacks transparency. I am not making a political point, but merely pointing out that the Bill's proposals are less transparent and open. That is because the individual views of members of the committee will not be published.
<P>
It is understandable that the Government seek to give less information than necessary. I realise that with monetary policy, Governments and banks think that the more information available the more mischief, as it were, the markets can make with it. That understandable instinct was expressed by the Economic Secretary on a previous amendment. I can understand the feelings of a central banker or a Minister that the less information given, the better, but the argument for openness should outweigh that.
<P>
Let us remind ourselves of the arrangements laid down by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe. In the monthly monetary meetings attended by the Governor, his senior Bank officials, the Chancellor and his junior Treasury Ministers and officials, full and frank discussions took place--as I know, because I was privileged to sit in on them. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells also has experience of free, open and honest debate on monetary policy to thrash out the issues and reach the most suitable decisions.
<P>
Those full, frank and open meetings--I and others believe--delivered exactly the right decisions. One reason for their being so free, open and honest was that the participants knew that their views should be attributed in published minutes within six weeks of a meeting. This contributed to the high quality of the decisions that were taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I have before me a complete blueprint of the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting of 6 to 7 August. After careful examination, I cannot see any attribution of comments by individual members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The hon. Gentleman has missed the point; clearly he has not read the amendment. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. I will take him through it. Before 1 May, in the arrangements set down by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, the published minutes ascribed views to the Governor and the Chancellor. There is no point in his shaking his head; he is making the point for me. There is no such attribution in the minutes of 6-7 August, which we have all read. They are long and informative but they are deficient in one crucial respect--in their ascribing and attributing of specific policy views and decisions to individual members. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that one would have to look long and hard to find any view being ascribed to leading central bank officials--or, indeed, to the Governor. That is the point of the amendment. We wish to return to a sensible position; we want to know what members of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings have said.
<P>
I speak in a genuine spirit of co-operation, to try to improve the Bill, and I want the Economic Secretary to have the chance to answer us. I repeat that one reason that so many commentators thought that monetary policy prior to 1 May was being conducted well was that individuals had no hiding place at monetary meetings; people had to go on record and justify everything they said. The anonymity of the proposed arrangements, under which members of the Monetary Policy Committee can hide, will not contribute to good governance. It will detract from good monetary policy rather than to add to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) is confused because the present arrangements for publishing the minutes are the same as in the Bill. The Government took action before enactment--indeed, before the Bill was published. The hon. Gentleman's confusion arises from the Government's decision to proceed before the legislation has been passed by the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a typically incisive point. I hope that the Economic Secretary will take these comments in the spirit in which they are intended. It can certainly be argued that the Governor and the Chancellor were comfortable with arrangements prior to 1 May. Indeed, they welcomed publication, and the attribution of specific views on specific points, within six weeks of their meetings. That contributed to a higher quality of debate and discussion than would otherwise have been the case. A reply is needed to that point. Even though the Chancellor is not formally a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, he can appoint members.
<P>
I conclude by adducing another reason why attributing specific views to individuals would be desirable. At previous sittings, we spoke about the composition of the Monetary Policy Committee. We all agree that the present nine members are first-class operators. They are a distinguished group of individuals, and the City and the markets view them as such. I have no complaints about that. However, under clause 15, seven of those nine are appointed directly or indirectly by the Chancellor or the Prime Minister.
<P>
The present nine members have impeccable credentials, but I am worried that, in future, seven of the nine members of that terribly important committee will be political appointments made by the Chancellor or the Prime Minister, in consultation with Her Majesty the Queen. Political influence can be brought to bear on the committee and political pressure could in future be applied to those individuals by those near the Prime Minister or the Chancellor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman urged Opposition Front-Bench Members to publish the minutes of shadow Cabinet meetings, attributing to its different members the radically different views that they have on Europe--all in the interests of open government, of course?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I concede to the hon. Gentleman--whose interventions I always enjoy--that, for the time being, the conduct of monetary policy is perhaps marginally more important for our nation than the conduct of shadow Cabinet policy. [Hon. Members: ``Oh.''] The hon. Gentleman made a silly point when he talked about a statutory body in relation to the shadow Cabinet. He knows perfectly well that the two are not on all fours.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The political pressure that can be exerted on seven out of nine potentially political appointees is something on which the City and the markets will decide. They may say that the appointees are political stooges and that they are not impressed by the conduct of monetary policy. That is one way in which wrongful political influence can be exposed.
<P>
Of course, the markets can decide, but would it not be better for all concerned to know what individuals were saying on particular days--perhaps nearer to general elections, may I venture to suggest? It would be important and interesting for the City and the markets to understand precisely what Monetary Policy Committee members were saying about policy issues that fall to them to decide--issues that are as important to this country and the macro-economy as monetary policy and the setting of interest rates. That is why the Government should accept the amendment.
<P>
Sensible publication arrangements were in place before 1 May, so why has the Economic Secretary decided to ditch them? Why do not the arguments for transparency find favour with her? My next question is particularly apposite in the context of our discussions: have freedom of information considerations been discussed with Treasury Ministers? Has the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is responsible for freedom of information, contacted the hon. Lady or her ministerial colleagues in connection with the Bill and the requirements that we regard necessary for transparency and openness? Have such matters been followed up in the Government's freedom of information Bill, which we understand is pending?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), as I do with my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, that the amendment is not too controversial and that the Government should take it on board. Given that, unfortunately, the Bank of England Bill is likely to be passed, the best thing to do is try to make the best of a bad job.
<P>
It would be interesting for the views of Monetary Policy Committee members to be published because that would lead to a genuine debate on the conduct of economic policy. The conduct of monetary policy is not purely a technical issue. An enormous amount of debate takes place among economists on how to translate the inflation target set by the Government into monetary policy measures. It is important, therefore, to monitor the views of Monetary Policy Committee members to see who is making the right decisions. Over a long period, we can determine who is right and who is wrong, if their views are published and can be analysed. Reaching a decision on how to conduct monetary policy depends on one's analysis of the current economic situation and the accuracy of the forecasts.
<P>
If people believe that the economy is overheating and have forecast that it will continue to grow, they are likely to want some tightening of monetary policy. By contrast, if people believe that inflation is under control and that an increase in unemployment is more likely than a re-emergence of inflation, they will lean towards not tightening monetary policy or even expanding it.
<P>
If the views of Monetary Policy Committee members are published so that we can read and analyse them, we can decide, in the following months and years, who was right and can debate the issues more widely. The amendment will lead to a much clearer understanding among the public of the importance of monetary policy and how it works.
<P>
A variety of views is held: Tim Congdon, Patrick Minford, Goldman Sachs, the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer each have their own views; indeed, we know from the Chancellor's statement last Tuesday that his view of the current economic situation differs from that of the Bank of England. The issues are not purely technical; they are subjective matters of opinion. There will be right and wrong answers, however, as we will be able to see if the Government accept the amendment. The amendment would ensure that the process of making the Bank of England independent, instead of being a disaster in terms of accountability, would enhance economic debate. In the long run, that will lead to the right monetary policy decisions being taken.
<P>
As we know from the autobiographies of previous economic Ministers, the Bank of England tends to want to intervene in exchange rate policy for reasons other than controlling the money supply. There is a widespread belief among economists that linking sterling to the deutschmark, for example, will have an anti-inflationary effect. I believe that that view is mistaken; I see no logical connection between inflation and the exchange rate. This country's experience of shadowing the deutschmark in the late 1980s and of joining the exchange rate mechanism in the early 1990s proved to be a complete disaster.
<P>
However, current or future members of the Monetary Policy Committee may hold the view that tinkering with the exchange rates has an anti-inflationary effect, and it would be interesting to see their views set down, as I believe that those views will be proved wrong. We need to know who is advising the committee to pursue wrong economic policies. The amendment would open up economic debate and lead to better economic policy.
<P>
In discussing an earlier amendment, we were told that it would be wrong to dock the pay of Monetary Policy Committee members if the Bank of England was not meeting the inflation target. We were told that people were not members of the committee for the money; they were professionals who depended on their reputations, which would motivate them to make the right policy decisions--to dock their pay would be immaterial to the decision-making process. If we know only the committee's collective opinion, however, how will individual members' reputations be affected?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> On the same logic, is not it also true that, under the more open and transparent arrangements implemented by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe we knew what both the Governor and the Chancellor were saying and we could decide who was right?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. When the minutes were published, there was a wider economic debate. We could see that the Governor was urging an increase in interest rates and that the Chancellor was arguing that there should be no increase. Their two views were not just matters of opinion; they were based on their differing analyses of the current economic position. That was extremely interesting and it widened the debate about who was right. I believe strongly that the Chancellor was right to resist pressures to increase interest rates in 1995 and subsequently. That is why, when the Conservative Government left office, we had hit the target of 2.5 per cent. inflation, had had unemployment falling month in, month out for at least four years, and left it at 5 per cent., compared with 12 per cent. and rising in other European countries, and had steady, strong economic growth.
<P>
The publication of those views led to better conduct of economic policy. Since 1 May, and the publication of anodyne minutes that do not attribute views to individual members of the Monetary Policy Committee, the conduct of monetary policy has seriously declined. Some of the interest rate rises since 1 May have been excessive; the reputations of members of that committee are not affected by that because those are collective decisions--we do not know who decided against those increases or what the debate has been. The reputations of members of that committee are not at stake because they are hiding behind collective responsibility.
<P>
In conclusion, I reiterate that the translation of the Government's inflation target into monetary policy is not a technical issue; it very much depends on the views of the members of the Monetary Policy Committee, which is why we want the Treasury Committee to examine them on their appointment, so that we can know and test their views. The amendment would go a long way towards correcting many of the errors of the Bill and widening economic debate so that Britain conducts a much better economic policy.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have had a wee touch of the rose-tinted spectacles this morning in Opposition Members' evocation of the previous Government. In reality, much more information is now made available in the publication of the Monetary Policy Committee minutes. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds says that he is being co-operative; does he honestly think that the Ken and Eddie show was the right way of conducting monetary policy? It became so personalised.The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) says that it worked well, but he resigned from the Treasury when the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe was Chancellor--maybe one or two minutes should have been published about that so that we could have had some elucidation about the path of monetary policy and economic policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Just to put the record straight, I considered that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe was entirely successful in his conduct of monetary policy and that his decisions on interest rates were frequently better than those urged on him by the Governor of the Bank of England. The fact that he met his inflation target at the end of the Parliament, while achieving the other economic objectives, pays testament to that. I never had the slightest difference with him about monetary policy and I believe his record to be superior to that of the Government since the May election.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> That is an illuminating intervention. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe met his inflation target--what? Once? As soon as the arrangements that we are discussing were announced after the Labour Government were elected on 1 May, long-term interest rates fell. We have seen a fall in long-term interest rates of almost 1 per cent. [Interruption.] The right hon. Member for Wells, from a defensive, sedentary position, says that they have gone up; perhaps he would take into account the fact that if economic policy had been properly conducted by the previous Chancellor, there would have been no need to increase interest rates. Indeed, the removal of the sting of the Ken and Eddie show--two men disagreeing--means that we now have monetary policy on a much more professional basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn (Guildford)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Let me continue.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked about a freedom of information Bill. I say to him simply: haud yer wheesht! The time will come when he will get an opportunity to see the Government's proposals on freedom of information. I referred earlier to the fact that the Government were--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Let me finish the point and I will willingly let the hon. Gentleman intervene--I will even translate ``haud yer wheesht'' for him.
<P>
This morning I announced that we were soon to witness a further move towards much greater openness in Government economic policy with the publication of the foreign exchange reserves in the forward book. Indeed, the words were barely out of my mouth when the Government published those figures. There is now a much clearer exposition of our foreign exchange dealings than has ever been the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> First, I seek elucidation of the, I believe, Celtic phrase that the Economic Secretary has used. I welcome the news of the publication of the forward book and related matters. I am in generous Christmas mood, so I shall go further and say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made efforts to have a wider debate on the Budget. Although his pre-Budget statement did not find favour with my party or myself, it was, none the less, an attempt to put more information into the public domain.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Economic Secretary was asked whether the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had discussed with her or other Treasury Ministers the specific question of openness and greater transparency in affairs of the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank of England, not other matters. Would she care to answer?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> First, I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his speech and say that ``Haud yer wheesht'' can more appropriately be translated as ``Be patient.''
<P>
Freedom of information is much discussed in government. Indeed, it is one of the reasons for our election. The public became extremely suspicious of the previous Government, perhaps because of matters such as the Scott report. On the substantive matter under debate, perhaps the Opposition are seeing things through rose-tinted spectacles. In reality, much more information on monetary policy is available under this Government than under the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Is not it possible that the Economic Secretary is wearing rose-tinted spectacles when she looks at the performance of the gilt market just after the election? She ascribes the fall in gilt yields as an endorsement of the proposals on the independence of the Bank of England. Has it not crossed her mind that the reaction of financial markets to the end of the uncertainties of an election is an improvement in prices and that to ascribe such benefits to the Bill is to use rose-tinted spectacles?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The reason for the strong performance of the markets was relief at the election of a Labour Government, who are committed to economic stability and growth, who are open and transparent in their dealings, who have ideas for the future and who are not riven by internal dissent, as the Conservative party was then and continues to be.
<P>
If we were to include in the Bill a statutory requirement to reveal the detail of discussions, we could inhibit free and frank debate at the Monetary Policy Committee. The Federal Open Markets Committee provides an international example of that. It publishes transcripts five years after the event and, consequently, its members now read prepared texts. That would be an appalling way for monetary policy to develop. We shall appoint people to the Monetary Policy Committee specifically because of their expertise. We shall appoint intelligent men and women who might change their views in the course of discussion. They would be inhibited from changing their views if we were to adopt the amendment.
<P>
If we are to have proper and professional analysis of monetary policy, we must ensure that we do not personalise or restrict the discussions that take place. The minutes that are published are much more inclusive than anything that has been published before; what is more, voting records are published. I contend that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady attacked the disagreement between the former Chancellor and the Governor--what she called the Ken and Eddie show--over interest rate policy, and said that the new arrangements are much more professional. Does that mean that she believes that there will be no disagreement between members of the Monetary Policy Committee? If there is disagreement, why should not their debate be published?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> That is a rather silly point. Of course, in certain circumstances, there is likely to be disagreement among members of the Monetary Policy Committee. That is why we appoint a committee--a committee of people with recognised expertise. My point about publishing details of the debate is that we want to allow a free debate without attribution to take place. I thought that I had made that plain, but obviously I had not.
<P>
I recommend that the Committee rejects the amendment, because it is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I remind the Economic Secretary that the background to our debate is fairly sombre. We have had five interest rate increases since the election, all of which damage investment, which the hon. Lady is otherwise so keen to promote. The Government have missed their own inflation target in every single month. They loosened the target from the one that they inherited to 2.5 per cent., plus or minus 1 per cent., but inflation is now above 2.5 per cent. According to the Chancellor's recent projections, the Government will continue to miss their inflation target, despite the fact that they have had a Budget and a pre-Budget to try to put things right on that side of the national account.
<P>
	So it is not at all clear that the new procedure about which the hon. Lady boasts is in any way superior to what we had before--what she referred to as the Ken and Eddie show--which was conspicuously successful not just in achieving an inflation target but in all other aspects of economic policy, which will now be relegated to being subject to price stability under the Bill.
<P>
	The main point, which the hon. Lady continues to ignore, is that our arrangements for the provision of information and publication of minutes in the previous Parliament were to service an entirely different constitutional structure. We voluntarily decided to publish minutes; they were extremely useful. However, my right hon. and learned Friend the then Chancellor remained accountable to the House of Commons. He was frequently cross-examined about his interest rate decisions by Select Committees and in debates and at Question Time in the House. When he was asked why he had put interest rates up, put them down or kept them the same, he gave his reasons.
<P>
	Under the new procedure, the Chancellor will say, ``Don't ask me; it is nothing to do with me. It is all down to those clever chaps and ladies on the Monetary Policy Committee. You had better go and ask them.'' However, we cannot go and ask them. Under the Bill, we cannot even determine exactly what the appointees are saying about monetary policy and interest rates. That amounts to a dramatic reduction in accountability for monetary policy and the setting of interest rates. That is why we seek through this extremely modest amendment to increase the flow of information about the committee's decisions.
<P>
	I find it extraordinary that in order to defend her rejection of the amendment, the hon. Lady keeps harking back to a different prior structure, under which there was full accountability through Ministers to Parliament. In the light of her entirely inadequate reply, we must express our dismay by pressing the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 7, line 7, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4) The court may order for a period not exceeding two months that the Monetary Policy Committee shall take into account the overriding responsibility of the Bank to support the banking system.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take great pleasure in moving the amendment. Earlier, rose-tinted spectacles were mentioned, and it appears that the Bill portrays the world as the Government would like it to be rather than the world as it is. At our previous sitting, Ministers refused to spell out exactly how they see the link between exchange rates and interest rates. They dodge difficult questions.
<P>
An even more difficult question that the Bill dodges relates to the Bank's exact role after the transfer of supervisory functions has been carried out. What will be the Bank's role in supporting the banking system? As the clause relates to the functions of the court of directors, one of the main purposes of the amendment is to try to tease out of the Government a clarification of how they see the Bank's role continuing under the new regime.
<P>
The amendment was tabled, because the Chief Secretary felt that this subject merited just two lines on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Bank of England retains responsibility for the stability of the financial system''.--[Official Report, 11 November 1997; Vol. 300, c. 722.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to pre-empt the debate on part III of the Bill, under which responsibility for supervision of the banking system will be transferred. However, unless we debate on this clause what powers are left with the court after the transfer, we will not have another opportunity to do so.
<P>
Under part III, the supervision, which was ultimately the authority of the Governor, will come--through the appointments made to the board of supervision--ultimately under the control of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That is a regrettable politicisation of the role of supervision.
<P>
Let us assume that the supervisory system falls down and a bank in the system gets into trouble. It will still be up to the Bank of England to act as the lender of last resort. In the past, the Bank's own people would let it know the background to the problem, but, in the future, it will have to fly blind. The clause does not make it clear how the process of acting as lender of last resort will be carried out. It is as if the Bank has the responsibility of being lender of last resort without retaining the power to find out whether it should be so acting.
<P>
We have heard a great deal of criticism from Ministers about the inadequacies of the previous system under which the Bank operated through its court. On Second Reading the Chief Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the collapse of both Barings and BCCI showed that it is necessary to have a domestic regulator that has sufficient clout and reputation to deal with its international counterparts.''-- [Official Report, 11 November 1997; Vol. 300, c. 721.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, the Bank of England's key role in the difficulties experienced under Conservative Governments related not solely to regulation but to its role as lender of last resort. When Johnson Matthey hit trouble, the Governor of the Bank of England was abroad. He returned to find that his deputy had lent &#163;100 million to the broke bullion dealer. Was that the right decision and the right way of making it? Should not a role for the Bank's court be spelt out in the Bill to make it clear how such decisions will be taken in future? I would welcome the Minister's clarification, but the Bill seems to leave the matter under wraps.
<P>
And apart from the Monetary Policy Committee and the regulatory and supervisory role, the Bill effectively allows the Bank to continue as before. In its annual report this year, the Bank states that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Court is responsible under the Charter of the Bank of England for the affairs of the Bank--that is, setting the strategic direction of the Bank as a corporation, and ensuring in particular that the Bank's resources are effectively deployed in pursuit of its key responsibilities. Court . . . acts as a source of advice for the Governor on business and market conditions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is . . . not concerned with taking day-to-day decisions on supervisory chases, though it receives regular reports on the operation of the Banking Act and on resources in Supervision and Surveillance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many of the annual report's points are reflected in clause 2, but nowhere is it explained how the other important role is to be undertaken.
<P>
Criticisms of the Bank of England ignore the fact that there are more banks in the City of London than in any other city in the world. In view of the wider circumstances, I believe that the Bank's role has been outstanding. Moreover, under other systems in other countries, the problems caused by failing banks have not been avoided, yet they have cost taxpayers vast sums of money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is this not another example of conflict arising between the need to translate inflation targets into monetary policy and other objectives such as dealing with a systemic risk crisis? Those policies may well conflict and if the Monetary Policy Committee is not allowed to take problems such as systemic risk into account, it may continue pursuing anti-inflationary policies when a relaxation is necessary. It parallels conflict over exchange rate policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I compliment my hon. Friend on getting to the point a great deal faster than some Labour Members. A central point of the amendment is that this type of conflict over policy must be resolved. If we fail to resolve conflict between the exchange rate and the interest rate, we may damage the economy. In the current conditions, damage is already being done to the economy by the policy adopted since 1 May and the conflict--which the Government refuse to admit--between their exchange rate and their inflation objectives. But how much greater will the damage be if, by failing to resolve the potential conflict between the needs of monetary policy and the needs of the banking system, we undermine confidence in the banking system itself?
<P>
Let us remember that the Bank's interventions--on Johnson Matthey, BCCI and Barings--succeeded in resolving the crisis in the banking system with barely any need to use taxpayers' money. Let us compare that with what happened in other countries. In France, for example, the problems of Credit Lyonnais cost the taxpayer upwards of &#163;6 billion. The costs of the savings and loan crisis in the United States of America cost American taxpayers more than $500 billion. Those are massive sums. The Chancellor wishes to take an overriding role in banking supervision: is this because, as a Labour Chancellor with a new system, he intends--as we fear--to write some very large cheques? Our amendment would avoid that disaster by making it clear that where the needs of monetary policy conflict with the needs of the banking system, it is the court's role to decide, within the various decision-making bodies of the Bank of England--that the needs of the banking system must, for a period, come first.
<P>
I recall another banking crisis in the USA in the early 1980s, when the Continental Illinois bank got into serious trouble. The problem there was one of liquidity rather than solvency. The bank was almost bust, but not quite: its assets just covered its liabilities. But it was so close to the edge that no one wanted to lend it money. The US Federal Reserve bank made its resources available to Continental Illinois while it arranged for the bank's balance sheet to be unwound, its assets and liabilities to be unbundled, and its responsibilities shared among other major banks in the system. During that period of crisis with a major bank--not a minor one, like BCCI, Barings or Johnson Matthey--in the US system, the Federal Reserve bank consciously kept interest rates lower for a while than it otherwise would have done. That was an important ingredient in re-instilling confidence in the system.
<P>
In Asia, a new potential banking crisis is looming. We all hope that Asia's economies can contain it because, if it spreads--in today's global markets there is no guarantee that it will not--the theory that we are discussing under the clause could conceivably become a major problem for the Government.
<P>
I was alarmed when the Paymaster General told us that the problem of exchange rates and interest rates was the result of the previous Government's mismanagement of the economy. He said that as we now had a Labour Government such conflicts would not occur again. The Government have the rosy-eyed view that their immense knowledge and understanding of the world was denied to the previous Government, and that initiatives such as the Bill will ensure that they do not have to face the problems that all Governments have to face.
<P>
It is likely that the type of crisis anticipated by the clause will occur. Unless the issue is addressed in the Minister's response to the amendment, there is a danger that such a crisis could spin out of control.
<P>
Finally, in proposing the amendment, Conservative Members have remained silent on the issue of whether such an order to the Monetary Policy Committee should be published. This morning, we have heard a great deal of baloney about the need for secrecy. Opposition Members have put forward a number of amendments that would increase ``transparency''--the golden word that we hear so often from the lips of Labour Members. When it is a matter of incorporating transparency, however, they run away from it because they say that it would involve market-sensitive information. Almost any information is market sensitive, however, and if that sensitivity were taken into account, even less information would be given than is currently the case. Statistics such as the RPI, GNP and unemployment figures would be delayed for much longer because they were market sensitive.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Pre-Budget statements.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Indeed.
<P>
Markets know what is sensitive; they anticipate it. They are capable of dealing with that. Hon. Members might recall the film ``Trading Places'', in which a speculator in orange juice prices gave another speculator a false copy of a Government report the day before it was due to come out, and engineered a killing on the markets. That is an amusing but telling story of how trying to keep the wraps on information can do far more damage to the efficient management of a market than being truly transparent.
<P>
It would be justifiable for the court to tell the Monetary Policy Committee that it has a problem with a particular bank and wishes the MPC to take into account the powers granted by the clause in setting rates, but to avoid spelling out the reasons why, as that would make the problems of the banking system even worse. We are considering matters that are at the heart of the banking system, and that relate to confidence in that system. The clause implies that the issue of how far to go public with the difficulties of a financial institution should be left to the discretion of members of the court. I regard that as an exception, not the rule, however. The fact that Conservative Members have said nothing about the publication of such an order should not be seen as a contradiction of our stance on earlier amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Member for Guildford has made an interesting speech. It would have been even more interesting if he had got his facts right.
<P>
	Much of his argument was based on the intervention by the Bank of England in the cases of BCCI or Barings. The Bank of England did not intervene in those cases, so at the outset of his case, the right hon. Gentleman shoots himself in the foot.
<P>
	The amendment is quite sinister, because it would override the Monetary Policy Committee's responsibility for meeting the Chancellor's inflation target. It is an attempt to scupper the whole purpose of the Bill and of the Government's economic policy. I know that my hon. Friends will not be taken in by the honeyed tones of the right hon. Gentleman and will vote against the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I promised first to give way to the hon. Member for Guildford.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We referred to BCCI and Barings in the context of the fact that the Bank of England avoided those crises, costing the taxpayer large sums of money. The hon. Lady will recall that I also referred to the case of Johnson Matthey, in which a lending was made by the Bank of England as lender of last resort.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman has ranged widely in trying to promote the amendment, but that does not necessarily make it any more valid. In seeking to introduce a power of override over the Monetary Policy Committee, he seeks to subvert the purpose of the committee's existence.
<P>
	The hon. Gentleman also fails to take into account the Bill's later provisions, which deal with issues such as banking supervision and the impact of systemic risk. He has failed to give us an example of a situation in which banking collapse would lead to the kind of systemic risk that would impact on monetary policy. However, I shall overlook that fact and return to the main point behind the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does the hon. Lady believe that the Monetary Policy Committee should blithely continue conducting its anti-inflationary policy in the face of a potential systemic risk to the whole banking system of this country? If there is a conflict between the conduct of monetary policy to pursue a low inflation target and the need to deal with a systemic banking risk, how does she envisage that that would be resolved without the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind that other things do not always remain equal. I know that he is trying hard to prove to us that he is going further into the Bill and the statement by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. He will be aware of the division of responsibilities that takes place under the memorandum of understanding between the Governor of the Bank of England, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That sets out clear responsibilities for the Bank of England, the Chancellor and the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
The Bank is responsibile for the stability of the monetary system--the financial system's infrastructure and, in particular, payment systems at home and abroad--and for taking a broad overview of the system as a whole. In exceptional circumstances, there are opportunities to undertake official financial operations, as there should be. The operation and effectiveness of the financial sector must be guaranteed in relation to international competitiveness. The situation that Opposition Members describe, in which there is a risk to the entire system, is explicitly covered by the memorandum of understanding.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford is wrong to seek to promote the amendment under the guise of affecting the role of the Monetary Policy Committee, because overall responsibility for Government economic policy remains with the Chancellor. It is his responsibility to guarantee the use of public finance. Indeed, if the risks of which the hon. Gentleman has spoken were on such a scale as to have an impact on monetary policy, the effect on the taxpayer of any rescue operation would be considerable.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We are getting to the heart of our concern, which is that if the setting of interest rates is removed as a means of trying to solve a sudden banking crisis, it is far more likely that the Chancellor will have to write a very large cheque to underwrite the system and that the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab, than that the market will be able to find its own solution.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The logical extension of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that interest rates should be used to deal with systemic risk. At the time of the stock exchange crash in 1987, Governments across the world used interest rate policy to try to stabilise the markets. In retrospect, however, it is not ovbious that that was the right response. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the United States in the early 1990s. I do not blame him for that: I have been in opposition and had the job of trying to support an amendment. Knowing his background, I cannot believe that he sees the amendment as an acceptable way of dealing with matters of monetary policy and systemic risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Economic Secretary adverted to the 1987 crash and said that, in retrospect, it is not self-evident that making interest rate reductions was the right course of action. That may or may not be the case. I am sorry to have missed the earlier part of my hon. Friend's speech, but he is worried that it might be impossible even to consider the weapon of interest rates because of the existence of the separate decision-making mechanism of the Monetary Policy Committee. We are anxious only that the Bank should not disarm itself and not be able to avail itself of all the weapons to meet systemic risk.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The voice of experience has been heard. The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has clarified the position, which allows me to be much clearer in my response. The memorandum of understanding makes it clear that, in exceptional circumstances, the Bank will be able to undertake financial operations. Those powers remain with the Bank, but the Bank may be required to get involved in operations that go way beyond routine money market activity--that should be rare indeed--or there may be a major threat to the stability of the financial system that could seriously disturb the United Kingdom economy.
<P>
The memorandum of understanding sets out clearly how such situations would be dealt with. Depending on the circumstances, the Chancellor would still have the option to refuse support. It must not be assumed that it will always be in the nation's best interest for taxpayers' money to be used to that end, but it is essential that Ministers be involved in decisions that may put taxpayers' money at risk.
<P>
That brings us back to the question that the hon. Member for Guildford seeks to address, but the amendment is not appropriate. I hope that the Opposition were not seeking to be sinister or to take away from the Monetary Policy Committee the overriding responsibility to meet the Chancellor's inflation target, but that is what the amendment would do. I therefore recommend that the Committee oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Economic Secretary has elucidated a willingness to ignore one possible scenario. She asked me to give examples and I mentioned the situation in the far east. It has been widely recognised for a number of years that the central bank in Japan has conciously followed a policy of allowing banks to rebuild their balance sheets through profits. As we mentioned earlier, they were able to borrow money short-term at low interest rates and lend it for longer periods at higher interest rates. That is a classic tactic of central banks if a banking system is threatened with collapse. However, people's behaviour changes in such situations, so the interest rate needed to discourage improvident borrowing need not be so high. It is not clear from the way in which the Monetary Policy Committee is set up that on its own it will be able to take those factors into account. The amendment would make it clear to the Committee, where there might otherwise be confusion, that in some circumstances it would have to take into account problems in the banking system over and above the other measurements and criteria on which it judges monetary policy.
<P>
The real reason for the Government's opposition to the amendment is that it would put a measure of power over interest rates firmly in the hands of the court and, therefore, in the hands of those technicians who understand the problems of the banking system. It would take power from the Monetary Policy Committee, with respect to which the Chancellor obviously feels increasingly comfortable about his prospects of establishing a body that will do what he wants. The threat of an element of power accruing elsewhere in some circumstances explains the Economic Secretary's hostility. That is regrettable and could in future mean, though I very much hope that it will not, that an interest rate response to a bank in trouble, despite being the correct response in the circumstances--it need not be, but it might be--would be denied, because of the rigidities of the Bill and the Government's inflexibility about admitting that they could have overlooked a circumstance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief as we have already had a good outing on what is a major issue. I confess that on this occasion the amendment factory has failed to get its product on to the production line: there is no amendment to speak to. That perhaps will enable me to range a little wider on the relationship between the court and the Monetary Policy Committee in the conduct of the relevant duties. I shall not again cover the matter of how those responsibilities are to be divided.
<P>
Clause 16(2) would impose on the court of directors of the Bank a duty that would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``include determining whether the Committee has collected the regional, sectoral and other information necessary for the purposes of formulating monetary policy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That objective is commendable. It is sensible to put the court in charge of determining whether the Monetary Policy Committee has set up the necessary structures. However, I have some blunt questions.
<P>
Does the Bill provide any assurance that, once the Monetary Policy Committee has collected the information--one of its major tasks--it should do anything about it, so that, for the sake of argument, the state of the coal mining industry in north Nottinghamshire or the fishing industry in Newlyn should be a factor to be borne in mind when determining matters?
<P>
Will the court of directors have responsibility for guiding the action of the Monetary Policy Committee other than the court's general duties that are set out earlier in the Bill? Can the court impose sanctions on the committee because of a failure to act on information that has been collected laboriously? For example, could it invalidate the MPC's findings if, having collected the information and weighed it carefully--as Government Departments have been known to do in the past, when invited to respond to consultation exercises--it had done nothing about it?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have been referring to legal issues because it is important to understand what would be a breach of duty of either the court or the committee. They are also issues of substance; we do not suggest that the MPC should not take seriously the issues of impact. Indeed, such issues are germane to the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford. I hope that the Economic Secretary can respond to my remarks now. If not, perhaps she may wish to reflect on them and respond later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Mr. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve bank in the United States, has made interesting speeches about information collection. Indeed, if he could be persuaded to become Governor of the Bank of England and to be locked into a contract for at least five years, I may support the Bill for the next five years. He gets policy matters right; he has a track record in the United States of delivering correct monetary and economic policy.
<P>
However, monetary policy is not a technical issue; it is a subjective, economic debating issue and Alan Greenspan happens to be a person whose views I share. He said that, when inflation levels are at the level that we have in this country, more information needs to be available to make monetary policy decisions, especially when trying to measure rates of inflation to the decimal place at levels of 2.5 per cent. to 2.8 per cent. A large quantity of information is needed to reach sensible decisions on the inflation rate.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Economic Secretary would explain the Government's policy regarding the Bank of England's information collection system. Although it has a branch structure throughout the country whereby some information is collected, will that information be adequate for it to pursue monetary policy decisions when it becomes independent? Do the Government regard the current information collection as adequate or will they abdicate the decision whether the information collection system is adequate to the Bank of England? Is it a matter to be decided by the Bank of England or one for the Government to determine?
<P>
Should the Government still be in charge of ensuring that the infrastructure of the Bank of England is correct and that, within that structure, the Bank should determine monetary policy; or are they abdicating even decisions on the infrastructure of the Bank of England to the Bank of England?
<P>
The issue is crucial. Independent central banks throughout the world can function properly only if they have adequate information sources. The Federal Reserve bank has a huge network throughout the United States of information-gathering points and systems, which enables it to make correct decisions. As we have seen in recent years under the chairmanship of Alan Greenspan, those have resulted in the right monetary policy. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary could reply to those points.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> May I answer the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton first? He made an interesting point, which relates directly to the powers that we are giving under the Bill to the court and, specifically, to the non-executive directors of the court. We want to ensure that the procedures of the Monetary Policy Committee are up to the task that its members will be undertaking and that they can perform their function. We shall have a lengthy debate on information gathering when we discuss the next clause, so I shall not enlarge on that now.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to draw to the Committee's attention to subsection (2), which matches the requirements under the rest of the clause. The court is being given the job of ensuring that the Monetary Policy Committee operates professionally and effectively, which is an important part of the whole structure of accountability. If the committee is behaving in such a way as to suggest that it is not conducting its discussions responsibly, the court must report on its activities.
<P>
I come to the points made by the hon. Member for Daventry. It should be obvious from the Monetary Policy Committee's minutes whether the relevant information has been taken into account. That transparency is to be welcomed. As to sanctions, the sanction is in the report itself. If a situation becomes so grave that the court is required to write a report on the Monetary Policy Committee's procedures, the committee would be foolish not to take it seriously. The non-executive directors of the Bank in particular would have lengthy discussions about the structure of the court and how to widen its representation to take into account other interests. It is important that they act as a check and counterbalance, and as a watchdog over those aspects of the committee relating not just to the determination of interest rates but to the mechanisms it uses in coming to its conclusions. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Economic Secretary has not fully understood my point. I am not saying that we should extract by force voluminous amounts of information from the banking sector. I am asking whether the branch network around the country should examine levels of retail sales and use its own resources to obtain information about the state of the economy. I do not want banks to be further burdened with supplying information to the Bank of England.
<P>
The establishment of a network to collect such information is a matter relating to the Bank of England's resources. Does the Economic Secretary believe that the Bank needs to expand its information collecting activities? If so, will that responsibility lie solely with the Bank or will the Government also retain some responsibility for developing the required infrastructure?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am sorry if I did not understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I thought that he was talking about the relationship between the information and the decision-making process. In fact, he makes an important and valid point.
<P>
The bank has agents across the country. Indeed, Airdrie Savings bank was visited by the Bank of England agent in Scotland a couple of weeks ago, which was a source of great pleasure to us and made the local paper, as Airdrie Savings bank is the only mutually owned bank in the country. I am well aware of the agents' talents.
<P>
The court may decide that the Monetary Policy Committee's proceedings do not adequately take into account the breadth of information available to it. The court must say if it does not believe that the Bank's systems are adequate, and then it is up to the Bank to ensure that the required action is taken.
<P>
The Bank will receive information not only from its own information gathering systems, but from other such systems that will be available to assist the Monetary Policy Committee in making its decisions, as we have already seen from the minutes of past committee meetings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I seek clarification on a point of information, which has a bearing on the Chief Secretary's helpful remarks about delegation and sub-delegation under clause 3. Under schedule 1, the court can delegate to a sub-committee and the quorum will be nine. We understand that, under clause 3(4), the sub-committee can delegate to two members of the court. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The sub-committee may delegate any of its functions to two or more of its members.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall wait for Ministers to correct me, but my reading is that the sub-committee can delegate to two individuals. Does the Economic Secretary think that monitoring sectoral and regional information by delegating the responsibility to two members of the court is adequate under the terms of clause 16?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be confusing the powers outlined in clause 16 with those outlined in clause 3. Clause 16 deals specifically with the functions of the court of directors. I do not know where the confusion arose. He suggests that a sub-committee may be made up of two of the court's members, but I do not see that that necessarily follows from the terms of clause 16. Perhaps he would like to elucidate even further.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I said that my point was one of information and clarification, so that we could unpack the Bill's meaning. It is clear from clause 3 that there are only certain functions that the court of directors can delegate. I accept that. The hon. Lady says that one of the functions that will not be delegated is that which relates to the court's powers and duties under clause 16. I take it that her reading of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of clause 3(2) precludes any exercise of the powers in clause 16. Is the hon. Lady clarifying that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Yes. We agree and we are now speaking the same language. I hope that that clarifies the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am still hugely concerned by the answers that the Economic Secretary gave to my questions. I am sorry to labour the point, but I am alarmed that her responses were about the Bank's previous role and about ensuring that the banking system is adequately regulated by the Bank's agents visiting banks throughout the country. I was talking about the Bank of England's new role in the conduct of monetary policy and ensuring that the Monetary Policy Committee has sufficient information to enable it to make decisions about interest rates and monetary policy.
<P>
The Committee will not be able to obtain that information just from the banking sector; it will also need information about labour shortages in certain regions, about the level of retail sales and about overheating in certain sectors of the economy. Independent central banks require such information if they are to conduct monetary policy adequately. Alan Greenspan made the point in his speech that independent central banks need an extensive network of information gathering that covers the whole country. The US Federal Reserve bank has such a network, and it enables it to make correct decisions on monetary policy.
<P>
Such information will be required by the Bank if it is to be handed responsibility for monetary policy. It was also required when the Chancellor and Ministers took the decisions. However, such a network is even more important if responsibility is to be handed to a super-quango.
<P>
I had expected the matter-of-fact answer that the Bank of England would extend its information gathering processes and that the court would ensure that that happened. It is critical for the success of an independent central bank that its information gathering resources are adequate. I would be interested to know the Government's policy on that, but I am alarmed by the fact that they may not have one. Perhaps even the advice they receive from civil servants has not taken that point into account. If so, the Bank of England will conduct its monetary policy in an amateur fashion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman misunderstands what the Bank of England's agents do. They gather specifically the type of information to which the hon. Gentleman referred. There are 101 different sources of information available. As the Minister responsible for the Office for National Statistics, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that information gathering in this country is very sophisticated. He may find it useful to visit agents of the Bank to see how they conduct their job--they do not operate as branch banks of the Bank of England. Much of their work concerns the gathering and sifting of information and they spend much time going round companies and various parts of their region acting as blotting paper--soaking up all the available information. Notwithstanding that, if the court decides that insufficient information is coming from agents, it can make that clear in its report. The Monetary Policy Committee is not constrained only by information that comes through the Bank's channels; it has access to information from 101 different channels of information, not least of which are the statistics gathered by the Office for National Statistics.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 7, line 11, after `be' insert `reasonably'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 40, in page 7, line 12, leave out `or expedient'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This important clause concerns the power of the Bank of England to obtain information from various market participators and institutions. The institution of government has several coercive powers, perhaps most notably taxation, but it can impose its will in other ways, many of which have costs of their own. The power to obtain information from organisations may seem innocuous but it imposes an equivalent burden of taxation on businesses and must therefore interest anyone concerned with competitiveness in the United Kingdom and internationally.
<P>
In giving the Bank of England powers to obtain information, we impose costs on the Bank because it must have the staff and the administration to process that information. That is a matter for the Bank. I am more concerned about the cost that the clause transfers to the productive sector of the economy--the practitioners and institutions. That is very important because the City is internationally competitive and we want to keep it so.
<P>
When I use the term ``City'', I am aware that the city of Edinburgh, as the hon. Lady knows, is also an important financial sector and must not be overlooked. One might therefore see the term as an aggregation of all the economic and financial operations of banks, insurance companies, and so on, in the country. The City is interested in the clause and I am sure wishes us to examine carefully the powers that we give to the Bank to obtain information. Those located overseas frequently comment that the City has several competitive advantages. We have the English language, a good location in terms of the time zone and, crucially, comparatively low costs.
<P>
In another debate, we shall examine banking supervision and the role of the Financial Services authority; here we are more narrowly concerned with what the Bank of England may obtain. The clause is too unqualified in its definition of that. Other of our amendments tackle that in different ways, but this amendment seeks to replace the term ``or expedient'' in subsection (1) with ``reasonably''.
<P>
The Government could not resist the concept of such information only being obtained reasonably. That is an important balance because, under the clause, the Bank of England can obtain any information that it specifies in the notice. It can obtain information not only if it is necessary but if it judges that it is expedient to do so. The clause should be amended so that the bank can obtain data only if it is necessary for the performance of its duties. I can see no objection to that.
<P>
I ask the Government to agree to insert or delete those various words to ensure that the Bank of England only acts reasonably so that it cannot go on expeditions to obtain information simply because it judges that it is expedient to do so. The Bank is, in several ways, fairly independent of the Treasury and the House, so what we decide to write into statute today will have long-term implications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> As I understand it, amendment No. 31 is wrong and I hope that it is not pursued. Although the right hon. Member for Wells wants to ensure that information is reasonably required, the amendment would mean that the notice would include information that is reasonably specified. What is reasonably specified is what accords with the law.
<P>
Under subsection (4), the information will relate to financial affairs as detailed under an order. So Parliament will consider what information should be included, and the relevant bodies will be consulted. That process should ensure that information is reasonably required. The amendment would put the word ``reasonably'' in the wrong place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am conscious of having none of the legal expertise of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) in either the English or the Scottish systems. A member of my family is something of a judicial review buff, but I shall not go into that. When I was a Minister--I can still recall those days--in the Department where I served there was a senior lawyer who has written an admirable book, which all officials and Ministers should read, called ``The Judge Over Your Shoulder''. Discussion of the word ``reasonably'' and of the concept of the Wednesbury rules formed part of the dialogue that I had with a member of my family, which constantly went along the lines of asking ``Am I being reasonable?'' in the legal sense of the word.
<P>
It is important that we introduce the concept of reasonableness somewhere. If, as the hon. Member for Stafford has perceptively commented, it would be introduced in the wrong place under the amendment, I should be more than delighted if the Economic Secretary were to undertake to put it in the right place and, above all, encourage the Bank to act within that spirit.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I support the amendment. Smaller banks in London are anxious that an unreasonable burden might be imposed on them under the clause. There is a danger that regulatory authorities will assume that, because banks are smaller, they need more regulation than larger banks and that the burden on them will be excessive. One of the successes of London as a financial centre is that we have attracted many banks of all sizes to it. Ultimately we cannot, through a system of supervision, override the power of the market.
<P>
Banks survive in London because they can pay the cost of being here by running their business profitably. The banking sector is much more likely to get wind of problems in a bank before anyone else does. Banks will find that the cost of their deposits goes up and that the cost of doing business here is prohibitively high. In developing a system of obtaining information and reports from banks, the essential role of the market in sorting the wheat from the chaff cannot be ignored. If the Government imagine that there is some perfect system of demanding information and reports that somehow will underwrite and avoid the difficulties of the past then, again, they are looking through rose-tinted glasses.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The word ``expedient'' should not, in my view, be in Acts of Parliament because it gives the Executive far too much power to request information that they do not require. It merely becomes more convenient for the Executive to obtain information via the private sector source than to obtain the information themselves. It may cost &#163;100 for an item of information but the Executive may decide that it is not expedient to incur a bill of &#163;100 so instead it imposes a &#163;1,000 bill on each bank in the country for obtaining the information. Hence the phrase ``expedient''. I do not see that the word is necessary because it adds nothing to the clause. It is a dangerous term that provides opportunities for unscrupulous people in the Bank who might not care about the burden that they impose on the private sector. The Government's acceptance of the amendment would be a quite reasonable gesture. I hope that my hon. Friends will press it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Before the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton rose, I intended being quite nice to Conservative Members because the hon. Member for Guildford made a good point. Banks, especially small ones, choose to come to this country and settle. I should like to assure hon. Members that the concept of reasonableness, and what is adequate, is at the heart of the Bill. Clause 17(4) specifically allows the Treasury to submit an order if we find ourselves in difficulty in this respect.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked a question about Wednesbury which gave me the great advantage of free legal advice from an Edinburgh lawyer--for perhaps the first time ever! Reasonableness is something that we take strongly into account. However, we cannot support the amendment. I say this with regret because I think that it may have the opposite effect to what Opposition Members intend.
<P>
It could limit the information required to what might be ``reasonably'' required rather than make the specification for information itself reasonable. This goes back to the earlier discussion on the adequacy of available information. There is no question of the clause allowing the seeking of information just for the sake of it, merely to make life difficult. If there is any question of reasonableness not being applied, there is the option of judicial review, as the hon. Member for Daventry said, but I am anxious to give the Committee my assurance on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> In the light of the hon. Member's reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32 in page 7, line 18, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) Provided that--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) no such notice as is mentioned in subsection (1) shall be issued to an undertaking with respect to the affairs of any individual customer of that undertaking; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) where such a notice is issued, the undertaking concerned, or such person as appears to the Bank to represent that undertaking, shall be afforded an opportunity to make representations to the Bank about the need to furnish the information specified in the notice.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Students of the small print of the Bank of England Act 1946 introduced by an earlier Labour Government will notice certain resonances in the wording of the amendment. Its purpose is to take from that Act a concept that is good, and to suggest that it be embodied here--or at least to test why it should not be.
<P>
The aim is to ensure that when the Bank requests information, it does not flow through to the individual bank and beyond that to its customers. This seems to have been conceived--
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
