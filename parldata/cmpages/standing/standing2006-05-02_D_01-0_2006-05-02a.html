of Housing Corporation to delegate functions

etc.</div><a name="06050216000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

proposed, </i>That the clause stand part ofthe

Bill.</div><a name="06050216000012"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000182"></a>The

Chairman:</b> I propose to allow reasonably wide-ranging

debate on the Bill at this point, but I stress that it is not an

opportunity to talk generally about the Housing

Corporation.</div><a name="06050216000013"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000183"></a>Yvette

Cooper:</b> Clause 1 sets out the purpose of this relatively

short Bill. We discussed many issues concerning the clause on Second

Reading, but nevertheless it is worth rehearsing some of the key points

and details today.</div>

<a name="06050216000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause has four subsections

that aim to address the technical difficulties that we face as a result

of an omission in the legislation governing the powers of the Housing

Corporation. The first subsection will give the corporation an express

power to delegate the exercise of its functions to individual members

of the board, sub-committees, committees and employees.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div><a name="06050216000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Housing Corporation was

created, it was common for public bodies and non-departmental public

bodies not to be given an explicit power of delegation. At that time,

powers of delegation were more readily taken to be implied. Since then,

the majority of bodies set up without explicit powers have been wound

up or have had their legislation modernised to confer such

powers.</div><a name="06050216000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050216000184"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I understand the

Minister, but I do not see what practical difference it will make to

give delegating power to the Housing Corporation. At the moment, all

that happens is that the board is required to make the decision. An

officer prepares the report and it is presented to the board. Under the

new proposals, the officer will prepare the report, but it will not

need to go to the board. In practical terms, that will remove a

safeguard. As far as I can see, such provision does not do anything to

improve the efficiency of the Housing

Corporation.</div><a name="06050216000017"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000185"></a>Yvette

Cooper:</b> Practically, the measure will allow the Housing

Corporation to operate in exactly the same way as a series of other

NDPBs&#151;English Partnerships, English Heritage, the Commission for

Healthcare Audit and Inspection and the Commission for Social Care

Inspection. A series of bodies have that kind of power nowadays. Such

power will allow the board to take responsibility for deciding which

decisions it needs to scrutinise properly, which issues it needs to

debate and discuss, where it can add the greatest value to the running

of the organisation and which decisions could be delegated far more

effectively to officers or sub-committees. It allows the board to have

the kind of flexibility that many organisations already have, and it

was also presumed that the Housing Corporation already had that

power.</div> <a name="06050216000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout the

Housing Corporation&#146;s history it has been clear that the

corporation and the Department, as well as housing associations and

lenders, thought that the corporation had an implied power. That was

clear not only in discussion of previous legislation enacted before

1997, but in the most recent debates on the Housing Act 2003. It was

clear that the corporation, the Department and all the lenders thought

that the implied power was in

place.</div><a name="06050216000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill simply

restores to the Housing Corporation and all the stakeholders who need

to engage with it something that everyone had previously thought

already applied. It is therefore not practical to expect the board to

operate in a different way from similar bodies. This is about simply

giving it a sensible administrative basis on which to

work.</div><a name="06050216000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050216000186"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Peter Kilfoyle</b> (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab): I understand

perfectly that the Bill is regularising an irregular situation.

However, my experience of delegating powers at a local level causes me

concern&#151;under a Lib Dem council, it cost the city of Liverpool

hundreds of millions of pounds. Although such an approach might be

efficient on one level, it can be very costly to the parent

organisation.</div><a name="06050216000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

as diligent as many of my colleagues and I was not present on Second

Reading, but it appears 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>from clause 1(3) that no matter what has been done in the name of the

Housing Corporation, the Bill gives it legality and authenticity. The

Bill seems extremely vague about what it covers. Can the Minister

enlighten me? I would hate to think that in retrospectively approving

what has been happening for the past20 years, we were

regularising something that should be looked at in a different

way.</div>

<a name="06050216000022"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000187"></a>Yvette

Cooper:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I asked

officials the same question during our detailed discussions about the

need for the Bill and about its drafting. Its purpose is to regularise

decisions that have been taken on the presumption that an implied power

existed when it did not do so, according to our most recent legal

advice.</div><a name="06050216000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

important to ensure that we can address the many decisions that have

been taken previously and not leave housing associations, the

corporation and lenders in a state of limbo about previous decisions

that have been taken. It is important to put the previous decisions on

a particular footing; the issue is the uncertainty that might arise and

the fear that previous decisions might be challenged. Even when people

do not believe that there is a fundamental basis on which they can be

challenged, the uncertainty could cause all kinds of problems for

housing associations and lenders in the future, as many of the

decisions taken in the past still have ongoing consequences today in

terms of investment in stock, new homes and so

on.</div><a name="06050216000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon. Friend

said, it is important to ensure that this is not simply about giving

authority to any and every previous decision even should that

includea fraudulent decision, for example. That is why

subsection (3) refers to decisions

being</div><a name="06050216000154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;evidenced by a

document duly executed under its seal.&#148;</div>

<a name="06050216000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the lawyers&#146; response on

how to ensure that the provisions would cover decisions that were taken

appropriately and duly executed; in other words, decisions that were

taken on an appropriate basis according to the Housing

Corporation&#146;s

procedures.</div><a name="06050216000026"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000188"></a>Mr.

Kilfoyle:</b> The Minister has reassured me that no one who

has done something palpably wrong will be immune from the appropriate

strictures. May I ask her a further question, however? What

specifically prompted the introduction of the Bill at this time? Is a

specific case pending or has the Bill been dusted down as a sort of

plan 54(b) to fill up a bit of parliamentary

time?</div><a name="06050216000027"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000189"></a>Yvette

Cooper:</b> My hon. Friend asks an important question.

Originally, the issue was raised with the Department just before

Christmas, as a result of legal advice received by the Housing

Corporation. Like the Department, the corporation had previously

understood that the implied power existed. However, I understand that

advice sought as part of routine training raised questions about

whether there was such a power. As a result, the Housing Corporation

sought further, detailed legal advice, including leading

counsels&#146; advice, to clarify the position.</div>

<a name="06050216000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The advice was that such power

could not be implied from the existing statute. The Housing Corporation

therefore changed its procedures so that it would be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 6</div>able to take all further decisions at board level, rather than

delegating them, and also raised with the Department the need to

address the previous decisions. As the time of the House is extremely

important and there are many other issues to debate, we considered

whether those previous decisions could be addressed in ways other than

primary legislation. After extensive discussions with various

stakeholders, however, we eventually concluded that primary legislation

was the only way to regularise the

situation.</div>

<a name="06050216000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050216000190"></a><b class="B">Angela

Eagle</b> (Wallasey) (Lab): The issue that we are discussing

is very technical. On my reading of things, everybody assumed that the

power was there until somebody suddenly discovered that it was not, the

penny dropped and leading counsel said, &#147;Oops&#148;. What

would the situation have been if that small technical correction had

not been brought to us? What would Parliament be risking if what

appears to be a technical piece of work is not put into effect? If we

were informed about those issues, we might have more of an idea of what

has been going on, beyond a lawyer with a light bulb above his head

suddenly realising that something that he should have seen long ago was

staring him in the

face.</div><a name="06050216000030"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000191"></a>Yvette

Cooper:</b> My hon. Friend raises an important point that we

discussed on Second Reading. The Housing Corporation was assumed to

have powers to take at officer level or through sub-committees

decisions on a series of things. Such things might have included the

registration of housing associations, what are referred to as section 9

decisions, which deal with the transfer of assets from one housing

association to another, and issues around borrowing against

assets.</div> <a name="06050216000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, such

decisions have important implications for the future of social housing,

new build and the levels at which housing associations can borrow.

Although legal advice assured us that, through provisions in the Land

Registration Act 2002, housing associations could continue to borrow

against their assets, regard their homes, which might have been

transferred from another housing association, as their own and make

decisions about the future on that basis, it was also clear that there

remained some legal uncertainty around those

decisions&#151;particularly the decisions taken by the Housing

Corporation.</div> <a name="06050216000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

situation raised questions about decisions that could have important

long-term impacts for the future of social housing. For example, the

rate at which housing associations can borrow against their assets, the

draw-down of loans and the confidence that lenders might have in

individual housing associations, or in social housing more broadly,

might all be affected in the long term. Maintaining confidence in the

social housing sector in those long-term decisions was a serious issue

for us. We want this to be an area in which lenders feel they can

continue to invest and in which tenants, who depend on social housing,

can feel assured of the financial viability of their organisations.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000192"></a>Mr.

Bone:</b> While I understand that argument going forward, I do

not understand the argument about retrospection. Only recently, the

Housing Corporation 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div>was proposing a general consent under section 9 to cover this particular

problem, so I am unsure why are we going down the route of

retrospective legislation. If we did not pass this legislation, I do

not think that anything that has been done in the past would be

challenged. There is no indication that it has been.</div>

<a name="06050216000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand it, the issue

arose only becauseof an in-house seminar run by the Housing

Corporation&#151;no challenge exists. I cannot believe that lenders

would suddenly withdraw support after years of profitable business. I

have great reservations about this retrospective

legislation.</div>

<a name="06050216000035"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000193"></a>Yvette

Cooper:</b> We had extensive discussions with lenders. They

were extremely concerned that without this legislation, in order to

regularise the position, decisions might be challenged in the courts.

In addition, they were worried that some lenders might decide to

withdraw their confidence from the sector, and that that could have a

domino effect on other lenders. Financial institutions have about

&#163;27 billion-worth of investments in the nation&#146;s housing

associations. When those financial institutions raise concerns that

without this kind of legislation the investment might not be secure,

legislators and Ministers take them seriously.</div>

<a name="06050216000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are issues about

confidence in the sector. Confidence matters when it comes to being

able to secure investment in housing stock and in social housing for

the future. That is why we take this matter seriously and why we think

it is simply not worth the risk to such an important sector to ignore

those lenders&#146; concerns. We should take them seriously and

ensure that proper certainty is in place and that there is a proper

basis on which the Housing Corporation can take decisions in the future

and housing associations and lenders can rely on the decisions that

were taken in the past. Any uncertainty about those previous decisions

should not be allowed to jeopardise an extremely important sector for

the more than 2 million tenants who live in social housing.</div>

<a name="06050216000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why we take the matter

extremely seriously. Nobody can predict the precise consequences when

financial institutions and lending decisions are involved. However, the

concerns raised by lenders were sufficiently serious for us to need to

respond according to this timetable in order to ensure that all that

uncertainty was addressed and everyone could feel confident in previous

decisions.</div> <a name="06050216000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection

(1) is a standard delegation provision for bodies carrying out

functions similar to those of the corporation. It brings the powers of

the corporation into line with other such bodies and allows for

administrative efficiency. Given the number of statutory decisions that

it must take on a day-to-day basis, it is not practical for all of them

to be taken by the board

itself.</div><a name="06050216000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2)

gives the corporation and Housing for Wales a retrospective power of

delegation to anyof its members, committees, sub-committees

or employees, to ensure that the statutory decisions are not invalid by

reason of being delegated by the board on the presumption that it had

an implied power todo so.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div><a name="06050216000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, the hon.

Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) asked whether a general consent

would suffice, rather than the type of legislation that is proposed.

There are two reasons why that is not possible. First, there is a

series of other decisions, such as registration of registered social

landlords, that would not be covered, and secondly, the uncertainty

around section 9 consents would not be fully addressed by such an

approach. That could have serious consequences for individual RSLs and

for the Government&#146;s social housing

programme.</div><a name="06050216000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,

we have examined not just general retrospective consents but other

routes that might exist for resolving that uncertainty, and we have

concluded that our proposal is the only one that will work.

Retrospective effect is not intended to detract from the rights of any

parties, nor to create uncertainty&#151;the usual concerns that are

raised in relation to it. Indeed, in the present case, retrospective

effect is necessary to protect such rights, and to restore what was

thought to be the status

quo.</div><a name="06050216000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3)

operates to validate past decisions if they were done or evidenced by a

document duly executed under the seal of the corporation or of Housing

for Wales. Subsection (4) provides that fixing of a seal is witnessed

validly if it was witnessed by any member or employee of the

corporation or Housing for Wales in the period before enactment of the

Bill. The two subsections draw a firm line under past decisions of the

corporation that were duly executed under seal and that were properly

authenticated by a member or employee of the corporation. Their aim is

to remove any doubt about the validity of such decisions, so that third

parties will be able to assume the validity of any decision properly

executed by the corporation under

seal.</div><a name="06050216000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of

the clause is relatively clear; it is a relatively technical provision,

but the consequences of not introducing it would be significant and

wide-ranging.</div>

<a name="06050216000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050216000194"></a><b class="B">Michael

Gove</b> (Surrey Heath) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve under

your chairmanship this afternoon,Mr. Benton. I thank the

Minister for making her case with her customary authority and clarity

and I empathise with her, as she is clearly suffering from a seasonal

malady, as are so many of us at this timeof

year.</div><a name="06050216000045"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000196"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. I confess that

I was, as we say in Aberdeen, &#147;thick with the cold&#148;

during our debate on Second Reading on Tuesday, so it is my fault that

the Minister is infected&#151;I got too close to her in every sense,

and those people who object to the Opposition being at one with the

Government on the Bill may read more into our relationship from the

fact that the Minister has contracted the cold as well. However, I

suspect that there were enough germs, or alien elements, in the House

of Commons to ensure that she was infected by some other

route.</div><a name="06050216000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

correctly observes that the four subsections of clause 1 are all

intimately related. The 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 9</div>first two are the most important: subsection (1)

creates a new delegated power, and subsection (2) gives it

retrospective effect. Subsections (3) and (4) are principally ways of

explaining how subsection (2) should operate, and in that respect are

even more

technical.</div><a name="06050216000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before

allowing the Bill to pass its Committee stage, there are a couple of

questions that we on the Opposition side feel are important to raise.

As I emphasised when I began my remarks, and as anyone who read our

contribution to the Second Reading debate will know, we are as keen as

the Government to ensure that the legislation proceeds smoothly to the

statute book. However, the parliamentary process affords the

opportunity of asking questions and of scrutinising one or two of the

statements made by the Government in support of the legislation, and

certain of those statements merit scrutiny. I pay tribute to my hon.

Friend the Member for Wellingborough and to all my other colleagues who

spoke on Second Reading&#151;they did a sterling job of subjecting

the legislation to the necessary

scrutiny.</div><a name="06050216000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have three

broad questions to ask about the legislation this afternoon. For the

ease of the Minister and her officials, they are questions A, B and C.

The A question is the audit question, the B question is the

&#147;but&#148; question and the C question is the consequences

question. I shall ask the audit question first. The Minister said that

the powers she hoped to vest in the Housing Corporation were powers

that had been vested in a majority of non-departmental public bodies

and that some of those non-departmental public bodies had been wound

up. Some non-departmental public bodies that did not have those powers

in the past now have them as a result of modernisation. However, I

stress that she used the word &#147;majority&#148;, rather than

&#147;all&#148;.</div>

<a name="06050216000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the Second Reading

debate, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) asked

the Government whether they would do an audit of all non-departmental

public bodies in order to ensure that we did not end up having to

introduce primary legislation for all those NDPBs that might find

themselves in the same position as the Housing Corporation. The House

and the public deserve to be reassured that there has been a

comprehensive audit of all NDPBs and that we will not see Bills

introduced for other NDPBs because the same lacunae exist in their

constitutions that have been exposed in the constitution of the Housing

Corporation.</div><a name="06050216000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

second question is the &#147;but&#148; question, which relates to

our willingness to support the legislation with a caveat that we enter

along the way. On Second Reading, we explained that we supported the

legislation, primarily because without it, there would be an additional

element of risk in the financial markets. At the moment, the section 9

consents referred to by the Minister mean that all private sector

lenders that have given money to housing associations have the absolute

knowledge that that lending is secured. That means that if a housing

association goes belly up, they have the first call on its assets. As a

result, they can lend money to housing associations at below the market

rate. As a result of the way in which the law was presumed to have

operated, a private-public partnership allowed social tenants access to



<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>private finance at truly competitive rates. It is a

very good example of compassionate conservatism in action, and one that

we wish to see supported.</div>

<a name="06050216000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Council of Mortgage Lenders

has been adamant that without this legislation, there would be an

element of risk in the markets that would price the debt at a higher

rate than currently, which would mean one of two things. Either social

tenants would pay more, or the rest of us would be taxed more in order

to provide a necessary public service. For reasons of prudence&#151;a

word dear to the hearts of those in my party&#151;it is vital that

the legislation is passed.</div>

<a name="06050216000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, even though we accept

that the Bill must be passed because of the need to give retrospective

effect to the section 9 consents, there is still a question mark over

some of the decisions that the Housing Corporation may have taken in

the past. We accept that the legislation is necessary in order to give

retrospective effect to section 9 consents, but I feel, as I suspect

that my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough does, that some of

the other decisions to which we are being asked to give retrospective

effect have been insufficiently clearly spelled out by the Minister and

her Department.</div> <a name="06050216000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister talks about decisions referring to the registration of

associations and one or two other decisions that have been taken by the

Housing Corporation in the past. It would be helpful if she made clear

what those decisions were and why they required the same legal

underpinning as the section 9 consents. It would also be helpful if the

legal advice that counsel gave to her Department and the Housing

Corporation were put in the public domain. We accept the overwhelming

need for the legislation, but we believe that the process of scrutiny

has exposed some areas where more information is required.</div>

<a name="06050216000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final question is the

consequences question.</div>

<a name="06050216000056"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000197"></a>Mr.

Kilfoyle:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving

way before he goes on to his final question. I shall pass over the

oxymoronic phrase &#147;compassionate conservatism&#148;. Before

the hon. Gentleman deals with the consequences, will he explain what he

means by an audit of NDPBs in relation to delegated powers? Is he

suggesting that all of those bodies should have delegated powers? I am

not quite clear about

that.</div><a name="06050216000158"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

pm</div><a name="06050216000057"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000198"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me the

opportunity to return briefly to this issue, which is of great

importance. I stress that it was first raised in the House by the hon.

Member for Carshalton and Wallington. He made a good point, which I am

more than happy to endorse. The hon. Gentleman pointed out that the

Housing Corporation was presumed to have a power, but in fact lacked

it. We are now legislating to give it a power that everyone assumed

that it had. Fair enough, we all say. But it occurred to the hon.

Gentleman that there might be other NDPBs that everyone assumed had

this power but which, in effect, were merrily making decisions without

the required appropriate legislative

cover.</div><a name="06050216000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

said that the majority of NDPBs that were set up when such powers were

not granted had either been wound up or modernised, and we are 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div>satisfied that the majority of cases have been

reviewed. However, majority is not the same as totality. The

implication of her words is that there may be some NDPBs that everyone

believes should have the right to delegate powers to committees or

officers, but that are, in fact, operating in a legal black hole. We

want to ensure that a proper audit of every NDPB is undertaken in order

to ensure that in a few weeks or months or in a year&#146;s time we

do not need another piece of primary legislation to tidy

up.</div><a name="06050216000059"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000199"></a>Mr.

Kilfoyle:</b> I understand perfectly that the matter was

raised initially by the Liberal Democrats, but is the hon. Gentleman

suggesting that there ought to be a trawl through the NDPBs to

determine where there are gaps? Has he considered the difficulties and

cost of doing

that?</div><a name="06050216000060"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000200"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> We have considered the difficulties and cost of not

doing that. We have to legislate at this point because an element of

risk has been introduced into the lending process, which, unless it is

addressed, could lead directly to negative consequences for social

housing tenants, whom the hon. Gentleman and I wish to be in as secure

a position as possible. If other NDPBs are spending public money and

taking decisions in the public interest, but do not have the legal

authority to take such decisions, despite the fact that everyone

assumes that they have such powers, we could be in the position not

just of having to legislate but of having to bail out organisations

that have been operating in legal

limbo.</div><a name="06050216000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask that some

of the civil servants in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister use

some of the time and the resources that we have given them to ensure

that the same situation does not occur again in that Department or any

other.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000201"></a>Mr.

Kilfoyle:</b> I would have thought that the onus would be on

the Cabinet Office rather than the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister

to organise a trawl through public bodies. However, my question

remains. The hon. Gentleman pointed out the cost of not doing such a

trawl, but has he considered the cost and the complications of doing

one? Is he aware of how many NDPBs might fall foul of his imagined

problem with the law somewhere down the

line?</div><a name="06050216000063"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000202"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> The burden of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is

that, because of the administrative cost, we should allow various

organisations to operate outside the rule of law. As a matter of

philosophical principle, we on this side of the Committee are unhappy

with that. We want to ensure that organisations use their powers within

the scope of the rule of

law.</div><a name="06050216000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that

many of the areas that we are talking about are administrative. I

suspect, but do not know. The Government have a responsibility to

ensure that public money is spent in line with the rule of law, and

that decisions are delegated to the appropriate level and taken in line

with the rule of law. That responsibility falls on the

Government&#146;s shoulders, not on ours. The Minister stressed in

her speech that the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div>majority of bodies likely to be affected had changed

their constitution or been wound up. I trust her word absolutely. If

she knows that a majority of bodies are out of the woods, that implies

that a minority&#151;presumably a small one&#151;are not. As the

Minister can already state with confidence that the majority are out of

the woods, much of the work has, by implication, been

done.</div><a name="06050216000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050216000203"></a><b class="B">Dr.

Phyllis Starkey</b> (Milton Keynes, South-West) (Lab): With

the lapse of time, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s precise words have

become slightly muddled up in my mind, but I believe that he said he

had made an assessment of the cost and effect of not undertaking the

audit. Can he enlighten us as to what that estimate of cost and effect

was?</div><a name="06050216000066"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000204"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> As I explained in my response to the hon. Member for

Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), that audit has&#151;by any

reasonable inference from the Minister&#146;s words&#151;already

taken place. If the Minister can state with confidence that a majority

of non-departmental public bodies that are in a similar position to the

Housing Corporation have either been wound up or had their constitution

modernised, by definition she must have made an assessment of how many

non-departmental public bodies are affected and concluded that a

majority of them are not affected. The question is therefore more

properly put to the Minister.</div>

<a name="06050216000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the hon. Member for

Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), in her function as chair of a

Select Committee, takes her responsibilities of scrutinising the

Executive seriously, but it is for the Executive, not the Opposition,

to say how many bodies are likely to survive in their un-modernised,

still operational state, and are therefore likely to require the form

of scrutiny that we are

discussing.</div><a name="06050216000068"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000205"></a>Dr.

Starkey:</b> I put the question to the hon. Gentleman because

he asserted that he had estimated the cost and effect of not carrying

out the audit. I simply ask him to share the results of his assessment

with us. What is the cost and effect of not carrying out the audit,

which he says he has

measured?</div><a name="06050216000069"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000206"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> The hon. Lady is labouring under a misapprehension

and is drawing the wrong inference from my

words.</div><a name="06050216000070"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000207"></a>Dr.

Starkey:</b> Well, you should have been

clearer.</div><a name="06050216000071"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000208"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> I have sought to be crystal clear on the subject. My

point is that we have seen the consequences of failing to do that

proper audit work in one particular area. I am not making a

party-political point because, as the hon. Lady knows, the original

form of the legislation was passed under a Conservative Government, but

we know that the consequence of waiting until now to put the matter

right is introducing an element of risk into the lending

market.</div> <a name="06050216000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know

what the consequences would be in a variety of other areas, but I can

prudently give this estimate. If one considers the amount of time that

it is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div>likely to take the Minister&#146;s civil servants and others

to look at the bodies that might be affected, if one

weighs in the balance the consequences of not conducting the audit and

if, in even one case, a situation similar to the one that we are

discussing were likely, any normal person would conclude that it was

worth while conducting the rest of that audit, rather than risking

undergoing the process again. I talked about compassionate

Conservatism, but that seems an eminently common-sense Conservative

point of view.</div><a name="06050216000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

repeat for clarity that the evidence is before us. The Minister said

that a majority of bodies were affected. She asks the Opposition a

series of questions, but I noted that when the Minister mentioned that

a majority of bodies were affected, the hon. Member for Milton Keynes,

South-West, did not ask a question of the Executive&#151;a rare lapse

from the otherwise Olympian standards that she sets herself in the

scrutiny

business.</div><a name="06050216000074"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000209"></a>Angela

Eagle:</b> If the worst scenario came about and other

non-departmental public bodies had such lacunae in their rules, we

would have to legislate once again to put things right, so the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s point about our not being bothered with legislation

in future does not hold water. We would avoid further uncertainty

arising if there were such a flawed NDPB, if we want to put it that

way; but actually Parliament would still have to legislate to put right

any other such flaws that were

discovered.</div><a name="06050216000075"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000210"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> I have no wish to act as a judge assessing the

hierarchy of interventions, but the hon. Lady makes an even better

point than the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West did. It is

quite right that legislation would be required in those circumstances,

but it would be better if we introduced one measure that could cover

all the relevant bodies, rather than a succession of piecemeal Bills.

It would be appropriate if we could ensure in each of the particular

areas where each of the NDPBs operate that we are capable of

legislating in such a way as to ensure that the next time such

functions are affected by legislation, we can take into account any

lacunae that have been uncovered, rather than leaving that sine die and

then waiting until we are surprised, as we have been with this

particular discovery. It would be better to be in a position of

knowledge than one of

ignorance.</div><a name="06050216000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">This would

be prudent housekeeping on the part of the Government, although the

hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) may prefer to remain in a

position of ignorance, and to be surprised whenever a lawyer&#151;a

barrister, for instance&#151;reminds her or this House of a mistake

that we have made. I repeat for the benefit of all those who have

intervened that this prudent housekeeping has already, by clear

implication, been undertaken by the

Department.</div>

<a name="06050216000077"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000211"></a>Angela

Eagle:</b> As you know, Mr. Benton, I am not in favour of

anyone staying in a position of ignorance at all. The important thing

about this situation is that nobody knew that there was any problem

until one lawyer discovered a flaw in another lawyer&#146;s work. The

problem of uncertainty did not arise until a seminar took place at the

Housing Corporation. Therefore, the issue is not to do with waiting to

see if there are more lacunae in the law, because we in Standing

Committees 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div>know&#151;even if this is not known anywhere else&#151;that lawyers

are never perfect in their framing of legislation, which is why we have

our job to do here.</div>

<a name="06050216000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to take a look at the

matter, but in a reasonable way, and we do not need to start a load of

hares running, so does the hon. Gentleman not agree with me about

possible flawed legislation in all NDPBs, many of which do a great

number of crucial things, and all of which may be thrown into

uncertainty if

he&#151;</div><a name="06050216000079"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000212"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. That is a lengthy

intervention.</div><a name="06050216000080"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000213"></a>Angela

Eagle:</b> It is a long sentence, but perhaps the hon.

Gentleman will address my

point.</div><a name="06050216000081"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000214"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman responds to that

intervention, I should point out that although I said at the beginning

of the sitting that I would allowa wide-ranging debate, we

are moving away slightlyfrom the Housing Corporation, so I

must ask the Committee to come back to

it.</div><a name="06050216000082"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000215"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I am pleased by your ruling

on this matter, but I am also delighted to be able to respond to the

point that the hon. Member for Wallasey is making. Behind her

intervention and those of the hon. Members for Liverpool, Walton and

for Milton Keynes, South-West lies a reluctance to see institutions

governed by the rule of law, public money spent as wisely as possible

and civil servants do what they are paid to do&#151;scrutinise the

effective working of government. Given that the Minister herself

emphasised that a majority of NDPBs were not in danger, we already knew

that only a minority are affected and that part of the work of

scrutinising the bodies has been

undertaken.</div><a name="06050216000083"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000216"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. In case I did not make this clear to the

hon. Gentleman, let me state again that I would like the Committee to

return to the subject of the Housing Corporation and the

clauses.</div><a name="06050216000084"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000217"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> Thank you very much, Mr.

Benton.</div><a name="06050216000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having talked

about the &#147;but&#148; question, I want to turn to the

consequences question, which touches on one of the points made by the

hon. Member for Wallasey. The Government have made it clear that they

intend to ensure that the Housing Corporation&#146;s functions are

reviewed, and the potential merger of the Housing Corporation with

English Partnerships has been widely slated and discussed. Should that

merger take place, primary legislation would be required. As my hon.

Friend the Member for Wellingborough pointed out on Second Reading, a

significant and important measure governing the future working of the

Housing Corporation might come before us shortly. It would be helpful

if the Minister could explain what the nature of that legislation might

be, what impact the debate we are currently having will have on it and

what further thoughts the Government have about modernising the

constitution of the Housing Corporation in the light of this already

publicly acknowledged change&#151;or potential change&#151;to the

way in which it works.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div><a name="06050216000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mention that point because I

am sensitive to the points made by the hon. Member for Wallasey, who

pointed out that if we expose flaws in other NDPBs, we may need to

legislate. It may be the case that the flaws that we uncover will be

capable within a few months of being addressed in legislation drafted

in the relevant Department. However, it may well also be the case that

an audit puts all our minds at rest because there is nothing to worry

about. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than knowing that this

Minister and every other Minister could sleep easily at night knowing

that the non-departmental public bodies for which they are

parliamentarily accountable were operating within the rule of law.

Ensuring that the rule of law governs the functions of an important

non-departmental public body is the burden of the Bill. If the Minister

can reply to those three points with her usual clarity, brevity and

authority, Conservative Members will be

satisfied.</div><a name="06050216000159"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000218"></a>Mr.

Kilfoyle:</b> I am usually sceptical about anything that is

retrospective, most particularly the law, and notwithstanding the

twaddle spoken by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove),

Labour is a party of the law and of value for money. We do not need

lessons or side swipes from him on those matters.

</div><a name="06050216000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must comment on the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s attempt to divert the discussion into a

cul-de-sac with nonsense about a trawl through all of the NDPBs. Most

of them, by his own admission, were set up inadequately by the previous

Conservative Administration. It is the Labour party in government that

has had to try put those wrongs to right. His point was entirely

spurious.</div><a name="06050216000089"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000219"></a>Mr.

Bone:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the original

legislation was set up correctly and that Parliament, at the time,

expected the board to approve the decisions? It was not the original

legislation that was wrong, and it was only the subsequent action by

the Housing Corporation in not seeking board approval that changed the

position.</div><a name="06050216000090"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000220"></a>Mr.

Kilfoyle:</b> That goes to show how the previous

Administration had become divorced from the day-to-day realities of

running an organisation, particularly when it was handling large

amounts of public money and wanted to do it efficiently. It could

certainly be argued that both sides were remiss, but I know which was

more remiss given the legislation as it was originally drawn

up.</div><a name="06050216000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, but not

least, the trawl proposed by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath is a fine

thing to come from the party that goes around the country trumpeting

that we should remove bureaucracy, red tape and the sort of actions

that are inhibiting the private and public sectors. He wants to create

a trawl for non-existent problems. If the problems exist, they will be

dealt with by the Government. However, that is a separate situation

from creating a bonanza for lawyers and&#151;as a journalist, he will

know about this&#151;a non-existent story that the Conservatives can

trumpet from the front pages.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div><a name="06050216000092"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000221"></a>Michael

Gove:</b> I remind the hon. Gentleman, who was busy on the day

that we were debating these matters on Second Reading, that the

Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister,

said:</div><a name="06050216000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have

studied the situation, and we are not aware of any other bodies for

which such retrospective legislation is

required.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 25 April 2006; Vol.

445, c. 534.]</div><a name="06050216000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Under-Secretary said that he was not aware ofany other bodies

having conducted, by implication,a review. Today, the

Minister now present said that a majority of bodies were in the clear.

There is a difference between none and a minority, and I was

specifically addressing an inconsistency in the Government&#146;s

position. By implication, the Minister has made it clear that a survey

or an audit has been carried out, but the problem is that it has not

been

effective.</div><a name="06050216000094"></a>

Starkey:</b> Does my hon. Friend not agree that the

implication of what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath was suggesting was

that we should leave the Housing Corporation in an irregular situation

while we trawl around each NDPB in case it might be in the same

position, before we formulate another measure covering everybody? In

the meantime, the current situation would

continue.</div><a name="06050216000096"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000224"></a>Mr.

Kilfoyle:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because she

reminds me that many on the Opposition Benches have that wild and

wide-eyed attitude whereby they are always looking for problems that do

not exist. When problems do not exist, they are often prepared to

invent them to preoccupy Ministers who have got better things to do

with their time, as has happened with this

Bill.</div><a name="06050216000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06050216000225"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Dan Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): It is indeed a

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. I am somewhat

bemused by the direction that our discussions have taken, but I take it

that that is down to the time pressure under which we are

operating.</div><a name="06050216000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

address my remarks primarily to subsections (1) and (2). Subsection (1)

gives the board of the Housing Corporation the power to delegate

decision making to appropriate levels, which seems sensible. The

capacity to delegate some decisions to committees, officers or

employees of organisations is common, and it is an effective way of

carrying out business. Local authorities are a prime example. I believe

that they were mentioned on Second Reading, which I was unable to

attend as I was in Committee scrutinisingthe Commons Bill, to

which I had tabled several amendments.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div><a name="06050216000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have always supported the

principle of devolving power to the lowest level possible. The

delegation of powers within the Housing Corporation will facilitate

greater opportunities for its officers and employees to engage in

debate with people throughout the country, so that not everything will

have to return to the national body for discussion. As such delegation

has been in practice in the organisation for several years, although it

might have been outside the letter of the previous legislation, it

seems sensible that such powers be granted. Subsection (1) makes a

great deal of sense.

</div><a name="06050216000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2) refers

to the need for retrospective legislation, which has been a problem for

hon. Members; the hon. Member for Wellingborough has mentioned it

several times today. Given the substantial housing investment secured

through the corporation, any questions about earlier allocations could

give and may have given unnecessary cause for concern to investors,

housing associations and perhaps ultimately to tenants, too. I should

be interested to hear what steps the Department took in the period

preceding the Bill&#146;s entry to the House to reassure the public

that there was no need to panic.</div>

<a name="06050216000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The need for the Bill arose

through a change in the accepted working practice of organisations. As

the hon. Member for Wellingborough said, the reason was a gradual

change in the working of such organisations during the period in which

the Housing Corporation has existed, rather than poorly drafted

legislation. However, I would hate to be generous to previous

Conservative Governments, despite the fact that the hon. Member for

Surrey Heath has generously pointed out that it was my hon. Friend the

Member for Carshalton and Wallington who raised on Second Reading the

point about auditing other organisations, which has allowed us such a

fruitful diversion this

afternoon.</div><a name="06050216000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As such

delegation has become commonplace, it is understandable that it was

assumed to be lawful. Most other organisations dealing with the Housing

Corporation would customarily have worked in that way and would have

expected the corporation to have had such powers. From time to time,

situations crop up in local government whereby customer practice has

developed and it is assumed that at some point an agreement was made

allowing it. As employees move on, new members of staff take it as read

that the organisation&#146;s operating practices are based on its

original founding principles, without thinking to question whether

there were any holes in the underlying framework.</div>

<a name="06050216000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is to be welcomed that the

error in respect of the Housing Corporation has been brought to light

and that Ministers and officials have sought to clarify the position.

As the hon. Member for Surrey Heath said, allowing such an uncertainty

to continue might have jeopardised future investment. I am sure that

all members of the Committee want such uncertainties brought to an end

and confidence in the process

restored.</div><a name="06050216000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

reluctance to countenance retrospective powers is a natural initial

response, but in this case it is retrospective action that confirms

past decisions and seeks to bolster confidence, rather than action that

might call into question the basis on which other decisions have been

taken. Given that the measure will 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div>increase confidence rather than alter the position, it seems sensible,

and I hope that it will allow a line to be drawn under the past use of

delegation by the

corporation.</div><a name="06050216000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

grateful to the Minister for drawing attention to the underlying

purpose of subsections (3) and (4), which is to ensure that

retrospective action to which they refer will cover only action taken

lawfully and in the spirit of the original

Act.</div><a name="06050216000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, I

am happy to support clause 1. I do so not out of a generous desire to

underline the compassionate nature of my party, although it does have

such a nature. I find it a little odd that members of the Conservative

party have now felt the need to qualify their conservatism at every

opportunity. I can conclude only that that relates to the experience of

most people, which is that conservatism has been very different from

compassion. I am grateful for being allowed to deviate slightly from

the text of the Bill, and I support the clause standing

part.</div><a name="06050216000107"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000226"></a>Mr.

Bone:</b> It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Gentleman

who, apart from his last few sentences, has made some powerful points.

I draw attention to my interests as recorded in the Register of

Members&#146; Interests and the fact that I am a member of Rockingham

Forest housing association, which is an unremunerated

position.</div> <a name="06050216000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the

Minister tell us whether the bright spark that found out from the

seminar that the corporation was acting ultra vires has been promoted

or relegated? Obviously, the person has started something that is both

serious and important, and which should be examined.</div>

<a name="06050216000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, much of the

debate was about disposals. I said that general consent under section 9

would cover such matters, so we would not have to pass retrospective

legislation. The Minister said earlier that other areas are not covered

by general consent and that that is the real reason why we need

retrospective legislation. Such a matter needs to be spelled out in

some detail so that the House can make a proper decision about

it.</div> <a name="06050216000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am always

worried about being asked to pass retrospective legislation. This is a

rushed Bill, and quick retrospective measures are usually bad

legislation. I have read statements that the Housing Corporation has

been issuing since the turn of the year and nowhere in them was a sign

of panic that, if the House of Commons did not pass an Act, things

would go pear-shaped. Considering that the merger with English

Partnerships is very much on the cards, I wonder why we could not have

waited a little longer, considered the matter in great more detail and

perhaps have improved the

situation.</div><a name="06050216000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Liverpool, Walton made the point about regulation and cost.

We must first bear in mind the board of directors. If I were on a board

of directors and my organisation was disposing of assets worth a

considerable amount and creating high charges, I should expect such

matters to be board decisions. I accept that the work would be done by

an official or a sub-committee, but I would expect the legislation to

come to the board. The Bill will remove that requirement, and that is

what I am worried

about.</div>



<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div><a name="06050216000160"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

pm</div><a name="06050216000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is even

worse because it is not the Housing Corporation but the housing

association that works on disposals and charges. The housing

association doesall the work and preparation, exercises all

thedue diligence and then reports to the Housing

Corporation.</div> <a name="06050216000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Housing Corporation costs more than &#163;40 million a year to run.

Its board collects a remuneration of around &#163;250,000 a year.

Would not the Bill have been an opportunity to consider whether the

Housing Corporation needs to approve such disposals? If we could have

removed the new measure&#151;the Housing Corporation does not do

anything but rubber-stamp, and it has never turned down a request from

a housing association&#151;and a layer of bureaucracy and red tape,

that would have been worth while. We could have saved a great sum of

that &#163;40 million a

year.</div><a name="06050216000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have missed

an opportunity. It is a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. Will the Minister

take on boardthe possibility of considering, when and if the

mergerof English Partnerships happens, whether that

requirement could be removed from the Housing Corporation, perhaps

saving millions of pounds a year? I understand how the Government

started on the Bill&#151;they were under pressure from lawyers and

stakeholders&#151;but if they had looked at it a bit more carefully

and waited a little longer, they could have come up with a better

Bill.</div><a name="06050216000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000227"></a>Angela

Eagle:</b> I shall take a small amount of time to support the

Bill and clause 1. It has been rare during my time in Parliament to

come across a piece of Government legislation so thankfully short.

After working on various Finance Bills and all sorts of other humongous

300 and 400-clause Bills, something so simple is a

joy.</div><a name="06050216000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the nature

of the problem, the Government were quite right to introduce a quick

Bill to remove the legal flaws discovered by the lawyer doing the

seminar at the Housing Corporation. The hon. Member for Wellingborough

speculated on what might have happened to that lawyer. I hope that he

or she was granted an immediate post in the office of parliamentary

counsel, so that we can ensure that future Bills are drawn up with the

same rigour that the lawyer brought to that seminar at the turn of the

year.</div><a name="06050216000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear that

once some such thing has come to light, it is important&#151;for the

sake of the lenders and potential creditors of the social housing

system provided by the Housing Corporation and its 1,800 housing

associations&#151;to put right that legal flaw quickly if stability

is to be maintained and uncertainty banished. That is why I believe,

unlike some Opposition Members, that it is important that the

Government have acted quickly to get rid of legal

uncertainties.</div> <a name="06050216000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

always, retrospectivity is an issue, but my hon. Friend the Minister is

right to point out that the retrospectivity implied in the Bill will

shore up the status quo as it was understood before the infamous

seminar. It will ensure continuing stability and confirm 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div>in law something that everyone thought was already the case. It will not

disadvantage anyone.</div>

<a name="06050216000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point about the

Government&#146;s quick move is that it will not only remove

uncertainty and ensure that lenders do not change their attitudes to

lending housing associations money at particular interest rates but

will avoid all sorts of potential mischief with litigation, which can

sometimes arise in such circumstances. In answer to my question about

the important decisions that might be affected by the uncertainty, my

hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the registering of housing

associations; such decisions might also involve the transfer of

ownership or the taking out of loans at a reasonable interest rate that

will not suddenly be put up. The Bill is technical and has important

practical consequences for ensuring stability, because it recreates a

legal certainty that had suddenly been

lost.</div><a name="06050216000120"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000228"></a>Mr.

Bone:</b> Is the hon. Lady not concerned at the prospect of

removing the requirement for the board to scrutinise the registering of

housing associations? Does she not think that that should be done at

board

level?</div><a name="06050216000121"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000229"></a>Angela

Eagle:</b> Not necessarily; the hon. Gentleman should remember

that a great deal of the experience of how housing associations work,

operate and run themselves was not there 40 years ago when the

legislation was first written and the idea of housing associations was

new. The removal of the requirement is not necessarily a problem at

all. Lenders would not be remotely interested in lending to dodgy

organisations or dodgy housing associations. The hon. Gentleman alluded

to his entry on the register; he will have experience of such issues,

and I am sure that he will agree with my

assessment.</div><a name="06050216000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come

back to the point that I was making,2 million tenants live in

this part of our social housing system. I was interested to hear the

hon. Member for Surrey Heath confirm that social housing was a

necessary public service. That reassures us somewhat about the general

evolution of the Conservative party; having realised that social

housing is back on its agenda, we shall sleep a bit better in our beds.

The key thing is that the sudden throwing into doubt of the legal

position when 2 million tenants have their housing well-being looked

after by 1,800 organisations is not desirable, even if it is due to

technical reasons. That is why it was important that the Bill was

discussed quickly.</div><a name="06050216000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

am afraid that I do not go along with the &#147;but&#148; question

introduced by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. The question was more

one of setting the hares running. It is important for us to have

confidence in our NDPBs and how they work, and not to worry that

because one flaw has been found&#151;one of the oldest, as it

happens&#151;it will somehow be reproduced all over the place.

Setting such hares running can cause uncertainty where there is none

and create needless adverse responses. Although such things may be fun

for the Opposition, there can sometimes be consequences. I hope that

the hon. Gentleman will forget about his scaremongering on those issues

and be reassured that the problem is not a recurring

one.</div><a name="06050216000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, I

support the Bill and commend my hon. Friend the Minister for acting so

quickly on an 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>issue that, although technical, could have had adverse effects if

allowed to run on. I commend her for deciding to introduce the Bill

rather than waiting until some time in the future and letting the

uncertainty play havoc on the financial markets or, even worse, provoke

malicious or mischievous challenges to decisions that may well have

been made a long time ago.</div>

<a name="06050216000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that such

loopholes are closed quickly in the interests of good governance and

the security of the 2 million housing tenants who rely for their homes

on housing associations. I support the Bill and commend my hon. Friend

the Minister for bringing it to us so

quickly.</div><a name="06050216000126"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000230"></a>Yvette

Cooper:</b> The debate on clause 1 has ranged widely, and I

should like to respond to some of the points made.</div>

<a name="06050216000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Surrey

Heath began by sympathising with me for my seasonal malady. It is

seasonal, although it is provoked by pollen rather than by a virus.

Since hay fever is not yet contagious, he escapes blame. I also assure

him that he need not worry about how close he gets to us.</div>

<a name="06050216000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman raised a

series of questions for the Government, which I shall try to answer.

The first was about what he described as an audit of non-departmental

public bodies. My hon. Friends the Members for Liverpool, Walton, for

Wallasey and for Milton Keynes, South-West also referred to the

issue.</div> <a name="06050216000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The officials

in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have done an audit of all

the non-departmental public bodies that report to our Department. We

found that none were in the position that has been mentioned. We also

raised with the Cabinet Office the need to co-ordinate across

Government more widely on the issue. We are not aware of any other

bodies that need such powers and do not have them. There may be other

non-departmental bodies that do not need such powers and do not have

them. As I said, we are not aware of any other body that is in this

situation, but I am not in a position to give guarantees for other

Departments, and it would not be appropriate for me to do so. We tried

to examine comparable bodies. For example, we examined the

circumstances of English Heritage and found that having been

established in 1983, it had an express power to

delegate.</div><a name="06050216000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to

be mindful of the warning given by my hon. Friend the Member for

Liverpool, Walton that we should not attempt to create work either for

lawyers or for legislators. Equally, the issue of the Housing

Corporation is significant because, unlike many non-departmental public

bodies, it deals in the financial markets and its operations have

implications for them. Organisations in such situations are different

from other non-departmental bodies, which may not be in engaged in such

financial decisions, which have so many wider ramifications. The

significant point is that when modernising legislation is introduced we

need to ensure that such issues are properly scrutinised.</div>

<a name="06050216000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second question put by the

hon. Member for Surrey Heath was which decisions required the same

legal underpinning for the past, as well as the section 9 decisions to

which we referred. The issue is about the statutory functions of the

Housing Corporation; it is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div>not about which kind of biscuits to get for the board meeting. It covers

consents under section 9 of the Housing Act 1996, which requires a

registered social landlord to obtain the consent of the corporation for

any disposal of land under section 8 of the Act, which includes the

placing of charges by lenders as security against a loan and rule

changes for RSLs. For example, if someone does not have a valid consent

to theirrule changes, that could raise questions about

constitutional amendments for the housing association and for decisions

that flow from them. Some of those amendments may be significant while

others may not be. Either way, it is important to have certainty about

those decisions.</div><a name="06050216000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

provision may also cover the Housing Corporation&#146;s ability to

appoint members to the board of an RSL that is causing problems and is

under supervision. We would not want those sorts of things challenged

in the court by people who are causing problems within the RSL if it is

already under supervision and needs to be regulated further in the

public interest.</div><a name="06050216000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

each of those areas when we have pursued this matter some legal comfort

regarding rule changes might be provided by other legislation, for

example the Land Registration Act 2002, the Companies Act 1985 and the

Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965. Having looked into that in

some detail, we came to the conclusion that there was insufficient

certainty in relation to the statutory functions for us to expect the

Housing Corporation, the housing associations and their lenders to

proceed on the basis of the appropriate comfort needed for future

decision-making.</div><a name="06050216000161"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

pm</div><a name="06050216000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for Surrey Heath asked whether we could publish our legal advice. We

considered that as well because we were keen to be as transparent as

possible. As the hon. Gentleman knows, legal advice is covered by legal

privilege. There may be challenges in court in advance of the

legislation reaching the statute books, and for that reason&#151;and

the precedents that would be created&#151;we concluded that it would

not be appropriate for us to publish that advice. We did, however,

provide a summary of the key points. We relayed the key points to the

Council of Mortgage Lenders when it raised this issue, and I am happy

for officials to provide further advice to the hon. Gentleman on the

issue if he feels that it is important. We made sure that we relayed

the principles of the legal advice we received to the House and to the

Opposition parties in order to allow proper discussion of the

issues.</div><a name="06050216000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third

question that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath raised concerned

consequences and the relationship between the Housing Corporation and

English Partnerships. The hon. Member for Wellingborough also raised

the issue and asked whether future legislation would be needed. We

should be clear that we have not taken a decision about the

relationship between the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships.

We are consulting and having a wide debate about that and we have

definitely not made any decision yet about the appropriate way

forward.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div><a name="06050216000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the two

organisations were to merge into a new one, primary legislation would

certainly be required, but it would take time to draw up primary

legislation and to take decisions about the functions that a new body

would have. It would be irresponsible of us to delay the measures in

the legislation until such time as decisions were made, especially as

it may be the case that no legislation will be introduced, or it may be

some time before the legislative opportunity arises. I assure the House

that were it to be the case that new legislation created a new body, we

would ensure that the express power was included as part of that

legislation.</div>

<a name="06050216000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the

Member for Liverpool, Walton raised a point about not searching for

non-existent problems. Nevertheless, we have made it clear that we must

ensure that all of our non-departmental bodies can function effectively

and appropriately. I welcome the support of the hon. Member for North

Cornwall for clauses 1 and 2. I agree with him that this is timely

legislation which we need to pass in order to address the

problem.</div>

<a name="06050216000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for Wellingborough raised a series of questions to which I shall try to

respond. He asked whether we could wait longer. As I have already said,

it is not appropriate to do so. He said that the Housing Corporation

was not panicking so we should not legislate in haste, but he would

accuse the corporation of extremely irresponsible behaviour if it

started panicking about this issue. The Housing Corporation and its

lenders have been very responsible in their approach and part of the

reason for the calm and measured tone of their response is that we made

it clear to them from an early stage that we wanted to resolve the

position and would be prepared to introduce legislation, if necessary,

in order to do so. It has proved necessary, and we have responded to

their

concerns.</div><a name="06050216000139"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000231"></a>Mr.

Bone:</b> The Minister just said that the Housing Corporation

was aware very early on that the Bill was coming before Parliament. In

that case, why were they still pursuing until recently the idea of a

general consent under section

9?</div><a name="06050216000140"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06050216000232"></a>Yvette

Cooper:</b> As I said, the Housing Corporation first raised

the issue with the Department in December last year and we had further

discussions and meetings in January and February. We made it clear to

the corporation that we wanted to resolve the situation, but also that

we needed to explore every other avenue of doing so because it was

important not to take up parliamentary time if there were alternative

routes. That is why we asked the Housing Corporation to look further at

issues around general consents, and we looked at them as well. We have

been very clear with the corporation and with the lenders from the

beginning that everyone agreed that the situation needed to be resolved

to provide a secure basis for and proper certainty around future and

retrospective decisions, but that we needed to work out in some detail

with it and other stakeholders how we took the matter

forward.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div><a name="06050216000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for

Wellingborough asked whether section 9 decisions could have been

covered by the general consents. It is correct that other decisions

could not have been covered by general consents, as only section 9 of

the Housing Act 1996 on disposal of land provides for general consents.

Therefore, we would not have been able to cover some of the other

issues around regulation, and regulatory and registration decisions

through a general

consent.</div><a name="06050216000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,

the legal advice was that there was no certainty that a retrospective

consent to dispose of land would be held by a court to be valid; that

even though it might provide some considerable comfort it would not

provide legal certainty. On that basis, we thought it appropriate to

legislate to provide

certainty.</div><a name="06050216000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

considered whether section 9 consents were needed at all. In fact, the

Elton review considered this and decided that it was not appropriate to

remove the requirement for a section 9 consent to be given by the

Housing Corporation. One of the issues is that social housing assets

are in part funded by the taxpayer. They are a public investment and

provide an important public service. Therefore, there are significant

questions about the protection of taxpayers&#146; money and the

public interest if housing associations are able to dispose of assets

that have been part-funded by public investment and by taxpayers. The

hon. Gentleman is welcome to raise the matter as part of a wider debate

about the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships. Obviously, it

would be more fruitful to discuss that wider question, which has far

wider ramifications, in that way rather than trying to debate it within

the scope of this Bill, which has a limited

purpose.</div><a name="06050216000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend the Member for Wallasey and other hon. Members asked what had

happened to the lawyers who uncovered the problem in the first place. I

am not able to say what has happened to them, to the many lawyers who I

presume have been consulted over the decades, or to the officials under

this or previous Governments who perhaps failed to consult lawyers when

dealing with the issue on previous occasions. Nevertheless, now that we

are clear that there is a problem, everyone&#151;lawyers, officials

and so on&#151;is working hard to resolve it. My hon. Friend is also

right in saying that we should be trying to prevent court challenges

and unnecessary litigation in the

future.</div><a name="06050216000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, a

question arose while my hon. Friend was talking about whether

registration of RSLs should be done at board level. In fact, the

registration of RSLs is done not by officers but by sub-committees,

whichis a perfectly sensible approach for the Housing

Corporation to take. Obviously, it is for the corporation to decide

whether that should be done by the main board or by a sub-committee.

The point is that the Bill allows the corporation to take that decision

itself, rather than taking everything through the board. I hope that I

have responded to every question that was raised on clause 1.</div>
