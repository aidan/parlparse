                           </span> Good morning, Mr Walker
and, through you, to the rest of the Committee. As we were finishing on
Thursday evening, the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb), was telling us how, in contrast to
me, he has received such good, personalised and relevant careers
advice. Given that he is acknowledged throughout the House and
elsewhere as having imagination, creativity and style—his words,
not mine, although I am sure we would all agree—he rightly
became a chartered accountant. However, despite his enormous creativity
and imagination—and, given the suit that he has on today, his
obvious style—he has failed to instil in me any degree of
reassurance.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has a worrying belief that face-to-face advice might not be appropriate
for all students, leading to the real possibility that young
people’s needs might be neglected or dismissed to the point of
impersonal and often irrelevant information being provided elsewhere.
Despite the rhetoric from trusted professionals, the Minister failed to
convince me that the Government are providing the logistical and
practical support to allow careers professionals to do their jobs. The
destination measure on schools is most welcome and I pay tribute to him
for highlighting it; I was putting that in place as part of the
information, advice and guidance strategy 18 months ago. Once it is
operational, I hope it will be

inherently built into the statutory framework proposed under the Bill.
I shall return to such matters on Report, but at the moment, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000023">&#160;</a>

careers guidance in schools in England. Under the previous clause when
we were discussing amendments, I touched on what I thought was a leap
in the dark and what a gamble the Minister is taking with his proposal
for the careers service. It is not just me who fears that. The NASUWT
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000048">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Schools

discretion of the headteacher. Breadth, suitability or diversity of
advice cannot be guaranteed, impacting adversely on social mobility and
leading to
inequality.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
Institute of Career Guidance has similar concerns. It
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
understand Government will still expect schools to provide careers
education for their pupils, but we also know the pressure schools are
under to target their resources on core curriculum subjects. We are
concerned that without this requirement being retained, many schools
will marginalise careers education, and this will be particularly
detrimental for pupils with limited access to parental or peer networks
and who may not be enabled to review their career options with a career
guidance professional through their
school.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“we

                        <p class="tabbed">We
echo those sentiments, and we ask the Minister to inform the Committee
how the Government will address them. Will he set out how the success
or failure of the new duty will be judged? How will Parliament be given
the opportunity to hold the Secretary of State to account for his
policies and how they are working in
England?<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
Thursday, my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton West intervened to ask
the Minister how the new regime will be monitored and measured and,
frankly, he failed adequately to answer her reasonable question. The
group of amendments is designed to help him, and to ensure that the
Bill locks in the Secretary of State to reviewing, evaluating and
making available information to Parliament, so that Parliament can be
satisfied that he is accountable for the quality of careers guidance
and
skills.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000052">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Taking
into account those concerns and given the uncertainty surrounding the
future of services such as Connexions, I seek the Minister’s
assurance that the clause will not have a negative impact on the career
choices of young people. What steps is he taking to ensure that the
problems highlighted by the NASUWT, the Institute of Career Guidance
and the Association of Colleges do not
arise?<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
was touched on during our deliberations on amendment 119 under clause
26, there are concerns about the Department for Education’s
intimation that the requirement could be deemed to be satisfied by
schools securing access for pupils to national telephone and online
careers advice resources. Does the Minister agree that young people
should be entitled to speak to a professional face to face to discuss
such an important part of their education, training or development?
There are concerns that, without the facility, social mobility will be
impeded, access to careers services will be by postcode lottery and
schools in more disadvantaged areas, with limited resources, will not
be able to fund significant face-to-face services or to pass costs on
to parents, as might be the case in more affluent areas. Emphasis on
the importance of the term “independent” must not
override the requirement for schools to secure acceptable professional
quality
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
those reasons, I ask the Minister to give his assurance that, before
the clause comes into force, he will consult stakeholders and compile
and make available to the House a report addressing the concerns I have
outlined. In particular, the report should address

                           </div>key questions: first, will schools be required to seek services from
service providers that are already registered with an accredited
careers professional body; secondly, will the Government require that
all providers of careers guidance services to schools must comply with
Government-determined quality standards; and thirdly, will future
service providers be subject to Ofsted inspection to ensure that
schools comply with their obligations? The amendments are reasonable
and I hope Minister will reassure us on how he will monitor, evaluate
and review the proposals that the Bill will put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000055">&#160;</a>

briefly to what my hon. Friend has said. The issue is enormously
important, because young people do not have a good view of what
opportunities there are for them. We know from recent work that
children, particularly those from less well-off backgrounds, have
limited experience of people working in a wide range of areas, so
getting it right matters. It matters for not only those young people
but for us as a society. We know that in a time of better economic
circumstances we had skills shortages, and we know that those times are
going to come again soon. If we do not get young people with the right
skills into the right jobs and give them opportunities, not only they
but our whole society will suffer, so I want to support what my hon.

change to careers advice provision in schools is effective and achieves
the outcomes the Government want, it will be one of the most
significant elements of the Bill. Important questions have been raised
about ensuring quality and ensuring that the provision directed by
heads within an institution is genuinely impartial and provided in the
interests of the young person, and not through the prism of the
institution’s interests, which all too often has been the case.
The Browne review said:<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

by the Sutton Trust has shown that half of young people consider the

                        <p>Half
currently think that it is inadequate, so the case for change regarding
the need to improve careers advice has absolutely been made. What we
always need to do in this place, of course, is to make sure that the
provision put in place by the Government will actually improve matters.

opportunities open to people? The shadow Minister was right to mention
Ofsted. May I press the Minister to write to the chief inspector and
ask her to ensure that Ofsted takes a close interest in the quality of
provision provided by schools? It can do so not only through its
individual school inspections but through the surveys it carries out.
If we get this right, it will be a tremendous feather in the
Government’s cap, having improved a situation that is not right.
If it goes wrong and after a great fanfare, it turns out that schools,
in the name of impartiality, manage to suit their own interests rather
more than their pupils’, and in a few years’ time young

                           </strong> Good morning, Mr Walker. It is good to be back
scrutinising the Bill and returning to the issue of careers advice and
guidance, which is so important if we are to enable people to achieve
the best that they can. The Committee will be familiar with the survey
that was carried out and published today, which reports that state
school pupils are more than four times as likely to be given bad
careers advice as private school students. Indeed, the survey has
highlighted how the current system is failing children by giving them
inadequate advice, which means that they cannot fulfil their ambitions.
It found that 27% of former state sector pupils were given bad careers
advice, against 6% who were educated
privately.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
could go on but I suspect you would not permit me to do so, Mr Walker.
However, I want to make the point that the case for change is
fundamentally important. There absolutely is variability in the quality
of the advice currently offered, and for two reasons. First, Connexions
was simply asked to do too much. Expecting it to give advice on many
different issues as well as on careers was asking an excessive amount,
and the Committee has acknowledged that the current Connexions service
is far from perfect. For the record, I do not say that it does not do
good work; however, its current construction does not work best in
respect of careers. Secondly, the current responsibilities of
schools—again, we ask so much of our teachers—mean that
in some places, best advice is not offered. If the research is to be
believed, the problem tends to be exaggerated for state school pupils
compared with privately educated
pupils.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
articulated much last week which it is not necessary to amplify today,
beyond saying that part of my aim is to ensure that careers advice is a
driver of improved social mobility, so that we provide people who do
not receive best advice from other sources, such as familial and social
networks, with the kind of advice that allows them to turn their
ambitions into fulfilled reality. I understand the concern across the
Committee about the process through which that takes place. I do not
think we differ on the aim; indeed, Opposition Members have
acknowledged that Connexions needed to change. I have no doubt that it
would have done so whoever had been in government; there was growing
consensus on the need to move to a different kind of careers
settlement.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000062">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
123, 124 and 144 are designed to establish exactly how we will test the
new arrangements. That is a perfectly reasonable request to make of the
system we are putting in place. We had a good discussion last week
about the importance of careers and, as I said, I do not want to
amplify it beyond what I have said so far. However, it is important to
understand the detail of what we are trying to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000063">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">With
the responsibility that we are placing on schools to secure impartial,
independent careers guidance, it is right that there should come a
reasonable degree of freedom to choose how that is secured, because the

different cohorts of pupils are bound to be different. I do not want to
prescribe exactly how that should be done on a school-by-school basis;
it has been tried in the past without
success.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that in fulfilling their professional duties, schools will
consider how working with employers, local authorities—as
mentioned in the detail of this discussion—and others could
assist them. That is not new to schools; they already have much
experience in forming such collaborative partnerships with other
agencies to achieve stated objectives, covering a whole range of

am keen to ensure that other organisations contribute to making the new
arrangements effective. In Committee last week, I explained that I
intend to call a summit of those with an interest in careers guidance,
to ensure that each can have their say and play their part in the
smooth transition from the existing arrangements to the new one. I do
not pretend that the transition will not be a challenge—of
course it will. Our fundamental shift in the provision of careers
advice and guidance will be a significant challenge, for careers
professionals and for schools. None the less, the challenge is worth
taking on, given the imperfect arrangements that persist at the moment
and our ambitions for advice and guidance to play their part in driving
social
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
deal with the specific points made by the hon. Member for Hartlepool,
that summit should be part of an ongoing conversation between
Government and a full range of organisations interested in delivering
the best possible careers guidance for young people. Indeed, yesterday,
I was pleased to meet—perhaps in anticipation of our discussion
today—the Careers Profession Task Force, which is chaired by the
wonderful Dame Ruth Silver who has done so much good work in the area.
That group of professionals, covering a wide range of interested
parties from the sector and beyond, is committed to working closely
with Government, not only to define professional standards, which will
make the provision of careers advice meet the highest quality
requirements, but to plan the transition
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000067">&#160;</a>

would not go so far as to say that we are making a
concession—that would be going too far; but we acknowledge the
Committee’s and the hon. Gentleman’s absolutely proper
concern. I shall be happy, therefore, to produce an action plan
following the summits that we shall hold. That plan will contain
staging posts that can be measured as we reach the destination of a
fully fledged service next year. We said that our first step will be in
place this autumn and that the service will be fully operational from
next spring. Working with the taskforce that is built around the
summits that we have already introduced, I am happy to cement that
timetable with those staging posts and to work with the sector to
deliver outcomes that will mark progress along that
journey.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000068">&#160;</a>

comments. I want to probe him on a point that was touched on during
discussion of clause 26. What happens to the year group that is going
through the careers process now? He said that the all-age careers
service will be up and running fully by spring, but what about students
who are thinking about career options at present? How will the Minister
ensure that they do not fall through the
cracks?<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000069">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman will remember that last week I
made other commitments. The first was to write to all local
authorities, which I shall do this week, reminding them of their
continuing statutory responsibilities concerning participation. I
appreciate the points that were made when we last debated these
matters; there is some variability in how local authorities are
responding to that continuing statutory need.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
I committed to communicate with schools about their statutory
responsibilities. I understand that the hon. Gentleman may be fearful
that there will be a hiatus, because the new duty will not take effect
until after the beginning of the school year. We must make it clear to
schools that they must prepare for the coming school year in
anticipation of the statutory duty. It would be an irresponsible school
that did not make provision for the beginning of the year in
anticipation of what they intended to introduce once the new duty came
into force. That the Bill’s provisions will not be in effect in
August or September is simply a result of the legislative timetable,
but they will be in place mid-way through the academic year. In the
communication that I issue, I shall tell schools that they should
anticipate those changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
the hon. Gentleman’s point, but we can deal with the problem. I
acknowledge that doing so depends on the professionalism of heads,
governors and teachers. However, I have a strong faith in those
people—this theme has emerged throughout our consideration of
the Bill; I have been a champion of educators for as long as I have
been interested in education, which is since I was very
small.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000072">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a good question. Local authorities’
statutory responsibilities changed as a result of legislation
introduced, as hon. Members will remember, by the previous Government.
The arrangements for Connexions were altered; indeed, we were on the
Bill Committee that dealt with that matter. An assumption that
Connexions would change was already built into legislation. I shall
come to how the matter concerns schools, but we need to make it
absolutely clear to local authorities that they will retain that
statutory duty. We cannot prescribe exactly how they effect that duty,
but we can remind them that they have it. It has emerged over the past
few weeks and months that different local authorities, having
interpreted their duty, are putting different arrangements in place to
meet it. I have highlighted Northampton, which seems to be an exemplar
of good practice in that respect.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000074">&#160;</a>

it is not normally done in Committee, but it is absolutely right that
Ministers should be responsive. I have discussed this point a little
with the hon. Lady offline; there is a need to pick out examples of
best practice and to find a mechanism. Moving to the destination can
perhaps be done through the summit and the staging posts that I have
described. There is a good argument for identifying examples of best
practice and looking at how we can ensure that they are understood and
that people learn from them. I will do that as a result of her
overtures.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000075">&#160;</a>

saying. Clause 30 repeals the duty of the governing body to co-operate
with the local authority. How is the relationship that he has described

provisions in the

                           </strong> The answer is in my previous remarks. I would
expect schools to work with all agencies where there are overlapping
responsibilities. On the statutory duty the hon. Gentleman described,
one cannot move from having a statutory duty to having nothing. Good
schools have long experience of interfacing with different agencies on
the provision of the right kind of services for their students. Of
course we would expect good practice to involve that kind of
collaborative work. I will not, however, set down in legislation
exactly what form it should take and exactly how it would be effective.
That would be outside the spirit that inspires this legislation, which
is to give schools more freedom to make those decisions, on the ground,
closest to the point where they have effect, and in the interests of
the school’s students. We trust governors, head teachers and
teachers to make those judgments. I accept, however, that there needs
to be a clear set of parameters in which they make them, which is what
the legislation tries to effect. I want to move on a little. We can
perhaps explore that issue further through interventions from
Opposition
Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000077">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On more than one occasion in this Committee, I
have mentioned instances of schools barring further education colleges
from coming in. Not only do the schools sometimes bar them from coming
on to their premises for open evenings, but as soon as an FE college
makes inquiries of a school, because a pupil is looking to join the
college, the school deliberately tries to lead the young person back to
their institution. It could be that schools do that because they
believe it is better for the young person, but there are some serious
conflicts of interest, so the Minister needs to do more than just tell
us how much he trusts heads and governors. He needs to explain how this
legislation will make schools that do not always put the interests of
the pupil first do so in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000078">&#160;</a>

education colleges, born of my enthusiasm for vocational and practical
learning. If he looks at the explanatory notes to the Bill, or the Bill
itself, he will see that there is a requirement for schools to offer
balanced advice on their duty to secure the independent guidance that
we all seek. One of the problems with the current arrangements is that
it has been suggested, and proven by a number of pieces of work and
surveys, that the advice that many students currently receive is
slanted towards an academic pathway. A survey famously produced by
YouGov for Edge found that teachers knew less about apprenticeships
than any other qualification apart from the Welsh baccalaureate. I have
nothing against the Welsh baccalaureate—that needs to be a
matter of record. It is surprising, however, that the paucity of
knowledge on apprenticeships should have formed the basis of the advice
that so many young people are
given.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000079">&#160;</a>

First, the balance of advice is that there is a need for change so that
all the options available to

			Column number: 687<a class="bkMark" name="Column687">&#160;</a>
                           </div>young people are made clear. That is most likely to come through the
involvement of professional careers advisers who have a comprehensive
understanding of all the options available to young people, in both
progressive learning and careers. I want all young people to receive
good quality advice. Secondly, in institutional terms, I would expect
schools to have the kind of collaborative arrangements that I described
earlier. I would be peculiar in securing impartial and independent
advice if schools took an introspective view about that. The
relationship between different providers of education within a locality
is an important element in making clear to young people the different
options ahead of them. A turf war between schools and colleges, such as
my hon. Friend described, would clearly not be indicative of the best
practice that I described in answer to the intervention from the hon.
Member for Bolton West about how schools, local authorities and others
can work together to secure the best
outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000080">&#160;</a>

initially and was then developed much more eloquently by the Chair of
the Select Committee, regarding the licensing of careers professionals
and the inspection regime and Ofsted? How does he expect those to fit
into his new vision of careers

                           </strong> One of the things being developed by the careers
task force that I mentioned is—I think it is fair to say
this—the most coherent ever arrangements on professional
standards. That will lead to a set of arrangements where there is
greater clarity than there ever has been about the professional
standards that apply to the careers profession and the nature of
training and accreditation. What I look to in the all-age service is an
arrangement where, in order to be part of that service, careers
advisers need to meet those professional standards. I am quite
unabashed in saying that. I am highly sympathetic to the principles of
licence to practise, as is well known, and I would see the careers
profession as a model for where we might develop that kind of good
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000082">&#160;</a>

already under way. The advice that I have received from Dame Ruth and
her team is that much progress is being made. There is a great deal of
enthusiasm in the profession about that, because it sees our public
policy initiative as a catalyst within the industry for, as I have
described it, an unprecedented degree of coherence on professional
standards, training and accreditation. I am therefore confident that
the profession is up for it, in the popular parlance.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000083">&#160;</a>

Gentleman will know that we are trying to reduce the burden on
Ofsted and make more straightforward what is inspected in schools. My
hon. Friend the Schools Minister has articulated that case a number of
times, both here and elsewhere, and I do not want to in any way inhibit
that desire. Nevertheless, I would expect some consideration of these
matters, because if the Ofsted inspector felt that there was a weakness
in this area—perhaps something was highlighted to them by
teachers, learners, parents or others—clearly, as this would be
a statutory duty and meeting that duty would be part of what being a
good school was about, I would

Beverley and Holderness is asking us to make that clear through
communication with Ofsted—my hon. Friend the Minister and I meet
Ofsted from time to time—I am sure we would have no difficulty
in highlighting that point. However, I do not want to include that
among the things that Ofsted must inspect in every school in every
case, because that would be counter to the policy

144 requires the Secretary of State to report on the impact of our
changes on the quality of careers advice in schools. I
believe—in making his argument, he also acknowledged
this—that the best indicator of good quality careers advice and
guidance is outcomes, destinations. The test of the new arrangements
will be whether they make a difference to where people subsequently go
to learn and the kind of employment that they gain as a result of that
progressive learning. Destinations are, in the end, by far the best way
of judging the quality of the advice and guidance

of the problems I have highlighted. We could have a long debate about
this, Mr Walker, but you would not permit it. the problems I have
highlighted are well made by Alan Milburn in his report on
social mobility, as well as in a number of other studies commissioned
by the previous Government and in some we have begun to look at as a
new Government. It is about whether people get the right kind of
guidance about progressive learning and
jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000091">&#160;</a>

survey that I mentioned, which is based on research reported in the
evening papers last night and, I gather, some of the daily papers
today, points to the fact that many people are not getting the right
kind of advice and guidance, as measured by what they say about the
advice they received, by where they subsequently head in respect of
learning—my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness
mentioned the relationship between schools and further
education—by how many people from underrepresented groups in
higher education get the opportunity to fulfil their potential and by
the kind of jobs they end up doing. Those are all bits of

                           </div>destination evidence that would need to change if the new system were to
be considered a success. That will happen over time, because we are
talking not only about a short-term set of objectives, but about a
medium and long-term set of effects. However, I am as determined as the
hon. Gentleman to challenge some of that
orthodoxy.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me put it plainly: too few people from working class families get the
kind of chances that he, I and other Committee members had. Too few
people get good advice on apprenticeships—we know that as
well—and too few people are able to fulfil their potential. Part
of that—not all of it—is about prior attainment and all
kinds of other things, but part is about the advice and guidance they
get. Those are the kind of destination measures, but to go further
would take us down a path that is extremely long and fascinating and
yet, under the strict terms that you would apply to our
discussion, Mr Walker, possibly tangential to the debate on the

attention yesterday by an adviser to the Leader of the Opposition. I am
surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not receive the same e-mail. In
the <em>Evening Standard</em> last night, we were told about a poll
conducted by Future First, which the hon. Gentleman will be familiar
with. The survey was highlighted in the London papers last night, and
has been picked up by the national papers

                        <p class="tabbed">The
real issue is that we do not need just a single survey; we know from
any amount of research that there is a profound problem about people
achieving their potential if they do not receive the right kind of
advice and guidance, and if they do not achieve the right kind of
results early on in their educational career. That is something that we
are determined to address, because we know that it impacts on social
mobility, and there is a fundamental relationship between social
mobility and social
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000096">&#160;</a>

would go further and say that in a free society, with the consequent
inequalities that are a necessary part of that freedom, it is ethically
unacceptable not to have a degree of social mobility that means people
can rise through that society on the basis of their talents and
assiduity. For my money, if we reached that point, such rigidity would
be not only unacceptable, but immoral. That is why I have been such an
enthusiastic advocate of social justice during my political
career.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000097">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Hartlepool knows that, in our schools White Paper, we
proposed a destinations measure for schools that will record the
education and training that young people progress to after the age of
16. That is a real test of the effectiveness of schools in preparing
young people to move on to positive destinations, and that is the most
effective way of judging
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000098">&#160;</a>

new arrangements and the problems that I have highlighted with the
existing ones. It would also add to our knowledge of what schools are
doing to secure careers guidance, provide examples of good practice

differences, there is still far too much correlation between

                           </strong> We are about to discuss a large number of
significant amendments designed to enhance the quality of the careers
guidance and work experience to which a young person will be exposed.
Amendment 131 would expand the obligations placed on the responsible
authority. It would require the responsible authority to secure not
only independent careers guidance for pupils during the relevant phase
of education but, importantly, good quality work experience during the
same
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will acknowledge that we are not starting completely from
scratch. Work-related learning has been statutory for 14 to
16-year-olds since 2004. In 2009, 300,000 employers offered work
experience placements to more than 500,000 young people, which is an
astonishing number. Each student undertaking the new diploma must
complete 10 days’ work experience to secure the qualification.
However, it must be said that our IAG strategy in 2009 identified the
fact that far too many 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 692<a class="bkMark" name="Column692">&#160;</a>
                           </div>young people were still not being provided with a sufficiently high
quality, relevant and personalised insight into the
workplace.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members
will have experiences from their constituencies of young people who,
instead of looking round an engineering firm for potential work
experience because that is the career pathway they want to pursue, have
been given two weeks in the local school library. Such experience is
not sufficient, relevant nor personalised. That is why, in our 2009 IAG
strategy, we were putting in place further work to enhance and widen
the offer of work experience to young people, making sure that there
was more collaboration between schools and businesses. We strongly
encourage the Government to do the same, which is why we have tabled
amendment 131.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Work
experience gives a young person something that cannot be taught in the
classroom. It cannot be learned from a computer or a text book, and it
cannot be discussed with a careers adviser, however well informed and
experienced that professional might be. However, I have seen on my own
patch that young people often come across hurdles when trying to gain
work experience for themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I know that
the Minister has children, and it is the most natural thing in the
world that he wants to see them get on in life. He might, therefore,
use his contacts and networks to ensure appropriate, relevant and
personalised work experience for his young sons. There is nothing
corrupt or sinister about that; he would simply be having a word in
someone’s ear to ensure that his children get the work
experience that he wants them to have. Not all young people have such
opportunities, especially those in disadvantaged areas. The measure is
more likely to affect a school in a disadvantaged area that might not
have the same contacts as a school in a more affluent
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should like to see work experience in a variety of formats, such as
short work placements, work-based projects, work shadowing schemes or
even vacation placements. I ask the Minister seriously to consider this
important amendment, which would facilitate a more rounded and
comprehensive level of careers guidance. Pupils would be provided with
practical and invaluable experience, which, in the long term, would not
only assist them in making informed career choices, but would add to
their skills and experiences, making them much more work ready than
they would otherwise be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 136
would make it clear that schools should provide careers education
rather than mere careers guidance. Those two phrases are often regarded
as interchangeable, but that is incorrect. The word
“guidance” reminds me of my earlier point—that wet
Wednesday afternoon, somebody the pupil does not know and does not
strike up a rapport with, and a wasted, inefficient and unsatisfactory
experience for all concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Does the
Minister accept the principles of good quality, impartial careers
education? Such education has six elements: helping young people to
progress; empowering young people to plan and manage their own futures;
responding to the needs of each learner; providing comprehensive
information and advice; raising aspiration; and actively promoting
equality of opportunity and challenging stereotypes. Will the Minister
ensure that he promotes careers education rather than guidance? The
amendment would help him to do so, and I hope, therefore, that he will
accept it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 134
and 135 would ensure that disabled pupils are advised about the same
mainstream education and training options that are available to
non-disabled pupils. The Alliance for Inclusive Education told us that
many careers guidance advisers offer only segregated educational and
training opportunities to disabled young people. That is not
acceptable, especially since the Government and the Minister are
committed to choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Equality
and Human Rights Commission’s “Staying On” report
highlighted how careers advisers tailor their advice to what people
with a particular impairment should do, rather than basing it on an
individual’s aspirations. It concludes that,<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“careers advice,
the choice of subjects to study at school and for an apprenticeship,
and work experience placements are all subject to stereotyping that
tends to have an impact more significantly on distinct groups,
including girls, the disabled, the working class and some ethnic
minorities. The result is that young people’s options and
aspirations are limited at an early
age.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000340">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
report also notes that disabled young people are not receiving
information about opportunities in work-based learning and
apprenticeships, and that the information they are given about further
education options is often negative. What does the Minister intend to
do to ensure that careers guidance offers all mainstream options to
disabled children and people with special educational
needs?<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
on amendment 128, clause 27(2) requires that the<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“responsible
authorities must secure that careers guidance provided under subsection
(1)…is presented in an impartial manner…includes
information on options available in respect of 16 to 18 education or
training, including
apprenticeships”.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
provision should go further to include guidance on likely post-18
pathways. It is difficult to see why such information should not be
provided to young people who are trying to make important decisions at
this stage of their educational journey, whether it is academic or
vocational. I do not think it would add anything to the cost of the
provision of the service. If anything, given the importance that
Ministers rightly attach to destination data, it would be an efficient
and effective tool to help minimise the risk of error. It surely
follows that a young person should have a comprehensive understanding
of what is involved in a career path before deciding whether to take
that path. A full understanding of, for example, qualification
requirements, cost, time scales and level of difficulty, perhaps
including statistics on success rates in getting employment
post-qualification, should be made available to young people to enable
them to make an informed decision on career choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In <em>The
Times</em> yesterday an article about universities and law courses
advised young people not to study law at A-level, because it would be
irrelevant to the law degree that they would take. If someone is
interested in law, that sort of advice is vital. It also makes no sense
to be obliged to advise someone about the requirements for securing a
place on an AS or NVQ level course without considering their pathway
post-completion of those courses.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the
Minister is aware, career decisions taken at 18 are becoming
increasingly complex, due to increased competition for higher education
places, difficulties in securing employment at 18, with a very
difficult job market for young people at the moment, and a greater
range of opportunities for apprenticeships and other 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>choices. In addition, critical decisions are required about the cost and
future returns of continuing education, which can mean high tuition
fees.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister consider this amendment, which would enable young people
to have guaranteed access to a fully comprehensive advice and career
guidance service? I think his point about the all-age career service
will go some way to helping to achieve that, but I hope he will look
favourably at the amendment to ensure that young people can proceed to
further or higher education and then on to work after the age of 18
with a full understanding of what is involved in their chosen career
path.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000133">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall focus most of my remarks on my amendments
96, 97 and 98. Amendment 96 highlights what I consider to be poor
drafting. Clause 27(2) (4) states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        </p>
                        <p>At
first reading that sounds fine. Some parts of the Bill at first reading
sound absurd; we need to stare at them and think about them a lot
before they start to make sense, but this sort of thing is the precise
opposite. The phrase used is “presented in an impartial
manner”, not “is impartial”, as one would think it
should be. That is peculiar drafting. It does not make sense, and the
phrase should either be deleted or changed to “is
impartial”. It is a small point, but as we are going clause by
clause, line by line, we ought to try and get it right. I should be
interested to hear either a florid defence of that particular wording
or a dignified and carefully choreographed retreat from it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My other
amendments are probing and could in some ways be seen as superfluous
because of the mention of various training pathways—specifically
apprenticeships. The point of the amendments is to make sure that
careers advice includes options in both academic and vocational routes
and to say that explicitly in the Bill. We have talked about the need
to ensure access to high quality careers advice, but we have walked
around the issue, although the Minister referred earlier to a news item
from yesterday, about the weakness of careers advice, particularly in
state schools and in poor areas. The reality is that it is easier to
provide careers guidance and advice to those following a predominantly
academic route. I imagine that there is satisfaction in independent
schools, where a vast majority of students go on to A-levels and
university.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000136">&#160;</a>

old daughter is doing A-levels at the moment and I hope she will go to
university. As a parent, it is extremely complex trying to work out
which courses she might do and at which institutions she might do them.
Thinking through the living arrangements, the quality of the individual
courses and the brand of the university is quite complex for parents,
but one can get through it. When we look at those who do not follow
that route, things are infinitely more
complicated.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000137">&#160;</a>

Committee. Given the experience of his 17-year-old and his wish to see
her go on to university, does he accept that one of the omissions in
the Bill as it is currently drafted is that there does not seem to be
any role for parents in securing good, impartial information, advice
and guidance? Does he think there should be more in the Bill with
regard to

of thought. Schools normally work closely with parents when it comes to
such matters. That has been my experience; it may not always be the
case. Perhaps it is something on which the hon. Gentleman should have
tabled an amendment. It is certainly an important
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
know that the role of parents is critical to our children’s
future, and we are aware that those who are most vulnerable in our
society, who are not following an academic route, have to navigate a
much more complex ground. The qualifications they may need and their
relevance are harder to determine. If someone is not sure where to go
next, and if they do not have, as we have already discussed, family
networks to advise them, or if there is not an expectation that the
young person will be happy to follow a parental lead, the need for
effective and high quality guidance is great, which is why the Minister
is right to set out the direction of travel that he has. What we are
trying to work out is whether we are going to head in that direction.
Wishing for it and actually doing it are two separate things. The key
point is that it is infinitely more complex. That needs to be said. We

                        <p class="tabbed">Further
education and skills-based learning provide a critical and important
resource for young people. As I have touched on before, colleges who
provide those must not be prevented from communicating careers advice
directly to young people, as seems to be the case in some instances. Dr
Alison Wolf’s review of vocational education makes it clear that
courses of study must do more to ensure that there are successful
pathways leading on to employment or higher education, rather than
ending up in a cul-de-sac. Higher quality careers advice will be one
element in ensuring that people go on appropriate courses that link on
to progression in education or, indeed,
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the guiding principles of the Wolf report revolves around providing
accurate information on the value of vocational opportunities. The
review
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“we
should tell citizens the truth. That means providing people with
accurate and useful information, so that they can make decisions
accordingly. Good information becomes more critical the more important
the
decisions.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We

critical.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“For
young people, which vocational course, qualification or institution
they choose really can be life-determining. 14-19 education is funded
and provided for their sakes, not for the sake of the institutions who
provide it. This may be a truism; but it is one which policy too often
seems to

will deliver careers guidance in schools in the future will meet
current standards? If nothing in the Bill says that people should be
properly qualified to deliver advice and guidance, how can we ensure
that the people delivering it will have the requisite skills, knowledge
and information? I therefore hope that the Minister will accept the
amendment; as I said, he has previously agreed that there needs to be
well-qualified people in schools. Also, under the current system there
are different routes to gain those qualifications in information,
advice and guidance—the matrix standards. How will they be
developed in the future? Will there still be the different part-time
and full-time routes to do them? Who will deliver the education for

move on to careers education, which is absolutely fundamental. The hon.
Gentleman talked about people following academic routes in school, but
I believe that the root of the problem lies much more in aspiration. I
live for the day when young people living on my estate of Hag Fold will
wake up and say, “I want to be a brain surgeon”, or even,
“I want to be a teacher, a social worker or train
driver.” One of the problems is that people are guided by those
whom they know. Until I worked for a rail union, I never knew that
there were so many well-paid jobs associated with the rail
industry—that is one of the world’s hidden secrets. There
are many hidden professions throughout society that, unless one has
family or friends with such careers, one is unlikely to know
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000150">&#160;</a>

not have effective careers guidance. I was dependent on family and
friends, and too often young people still
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000152">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
other element is work experience. Connexions was able to fund young
people so that they could experience different types of work,
particularly those who were not achieving in school—the NEETs
and those at risk of becoming NEET. Again, if we do not enable young
people to go to different workplaces and see what is possible, we will
trap them in the careers that their families and friends are involved
in. Work experience is extremely important for all young people, but
particularly for those who do not have a wider range of information
available in their

Hartlepool that it is very important that disabled young people be
given the same opportunities and information as non-disabled young
people. It is not only about continuing with special education. Young
people should be enabled to fulfil their potential, wherever it lies.
If they need additional support to be in mainstream education, so be
it. That additional support should be given; they should not be put on

is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship. I rise to support
amendment 146, partly because of my own experience of careers guidance.
It was given by teachers and other people who were not
qualified—and thus I was encouraged to be a dentist or an
engineer. I am sure that the Committee feels that this is a loss to the
medical and engineering professions in many different ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
should be unnecessary, given the alternative. That raises the question
as to why we tabled it. If careers advice is not to be given by people
who are “appropriately qualified”, who will give it? That
is a clear concern of us all. What will happen to the current careers
service—to the professionals who provide a much better service

importance of our careers service and of protecting those professional
people. I fear that, if we lose them, many more people will be told
that they should be dentists or engineers when that is not the
appropriate course for them, or for the future of our medical and
engineering services, and we will all be worse off for it. Those young
people will not get the support they need to aspire to the careers they
want. I hope the Minister will appreciate that this amendment arises

provide poor quality advice. We would all be worried by

first point raised by the hon. Member for Hartlepool concerned work
experience. Work experience is an important part of what is needed to
prepare any young person for their working life. According to the 2010
CBI education and skills survey, 64% of employers have links with
secondary schools. Despite the fact that work experience is not
statutory, we estimate that some 95% of key stage 4 pupils participate
in it. I do not know about other members of the Committee, but I have
had numerous young people on work experience since becoming a Member of
Parliament. Exposing young people to some of the excitement of the life
of a democratic representative is a very important part of what we can
do as Members of this House. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that work
experience can be an important form of engagement that leads people to
frame their own views about what they might do. Indeed, any work
experience with a Member of Parliament is likely to convince them that
this job is arduous, and that other options exist for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000163">&#160;</a>

its relationship with the employer. Good schools already place a

experience with children in a primary school, which has given me

a quota for the number of women that they wanted to get into
underrepresented careers, which is why dentistry and engineering were
recommended to someone who was not doing a particularly heavy amount of
science courses. That is why good work experience and well qualified

rapidly on to amendment 136, I understand the concerns behind it. I am
mindful that the careers profession has invested a lot of time and
energy into achieving statutory recognition for careers education. I
want to emphasise, deservedly, something I mentioned earlier: the
Careers Professional Alliance, which represents six professional
associations, has made good progress in bringing this diverse sector
together, which is significant if we want a highly professional,
high-quality sector addressing the needs of young people and
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
careers profession is committed to creating one professional body which
will set standards, maintain a professional register leading to a
licence to practice, and provide a range of professional services. That
will give the careers profession one umbrella body which is independent
and self-supporting. That has come about as a direct result of the
Government’s policy on developing an all-age service. I am
delighted with the progress and I congratulate all those involved in
bringing it about. We have yet to reach the destination, but we are
making significant steps along the road.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To pick up on
the passing remark made by the hon. Member for Hartlepool regarding the
previous amendment, the plan that we will put in place as a result of
our discussions will not only build on that work, but set staging posts
towards the destination that we want to reach by next year. I will also
ask the Careers Profession Alliance to set key milestones on behalf of
the profession regarding professional standards with officials from the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for
Education.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will reassure the hon. Gentleman also by saying that as the Bill makes
its way through Parliament, we expect to set out in clearer terms the
evidence that we have gathered on the statutory recognition, in order
to ensure that students can take full advantage of the careers guidance
that schools are able to access. The broad range of activities
encompassed within the terms of careers education are important in
contextualising the careers guidance on offer to pupils and support the
development of decision making and careers management skills. That
point has been made to me by the profession, academics and others, and
I understand it. What schools do in those terms matters just as much as
what independent careers advisers offer, and to see careers advice in
isolation from the supporting education provided by teachers would be a
mistake. We will make it clear as we set up the new service that
schools have a continuing responsibility to ensure that the context is
provided, in the way that I have described, for the advice that young
people are
given.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
the lack of clarity about the difference between advice and guidance is
to some degree a feature of the current arrangements. The distinction
between careers advice and careers education has become blurred, and
the Bill will helpfully make the distinction crystal clear. What
matters is that young people get the support they need to make informed
decisions about their future, that we empower teachers to do what they
think is right and that we free them from unnecessary bureaucracy and,
in this case, prescription. We will continue along the road of raising
the standard of careers advice, considering the context of what happens
in
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
leads me to amendment 146, which attempts to introduce a further
element of prescription by requiring all independent careers guidance
to be delivered by qualified careers advisers. Let me be clear about
that, because I have already committed myself to the principle of a
licence to practice in respect of the all-age service. While we are not
being prescriptive, I would of course expect that the advice secured as
part of the statutory duty under the Bill to be of appropriate quality.
Neither the hon. Member for Bolton West nor the hon. Member for
Hartlepool said this, but a school that felt that it could do that in a
way that was regarded by learners, parents or others as being wholly
inadequate would be harshly judged. It would ill befit a school that
wanted to deliver the best for its pupils to try to secure
inappropriate, inadequate or unprofessional careers advice and
guidance, particularly when advice would be available from careers
professionals with the renewed professional standards that I have
described.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000176">&#160;</a>

kind of people and provided in the right kind of way. I say to the

hiding place if they fail to carry out what is expected of them or,
indeed, that they will try to concoct a cheapskate way of doing this? I
do not see that. I do not believe that of schools, and I certainly do
not believe it of heads and teachers. The Committee knows that I have
an elevated view of educators and it will take a lot to shake me from
that view, given that it is framed and informed by the inspirational
experience of seeing the transformation they make to young

provide such a service within schools are appropriately qualified is
some terribly over-prescriptive evil, particularly as we know that on a
sustained basis young people have not been receiving the quality advice
that they should. We are not changing heads. We are discussing a Bill.
For those involved in Bills, it might seem that it will change the
world, but for those outside, unless some special duty or bite is put
on them, it will not change much at all. My hon. Friend agrees with
licensing for those in the all-age careers service, so surely some
pressure to ensure that those providing the service within schools have
some form of appropriate qualification or capability is not
unreasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000180">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Under current arrangements, Connexions advisers are
expected to have achieved certain registered standards, but those who
provide careers advice and guidance in schools beyond their core
teaching qualifications do not have to have additional qualifications
to those issued by the Institute of Career Guidance or elsewhere. The
existing arrangements do not insist on additional professional training
or accreditation. Indeed, in the previous Government’s view that
was good enough. I do not believe that it is good enough, which is why
I am putting in place the all-age careers service, which will place
strong emphasis on professional standards that are being developed, as
I have described. While we are not being prescriptive, we are putting
strong emphasis on the all-age service’s high standards and the
need for schools to secure high quality, independent professional
careers advice and to show how they have done so. That goes a
considerable way down the road described. It goes much further than the
status quo, and it will deliver precisely what hon. Members want to

                           </strong> Let me just be absolutely clear. At present, when
giving careers advice and guidance, teachers do not have to have
additional careers qualifications above and beyond their core teaching
qualifications. I am arguing that, in the new all-age service,
professional standards will form part of that service, standards that
have been developed by the sector at the moment. However, I will go
further—we will certainly encourage schools to use qualified
advisers. I strongly endorse the view that a school that wants to have
the best possible outcomes for its pupils would look first to the
all-age service or other qualified
advisers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be a very odd school that acquired a service to meet the
statutory duty from someone with no history, qualifications or
accreditations in careers advice and guidance. How would that school be
judged? Would its governors allow that to happen and would its head
teacher want it? Would its parents stomach it and its learners agree to
it? Of course, they would not. What sort of world are we imagining?

years—have led to circumstances in which many young people did

schools not to use qualified individuals. Why does he not feel the need

the balance of responsibility from the centre to schools. It recognises
the immense human capital that exists in our schools, and which was
underutilised by the micro-managed, target-driven and bureaucratic
regime that preceded ours. That is not to say that that regime was not
without many virtues; clearly, it had many virtues. However, on
trusting schools to do what they think is right for their students, it
was inadequate. That is why the Bill makes the assumption—the
right assumption—that we should place faith in schools and
change the balance of
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000189">&#160;</a>

trusting schools to make those professional judgments about how they
best address their statutory duty based on the needs of their pupils,
we will draw to their attention best practice, as I described earlier;
we will use the advice available to us through the careers sector to
deliver the best professional standards; and we will market the new
service effectively. We already have a well received web-based product,
because many young people do not look first to a face-to-face contact
with an adviser, but to online or telephone sources of
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000190">&#160;</a>

mentioning that existing online products are very well received by
young people. Some 90% of users of the current internet-based service
were pleased with the service they received. Telephone users were even
more satisfied—99% said that the service was providing them with
good advice and guidance—so we are building on a model that has
strengths. The previous Government created the Next Step adult careers
service—at least, they laid the foundations. I suppose we
created it, because we rolled it out last summer, but the Next Step
service will also provide a useful foundation for what we plan to do
next, so there is existing good practice on which we are building. I do
not think that we need to be more prescriptive than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000191">&#160;</a>

understand the concerns behind amendments 97 and 98, which seek to
ensure information on academic and vocational options. I have already
made it clear that that is very close to my heart. It is vitally
important that young people have a thorough appreciation of all the

understand the various merits of each
route.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000192">&#160;</a>

country has been guilty in the past of a lamentable failure to provide
young people with a proper technical and practical education of a kind
that other nations can boast. For too long, we have lived with the myth
that the only form of prowess that counted came through academic
accomplishment. It is not a view that I share. It is not a myth that I
am prepared to perpetuate. Through the acquisition of practical

new section 42A(4) requires careers guidance for every young person to
include information on all post-16 options. It also addresses the point
about further education colleges and schools and the relationship
between the two. It states “including apprenticeships”.
This is sufficient to ensure that pupils receive information about all
academic and vocational options and are made aware of the fullest
possible range of routes open to them. In respect of amendment 97, I
can reassure members of the Committee that the definition of 
“16-18 education or training” options in
subsection (4)(b) has been used in previous careers
legislation and is accepted to include all academic and vocational
routes. My hon. Friend knows that I am as passionate as he is about
ensuring that people get balanced
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
restrict the careers guidance requirement to mainstream options, as
suggested by amendment 134, would introduce an element of discretion
for schools in deciding which options their pupils should be informed
about. I can only see this leading to a patchwork of options being made
available to young people, as schools would interpret the meaning of
“mainstream” options quite differently. The difficulty
with using “mainstream” in that more permissive way is
that it would perhaps lead to more inconsistency rather than more
clarity and consistency.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the heart
of this new duty also lies a recognition that teachers are not always
best placed to offer careers advice, particularly on vocational options
of which they have no prior experience. With all that is expected of
schools, it would be too much to ask them to keep up to date with the
latest information.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 96
would remove the requirement for independent careers guidance to be
presented in an impartial manner. Information, advice and guidance
should offer an insight into the benefits of different learning
options, but also tackle openly the differences between them.
Throughout this process, care must be taken to keep the best interests
of the young person in mind at all times and not undermine a route that
may be appropriate for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
the impartiality of careers guidance has been called into question.
Hon. Members will know that the Ofsted report, “Moving through
the system—information, advice and guidance”, which was
published last year, noted:<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
information, advice and guidance given were not always sufficiently
impartial about the options available to young people at the age of 16,
for example where secondary schools had their own sixth
forms.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is why we want to emphasise in the Bill the impartiality of advice that
is given about the available options. I understand that hon. Members
may feel that the word “impartial” is unnecessary if
careers guidance is already described elsewhere as independent.
However, impartiality counts as well as independence, and they are
different things.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000201">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As I understood it, the point made by the Chair of
the Select Committee was that the concern is the wording rather than
the impartiality. An impartial manner might not necessarily imply
impartiality. Is the Minister confident that the rest of Bill requires
impartiality and not simply an impartial
manner?<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000202">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes, certainly that will be emphasised in our
communications with schools. The provision is sufficient as worded, but
I will go further and emphasise 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 705<a class="bkMark" name="Column705">&#160;</a>
                           </div>impartiality in the terms mentioned by the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness. The Government are determined
to ensure that the advice is both impartial and
independent.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
assure hon. Members that in respect of amendment 135, the
requirement to provide information on all post-16 options to pupils
extends to those with special educational needs. I understand the point
that the hon. Member for Hartlepool has made. It is critical that we
place appropriate emphasis on the needs of people with particular and
sometimes challenging needs. I met people from Skill, which, as the
hon. Gentleman will know from his ministerial experience, is an
organisation that represents the interests of the people that he has
described. I am determined that in our words, and in the guidance that
we give, we emphasise the importance of ensuring that those with SEN
and other disabilities, needs and challenges are taken into full
account in advice about learning and career options. Too often,
learning options and employment opportunities for people with special
needs of one kind or another are stereotyped. We must challenge such
stereotypes in precisely the way that the hon. Gentleman has
identified.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government attach great importance to the measure. As I have said,
local authorities will retain their duty to provide targeted support to
young people and young adults with learning difficulties up to the age
of 25. Such support will include a responsibility for carrying out
learning difficulty assessments and should, of course, include a degree
of careers guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On amendment
128, in choosing post-16 options, young people must have an
understanding of where such options might lead at 18. Last week I
mentioned Lord Browne’s report on higher education, in which he
said that many prospective students do not receive adequate advice or
information to help them choose the right course of study. That is a
concern to the Government and that is why schools working in
partnership with expert, independent careers advisers will be at the
heart of the new arrangements. The CPA is establishing common
professional standards, and I firmly believe that professionally
trained careers advisers are the best placed people to provide detailed
guidance on the learning routes that are available to young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Proposed new
section 42A(4)(b) is clear about information on all post-16 options.
Those sources of information will contain different levels of advice on
the post-18 pathways, so careers advisers should have the discretion to
supplement that basic information with more in-depth guidance in
discussion with the young person concerned. The clause does not limit
careers guidance to post-16 education and training. Proposed new
section 42A (7) defines career
as<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“any
training, education, employment or occupation”,<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>so we would expect
young people to receive guidance on post-18 pathways. Indeed, many
elements of the advice that young people are given when they make
earlier decisions will have a direct impact on their progress post-18,
so there is a necessary synergy between the advice that is given about
different options before and after the age of
16.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, we need to be clear that guidance is independent and
impartial. We also need to be clear about the standards we will put
into place to ensure that

                           </div>it is of the right quality. All that will be an immense advance on where
we have been and where we are. On that basis, I urge the hon. Member
for Hartlepool to withdraw his amendment and my hon. Friend the Member
for Beverley and Holderness not to press his amendments to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000210">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister’s body language indicates that
he knows that he has lost the debate on this. My hon. Friends and the
Chair of the Education Committee had him on the ropes, certainly with
regards to amendment 146. I pay tribute to what my hon.
Friend the Member for Bolton West has done on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will start
by trying to be positive. The words that the Minister said on amendment
131 and work experience were positive. The rhetoric and warm words that
he used in respect of amendment 135 were also positive and a welcome
step. On amendment 136, it was useful and helpful to hear him say that
evidence will be used as a means of shaping policy. Given the example
of the Department for Education since May—on the education
maintenance allowance, Building Schools for the Future and school
sports partnerships—there has been a lack of evidence-based
policy. It is nice that there has been a departure from that approach
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
remains the case that there is a worrying trend from the Treasury
suggesting that, because young people use social networks, face-to-face
provision is not necessary and that online provision is sufficient.
Online provision is important and no one is disputing that, but some of
the phrases that the Minister used were worrying.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On amendment
128, I understand the Minister’s point that the clause is not
age restrictive as it stands. I think the amendment goes with the grain
of Government policy. The Minister for Universities and Science is
trying to ensure—and I understand where he is coming from,
although that is not a phrase I usually use—that students and
potential undergraduates are consumers. If they are spending in the
region of £27,000 on tuition fees, they want to ensure that they
get value for money, a first class education and that the pathways
after the degree will lead them to a fulfilling and, hopefully,
economically rewarding career. If he accepted amendment 128, the
Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning would be
working with the grain of the Minister for Universities and Science. It
may be that at the age of 14, an individual may want to do a particular
course and want to go down that route. It should be pointed out to that
individual at that time that employment rates for that course are, for
example, 10%. The adviser could say, “Unemployment is high, is
it worth thinking about another choice?” The amendment puts it
more explicitly than the Minister has suggested so
far.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will not press a number of my amendments, although I give notice to the
Minister that I want to test the opinion of the Committee on amendment
128. I urge my hon. Friends the Members for Walthamstow and for Bolton
West to ensure that amendment 146 is pressed to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000215">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Following the Minister’s remarks, I am
happy not to press my amendments. The debate on amendment 146 has given
the Government an opportunity to think some more on this. As we have
laid out, this 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 707<a class="bkMark" name="Column707">&#160;</a>
                           </div>external advice has to be impartial. The wording of
new section 42A(4) to the Education Act 1997 could be changed again so
it just says that the guidance must be impartial, that there must be
information on options and that the guidance must be in the best
interest of the pupils, specifying in addition that it must be provided
by someone who has the appropriate qualifications. That would finish
that section and bring it to completeness. I hope that the Government
think more on that. I am sure they will, given the Minister’s
openness. I am happy not to press my amendments, and I will vote
against the
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000216">&#160;</a>

about and genuine in his desire to improve careers education and
guidance for young people, I do not share his confidence that that
guidance will be provided to the standard that we all believe it should
be unless we ensure that it is provided by professionals. As the Chair
of the Education Committee also believes that it should be provided by
a careers professional, I hope that he will join us when I ask the

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
we ought to have introduced a qualification for careers teachers. The
Minister seemed to say that we needed such people to be properly
qualified and trained. Unfortunately, we did not introduce such a
qualification, but we did expect the external person coming in to give
careers guidance to be properly qualified. The Bill provides that such
a person cannot be employed by the school, but it is far more important
that the person has the requisite skills, knowledge, experience and
qualifications to deliver the guidance those young people so
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000218">&#160;</a>

hope that schools will automatically look at the all-age service is too
great a risk, in particular at times of financial austerity, when

all young people is essential, whether they attend a community,
foundation voluntary or foundation special school, or a pupil referral
unit. Given the Government’s intention to establish further

Committee that all new academies, through their funding agreements,
will be subject to a requirement to secure access to independent
careers guidance for their
pupils.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have always been clear that, while maintained schools are governed by
legislation, one of the defining features of academies is that they are
regulated contractually. A broad regulatory framework allows academies
to be flexible and innovative in their approach to raising standards.
Where maintained schools have important requirements, which we want to
replicate for academies, such as the duty to secure independent careers
advice, we will include that in future academy funding agreements. We
believe in the importance of choice and diversity in schools, and in
using funding agreements to ensure that academies meet important
requirements, which is a well established mechanism, also used by the
Government supported by the hon. Member for
Hartlepool.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will encourage existing academies to move to a new model funding
agreement containing that requirement. More important than such a
requirement, however, is practice on the ground. We have taken steps to
strengthen the evidence base to show the benefits of good careers
guidance and to improve the quality and status of the careers
profession, both of which should help to deliver better careers
guidance for pupils in all schools. I hope that that reassures the hon.
Gentleman and that he will withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000229">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a pleasure to speak on this group of
amendments; I notice that my amendment is the lead amendment. Amendment
75 seeks simply to add academies to list of schools. Thanks to the
ordering that you chose to follow, Mr Walker, the Minister has already
had the opportunity to explain that he is looking to include them in
the funding agreement rather than in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000230">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I wonder what the hon. Gentleman feels about
existing academies. This is a residual problem that occurs throughout
the Bill: the Government introduce measures that they think are
important for all schools to follow, but because they will do that only
through the funding mechanism for new academies, they are unable to do
anything about existing academies.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000231">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There are opportunities to talk to those schools,
and I imagine that funding agreements may be amended, perhaps with
mutual agreement. It is hard to believe that existing academies are so
dead set against the provision of decent careers advice that they will
resist such negotiations. The inheritance creates some anomalies, but
part of the whole idea of academies as set up by the hon.
Gentleman’s Administration was to give them greater independence
so that we are less tempted to prescribe every last thing that they
should do.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My feeling
was as a point of principle. Where we have an issue that lies outside
the basic provision of education within a school and where the
institutional interest of a school is set against the individual
interest of a pupil, we may choose to legislate and lay down in the law
the requirements on academies, and that would not necessarily be in
breach of the general view that we should tell it what we want from it
but not necessarily how to do it. The Minister has made it clear in
this strangely ordered debate that he will rely on funding mechanisms,
and I would hope and expect, in answering the shadow Minister’s
point, that within a short time, all schools, including existing
academies, will have the responsibility accepted in their funding
agreements.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000233">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In respect of existing academies, there may be a
risk that the proprietor and the head teacher will think that it
imposes unnecessary bureaucracy and a burden on his or her work load to
arrange and negotiate a new funding agreement, which may include, among
other things, revised guidance and criteria on careers advice. What
nudge factors will the Minister deploy to ensure that it is in the
interest of the proprietor and the head teacher of an academy to go for
a revised funding agreement, given the work, negotiation and time that
that would
take?<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000234">&#160;</a>

for Beverley and Holderness; as someone once said, the first shall be
last and the last shall be first. Both he and the hon. Member for
Hartlepool make an important point about open academies. We will
communicate to them the changes that will be made by the Bill and
reiterate the importance of policies such as the need to have
independent careers advice and guidance. Of course, academies will be
subject to the destinations measure that was referred to by my hon.
Friend the Minister, which will provide information to parents on the
effectiveness of academies in preparing their students to move on to
positive destinations. We will encourage academies to move to the new
model funding agreement, which will bring with it a number of
advantages. Existing academies may find them advantageous, and if they
move on to a new funding agreement, they will have the provisions. I
think that answers the questions of both my hon. Friend and the hon.
Member for Hartlepool about how we expect the duty to be applied to
existing
academies.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000235">&#160;</a>

responsible authorities must ensure that all providers of independent
careers guidance have access on request to information on the
educational progress of pupils in order to assist them in the guidance
they
provide.’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall be brief. This amendment seeks to ensure that independent
providers of careers guidance must have access to information held by
schools on the educational progress of pupils to assist them in
providing guidance to that student. Under clause 27 as it currently
stands, there may be an issue for schools as to how much information
may be shared with independent service providers who provide careers
advice to young people. To provide an effective and comprehensive level
of support and guidance to a young person in terms of their future
prospects, realistic capabilities and options, it seems common sense
that service providers are given some level of academic information.
This would include information such as projected results for that young
person, attendance records, punctuality and perhaps even details on
extracurricular activity, in certain circumstances. All this would
assist in offering more accurate and detailed advice to a young
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We accept
that there should be limitations on information sharing. Information
held by schools on matters such as personal or health issues should not
be provided. If the young person chooses to volunteer this information,
that would be a matter for that individual and perhaps his or her
parents. Clear guidance would need to be set out before implementation
to ensure that only relevant information would be made
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
specifies that the information be made available to a service provider
on request and therefore would not simply give that service provider
infinite unrequested data. The service provider would need to make a
request to the school concerned; as a result of that request a decision
would be made about whether the information would be released. I hope
the Minister will accept the amendment, which is probing in its nature.
It also addresses an important point about providing requisite data in
order to provide comprehensive and personalised advice for young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000264">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I share the hon. Gentleman’s view that
careers advisers require access to data about young people, including
information on their educational progress 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 711<a class="bkMark" name="Column711">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and, indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said, extra-curricular activities and
interests, in order to provide effective guidance that is in the best
interests of the individual pupil. However, primary legislation should
be restricted to those areas where it is absolutely necessary, and if a
school chooses to form a partnership with a specialist careers guidance
provider, then we should trust them to make sure that that partnership
delivers the maximum possible benefit to pupils. There is no reason
that schools would not want to co-operate with careers advisers in this
way. They already work with a number of agencies in other areas,
including health and social care, for the good of the children at the
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that a school is best placed to know the needs of their pupils.
Because this duty is on the school and it is the school that has the
information, there is no need therefore in primary legislation to
require any form of data sharing in order to fulfil this duty. On that
basis, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000266">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Is the Minister able to anticipate a scenario,
which was touched on earlier in Committee, where there might be a
question mark over the independence of careers advice? The Chair of the
Education Committee has well highlighted that further education
providers do not have access to schools. In circumstances of impartial,
independent advice being provided via the conduit of independent
service providers, will it be possible for the head teacher to restrict
access to data, because he or she might think that pupils were going to
an alternative FE college as opposed to a school sixth-form college.
How will the Minister stop the risk of that
occurring?<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The head teacher is obliged to maintain the
confidentiality of those data within the school, except where explicit
provisions in statute require the sharing of data—for example,
data held at local authority level—that might help the
Department provide destinations measures. There is a case for
data-sharing in those circumstances. Ultimately, the school record and
the details of the progress of a pupil at a school are confidential to
that
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause has a requirement that the school provides impartial advice. The
examples that have been given relate to existing statutory provisions,
in which there is no similar requirement about providing impartial
advice. We will require schools to provide access to independent advice
in the interests of the child. If the school needs to provide those
data to do that, the school will of course do so. The scenario painted
by the hon. Gentleman is one that the clause is designed to address. It
is best addressed by the clause, rather than by having external
advisers who are somehow able, by statute, to obtain the school records
of any pupil whom they would like to take part in a course at their
institution.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000269">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will deal relatively quickly with amendment 130, which seeks to extend
the age at which a young person can seek careers advice to 18. That
would be consistent with the raising of the participation age to 18 by
2015, and would provide a young person with appropriate careers advice
up to and including 18. I welcome submission E 86 on the matter from
the Department for Education, which the Committee received last week at
4.34 pm. It confirmed that the Department intends to consult on the
issue and, subject to the outcome of that consultation, lay regulations
to ensure that all young people will have access to careers guidance up
to the age of 18. That is something I wanted, and which I announced in
the publication of the information, advice and guidance strategy
“Quality, Choice and Aspiration” 18 months
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is disappointing that little progress has been made since that
announcement, but I welcome what was provided by the Department last
week. Will the Minister set out a definitive time scale on the
consultation and explain when he expects to lay regulations? Can he
also say in what circumstances an extension to 18 would not be a good
and positive step? It would be useful to know such
details.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000299">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
come now to amendment 129. As drafted, the clause requires that the
careers service should be provided when a pupil reaches the age of 14.
There is a strong argument that that age is too high and, to engage
young people effectively, suitable, appropriate and personalised
careers advice information is needed much earlier. That could be at
secondary school, but there is equally a relevant case for appropriate
suitable careers advice at primary school—something that I
pushed for under the IAG strategy in 2009.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000300">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Such a service
would provide young people with context and a degree of experience that
would inform their subject choices and options at the age of 14 onwards
rather than a big bang approach, in which options come simultaneously
with careers advice and they do not have sufficient time to reflect on
what is appropriate for them. We have chosen the age of 12. It could be
earlier than that, but I should like to know the Minister’s
thinking about an appropriate age for young people to receive careers
advice, perhaps in primary school, but certainly below the age of
14.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000301">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to use the amendment to probe the
Minister’s thinking on how the service in schools will fit with
the all-age careers service. That is important, given the issues of age
that we are debating. My hon. Friends have already expressed worry
about what is happening to careers guidance. Can the Minister give us
more information about the commissioning of the all-age careers
service? Furthermore, given the announcement yesterday about the new
bursary scheme for 16 to 18-year-olds, can he give us more details
about it? Some news agencies were speculating that money was being
taken out of the all-age careers service funding to bolster the
replacement to
EMAs.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000302">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Like other members of the Committee, I should be
interested to hear the Minister’s thinking on such matters.
Alison Wolf said explicitly in her report that it was appropriate for
young people aged 14 to be going into FE colleges. Tens of thousands of
young people are already doing so. Only a small number are full time,
so the age of 14 sounds a little late if people will be making
decisions that could have such an impact later in their
lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000303">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I draw the Committee’s attention to
evidence sent to us by Paul Jackson, the chief executive of
EngineeringUK. That piece of evidence, along with several other copies
of evidence, encouraged the Committee to consider reducing the age
below that of 14 years. On the subject of careers advice, he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“At
the moment there is a huge deficit in this area. Engineering is such a
massive discipline involving careers that span nanotechnology on one
side to big infrastructure build on the other. All too often career
choices are made too late in the day at school to enable many school
age children to enter the profession. Also, particularly with girls, we
find that they can be really excited by engineering as a subject in
their early school years, but are often put off by the image of the
profession when they come to make crucial subject
choices.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">Careers
advice could and should play a very significant part in changing the
mindset of school age children about how to select their GCSE topics.
There is no doubt that independent careers advice at 14-16 is often too
late in terms of our discipline, and we would urge the government to
free up the pipeline of entrants into the industry by committing to
earlier careers
advice.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000353">&#160;</a>

Committee should pay attention to that. We know that the future of our
country and prosperity is linked to how we grow manufacturing and build
on our engineering skills, particularly high-tech engineering. If
professionals say that it is too late to give people careers advice at
age 14, and that we will miss out on a raft of young people who would
be excellent engineers and help the country’s prosperity to
grow, we should listen to those
professionals.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000305">&#160;</a>

length about this matter, but I wanted yet again to point out some of
the peculiarities of the middle school system as it relates to the
clause. I disagree with putting the age of advice at 12, and I am in
favour of raising it to 13. At 13, young people in Somerset are in year
8, which is the last year of a four-year period at middle school. By
then they are well known by teachers and head teachers, and it seems
extremely appropriate for young people to be given good, independent
advice by someone who has known them for a long time. The difficulty
with making that decision a year later is that sometimes a pupil has
moved into senior school, and that is the time when they are least
known.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000306">&#160;</a>

different systems in different places. In Leicestershire, middle
schools cover a different period that goes from age 10 to 14. In
Somerset they go from age nine to 13. I would change amendment 130 to
read “19” in some cases, rather than
“18”.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000308">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The majority of those children are 13. The period in
question comes at the end of four years of being known by a particular
school. One of the advantages of doing such things in the middle school
system is that those students and their teachers and head teachers have
no interest in using the financial incentive that comes at a later
stage, when the money follows the student and provides an incentive for
the head teacher to keep that young person as a result of making
subject choices that may affect their future career, or may stop them
going on to college. As far as I am concerned, all subject choices are
career choices. Such choices should be made at 13, and that should
continue on to
19.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000312">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will speak to amendments 129 and 130, which
concern the age range of young people who should receive access to
independent careers guidance. I agree with the hon. Member for
Hartlepool that careers guidance should not simply cease once a young
person reaches the age of 16, and neither should access to guidance
cease at the age of 18. As we have discussed, we are establishing
arrangements for the provision of careers guidance to ensure that young
people and adults have access to expert impartial guidance
throughout

post-16, and we have record levels of post-16 participation. However,
we still face high drop-out rates—the UK is ranked 28th out of
30 OECD countries on participation at 17. I agree with members of the
Committee that the decisions that young people make during the 16 to 18
phase of education are just as critical to their realising their
potential as the decisions that they make
pre-16.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
previous Administration, in the information, advice and guidance
strategy that they published in 2009, set out their intention to
consult on extending the careers education duty to cover young people
up to the age of 18 attending schools and institutions in the
further education sector. We are amending existing delegated powers to
allow us to take a similar course of action in respect of this new
duty. We intend to consult on the issue and, subject to the outcome of
that consultation, introduce regulations to ensure that all young
people attending schools and further education institutions have access
to high-quality careers guidance up to the age of 18 in future. In
answer to the specific question of when, the consultation process will
begin in the
summer.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000314">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the question of the earliest age at which pupils should be subject to
independent careers guidance, I accept that a cogent argument can be
made in support of commencing the duty at the beginning of the
secondary phase of education. I will come to the point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Wells about middle schools in a moment. After
all, careers guidance should not be a one-off stand-alone experience
for a young person. It is an ongoing process by which young people are
supported to make the decisions that are right for them and are helped
to gain the skills to make effective decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I firmly
believe that the provision of personalised guidance to individuals is
unlikely to be of huge benefit before the age of 13, because the first
major decision point relates to post-16 options. Independent, impartial
guidance in the year leading up to those decisions is far more likely
to have a positive impact on a young person. A 2010 Department for
Education study demonstrated that the effect of careers guidance on
young people’s attitudes to schools and intentions to remain in
education is strongest at that age group.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000316">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The focus in
the early years of secondary education is rightly on making a
successful transition from primary school and gaining a good grounding
in the national curriculum subjects, all of which will help a young
person to get more out of their careers guidance at 13. That does not
mean that pupils will not benefit from some careers guidance before the
age of 14, or even 13. In providing schools with greater freedoms and
flexibilities, we trust professionals to make decisions about how best
to use their resources to meet the needs of their pupils. Schools must
have the freedom to decide how they want to introduce their pupils to
the world of work as part of their time at
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000317">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> For the children most likely to be disaffected and
most likely to end up in youth unemployment, the signs of
disaffection are likely to have emerged by the age of 12 and 13.

biggest impact later, for some children and those who are being failed
by the system now, there is a strong case for providing advice at 14,
or at least showing what options the FE and university technical
colleges have to offer. Age 14 may be in the mix at the moment, but, as
originally conceived, the starting point was
14.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000318">&#160;</a>

the Member for Wells about middle schools. I have taken on board her
points about the importance of young people receiving appropriate
guidance before they make choices about their options, which may in
some circumstances happen earlier than year 9. She has made a forceful
argument, both here and outside the Committee, although I would like to
know how widespread an issue it really is. The hon. Member for
Hartlepool rightly pointed out that we have made a commitment to
consult on extending the age range for the duty to 18, which was in the
note about exercising the regulatory powers under the clause. I am
happy for the consultation to go one stage further than I have set out

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an important point about very
small schools with mixed ages. The clause
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000321">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“For

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to address the question of whether the age of 14, as specified in
the clause, should be reduced to 12. I think that that would be
extreme, because that would mean that pupils will start at the age of
11. Far better, and more interesting, is the proposal of my hon. Friend
the Member for Wells, which applies when the majority of pupils in the
class attain the age of 13. That means that there will be pupils who
are 12 starting that academic year, but they will reach 13 during the
year, which is in year 8. I am happy to say to my hon. Friend the
Member for North Cornwall that we will extend the consultation to look
at extending it not just beyond 16, but down to year 8. However, I want
to see how wide a demand there is for such an extension to the

legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032947000323">&#160;</a>

will it be, and when does summer end? Will it be in October? May I

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister did not take amendment 129 in the spirit in which it was
intended. As I said, it was a means to probe Government thinking on a
wider debate about whether adequate, relevant and suitable careers
advice could be provided for younger people, perhaps in primary
schools. As I said, at the age of eight, I wanted to be an astronaut,
and I was not suggesting that I sit down with a careers adviser.

with a careers adviser to complete my application to NASA is somewhat
over the top. I would make a wider point about having a personalised
basis. If someone were interested in being an astronaut, advisers could
take into account concerns about science, chemistry and physics and
tailor an experience that would be relevant to them. I think that that
would be an appropriate way. The amendments were of a probing nature,
and I do not want to press them to a Division, so I beg to ask leave to
