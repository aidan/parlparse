                           </span> If I understood the hon. Member
for Bedford—he will correct me if I am wrong—we are
ironically almost in a situation where I am arguing for commercially
negotiated agreements and he is arguing against them. That is not the
usual position in which we would find ourselves, as he is a great

enterprise.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000026">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
reasoning behind all this is simply that there have been allegations on
both sides, as has been well documented by Hooper. On the one hand, the
competitors of Royal Mail have felt that prices have not been fixed in
their favour, and on the other hand, Royal Mail has felt that prices
were not helpful to Royal Mail. The idea behind the amendment is that
these types of negotiation should be commercial negotiations so that
they make sense in the context of the real world. That is the purpose
of the amendment and it links in with the previous amendment to which I
spoke, although it approaches the issue the other way
round.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000027">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The hon. Lady has an excellent
memory of our discussions earlier. I understand the intent of her
amendment, and she is correct to say that there should be a balance,
but does she not understand that the impact of the amendment would be
that the balance would move substantially against those who may be
thought of as providing competitive services? I stress again to her
that we did talk about getting the balance right, in terms of the
relationship between post offices and the Royal Mail where there is an
imbalance of power, as she asserted. Will she not accept that without
any agreement or understanding between the competitive providers and
the Royal Mail, leaving the matter to commercial negotiations would be
like sending the competitor to the slaughter at the hands of a private
monopoly—or a public
monopoly?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000028">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> That is a very difficult question to answer. I
think that Hooper summed it up rather nicely in his report when he came
down on the issue very ambivalently,
saying:<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
regulator has to be able to take effective action to regulate a market
which has room for competition with the benefits competition can bring,
and to deregulate and take other action where appropriate to ensure
that the universal service is
sustainable.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000428">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
am not sure whether that really gives us the answer to the question. We
are trying to create a situation in which it is practical for Royal
Mail to carry on with universal service provision but it is possible
for competitors to come in. I would hope that by allowing commercial
negotiation, but also putting in safeguards for the universal service
provision, competitors would be able to come in, but I can understand
what the hon. Gentleman is saying.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I suppose
that if a regulator were very biased or veered too far towards helping
the provider of the universal service obligation, that could be very
unfair. The accusation by some of the competitor organisations has been
about whether they would be subsidising an inefficient Royal Mail, or
something of that nature. The regulator will have to be very careful,
but I would have thought that the regulator would not want to get that

the other amendments in the group. Amendment 108 to clause 40 proposes
inserting at the end of subsection (1):<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“OFCOM

                        <p>The
purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the opportunities for
cherry-picking the services within the universal service are minimised.
It prioritises the delivery of the whole universal service over the
provision of a particular service. For example, it would prevent a
postal provider from securing a limited delivery service in a highly
profitable area while leaving the universal service provider to provide
deliveries in the remaining areas at greater cost. The funding of the
universal service is a complex arrangement. Such studies as have been
undertaken on how much of a burden the cost actually is seem to be
contradictory. What has certainly been mentioned in Hooper and in
Committee is the need—<em>[</em>

                        <p class="tabbed">How
much of a burden is involved is a complex matter, partly because of the
lack of sufficiently clear accounting—an issue that has been
raised in Committee and by Hooper. We need much clearer accounting, so
as to single out the cost of the universal service provision. The exact
effect of another provider offering a partial service, while obliging
the universal service provider to sustain the whole service, is
difficult to state. We know from experience of the current access
regime that failing to protect the universal provider can make it
vulnerable to cherry-picking by competitors. Amendment 108 therefore
offers protection to the universal service provider. Some hon. Members
might think that we are being too protective, but protecting the
service is an absolute priority for us, as is its viability, so that it
remains accessible for all of
us.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
112 would insert into clause 48, at the end of subsection
(4):<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000038">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>That
is fairly self-explanatory, and reflects the same arguments that were
made for the other amendments in the group; it is about ensuring that
the universal service provider can carry on providing the universal
service, despite competition for parts of the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
sum up the importance of what the regulator will be doing in this
respect, I go back to the Hooper report of 2008. Without reiterating
the quite complex arguments explaining the good and the bad from all
points of view, Hooper clearly said that
the<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000040">&#160;</a>

of competition with the risks to the universal service.

primary
duty.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000431">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our
amendments should strengthen that position. We understand that the
access regime has brought benefits and should be continued, but there
is a need to review the way in which that access or headroom works. We
must also bear in mind that the regulator has the important role of
preserving the universal service, and that should be his primary
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000041">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In the evidence sessions, we
heard from Royal Mail and other operators that establishing a fair
access regime would be critical for the new regime. When I was
reviewing the 2009 Bill provisions, it seemed that the key was to get
the right balance between protecting the universal service—a
matter rightly stressed by the hon. Lady—and allowing all the
benefits brought by competition and enabling deregulation. To be fair
to the hon. Lady, she has acknowledged that we are involved in a
balancing act, and getting it right is not a science but a
judgment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should be absolutely clear to the Committee, as we were in our policy
statement, that the Government are committed to encouraging competition
in the postal service market. We have not moved away from that. That is
absolutely critical, but it cannot happen at the expense of a universal
service. That is the prime objective, so we have to manage and
encourage competition in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree with the sentiments behind the amendments: nothing Ofcom does
should undermine the universal service. However, that is exactly what
we have provided for in the Bill. We have made those judgments, and we
think that the Bill gets it right. All the amendments would add to the
Bill something that is already catered for in the
drafting—except the first part of amendment 95, and I
will come back to that. I wish to reassure members of the Committee
that I have looked carefully at the wording of amendment 106 to see
whether it would add anything of substance to the Bill, because, as I
say, I agree entirely with the sentiment behind it. I ask hon. Members
to turn their minds back to last Tuesday evening, when we discussed
Ofcom’s overarching duty to secure the provision of the
universal service. It is that prism through which Ofcom will view all
its regulatory decisions. It will always have to go back to clause
28(1), in particular, which states
that<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“OFCOM
must carry out their functions in relation to postal services in a way
that they consider will secure the provision of a universal postal
service.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000432">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
provision is not optional; it is not something that Ofcom does on day
one and no other day, and it is not something that it does on some days
and not others. It is what it has to bear in mind the whole time.
Therefore, all decisions that Ofcom will have to take about post will
have to begin and end with the question, “Does this help secure
the universal postal
service?”<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
fact, clause 28(2) makes specific reference to Ofcom’s power to
impose access conditions, so the clause that tells Ofcom that its
primary duty is to secure the universal service refers to how it should
go about that, in setting the access conditions. That reinforces the
fact that Ofcom’s power to impose such conditions is subordinate
to its requirement to secure the universal service. Indeed, Ofcom would
be in breach of its statutory duties if it applied any access
conditions that undermined the universal service. We deliberately made
that change to last year’s Bill to meet concerns such as those
that members of the Committee have expressed today. I hope that the
hon. Lady will accept that the way in which we designed the clauses has
strengthened the commitment to the universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000046">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
might ask, as I did, “If the wording in amendment 106 does not
contradict Ofcom’s duties, why not insert it for good
measure?” The problem with adding wording for good measure is
that it rarely has the desired effect; it can often have the opposite
effect. My concern is that the additional wording would confuse and
might undermine what is already clearly set out. It is therefore
unnecessary. Highlighting the duty to secure the universal service in
relation to one of the regulatory controls that the Bill gives to Ofcom
could be interpreted as undermining its application to Ofcom’s
other powers under part 3. I am sure that none of us would want that to
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The same
arguments apply to amendment 112. Ofcom’s duty to protect the
universal service applies whenever it considers imposing access
conditions, so I hope that the hon. Lady recognises that the additional
wording is unnecessary, and that she will not press the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 108
is slightly different from the others in the group. My understanding is
that it seeks to clarify that Ofcom could use clause 40 if it felt that
another postal operator was putting the universal service at risk by
cherry-picking a universal service provider’s more profitable
elements and providing a significantly reduced standard, by delivering
letters on only two days a week, for example.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again, I have
a great deal of sympathy with the intent behind amendment 108. I have
been clear at every stage of debate on the Bill that although I fully
support fair and open competition in the postal service market, it
cannot be at the expense of the universal service. I do not believe
that the amendment would help in the way that the hon. Lady suggests
that it might; on the contrary, it might have some extremely
undesirable unintended consequences. In common with the amendments that
we have just discussed, and for exactly the same reason, I believe that
amendment 108 would call into question the overarching application of
clause 28, and the extent to which that primary duty on Ofcom applies
to its other functions under part 3, which would be deeply unhelpful.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that the amendment would be compatible with
the
directive.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was mindful of cherry-picking when we were designing the Bill and
revising the 2009 Bill, and we shall discuss that in more detail when
we reach clause 40. This morning, I discussed the importance of clause
40(2), which will provide Ofcom with the power to impose conditions to
prevent cherry-picking by other postal providers working within the
scope of the universal service. We shall debate that in greater detail
later, but I refer to it now because it demonstrates that the hon.
Lady’s amendment, which was designed to deal with
cherry-picking, is not needed—other parts of the Bill deal with
such
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000051">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thought that we had dealt with that this morning.
Under clause 34, Ofcom may decide to designate more than one universal
service provider. Such a situation would occur only in two strictly
limited circumstances: if there were a postal administration order,
which would be an emergency situation, or if, under clauses 42 and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 622<a class="bkMark" name="Column622">&#160;</a>
                           </div>43, Ofcom decided that there was an unfair burden and wanted to remedy
that by using the procurement option. Under the procurement option,
measures would have to be taken and conditions set out to ensure that
if there were more than one universal service provider—it is
worth pointing out that just because one goes to the procurement
option, it does not automatically mean that it will result in more than
one universal service provider—they would have to work together
to ensure that a universal service was provided across the whole of the
United Kingdom. Part 3 makes that clear and builds on clause
34.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I mentioned
amendment 95 earlier, because it is a bit different in that it would
prevent Ofcom from stepping in to mandate access. I agree that access
arrangements should be negotiated on commercial terms between Royal
Mail and other operators. Indeed, that is exactly how the current
access arrangements came into being and because Ofcom has a presumption
against intervention—it may not impose an access condition
unless tests are met—that is what we expect to happen in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of clause 37 is to enable Ofcom to step in, if those commercial
discussions have failed. That is not always as widely understood as it
should be. Ofcom can step in only if it appears that to do so is
appropriate for promoting efficiency and effective competition and
conferring significant benefits on users. These are tough tests, so it
will not be a free-for-all by any stretch of the imagination.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
pointing out to those who have expressed concern that these are the
same tests that must be met in the regulatory framework that applies to
communications more generally. For the past seven years, since the
Communications Act 2003 came into force, Ofcom has been working with
these tests and using the tools to enable access, where appropriate, to
the BT network. Consumers and competition have, without doubt,
benefited from that, and we have seen improved access to a wider range
of services and exposure to competition. That has made BT more able to
compete with the new entrants, and it is a better business as a result
of that competition. Everyone can benefit, but the question is about
getting the structure right. The way in which we have set out the three
tests in subsection (4) is robust, which shows how the commitment to
the universal service with respect to access conditions will roll
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
intention of the three tests—taken together with Ofcom’s
general duty in respect of post and the requirement that any regulation
it imposes must be objectively justifiable, non-discriminatory,
proportionate and transparent—is to focus regulation, laser-beam
like, on economic bottlenecks. By that I mean access to Royal
Mail’s final-mile delivery network. Royal Mail, as I am sure
that the Committee is aware, currently delivers 99% of all letters in
the UK, so while there continues to be a monopoly, the regulator should
be able to step in. The Bill ensures that the regulator can do so only
in a limited set of circumstances, but it is important that it can step
in to ensure that there is no dominance. If Ofcom did not have those
powers, there would be a danger that we would snuff out competition. I
believe that we have the balance right. Ofcom needs to be able to come
in to protect the competitors without over-regulating the universal
service provider. If Ofcom did not have the ability to step in to
mandate access, there is a risk that dominance would go unchallenged
and,

that the amendment should remove such important protections. Certainly

intention. Given that our approach was included in last year’s

amendment 106, it was nearly accepted, but not quite—I wonder
what it did wrong not to win the Minister’s approval. If the
will is there, it seems unhelpful of the Minister not to want to
include our amendments. It would make a change, now and again, in the
spirit of Christmas, to take one or two on board. I want to press
amendment 106 to the vote, because it exactly expresses our
meaning.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Hooper
clearly made the point that talking about the Royal Mail is different
from talking about some other utilities, which have huge infrastructure
costs. There are aspects of the networks of enterprises such as the
national grid or BT that are very difficult for anyone else to
replicate. The point made by Hooper in his report was that something
like 70% of the costs of Royal Mail are labour. It is footwork, as it
were.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Indeed, the
hon. Member for Bedford has mentioned other people being able to do
something about the final mile. Hooper says that that, combined with
the falling mail volumes, puts the Royal Mail in a tricky position with
respect to the universal service obligation. It is probably easier for
competitors to walk in and compete than it is in the fields of some
other utilities, where the infrastructure needed is so great that they
cannot simply set up and
participate.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
Hooper has made that point, I feel that we are justified in trying to
protect the provider that has the universal service obligation, because
there are additional costs and responsibilities in comparison with any
competitor who comes along to do the nice
bits.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000063">&#160;</a>

commercial matter in amendment 95, the Hooper report made the point,
which I have outlined, about a slightly different situation from that
of the utilities—a situation that it is slightly easier to push
in on. Therefore I do not think that the amendment is as detrimental as
the Minister has suggested. The other amendments relate to later
clauses, so I will finish my comments on that note, but we should
certainly press the amendments to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000067">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That looks like a large number of amendments,
but they are all similar in meaning. The amendments to schedule 3 are
simply a logical implementation of the amended clause 37. I will not,
therefore, need to speak to each individual amendment, but I will give
a general
overview.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Essentially,
we are looking at price controls. The amendments are similar to those
we have just been talking about, but they would take out of the Bill
the insistence on price controls because we have talked about the
commercially negotiated way of doing things and see that as the way
forward. Any agreement on access to the universal service provider
could be made on a commercial basis, and the regulator would always
have regard to the need to preserve the universal service obligation
and to ensure that that did not in any way suffer. If we are to have
that, logically we need to amend the parts of the clauses and related
schedules that refer to price controls. It is not that we are
suggesting that, for example, there is something wrong with the
schedules themselves. The principle is that if we are not going to have
those price controls expressed in that way, those elements of the Bill
become unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not want
to repeat at great length the arguments we have been through this
morning and this afternoon, but the idea of each of the amendments is
to remove those sections of the Bill that refer to price control.
Amendment 107 would remove subsections (5) to (7) of clause 37. That
same idea is reflected in amendment 113, which would take out of clause
57 the chunk that refers to price controls. Amendment 114 likewise
would take a chunk out of clause 57, removing subsection (13). The same
thing happens in the amendments to the schedules. We are proposing to
delete paragraph (3) in schedule 3 to the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The logic of
the amendments is exactly as I have described. Given that the Committee
has heard a lot about that, I will finish on that
note.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not surprised that the hon. Lady has been
brief on this occasion, because this set of amendments is unsurprising.
They remove important protections for consumers and the rest of the
market, which the Opposition included in the 2009 Bill when they were
in power. If I may pre-empt any intervention from the
Opposition—particularly from the hon. Member for Kingston upon
Hull East—the need for the protection of competition, which
these amendments removes, is strengthened, because Royal Mail could end
up entirely in private hands under this Bill. The hon. Lady has got
herself into rather an odd position. When they were in government, the
Opposition wanted regulation for a state-owned Royal Mail, but they are
now arguing that there should be no

                           </div>regulation for a privatised Royal Mail. That is rather an interesting
position, so I am not surprised that the hon. Lady has been briefer in
support of these
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
group of amendments would remove Ofcom’s ability to impose price
controls through access conditions. Clause 37 ensures that proper
protections are in place in the event that a dominant player abuses its
position in the market, as we heard in discussing the previous group of
amendments to the clause. It may be that Ofcom never has to use the
powers under the clause; indeed, there are a number of hurdles that
Ofcom will have to overcome before using them. In the previous debate,
I made reference to subsection (4), which sets out some of those
obstacles. If Ofcom could overcome those obstacles, it would make sense
for it to use those powers, but it is properly constrained in the Bill.
I discussed the circumstances in which Ofcom might have to step in to
mandate access, and I will not go over that again. They are a limited
set of circumstances, and decisions will be viewed through the prism of
the fundamental duty to secure the universal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
reminding the Committee that Ofcom can only mandate access where it is

has got the balance right between protecting the universal service and
competition, to which we keep having to return. The hon. Lady’s

Opposition’s muddled thinking on the value of regulation in
nurturing competition and the problems of regulation in stifling
competition. I know that for Opposition Members, the idea of a public
sector monopoly and bureaucratic fiat is preferable to freedom of
choice and competition. There are some specific issues that the
Minister was right to put in the Bill—we need to have them
explicitly set out. Will he confirm that without the protection in
subsection (5)(b), there is a potential for Royal Mail to manipulate
prices so that competition is snuffed out, as there might not be enough
margin to play with between wholesale and retail
prices?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000126">&#160;</a>

just ahead of me—I am about to discuss that part of the clause.
It speaks to the need for Ofcom to have such powers, and I want to

the amendments would be to
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000127">&#160;</a>

part of an access condition. If Ofcom had sweeping powers, perhaps one
could understand the need to restrain them, but we are talking about
limited circumstances where Ofcom can use such price controls. It
absolutely cannot do so unless it appears to it that the provider
concerned—Royal Mail in the case of clause 37, but it could be
any operator under clause
48—<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p>These are restricted
conditions, but if there was a danger of such a price squeeze to snuff
out competition, one would expect Ofcom to have the power to act. That
is why we have put it in the

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am quite surprised that the hon. Lady wants to take that power away
from Ofcom, particularly as the Bill is privatising Royal Mail. In many
other amendments in other clauses, Opposition Members were worried that
a privatised Royal Mail could seek to abuse its position. This is not
terribly consistent with the story we have been hearing so
far.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me finish by asking this: what might happen if Royal Mail abused its
position and Ofcom did not have such a power? Prices for bulk customers
could go up, meaning that more of them—such as insurance
companies, banks and utilities—would move their mail away or
communicate electronically through the internet. That would further
damage a declining
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000131">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Is the Minister suggesting that there would be
some sort of price cartel—that Royal Mail’s commercial
competitors would negotiate prices with it and fix them artificially
high?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000132">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No—quite the reverse. It is Royal Mail that
would have the dominant position and would seek to exploit it. The
competitors, however much they clubbed together, would be in a weak
negotiating position compared with Royal Mail—if it sought to
abuse its position and Ofcom did not have the powers that the hon.
Lady’s amendment, if accepted, would remove. If Ofcom did not
have those powers, access operators and private competitors would be
forced out of business. Some may think that a really good thing, but I
believe that appropriate competition that supports the universal
service is good for consumers, driving efficiency and
innovation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000133">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I accept that
it has been a testing situation for Royal Mail, but that is one reason
why we have done some modest rebalancing in the Bill towards the
universal service provider, compared with the 2009 Bill. We have taken
account of the evidence gathered by Sir Richard Hooper and of the
concerns expressed in our oral evidence sessions by Royal Mail, the
Communication Workers Union and others. We have got the balance right,
but the hon. Lady has gone to the other extreme. In all conscience, we
could not take so many powers away from Ofcom and leave a private
universal service provider in a position to abuse its
dominance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have been clear that Ofcom’s powers are limited and that we
prefer that Ofcom is required to regulate, particularly in the
authorisation regime, by showing bias towards deregulation, which it
has a track record of doing as a regulator. It has to ensure that it
does not intervene in the market between private players, be they the
universal service provider of postal services and another postal
operator in this case, or be they other players that it regulates in
other markets. In its DNA, Ofcom is designed to be a regulator that
does not try to over-regulate. It is therefore a very appropriate
regulator for Britain’s postal market today. Where competition
is well embedded, it will enable more and more
deregulation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is why the hon. Lady’s amendments are rather unwise. Although we
are moving in the direction of more competition and more deregulation,

                           </div>clear signal that we want to go as fast as competition will
allow—with a regulator whose DNA has a bias towards
deregulation—we still need to ensure that the universal service
provider, which certainly has a dominant position, cannot abuse that
dominance. That is the fundamental balance that we have sought to
strike. We have got it right; the amendments would take us in
completely the wrong direction. Let me rephrase that—they would
go too far and lead to an abuse of dominance, which we cannot
accept.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000136">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister has made some useful points, and he
seems to understand that we see the protection of the universal service
provision as very important. He feels that there are several safeguards
to ensure that the regulator behaves in the most appropriate way. We
are not entirely convinced, but there are now opportunities for Ofcom
to intervene in the most difficult of circumstances. It is not terribly
clear how much commercial negotiation can take place, but the Minister
has commented that such matters might be left to the experience of
Ofcom. On that note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

for the chance to say a few words on clause 38 in the stand part
debate. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli for

relates to the accounting conditions that Ofcom may impose on a
universal service provider to maintain separate accounts on different
issues as directed by Ofcom. I have a few questions for the Minister.
First, what will be the costs of the burden that he may be placing on
private business? We have seen the Minister refuse to countenance any
proposals in our amendments, often claiming a regulatory burden on
private industry. I simply ask what impact assessment he has made of
such a burden. Will Ofcom have to prove an overall benefit for the
concept of universal service provision before imposing such conditions?
If so, to whom?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000166">&#160;</a>

38(2)(d), Ofcom “may” impose a condition requiring
specified systems to be<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000167">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Why
is the independent auditing of such a condition “may” and
not “must”? Will the Minister tell the Committee whether
the auditors currently employed by a universal service provider for
other areas of its business would be appropriate to carry out that
work? May I also ask whether the issues laid down in such conditions,
and indeed the criteria to which any audit would be carried out, would
be made public? Or would they be subject to the judgment of Ofcom as
empowered in clause 38(6) and (7)? Can the Minister advise the
Committee whether Ofcom will be able to impose such conditions on
different universal service providers at different times, so that one
provider has to comply with an accounting condition but another does
not? What is the hurdle that has to be failed to have Ofcom impose such
a condition? Should we see the imposition of such a condition as an
indication that Ofcom is not content with how a universal service
provider is running that part of the business? Can the Minister also
tell the Committee why it only “may” be necessary for the
separate accounts to be published? What criteria will be used to
determine whether publishing takes
place?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000168">&#160;</a>

(5) allows for Ofcom to impose the condition that the costs of
following its requirement for a universal service provision to be
independently audited are met by the provider itself, so if the
provider was not charged with meeting the costs, who would be? What
criteria would Ofcom use to determine whether a universal service
provider should meet the costs itself? I hope that the Minister is able
to answer those questions, and accepts that the inquiries are an
opportunity for him to expand on some of the details in this part of
the

Gentleman’s Christmas shopping has been going, while he has been

provider on geographical or health and safety grounds. Clearly,
exceptions need to be attached to a Member of Parliament

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
38 sets out the accounting separation conditions that Ofcom may impose
on a universal service provider, to assist in establishing cost
transparency. We have to understand how difficult that whole notion is.
Postcomm has been working with Royal Mail for a number of years to try
to tease out the different cost allocation issues in the business. As a
network business, many of Royal Mail’s products use common
systems, such as sorting machinery, and so identifying the individual
costs of particular products can be complex. Cost allocation and
transparency has proved difficult, but if we are to answer some of the
thorny questions that arise when we look at regulating a network
business such as Royal Mail and at ensuring that price controls are
fair for all parties, we have to get to grips with that issue. Some
complicated accounting methodologies are applied, and I will not
pretend to be an expert on them, but I want to stress to the Committee
that cost allocation and cost transparency is a priority that needs to
be addressed, to assist in monitoring the universal service, to help to
set appropriate universal service prices for users, and to ensure that
any access price controls are set so as not to provide an unfair
subsidy to certain operators. That is what lies behind the clause, and
it is why the clause is so
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have kept to how the clause was in the 2009 Bill, which is not
surprising because the clause speaks to a requirement in the EU postal
services directive. That directive has provisions requiring member
states to ensure that the universal service provider keeps separate and
transparent accounts. That is widely understood to be a knotty problem,
and the regulatory regime in that area has to deal with it. So that
Ofcom has the ability to require the universal service provider to
establish cost transparency, clause 38 allows it to impose USP
accounting conditions to maintain accounting separation across
different services, facilities and products, and across different
areas, and to require the USP to use particular accounting methods. The
clause therefore includes quite a lot of flexibility. One or two of the
questions by the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire asked why
we had “may” and not “must” and so on, but
it is quite important that we ensure flexibility for
Ofcom.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At
the beginning of his remarks, the hon. Gentleman asked whether the
burden would be expensive and what all the costs were. I am glad to
hear him make such valid points, but our problem is that giving an
absolute estimate to the Committee is not possible, because so many
attempts have not quite got to the answer. We do not have an estimate
of the cost of the accounting separation. We might have been able to
give the Committee a cost but, despite a huge amount of work—I
pay tribute to colleagues in Postcomm and the Royal Mail who worked on
the area—that work remains
ongoing.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Postcomm
and Royal Mail are currently in discussion about how to handle the
different approaches. Given disagreement on the methodology for
allocating and sharing the costs between different products and
services over the network, the Government would find it difficult to
make the sort of impact assessment that the hon. Gentleman wants. In an
ideal world, I would very much like to give him a figure, but given
this developing

I did not expect him probably to say but, basically, he said that he is
imposing a burden on private business without knowing what the cost of
that burden will be. It seems to me that that is something that he has
resisted significantly throughout another hour of other batches of
amendments. I am not saying that the objective of the clause should not
be achieved. However, I had hoped for—but not expected—a
little more detail from the Minister on what he envisages the cost
might be, even in percentage terms, if for instance it was applied to
Royal Mail as a whole at this

Gentleman with either a percentage or an absolute figure. The question
is, what is worrying him about this? I hope he agrees that it is
important for Ofcom to have the power. I hope he agrees that we need
cost transparency and accounting separation in order for Ofcom to do
its duty. They are a fundamental part of the regime—without
them, Ofcom would not be able to undertake its regulatory duties
properly, so they are important. I hope we can at least agree that the
power should be in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman might be worried—this might lie behind his
question—that the burden seems an unreasonable one to put on the
universal service provider and not on other postal operators. I
understand that point and I hope to give him some
satisfaction.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Royal
Mail has a turnover of around £7 billion. Access competitors
have only reduced that by around 2%—they are taking a huge
volume of letters but, in terms of turnover, only around 2%. Asking
competitors to pay for the audit would therefore seem to be an unfair
burden to place on private operators. Given that the universal service
provider is in a dominant position and has a special place—that
is why it has to be regulated—it is not unreasonable for it to
have to meet the
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000178">&#160;</a>

the Bill receives Royal Assent—we have talked at some length in
Committee about the potential for many universal service providers. Has
the Minister given any thought to when some idea of the cost of the
burden might be determined? Will it be determined before any potential
sale of Royal Mail?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000179">&#160;</a>

exactly what will be entailed, presumably we would have got to the
answer. We would already have achieved accounting separation and cost
transparency, and would be on the path to what some might describe as
the holy grail. We would know the exact information that would resolve
some of the disputes about whether the universal service is a burden or
whether Royal Mail is subsidising the postal operators, as is alleged.
We would have concrete information to enable us to answer such
questions. Without wanting to be too much of an anorak on the issue,
one of the first questions I asked officials when I came into office
and was reviewing such matters in the early days was why had we not got
to full accounting separation and cost transparency, as a result of
which I was informed of a long saga.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000180">&#160;</a>

overall, the costs involved are huge. If the hon. Gentleman is now
worried about the size of the regulatory burden, although he was not

                           </strong> No. Any person operating a universal service
provider would prefer to have no conditions, but if we are to make sure
that there is competition and that the whole regulatory framework set
out in part 3 of the Bill has some real teeth, we must have such a
provision. Without it, we will not get very far. I hope that the issue
is not one of controversy. I do not detect from the hon.
Gentleman’s argument that he opposes the clause for
philosophical reasons. He is rightly probing some of its detail, and I
completely accept his questions. Perhaps I can deal with a few
more.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>The
hon. Gentleman asked whether accounting conditions apply at different
times to different universal service providers when there are more than
one. Of course, that would be for Ofcom to determine. In theory, that
could be the case subject to all the checks and balances over
Ofcom’s impositions of regulatory commissions, but it is highly
unlikely. The hon. Gentleman was not here during this morning’s
proceedings, but I made it clear when discussing clause 34 that there
were strict situations in which there might be more than one universal
service provider although it is not something that we expect to
happen.<p class="tabbed">It
is right that Ofcom has the flexibility to decide in such unlikely
circumstances, when there is more than one universal service provider,
how it goes about implementing the accounting conditions.
Instinctively, I would assume that they were similar. However, if one
universal service provider were providing a universal service in a
rather small area, the issues may be relatively different from those
for the main universal service provider, which is providing the service
throughout the majority of the country. One can imagine that Ofcom
might approach that in a slightly different way, but I do not think
that that should in any way concern the hon.

say—and I shall exaggerate to illustrate the point—the
second universal service provider were providing a universal service to
one island somewhere, clearly one would not want to impose the same
sort of USP accounting conditions on it as on the main universal
service provider, which would be providing a universal service to the

that after the modernisation agreement the main universal service
provider has 30 big sorting sites, with massive machines that are
sorting mail at 40,000 items per hour—I think that is the rate.
In other words, let us think about trying to apply cost-accounting
methodologies to that universal service provider—trying to work
out, in relation to the universal service products that are being
sorted through the machines, how much of the cost of the machines and
the labour and all the other associated costs relate to the universal
service products, as distinct from those being sorted that are not in
the universal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000190">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether Royal Mail could use its normal auditors for
accounting separation. Subsection (8) sets out what is meant by an
independent auditor. I am not aware of any reason why it should not use
its normal auditors as long they meet the definition in subsection (8).
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has a problem with the
definitions set out in subsection (8). They were mirrored in the 2009
Bill. To me, they seem fairly straightforward definitions and they do
not unreasonably restrict Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000197">&#160;</a>

hon. Gentleman asked—we had to come back to our musty set of
amendments from two or three sittings ago—why we were using
“may” and not “must” in the clause.
Subsection (1)

                        <p>We
had the debate about “may” and “must” in
some detail earlier. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the remarks that I
made some days ago. If Ofcom thinks that it is necessary, then it may
impose an accounting condition. Let us imagine how the mail market may
evolve. One can imagine that many years hence we will be looking at a
completely different market. The user needs and the structure of the
markets could have changed and in that situation, Ofcom might feel that
it is unnecessary to impose such conditions. In circumstances that we
cannot yet foresee, it might feel that it would be disproportionate and
not justifiable to impose such conditions and, therefore, it would
choose not to. I must say, though, that is quite a long way off. Given
that we have yet to reach the holy grail of accounting separation and
cost transparency with respect of this particular network, he does not
have much to worry about unduly.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I conclude by
saying that Ofcom may require the application of presumption on fixing
the determining costs, and the universal service provider to publish
accounts or other information required as a result of these provisions.
Such publication would provide transparency to the market and assist in
the discovery of any areas of inefficiency. At one stage, the hon.
Gentleman was worried about how Ofcom would go about publishing this
and whether it was appropriate. It is all in the name of transparency.
It is important that the wider market of postal operators can see that.
They are the ones who are being charged for access to universal service
providers downstream and, therefore, it seems to me reasonable that
Ofcom can decide that that information should be
published.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000200">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are going back to our famous debate about mays
and musts. If the original decision about whether this accounting
condition should be imposed on a universal service provider is a
“may”, it follows, therefore, that whether they publish
should be a “may”. There could be a reason why Ofcom
would not want them published. It may be that it may choose to publish 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 635<a class="bkMark" name="Column635">&#160;</a>
                           </div>part of the information. Ofcom may decide that parts of this information
are genuinely commercial and confident and would want to keep them out
of the public domain. That shows why it is important that Government,
and this particular Bill, do not set all of this in stone, but give
Ofcom flexibility, as we discussed at length some time ago.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ofcom may
secure USP’s compliance with the cost accounting system that is
audited annually. Annual audits would be a sensible approach, but Ofcom
must decide whether it wishes to do that. It can do that at the
universal service provider’s expense, not at Ofcom’s or
the taxpayer’s. Ofcom must ensure that any regulatory conditions
are objectively justifiable, do not unduly discriminate and are
proportionate and
transparent.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000203">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Just before the Minister finishes, he has not
addressed the issue of the costs of the independent audit. The Bill
says that Ofcom may require the universal service provider to meet
them. One of my original questions was that if the universal service
provider is not responsible for the costs, who is, and what criteria
would Ofcom use to determine that someone else—presumably
itself—would be responsible for
them?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000204">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If I have understood the hon. Gentleman’s
concerns, Ofcom has the power to get the universal service provider to
meet the cost of the audit. I think the presumption is that that would
happen. However, referring back to our “may” and
“must”, it is trying to give flexibility. I guess it is
possible for Ofcom to decide that it would pay for the audit itself. I
think it is highly unlikely, but it has the power to recover the costs.
As we go into other parts of the Bill, we have generally tried to
ensure that any costs involved with this aspect of transparency are
recovered by the key players involved rather than falling on the
regulator or on the Government. That is the right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000205">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> So the Minister does not see a position developing
where Ofcom will require this practice to be carried out, but that the
costs are met by Ofcom and not recovered at any stage by Ofcom from the
universal service provider. Does the Minister envisage that the cost
will always be recovered from the universal service provider, either
directly from a reduction in its accounts or by other costs that Ofcom
will levy on it?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000206">&#160;</a>

subsection (8), and that Ofcom could ensure that those costs were met

network. That is not the case and is not the clause’s purpose at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One has to
consider whom we are regulating in part 3. There are three tiers of
regulation. The first is that of the universal provider, which is Royal
Mail—the incumbent. It is envisaged in clause 34 that there
could be more than one such provider, but that would be in only very
specific, limited circumstances, as we discussed this morning. The main
and top tier of regulation is the designated universal service
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second tier is the set of other postal operators, which is what we mean
by “persons providing services”. Such operators provide
services within the scope of the universal postal service and are not,
therefore, other USPs; they are competitors to the main USP. They are
competing within the scope of the services that are envisaged within
the universal service—whether that be from the minimum
requirements or from the universal postal service order. Effectively,
the measure ensures that Ofcom has the ability to regulate USP
competitors.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When we
debate clauses 46 to 50, we shall discuss the third tier of regulation,
which concerns postal operators generally. Such operators could be
postal companies that are not operating, particularly, within the scope
of the universal service, but are clearly postal operators. For
example, they could be express couriers, who specialise in carrying
very heavy parcels that are not included in

                           </div>the universal service, or other postal operators, who provide services
that fall well outside the scope of the universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to understand that there are three tiers of regulation. I
reassure the hon. Gentleman that clause 39 concerns not
USPs, but postal operators who are within the scope of the universal
service. Sometimes we can sound tautologous in the way in which we bang
these phrases around, but I hope that I have made myself clear. If I
have, I hope that he will accept that the clause should stand part of
the Bill, and that the Committee will agree.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000219">&#160;</a>

particularly subsection (3) and its link with clause 44. We have
already discussed the difficulties with getting that transparency for
Royal Mail’s accounting. Can the Minister enlighten us on the
expected timetable of when that accounting and the cost of the
universal service provision will become clearer? That will be relevant
if privatisation goes ahead. How will a prospective purchaser regard
the purchase of Royal Mail without that particular information? Can he
give us some indication on that timetable? Secondly, the mechanism for
surcharging the competitor organisations, if it became necessary to
shore up the universal service provider, is complicated. The provisions
of clauses 40 and 44 are designed to do that. Are there any other
models, either in this country or abroad, where that sort of process
takes place? How successful have those models
been?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000242">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her questions.
She referred back to the previous clause and how long we expect it to
be before there is definitive accounting separation and cost
transparency, when we can therefore fully understand the cost of the
universal service. One would hope that we could get that rapidly. I
would not want to put a date or a timetable on that, because getting
complete independent agreement with the regulator has proved difficult
up to now. The idea that we will be able to magick them up next year or
the year after or have a specific timetable would be ambitious. I hope
that we can determine the costs quickly—it is important. No
doubt many estimates will be made of the different costs involved.
There have already been some estimates. It is not as if people do not
have views; it is just that it is inherently difficult to make those
estimates. There have been a number of assumptions based on different
methodologies. Different people want to put different elements and
different interpretations on the methodologies that suit their own
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let us
remember that a lot of money is at stake here. A competitor might have
a different approach to the one taken by the regulator, which might
have a different approach to the universal service provider.
Inevitably, they will want to put the best gloss on it, which either
increases or decreases the costs, depending on where their interests
lie. I hope that the hon. Lady understands how inherently difficult it
is. While a huge amount of work has been done in this area, and while
there are people in the country who say that they know what the
universal service costs, getting to a consensus on that is likely to
take some time. I hope that it can be done more rapidly than we have
seen in the past, but we cannot be absolutely
sure.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady’s second question related to the compensation fund,
which is foreshadowed in clause 40 and is discussed in the subsequent
clauses, in particular clause 44. She asked whether there were any
other models. We are certainly not aware of any other models for the
compensation fund. It is only one of the options set out in the
directive, and the provisions in the Bill mirror those in the
Communications Act 2003 for telecommunications, so this is a sort of
genesis of the proposals. I am sure the hon. Lady is aware that the
compensation fund idea is not something that we dreamt up. It was in
the 2009 Bill and it is in the directive. It is not unheard of. In many
ways it has been a central proposition in postal economics for many
years. That is how one would deal with the “unfair
burden” that the universal service provider has to
meet.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There have
been debates about whether compensation funds should be paid for by the
taxpayer or by competitors. In the Bill we have decided, as is standard
in the directive, that it should be competitors. Then, of course, there
are arguments about who those competitors should be and how we define
within regulations who should come under the regulation that would link
to the compensation fund. There are all those sorts of questions, which
no doubt will be teased out in due course. The model that we have gone
for is a standard model. We have not gone for anything particularly
unusual. With that reassurance, I hope that the hon. Lady will support
clause
40.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000246">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Schedule 4 is quite long. It covers the recovery of
administrative costs incurred by Ofcom. It allows Ofcom to impose
different costs on different operators provided that they do not exceed
Ofcom’s overall costs in carrying out its duties—I
presume that Ofcom cannot make a profit. I can grasp that it may be
more costly to regulate one part of the service than another, which
brings us back to the concept of splitting the service. Schedule 4
seems to pose a difficulty in that there may be different levels of
charges to providers delivering a service in the same section of
provisions—letters, for example. If I am wrong, I am sure that
the Minister will point that out in his closing remarks. However, if I
am right, how will the charges be determined on a provider-by-provider
basis?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
1(5) of schedule 4 informs us that Ofcom must publish a financial
statement setting out the total charges received that year, the total
charges outstanding that year and the cost to Ofcom of carrying out its
postal services functions. That is important, relevant and necessary
information. Will the Minister expand on whether Ofcom will provide a
breakdown of the charges received on a company-by-company basis rather
than simply an overall figure, as I read it at present? Or will it be
necessary to publish figures on a separate basis—for example,
letters separate from parcels?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, paragraph 1(5) of schedule 4 informs us that Ofcom will publish
the total amount of charges outstanding that year in its financial
statement. Again, will the Minister state whether that will be on a
provider-by-provider basis, and if not, why not? Will he describe the
circumstances that could lead to such charges being outstanding? I note
that the surplus or deficit will be carried forward into the following
year’s charges, and those charges will be adjusted accordingly.
Will that be done within Ofcom on a sector-by-sector basis, such as
letters, parcels or packets, as designated in clause 26? Or will it be
less discriminatory and perhaps lead to a particular sector overpaying
or another sector
underpaying?<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
respect of Ofcom’s ability to impose a penalty on a person
acting in contravention of a requirement to pay the charge outlined in
paragraph 1 of the schedule, what criteria were used to determine the
restriction to limit the charge to twice the amount of the charge fixed
for the year in which the contravention took place? What processes will
be incorporated by Ofcom in determining how to levy that charge? Where
in the scale of its management will such a decision be taken, and will
it need approval by the board? Paragraph 7 allows Ofcom to suspend an
operator from providing services. In such a situation, what safeguards
are in place for ensuring the provision of service in the area covered
by the suspended universal service provider? With that, I am happy to
listen to what the Minister has to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000254">&#160;</a>

bowling a googly without giving me any notice. I must confess that I am
not sure of the answer to some of those questions, including at what
level Ofcom would decide how the charging operation worked. I shall try
to deal with them, but if I fail to, I will certainly write to the hon.
Gentleman. In general, however, some of the answers to his detailed
questions have probably not yet been worked out in my Department or in
Ofcom, although they may—I am sure that they will—learn
lessons from how Postcomm operates its
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000257">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
Ofcom’s operation of the charging regime, it will learn from
experience, and if the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire has
particular suggestions or proposals about how that should be done, I am
sure that it will be keen to hear from
him.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will broadly outline what the schedule is intended to do, while
inspiration arrives. The schedule’s core function is to set out
how Ofcom can recover its costs in relation to its postal functions. It
allows Ofcom to fix a charge that postal operators providing postal
services within the scope of the universal service must pay. It is
important that that does not apply to operators outside the scope of
the universal service, for the good reason that they may only be small
companies and doing a small amount of business, so it would be unfair,
unjustifiable and disproportionate to ask them to pay costs. The
charges that would fall under the schedule are targeted only on those
operators within the scope of the universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ofcom
is allowed to fix a charge only when it has made a statement of the
principles that it will apply in fixing those charges, and the charge
must be fixed in accordance with those principles. There will,
therefore, be a lot of transparency about how the charges are made. The
principles must be such that Ofcom believes that, on a year-by-year
basis, the total amount of charges payable meets, but does not exceed,
the annual cost it occurs in carrying out its postal functions. The
principles must also be objectively justifiable, proportionate and
transparent, as the hon. Gentleman would expect. The charges can be
different for different types of operators, and certain descriptions of
operators may be excluded from the liability to pay. As long as the
principles are met, that seems an appropriate way forward. That deals
with the hon. Gentleman’s point about whether the charges will
be done by company or by
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ofcom
is required to produce a financial statement at the end of each
charging year, setting out the charges that it has received, the
charges that are outstanding and the cost to Ofcom of carrying out its
postal services functions. Any deficit or surplus must be carried
forward when determining charges for the following year. The schedule
sets out the meaning of Ofcom’s postal services functions,
including incidental functions as defined in paragraph 2(3), such as
any preparatory or facilitating steps taken by Ofcom before and after
the schedule comes into force.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000262">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The schedule
also details the different steps that Ofcom may take if an operator
does not pay the administrative charge—I think that the hon.
Gentleman is concerned about that—and allows for proceedings to
recover the charge and for the imposition of financial penalties. The
final step that Ofcom may take is to suspend or restrict the
entitlement to provide postal services, and the hon. Gentleman wanted
to know what criteria would be used in making that decision. Returning
to my initial remarks, I do not think that those criteria have yet been
decided, but no doubt when Ofcom sets out the principles, as required
under the schedule, it will give some thought to how the penalties will
be applied under
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000263">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
confirm that Ofcom cannot make a profit from regulatory fees. As I have
already said, costs must be applied on a transparent,
non-discriminatory basis, and Ofcom will set out all the details in its
published statement of principles. I am happy to send the hon.
Gentleman a copy of Ofcom’s existing statement, which is in the
public domain, of charging principles as they apply to telecoms, for
his study and enjoyment when he is on the M9 or in Edinburgh airport. I
am sure that many of the principles set out for telecoms will read
through to postal
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000264">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I need the hon. Gentleman to clarify his question.
We are talking about the charging regime for Ofcom, and about how Ofcom
charges different postal operators to ensure that it is funded, and
funded through the industry not the taxpayer. That is a completely
separate point to how the universal service is
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000266">&#160;</a>

postal operators that might be providing a service within the scope of
a universal service but are not the universal service provider. The
universal service provider is the one that has to provide the universal
service under the duties set out in clause 28, with Ofcom ensuring that
that happens. The suspensions for non-payment that the hon. Gentleman
is worried about will not apply to the universal service provider but
to the other postal operators. There is no hidden threat or danger to
the provision of the universal service, and I hope that that reassures
the hon.

strikes us, particularly with different patterns by which people use
mail services and the decline that we have heard about, that there
could be a rapidly changing scenario in respect of the costs for the
USP. It is a bit odd that we have a particular limit on an aspect of
Ofcom’s work. Why is it that Ofcom cannot carry out a review
earlier, unless it is directed by the Secretary of State? Surely, given
the types of comments that we have heard, the Minister would have
wanted Ofcom to have had the discretion to be able to choose when it
wanted to review the costs. It is strange to prevent the regulator from
establishing costs for regulatory purposes before the three-year period
is up, because there might be difficulties. We will have to examine
what the USP will be up against, and it will be important to discuss
whether the costs are being met and whether the right regime is in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision is of a slightly arbitrary nature. We heard the Minister
arguing about the importance of the regulator having the freedom and
independence to act as he wishes, but under the clause the regulator is
subject to a particular restriction and to a requirement for him to
return to the Secretary of State if he wishes to review matters
earlier. Surely the larger the amount of information gathering that
takes place, the better. Given the particularly difficult circumstances
that the provider of the universal service obligation might be

                           </div>working under, Ofcom would want the flexibility in case revisions and a
review of the costs are required or if it wants to start looking at
things
sooner.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000278">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Mention
is made elsewhere in the Bill of periods of 12 months or 18 months for
the review of regulations, so it is strange to have the three-year rule
under the clause, given the implication that, almost as soon as the
Bill is enacted and Royal Mail is privatised, the opportunity will be
there for Ofcom to start revising and looking at things. Will the
Minister give us a little bit of his wisdom and enlighten us about the
thinking behind the measure? Why has subsection (10) been made part of
the

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us remember the overview. We are not talking about the work being done
on understanding the costs involved of the universal service. A lot of
that work will be done, as we have seen in our debates, as part of cost
accounting and cost transparency—that is important for Ofcom and
its standard duties as a regulator. Under clause 42, we are talking
specifically about whether a financial burden is involved. We have to
read subsection (1)
carefully:<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“OFCOM

obligations.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000444">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We
are not looking specifically at the cost of a universal service. That
needs to be done in the normal course of events—we have those
provisions in clause 39. In clause 42 we are looking at
whether a universal service obligation is proving to be a financial
burden.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reason why we have a three-year delay is simply because we want to
ensure that the modernisation agreed between the Communication Workers
Union and Royal Mail continues and that no one believes in some sort of
get-out clause—that Royal Mail does not have to modernise or
become more efficient, that it can just wait until Ofcom does a review
about the unfair financial burden of a universal service and that a
compensation fund is miraculously created, coming to the aid of Royal
Mail and bailing it out. We would not want to put into the regulatory
framework any perverse incentives for Royal Mail not to become more
efficient.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000283">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am perturbed about what the Minister has just
said. The implication is that anything that goes wrong, as far as Royal
Mail is concerned, must be to do with what is going on inside Royal
Mail—possibly the trade unions or management, although he did
not mention management on this occasion. What about external factors
making circumstances very different? Those could be anything from
escalating fuel costs to a completely different approach to dealing
with mail—we have not yet got “Beam me up,
Scotty!” but one never
knows.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000284">&#160;</a>

years seems a long time to be unwilling to look at any possibility that
the burden might have been caused by anything other than what Royal
Mail has brought on itself—that is what the Minister seemed to
suggest—by sitting back and hoping that someone will come along,
pick up the pieces and bail it out. That is an image of a helpless
Royal Mail, always hoping that it will be picked up, put back on its
feet and subsidised by

of this dynamic organisation, which we have seen is modernising at a
huge pace. The Minister believes that it might be given even more
dynamism by being

Amess.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me be absolutely clear: we do not believe that Royal Mail will want to
avoid its responsibilities. I am sure that it will want to press ahead
with its vital modernisation, working in close partnership with the
unions to deliver on the modernisation agreement. We expect that to
happen—I would even go as far as saying that it must happen. We
have to see efficiency improvements. The modernisation agreement is
very welcome, and I hope that it delivers on those efficiency
improvements. It would be wrong of the Government to create a
regulatory framework that created poor incentives. If there were a
compensation fund available to Royal Mail on day one, the incentive to
press ahead with the modernisation agreement might be somehow weakened.
That is not to cast aspersions on Royal Mail and its employees by
saying that it has poor motives or poor aspirations. It is just that it
makes sense that the compensation fund should not be available on day
one. Waiting three years for this review is the sensible way
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let us
remember that competitors and customers will effectively pay for any
compensation fund, were it decided that it was necessary after the
review. They need to be reassured that they are not paying for Royal
Mail’s inefficiency. We therefore need to ensure that there is
not some immediate get-out clause for Royal Mail. I hope that the hon.
Lady understands that this is not an attempt unnecessarily to bind the
regulator. She is right that in many other clauses we have emphasised
the importance of regulatory flexibility and of the regulator making
its own decisions. That has not always been the case—I refer her
back to clause 33, where we were discussing a review of the minimum
service requirements. Explicitly, the Secretary of State and Parliament
will decide whether the minimum service requirements can be
changed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In other
parts of the Bill we have made it clear that Ofcom is not running the
show completely. In this case, we think that Ofcom would welcome the
tying of its hands, because it wants to ensure that the incentives on
the universal service provider to be more efficient are right. That is
part of Ofcom’s duties, as we discussed in clause 28. Ofcom
would not, therefore, want anything to be built into part 2 that would
prevent the delivery of the modernisation agreement. I hope that the
hon. Lady is reassured by that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will make a
few more comments to reassure the hon. Lady, and then I will return to
some of the thinking behind this, particularly the rationale behind
this subsection. I hope that she agrees, as I think she has on past
occasions, that for the universal service to survive, this provision
needs to be more efficient. That was Richard Hooper’s
conclusion, and that is the basic starting point for the whole Bill.
The 2009 Bill had the same starting point as well, so a lot of this is
common ground.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000291">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Like the hon.
Lady, I accept that Royal Mail has been making huge efforts to
modernise, and there has been some progress on that. If the universal
service provider does not have the right incentives to continue with
that work, the truth is that without greater efficiency the cost of the
universal service will continue to rise. That will mean more switching
to alternative forms of communication, which will become ever more
attractive, and more decline in volumes. We could reach a point where
there is no way back for the industry and the universal service. I want
to keep stressing the importance of improving efficiency in Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000292">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have seen,
as I mentioned in previous debates, some of the excellent work that has
been done. We have talked a lot about the Gatwick mail sorting centre.
Perhaps that is where we ought to have our Christmas party to celebrate
the return from the snowy north of the hon. Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire, who believes in Santa Claus, so we can see for ourselves
the strides forward that are being made in efficiency and how much more
there is to do. If every sorting centre learned lessons from Gatwick,
we would be moving
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000293">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not believe I have told this anecdote before: I was talking to some
Royal Mail employees at the Gatwick centre about how they have taken
strides forward and improved efficiency. They were frank and open with
me, with the managers agreeing with them. As they are now adopting some
Japanese management techniques and working closely together, they have
decided to co-operate on a basic analysis of the processes that they
undertake every day. When they started that, they recognised that the
machines—some of the sorting machines are 19 years
old, and are not exactly cutting-edge technology—were breaking
down frequently. Clearly that was not efficient. It was increasing the
unit costs of sorting a letter, and they wanted to try to reduce the
down time of the machines to increase productivity and
efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000294">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">They
came to a joint and startling conclusion that it would be a good idea
to clean the machines. They did, and they now maintain the machines in
a way that the machines have never been maintained before, which has
significantly increased productivity. The machines do not break down as
often, and what was interesting and, I think, hopeful for the whole way
that world class mail is rolling out is that the involvement of the
employees in maintaining and cleaning machines in a way that had not
happened in the past has improved the enjoyment and autonomy of the
individuals working on those sorting production lines. They have
started naming their machines. <em>[</em>

                           <em>

names.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000295">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am trying to remember the name of the machine that we looked at. I
think it was Sue. Having been cleaned, Sue was performing more
effectively. It was interesting. The employees were almost like car
mechanics. They were now more attuned to the sounds that the machine
made and could tell and follow effectively and more quickly if a
machine was not functioning properly. Rather than calling in engineers,
they themselves were tackling some of the problems, and they were
monitoring the effectiveness of each part of the machine—they
are long machines, with many different parts. Each individual employee
working on the sorting machines got to

of each part of the
machines.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000296">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
anecdote was not simply to allow the Whip to get to his place; it was
also to express the fact that Royal Mail can make leaps in efficiency.
We do not want the pressure to be taken off it to continue to deliver
on greater efficiencies, which are absolutely critical. That is why
there is this three-year period before the review can be made. I hope
that the hon. Lady will understand that analysis and withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000297">&#160;</a>

more boring terms from the sources of information that we have had,
about improved relations in Royal Mail—Hooper makes a point of
stating that in his September report, and witnesses in our evidence
sessions said the same. However, the Minister forgot to give the
amendment a name. Bearing in mind that lovely picture of the
Minister—the dwarf or the elf—visiting the machines that
were being cleaned, and the idea of those little creatures he sees in
his imagination sorting out Santa’s mail, there is only one
thing we can do, which is refer to his comment this morning and call it
the elf and safety amendment. That is the Minister’s joke, not

has been a real determination on the part of management and the work
force to work together. So often, it is the people who are directly

                           </strong> I shall speak to the amendments together. To
translate amendment 109 into simpler language, it concerns who the
provider of the universal service obligation should be and for how
long. The suggestion that it should be 10 years is to try to give
stability to the provider, who in the first instance is most likely to
be Royal Mail. At the moment, there is not a serious suggestion that
any other company could provide the delivery of the universal service
obligation in the near future. To fulfil the universal service
obligation, it is obviously necessary to have a comprehensive set of
mail centres, delivery offices, large fleets of vehicles and other
substantial capital requirements—and, of course, the work
force.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000329">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Despite
the introduction of a liberalised mail market, no competitor of Royal
Mail has yet considered making the type of investment that would be
required to provide the universal service obligation in reality. Some
of them would be happy to skim a little cream off from the universal
service obligation, because there are areas 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 648<a class="bkMark" name="Column648">&#160;</a>
                           </div>where they would like to do the work. They feel that they would make a
good job of it and do it in a competitive fashion, but that confirms
the point that none of them has the wherewithal at the moment to
sustain a universal service
obligation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000330">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Nor
is the provision of the universal service obligation simply a matter of
capital investment and large-scale employment. Royal Mail embodies
generations of expertise and innovation from those who have worked for
it or managed it. That is why, despite the continued physical expansion
of the universal service obligation to more than 28 million addresses
today, Royal Mail’s quality of service figures are at record
levels. Let us be realistic and accept that the universal service
obligation, which the Government say they want to protect, can be
delivered only by Royal Mail at the moment. The amendment acknowledges
that simple fact. It also gives Royal Mail the certainty to make
investment and business decisions, confident that it will remain the
universal service provider for a reasonable amount of time. In business
terms, 10 years is not long. The replacement of complex
machinery operates in cycles of eight to 10 years, unless, of course,
the 19-year-old machinery is given that wonderful clean-down by the
Minister and
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
all know that something such as the universal service obligation
involves massive investment. If that investment is made, there needs to
be certainty for investors in the business that there will be at least
a 10-year period in which Royal Mail will be the universal service
provider. I hate to mention this, but sub-postmasters are still looking
for that inter-business agreement to be 10 years. For business, 10
years is not a hugely long
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment seeks to deliver a realistic scenario in which Royal Mail, if
it is the universal service provider, will be able to invest for 10
years rather than wondering “shall we or shan’t we
invest, because we might lose the service after a short amount of
time?” Or there might be cherry-picking going on, which would
mean losing parts of it. Therefore it would not be worth its while
investing and pushing ahead with—dare I say it?—the
modernisation
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Linked
into the matter is our amendment 110 in clause 43. It specifies
that<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A

years’ notice be provided to a designated

                        </p>
                        <p>of
the universal service
obligation<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“before

                        </p>
                        <p>It
is about planning ahead, and businesses having to decide what they will
prioritise and where their investment will be. It would give some
certainty either to the provider that it will no longer be the provider
and therefore must make other provision and look elsewhere, or that
perhaps it will not be the provider for the entire universal service
obligation but for only part of it. In such circumstances, the new
provider would have the time to make the necessary investment, get up
to speed and be ready to provide the service with a seamless
handover.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000336">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would offer protection to the universal service provider by
making sure that adequate notice is given, should that provider have
the service taken away and offered to another operator. Clause 43
allows Ofcom 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 649<a class="bkMark" name="Column649">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to draw a conclusion that the universal service obligation poses a
financial burden on the universal service provider, although it does
not guarantee that the universal service provider would have to agree
that assessment before Ofcom acts. The matter is entirely at the
discretion of Ofcom, which would then report its recommendations to the
Secretary of State for
action.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000337">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State might then direct Ofcom to take action. Again, the
Bill offers the universal service provider no guarantee that it will
necessarily agree with the course of action recommended by Ofcom,
endorsed by the Secretary of State and then implemented by Ofcom. We
are trying to make sure that there is a proper opportunity for the
planning that could be necessary if there were to be a change in the
universal service provider. There might be various attempts, for
example, to make the USP provide things a lot more cheaply. Other
pressures might be put on the universal service provider in different
ways. We want an element of stability and a proper transition period,
so that if a different provider were to be chosen, the original
provider would have a proper period of notice and anyone taking on the
service would obviously have time for a lead-in period. We are saying
that, in business terms, if we are to expect people to do the job, we
have to make sure that it is worth their while. We have to give them
something like a 10-year period in which to do it and, if we are to
make a change, we need time for people to withdraw and further people
to be put in place so that there is a proper notice
period.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000338">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
119 and 120 are about the proposed power for Ofcom to make a
procurement determination. Amendment 119 would remove the proposed
power from subsection (8), and amendment 119 suggests that subsections
(9) and (10) be left out. The proposed power seems to be an innovation
under the Bill. It is an element that could easily seek to undermine
the universal service obligation. It means that competitor mail
companies that are keen to lobby Ofcom could be anxious to cherry-pick
parts of the universal service obligation that they foresee as
profitable.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000339">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Procurement
determination is the technical term for saying that Ofcom will be
looking after another company to take over part of the universal
service obligation provision. If it were removed from the Bill, Ofcom
would still have power to carry out a review of the universal service
obligation. We have discussed such matters at length, so I shall not go
over all the different ways in which Ofcom can carry out such a review.
It would also have the power to act under clause 44, which we have also
mentioned, if the regulator believes that there must be some further
change in the universal service obligation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000340">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our main fear
about the procurement determination is whether the universal service
obligation will be broken up to give some postal providers the
opportunity to make partial provision. That would obviously have a
specific and possibly detrimental effect on the current provider of the
universal service, as it could become less financially viable. We are
concerned about that, and for that reason, we are anxious that this
particular element should be taken out of the clause to take away the
opportunity for Ofcom to make a procurement determination. In our mind,
it would be giving Ofcom

                           </div>powers that Postcomm does not have at the moment. To make a procurement
determination is to introduce a real and determined threat to the
integrity of the universal service obligation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those are the
reasons for our amendments. First, we want to provide a proper tender
period for proper business planning. Secondly, we want to ensure that
any switchover to another provider has a three-year running period, for
both the provider pulling out and the provider pulling in, and that
there is no opportunity to hive off bids in the meantime, here, there
and everywhere, to the detriment of the universal service
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000342">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Lady
has introduced the amendments. I understand where she is coming from.
Her intentions in tabling them are laudable, and I have a lot of
sympathy with the thinking behind them. However, I hope to reassure her
that while I am sympathetic to her intentions, in my view the
amendments are not needed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The matter
returns to something that I am afraid I have repeated many times in our
proceedings, which is that Ofcom’s primary duty is to secure the
universal service. Therefore, it is not going to act, following its own
review, in a way that could potentially undermine that service, whether
it is thinking about a compensation fund or about particular
procurement options, as the hon. Lady was talking
about.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ofcom
would fail in its primary duty if it looked at and used options before
it in a way that undermined the provision of a universal postal
service. That is the fundamental point of this part of the Bill. It is
a fundamental protection, whether for Royal Mail, competitors or a
potential investor looking at this part of the Bill and at the
procurement compensation fund. People can be reassured that
Ofcom’s primary duty is to ensure that a universal service is
provided. I do not believe that there will be more than one company in
the foreseeable future that is able to do that and meet Ofcom’s
requirement. Of course we have had those two specific
issues—this is one of them—where one can imagine that
Ofcom or, in terms of the postal administration order, the Secretary of
State, looks to more than one universal service
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
thinking in this part of the Bill does not lead to the prospect of
there being two national universal service providers, which I think is
the fear behind the hon. Lady’s concerns. When we debated clause
38, I said that one might imagine another universal service provider
operating in a very small area of the country, perhaps providing
services to one island, and to one address on one island. The hon.
Member for Ochil and South Perthshire said that that would be my
address. I live in a terraced house in Surbiton, and it would,
therefore, be a particularly unusual procurement to provide a universal
service provider for just my own address. However, anything is
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000346">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
devising the policy, I always imagined that if Ofcom, in ensuring that
it was meeting its primary duty, under clause 28, to provide the
universal service, decided to take the procurement option because of an
unfair burden on the universal service provider, that would be in
pretty unusual circumstances and would apply only 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 651<a class="bkMark" name="Column651">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to small geographical areas. I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady
and other Members who might be concerned but, having made those
preliminary remarks, let me delve into more detail, to reassure her
further.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000347">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Because
the aim of the Bill is to secure the provision of a universal postal
service, one has to look at everything in the round. The pension,
employee share and regulatory provisions all come together to ensure
that the universal postal service can be provided. However, we have to
ensure that we take precautions in case the solution that we have come
up with in our policy does not work. It would be absolutely
irresponsible of any Government not to make provision in a Bill for
things that might happen if everything went wrong. We are talking about
safeguards, not about what we expect to, want to, or predict will,
happen—far, far from it. The approach of our overall proposal
will sustainably deliver a universal postal service, but if things get
even worse than we expect and letter volumes fall off a cliff far
faster than even the worst predictions, or other market changes erode
Royal Mail’s ability to meet the costs of providing a universal
service, we need safeguards. Clauses 42 and 43 try to provide those
safeguards.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000348">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
43 addresses the risk by providing a menu of three possible actions
that Ofcom may take, after carrying out a review and as directed by the
Secretary of State on acceptance of that review, should the provision
of the universal service represent an unfair financial burden on the
universal service provider. The first option is a review of the minimum
requirements of the universal service, as set out in clause 33. Option
2 is the creation of a compensation fund to share the cost of the
unfair burden on the universal service provider. We have discussed that
option, and it is set out in more detail in clause 44. The third option
is the making of a procurement
determination.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So,
there are three options if things go wrong, and I contrast that with
the 2009 Bill which contained only one option—the compensation
fund. Unclear, and hidden, was the provision of the European
Communities Act 1972 for a reduction in the minimum service
requirement through the negative procedure. That was not a very
satisfactory approach, but those were the two options, and only one of
them was in the Bill. In this Bill we give Ofcom and the Secretary of
State three options for action if things go horribly
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me briefly set out how we get to that point and how the actions might
work. In brief, once Ofcom has conducted a review of the cost of the
universal service, and if it concludes that there is a financial
burden, clause 43 requires Ofcom to determine whether it is unfair for
the universal service provider to bear that burden. If Ofcom concludes
that the burden is unfair, it must submit a report to the Secretary of
State with a recommendation for the action, if any, it considers should
be taken to deal with the burden. That is the initial process, with
Ofcom at the heart of it. For the avoidance of doubt, I re-emphasise
that the powers are extremely unlikely to be needed or used. They are
safeguards to future-proof legislation in the event of a
crisis.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
procurement determination, which is what the group of amendments is
about, would mean that another operator could provide part of the
universal service with less or no need for compensation from users or
the market, and with a reduced risk that minimum requirements 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 652<a class="bkMark" name="Column652">&#160;</a>
                           </div>would need to be reviewed. That is a valuable tool. The fact that more
such tools are available is a step forward from the 2009 Bill. That is
the process by which we would have to
operate.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will deal with the specific amendments because they raise useful
issues. Amendment 110 would require Ofcom to give a universal service
provider three years’ notice before designating anyone else as a
universal service provider in relation to any part of the universal
service. I understand the sentiment behind the amendment—a
universal service provider would need time to wind down relevant
operations without incurring a large unfair burden, if it is found that
someone else will provide part of the universal service. The hon. Lady
went into some detail about the sorts of costs and investments that
would have been sunk and, therefore, what would be
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again—this
is critical in answering the amendments—I refer the hon. Lady to
the primary duty of Ofcom, which is to secure the provision of the
universal postal service. That means the whole of the universal postal
service, having regard to its financial sustainability and efficient
provision. With that in mind, the proposed amendment is
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill gives Ofcom the tools it needs to secure the universal service. If
the Secretary of State directs Ofcom to make a procurement
determination, it would still need to ensure the provision of the whole
of the universal service having regard to its financial sustainability.
It could not do anything that would go against that. Therefore, if it
felt that it was necessary to give a period of notice in order to
provide for the smooth transition of one part of the universal service
from one provider to the new provider, it would need to do
so—Ofcom could not act capriciously, taking a course of action
that would in any way endanger the delivery of its primary
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady talked about a figure of three years in amendment 110. From
her remarks, I was not quite sure why she had set upon three
years—there might have been a particular reason. However, I hope
that I have at least convinced her that the amendment is unnecessary
and I hope that she will not press
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000356">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
a similar vein, amendment 109 prevents Ofcom from making a procurement
determination for 10 years from when the clause comes into force. I
understand and have sympathy with the intentions behind the amendment,
but the arguments I have made should reassure the hon. Lady. It is
important to ensure that Ofcom has the tools it needs to secure the
universal postal service. I have yet to see a justification for
preventing the use of one of our menu of options in the event of an
unfair burden on the USP. Let me repeat: the provisions are there to
protect the universal service in the event of a crisis. Obviously, we
do not expect such a crisis within the next 10 years—or at
all—but it seems more prudent to retain the option just in case
such an intervention is
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000357">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me be absolutely clear. The powers are a prudent precaution—we
do not expect them to have to be used. They are not a way of creating
some tendering or franchising process, or some hidden way of
introducing it. The powers are safeguards and purely precautionary. It
is important that I keep emphasising that, not just for the hon. Lady
but for the Royal Mail and any potential investors—they need to
know that the provision is not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 653<a class="bkMark" name="Column653">&#160;</a>
                           </div>some approach to creating a bidding process every so often. It is about
protecting the universal service in the event of a
crisis.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000358">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, amendments 119 and 120, in contrast to the other two
amendments in the group, seem to want to get rid of procurement as an
option altogether, even if there is an unfair burden. I will not repeat
my arguments but, for the record, procurement is a sensible option to
allow Ofcom to recommend, in case it is necessary for the provision of
the universal service. It gives them another arrow to their
bow.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I refer the
hon. Lady to article 7(2) of European directive 97/67/EC, of December
1997, which, in the chapter on financing of the universal service,
speaks to the procurement option in the same article as it speaks to
the compensation fund. It is not an option that has simply been dreamed
up by the Government. It is there in the directive that underpins the
legal framework on this issue. The previous Government did not include
it in the 2009 Bill—I do not understand why. It is sensible to
have that option available, even though I do not think that it will be
used. It is worth noting for the record that if one looks at how
Deutsche Post operates and the legal framework that it operates in,
there is a provision for the procurement of the universal service in
Germany, should that be necessary, but it has never been used. I am
sure that those people who studied Deutsche
Post—<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000360">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Well, I was expecting to hear all sorts of
interesting facts about Deutsche Post, but I will obviously have to
wait for another time. The issue is that 10 years is a short period of
time. It is a new scenario and a new adventure for the universal
service provider to be a privatised company in this country, when for
centuries it has been in public ownership. It needs to be given a fair
chance, albeit we do not agree with the idea of its being privatised in
the first place. If it is going to have a go at providing an excellent
universal service, but within the private sector, it needs to have the
proper opportunity to do so. That is why we think that there should be
an opportunity for a 10-year period to be granted to that provider, so
that it can make the necessary investment, build on the fact that it
has done all that modernisation and, we hope, provide an excellent
service for the next 10 years. For that reason, I would like to press
amendment 109 to a vote, because it secures that 10-year period for the
provider to provide the universal service
obligation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000363">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Following
from that, it would be possible to find another provider, I suppose, in
less than three years. We would much rather see a proper three-year
run-in period, but we would consider withdrawing amendment 110. We
still think that it would be best practice to have at least that amount
of time, but maybe we do not need that fixed in the Bill. We want to
press our two amendments on procurement determination to a

remarks on schedule 4, the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire
bowled a few googlies, and I may have inadvertently given the Committee
some incorrect information during that debate.<a class="bkMark" name="10120836000422">&#160;</a>

Gentleman asked about the application of schedule 4 paragraph 7 to the
universal service provider. Contrary to what I said earlier, I
understand that that paragraph could apply to the universal service
provider. He may wonder what would happen to the universal service if
that situation arises, but I can reassure him that, should that happen,
it is almost inconceivable that Royal Mail would not pay the charges
required of it. Given Ofcom’s duty under clause 28, it is even
more inconceivable that Ofcom would be able to take the extreme step of
suspending the provision of the universal service, and when one thinks
about it, that immediately becomes apparent. In such unlikely
circumstances, Ofcom

provider for payment of the charges due, rather than follow the
suspension option. I hope that assists the hon. Gentleman and the
