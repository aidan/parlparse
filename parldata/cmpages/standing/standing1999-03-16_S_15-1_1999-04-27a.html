<H2><center>Special Standing Committee </center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 27 April 1999 (Afternoon) </center></H4>
<H4><center>[Part I] </center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. John Maxton in the Chair] </center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/042/1999042.htm">Immigration and Asylum Bill </a></center></H3>
<P>
<center><h4>Clause 30 </h4>
<P>
<h4>Location of bail hearings </h4></center>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): Association--I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Maxton, with the word that I was about to utter before we adjourned. I had got as far as the phrase, "Immigration Law Practitioners" but had not spoken the word "Association", so it may assist those reading the record of our proceedings if I begin this sitting with the name of that organisation, which has expressed concern about clause 30. 
<P>
The principle issue is whether it is possible to hold the sort of free, fair and open bail hearing that will be required to establish whether a person should be released from detention within the confines of detention centres and prisons. It concerns me that prisons are still on the agenda because our hope was that we could move away from using prisons for administrative immigration detention. 
<P>
I suggested earlier that there is a broad spectrum of belief about how the bail hearings will work--from the judicial rubber stamping at one end to becoming the fair hearings that we wish for. One critical issue will be the extent to which people are able to participate in, or observe, proceedings. I trust that the Minister wishes to keep clause 30 and that he will deploy strong arguments as to why, administratively, it is better to bring magistrates into a detention centre or prison than to send detainees all over the place. As he does that, I trust that he will consider those who may wish to observe such proceedings. Not only detainees' legal representatives but crucial groups and non-governmental organisations such as the Refugee Council, the Asylum Rights Campaign and Amnesty International have a valid role in observing whether this country's procedures are genuinely up to international standards. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees may wish to observe proceedings; holding them in a detention centre or prison could make that more difficult. Perhaps the Minister will say how he intends to avoid that. 
<P>
Family and community groups--the cultural groups with which many asylum seekers are associated--are also important. If, for example, a Kurdish asylum seeker is held in administrative detention, a Kurdish support  group in this country may wish to observe his bail hearings. How will it gain access to hearings if the person is held in a prison or detention centre? 
<P>
I referred on the previous clause to other concerned citizens groups. One great sign of strength in our country is the number of concerned citizens who take up forcefully the rights of asylum seekers in particular, and immigration detainees generally. They have special reasons for doing that, but often they do so out of the goodness of their hearts. It has been most refreshing to observe groups that represent host countries being prepared to put time, effort and money into supporting the rights of those who arrive on our shores. This has been especially true in Kent which has had an influx of asylum seekers recently. It will be a pertinent factor in decisions about where to hold hearings, for which clause 30 provides. 
<P>
I talked about Campsfield House in Oxfordshire. It is common knowledge that there are many concerned citizens in Oxfordshire who take an active role in deciding what happens to people who go to Campsfield House. Decisions about whether these people will be released under the bail proceedings will be of particular interest to them. I shall be interested to hear whether people who have formed support groups will have access to hearings held in detention centres. 
<P>
The best way for the Government to demonstrate whether bail hearings are genuine, fair and open and whether they offer a real prospect of a person being able to present his case fairly, is to allow the groups the same access as they would have to magistrates courts. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee a little more detail about how he intends to operate bail hearings in detention centres and prisons in particular. I hope that he can demonstrate that the Government are at the right end--the Dr. Jekyll not the Mr. Hyde end--of the spectrum when they set up bail hearings and that they will genuinely meet the requirements of people who have campaigned long and hard for them. 
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): Under clause 30, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, can direct that particular routine bail hearings will take place at a specified place. We need clause 30 so as to have flexibility with regard to where routine hearings are heard. Where suitable arrangements are in place at detention centres, courts should be able to hold routine bail hearings there. This will lead to a quicker more efficient resolution of hearings; it will also save on escort costs. 
<P>
However, that is not the issue. The purpose is to ensure that things are done in the most effective and efficient way possible. We estimate that when the Secretary of State decides that he wishes to go down this route, he will approach the Lord Chancellor, who will undertake the appropriate consultations with the various magistrates in commission areas about how they can best deal with these matters. For the avoidance of doubt, I can assure the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) that we do not intend a hearing to be in any place where appropriate safeguards are not in place: the place would also be somewhere the appropriate dignity of the court could be maintained. One of the difficulties of transporting detainees and prisoners generally is that it is often difficult for them to receive visitors on days when they have to be at court. The provision may well overcome that difficulty and enable things to be done in a far more sensible way. Moreover, I would hope that detainees would not have to sit around in paddywaggons for long periods. 
<P>
Let us see how the processs develops. It is an option that we are taking. We do not propose to do it immediately. No doubt the Lord Chancellor's Department will wish to consult fully. We do not expect it to happen in the next few months or even immediately when the Bill is enacted. Further down the road, either after the consultation and the various options are canvased that option may well be beneficial. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Government No. 514. 
<P>
<B>Mr O'Brien:</B> The amendments are grouped together to raise a series of issues. Amendment No. 495 will allow the court to release a detainee on bail without recognisance being taken if the court considers it appropriate. That addresses the concern that the hon. Member for Hallam had about how the court would make particular decisions and whether someone could be released without a recognisance. There was a debate about whether a recognisance meant a personal or a monetary recognisance. We finally concluded that the amendment would make the situation much clearer. 
<P>
Amendments Nos 496, 497, 502, 503, 512 and 514 are consequential and in effect are recognition that no recognisance may have been required when bail was granted in first instance. Where the courts are satisfied that the taking of a recognisance is not appropriate, they would have the discretion to dispense with it altogether rather than to set a nominal amount. It clearly is not desirable for courts to set a nominal amount if they do not believe it necessary. Other conditions may more readily address their concerns about a particular detainee. 
<P>
I understand that the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam--Nos. 619 to 622, 628, 630 and 631--derive from suggestions made by the Law Society of Scotland which considered they were needed to insert the correct legal terminology. It is with a certain diffidence that I must tell the hon. Gentleman and, through him, the Law Society of Scotland that the Bill already uses the correct legal terminology. The term "bail bond" exists in Scottish law and has done since the Immigration Act 1971 was passed. Indeed, in the context of immigration detainees, it is unique to Scotland. 
<P>
The amendment suggested by the Law Society of Scotland would have replaced "bail bonds", with "bail orders" which might or might not include a requirement for a bond to be lodged. By happy coincidence the amendments in my name would have just that effect but would apply to the whole United Kingdom and not just to Scotland. Amendment No. 618 is also inappropriate in that by allowing bail in Scotland, subject to compliance with the standard bail conditions, it transfers provisions designed for criminal bail into the immigrant bail context. To some extent we have already discussed the difficulties of doing that. Those conditions, which I understand include the requirements not to interfere with witnesses and to appear at every diet relating to the offence, are clearly inappropriate. 
<P>
I turn briefly to amendment No. 646.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. James Clappison  </B>(Hertsmere): I can assist the Minister, because in the light of his earlier remarks, I do not propose to move the other amendments. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>  Order. It might be as well for the Committee to remember that, in any group of amendments, only one amendment is moved. The others are for debate only, unless hon. Members wish it to be done formally. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B>  In light of the assistance offered by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), I need not detain the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Government amendments are helpful. I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification of the weighty advice that I received from the Law Society of Scotland on the appropriate terminology for north of the border. It is obvious that our parliamentary draftsmen were working to the 1971 Act. One cannot so easily catch them out. 
<P>
The Law Society of Scotland was not only thinking of the exact terminology; it wished to make a wider point, which is that, in Scotland, money bonds or money bail has not been used too much. Its principal anxiety was about the sort of bail that would be demanded under the 1077 1078 Bill's provisions. It was reluctant to see the Bill reintroduce or expand the scope of bail by providing for lodging a sum of money in court rather than applying other conditions, which is now apparently the norm in Scotland. 
<P>
Will the Minister clarify the type of sureties that are likely to be required north and south of the border? In particular, will he make it clear to those who read Hansard exactly who will operate the law in Scotland, whether the securities required in clause 31 will be simply and purely sums of money; or are we are talking about other conditions? 
<P>
I wonder whether, as we discussed earlier, magistrates will be given criteria, and expected to look principally at whether the money lodged with the court is likely to stop the person absconding, or whether to look at a range of conditions, of which a sum of money will be only a small part? That question was important to Scottish lawyers, who, at this particularly sensitive time, may feel aggrieved about United Kingdom legislation. They sometimes feel aggrieved, quite properly, that the Bill seems to be moving in a different direction from that in which they are trying to steer the Scottish legal system. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B>  I can tell the hon. Gentleman that what he asked for in an earlier debate is what we seek to deliver--a two-stage process. First, the courts should decide whether a person should continue to be detained, and if they conclude that he should not, they should release him, subject to the normal immigration conditions. Secondly, if they are not satisfied with those conditions, they may be prepared to release him on other conditions. They can then consider whether particular conditions are appropriate. 
<P>
The magistrates courts can consider a broad range of conditions, which may include a surety, which is a commitment to pay a certain amount of money should a particular set of conditions obtain--usually that the person does not turn up at the place or time that they are supposed to. Another possibility is a security, which is the depositing of a sum of money to obtain someone's release. A range of other conditions may be applied, which often include reporting to a police station at regular intervals, living at a particular address, informing the immigration service of any change of address within a particular time, ensuring that they do not go to a particular area or whatever else the courts might feel appropriate to ensure that concerns about someone's absconding are addressed. 
<P>
If the courts feel that conditions are available to them to ensure that someone turns up at court or at an immigration hearing or interview, or reports to an immigration officer as requested, they will properly grant bail. If they feel that the conditions that are available to them do not sufficiently reassure them, the courts will then deny bail and the person will be detained. That is the range of options that we intend to make available to adjudicators in Scotland and to magistrates courts in England and Wales. As I have already said, because there are so few detainees in Scotland, it is better that adjudicators should deal with the matter there. 
<P>
We are giving the courts a range of options, which will allow them properly to decide the future of anyone in detention. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
Amendment made: No. 496, in page 22, line 40, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"named in the recognizance or bond"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert "specified by the court". 
<P>
No. 497, in page 23, line 1, leave out from beginning to first "to" in line 2 and insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Bail may be granted subject to such other conditions as appear".-- 
<P>
</UL></FONT>[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 498, in page 23, line 3, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) If bail is granted under this section by the Commission, the condition mentioned in subsection (2A) may require him to appear before the Commission instead of an immigration officer.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is straightforward. It brings the procedure for routine bail hearings held before the special immigration appeals commission into line with that operating under the 1971 Act as amended by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 in cases where a person has made an application for a bail hearing to the commission. As such people can be bailed to reappear before the commission rather than an immigration officer, an identical provision should be made in the context of routine bail hearings. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere will be familiar with the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997. For those who are less familiar with it, it deals mainly with security cases and makes special provision for hearings before a special appeals commission in cases of appeals against decisions. It usually involves about five or six cases a year--certainly a small number of cases. I hope that the Committee will support the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 23, line 3, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"--(3A) The conditions imposed under this section must be notified to the person bailed in writing and in a lanuage he understands.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the Committee will have gathered, clause 31 gives the courts power to grant bail, subject to a recognisance or bond. Under subsection (3), conditions may be imposed, which include 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"conditions appearing to the court to be likely to result in the appearance of the person bailed at the required time and place."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We all hope that that is what will happen. 
<P>
In keeping with the spirit of earlier amendments, amendment No. 246 is straightforward, and we hope for a sympathetic response to it from the Government. It would require that conditions imposed on the granting of bail 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"must be notified to the person ... in writing and in a language he understands".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a familiar point, which was suggested by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, and I hope that the Minister will agree that it is desirable. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am afraid that I cannot support amendment No. 246, though I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's point. It is unclear by whom the application envisaged in the amendment is intended to be made--a technical point that could be examined again later. More fundamentally, it has always been our intention that an interpreter be present at a hearing fully to explain the entirety of the proceedings to detainees in whatever language they speak. 
<P>
The court will notify the terms of any recognisance or bail bond, together with any conditions imposed in writing in English, to detainees and their representatives. Where necessary, the interpreter will notify the detainee of those terms and conditions orally in a language that he understands. Informing the detainee in that way would enable us to make the most effective use of available resources. The interpreter could, however, be requested to write out longhand the conditions under which a person is detained, which would be a matter for the interpreter and lawyer to decide. 
<P>
The difficulty with the amendment is that we must not bind ourselves in such a way that people can claim that they are not bound by the conditions of bail because the translation is incorrect. It is essential that options are available when persons do not comply with bail conditions that we want to courts to be able to impose. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock </B>(Wyre Forest) : Does my hon. Friend agree that a further problem with the amendment is that only the detained person truly knows which language he understands? It would be inappropriate to allow a detained person to claim later that he should be exempted from all conditions because he had only a partial understanding of the language and because one or more of the conditions in the clause had not been properly translated into a dialect that he could fully understand, even though he was familiar with the language. There is a legal ambiguity in the amendment, which is essentially undermining the principle of putting conditions on bail in the first place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend, who has great experience of dealing with litigation in our courts, can educate us all on the ways in which an astute lawyer can find a way to ensure that his client does not need to comply with bail conditions. He rightly points out that there are many languages and many different dialects and that it is important to ensure that individuals understand precisely what is going on in the courts and, if they are bailed, precisely on what conditions. 
<P>
Amendment No. 246, however, would bind us because it states that: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The conditions imposed under this section must"--
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
there is no doubt about the strength of the obligation-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"be notified to the person bailed in writing and in a language he understands".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the language or particular dialect is not used, the person can claim that he cannot he subject to conditions that have not been explained to him in a way that he can understand. If the amendment were accepted, such a case might successfully be made--and none of us wants that. 
<P>
I can provide the reassurance that whenever possible the interpreter will ensure that everything that happens is explained to the detainee. In criminal cases--with all the caveats on which the hon. Member for Hertsmere and I agreed earlier about reading too much from criminal cases into bail conditions for immigration cases--there is a standard bail notice. The person is able to read the form in English or, if necessary, it will be translated by someone who can read English and speak that person's language or dialect. That seems to work well when people are detained in relation to the criminal law. 
<P>
I do not, however, want to set unnecessary and burdensome conditions that might result in bail not being granted in immigration cases because the courts cannot be fully satisfied that a translation in writing is available in the detainee's language. That could result in the detainee being kept in detention longer, until such time as the court can be sure that a person who speaks the individuals language is available to write out and hand over the notice. 
<P>
If a court has decided that a detainee should not be detained, it is not helpful to have a provision in place that could result in such a person being detained longer than necessary, solely for the administrative reason that a language translator is unavailable at the time. The detainees might well think that the motives behind the amendment are laudable but that the practicalities are likely to result in longer detention. 
<P>
I hope that I have provided some reassurance. We will try to operate the provisions in a way that has not provoked controversy in the criminal justice system where lawyers have been able to acquire translations to explain conditions to those granted bail. I am not aware that adjudicators' actions on granting bail have produced any problems. I hope that the Committee will accept that the amendment is unnecessary.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> To borrow a term from the hon. Member for Hertsmere, that response was a little disappointing. I added my name to the amendment in the hope of gaining something more concrete. The Minister has told us what good practice should be--that the person should leave the court with a clear idea of the conditions. To satisfy due process requirements, that would have to be the case, especially when one's liberty is at stake. That is a serious matter and someone should not be detained again purely because of a misunderstanding. 
<P>
Will the Minister tell us more about how good practice will be set, for example in the operation of court rules? There must be some standard procedures and guidance. The Minister spoke of an idyllic situation in which the person leaves the court fully understanding all the conditions as a result of clear explanation by the legal representative. Is there a way of ensuring that that always applies and that people never fall through the net? Even explanations of the conditions in English can leave 1081 1082 something to be desired. I do not know whether the bail conditions will fall under the new requirements for plain English and ridding legal language of Latin. I certainly have problems with words like "recognisance" and "surety". Someone who leaves court with a person speaking in such terms may have to find some else to get an explanation. Translating legalese into English is bad enough, but, translating "surety" and "recognisance" into Albanian would be a job and a half. 
<P>
I hope that we will be clear on such matters. The Minister has said that he is anxious about the individual challenging the fact that he or she did not understand the terms of the detention. However, I hope that the Minister does not allow the Government to fall into the trap of being challenged by someone taking up a case by questioning whether there was due process or natural justice in administering the system. Such a person might go to a court and be successful in arguing that he or she never really understood what the conditions were. The court may take a sympathetic view of that as the courts did not have in place effective procedures for ensuring that such communication took place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister' response. I was not disappointed but rather intrigued, as the Immigration Law Practitioners Association made a modest, sensible proposal. I would have thought that that organisation would be in a good position to know about potential difficulties, and its proposal, in the form of the amendment, is a sensible way of avoiding potential misunderstandings in future. 
<P>
I was also intrigued by the intervention of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Lock). Problems with dialects and linguistic strains are all the more reason for putting matters down in writing and ensuring that everyone concerned understands. 
<P>
I thought that ILPA made a sensible proposal and I hope that the Minister will be prepared to listen to that organisation, should it have further representations to make on this point. However, I wish to make progress and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 645, in page 23, line 11, at end add-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5A) If on a reference under section 29 the court decides not to grant bail to a detained person and it appears to the court that the detained person is the parent of children at the time of the reference the court must give its reasons for refusing bail. 
<P>
"(5B) If on a reference under section 29 the court decides not to grant bail to a detained person and the detained person is looking after children who are in detention with him or her the detained person may appeal to a judge of the crown court against the refusal to grant bail.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now come to the important subject of children in detention. I accept that that is not an easy matter for the Minister to deal with. 
<P>
Amendment No. 645 would insert into clause 31 proposed subsection (5A), which deals with detained people who are the parents of children elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the amendment is to explore the extent to which a court should take that into account in the bail reference. 
<P>
The proposed subsection (5B) is slightly different and concerns children who are in detention with their parents. Will the Minister confirm that, sadly, that sometimes has to happen. Clearly, that is a serious matter, which is reflected by the amendment's provision for a further appeal against a refusal of bail to a crown court judge. Children being in detention--and therefore a form of custody--with their parents is a serious matter that needs careful examination and may require review by a judge in the crown court. 
<P>
That is not too much to ask because, as the Minister knows, it is common for bail applications that are turned down in the magistrates court to be reviewed in the crown court. We do not like seeing children in detention: I am sure that all Committee members join me in that sentiment. However, I accept that this is a difficult subject. 
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the oral evidence and the very good written evidence that we received from the Children's Society. I remind the Minister--I am sure that he has read the memorandum of further evidence--that the Children's Society suggests that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There should be an unequivocal prohibition within the Bill against the detention of unaccompanied minors or children under any circumstances."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall deal with unaccompanied children later; we are dealing now with those children who are with their parents. The Children's Society recommends that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Children in detention centres should have access to an independent visitor who can advocate on their behalf."
<P>

<P>
We received some interesting and compelling evidence from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. It is always helpful to read particular cases, because they bring things to life and lead us to understand some of the issues that might be at stake for individuals. The foundation's evidence contains a case study, which it received from Hackney law centre, about children who were taken into a detention centre in traumatic circumstances. 
<P>
Four children were held with their mother in an immigration detention centre. They were kept for four to five weeks in a single cell. The mother stated that the older girls kept asking if they could return to school and that the boys' behaviour deteriorated. The mother asked social services to take the children into care because she could not care for them on her return to her country. Later in their lives in foster care, the children suffered psychological problems relating to their experience of detention and witnessing their mother's detention and deportation. 
<P>
Clearly, those are very distressing matters, but that case is in the evidence, so I do not propose to mention it in any more detail. However, it brings home to members of the Committee the seriousness of this subject. In later debates, I shall deal with unaccompanied children and the determination of the age of children--also important matters. 
<P>
I hope that I do not stray too far from the amendment, Mr. Maxton, but the Minister will know from debates on the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, especially those on the holding of 15 and 16-year-old boys on remand, the serious view that Conservative Members take of children in detention. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendments sympathetically; they are fairly modest but justified given the seriousness of this sensitive and important matter. They were tabled to allow such issues to be explored and they represent modest ways in which the seriousness of the cases could be reflected. I would have thought that, in particular, proposed subsection (5B) constituted a modest but useful additional safeguard. There is no great technical or other reason why it should not be possible to take such a course and reflect the serious view that we should take about children who are held in detention. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about the detention of children. I do not know the age of the case that he refers to, but I suspect that it is at least a few years old. I take a very serious view of the detention of any child, whether accompanied or unaccompanied. It is certainly undesirable that children should be kept with adults and the circumstances may not be at all suitable to their detention. That is why the aim of the immigration authorities must always be to ensure that the detention of accompanied children--those detained with their parents--should be kept to an absolute minimum. 
<P>
Children might be detained for a short period. That usually happens if they are detained the day before an enforced removal is due. They are then placed on a plane the following day, or within a couple of days. If children are detained for more than a day or two, we start to worry greatly about whether they should continue to be detained. That is why I suspect that the case referred to by the hon. Gentleman might be several years old. 
<P>
It is now appropriate for me to reflect on cases of unaccompanied children, who must be dealt with slightly differently. Although there may be some justification for detaining them for a day or, at the most, two days, before putting them on a plane to return them--an undesirable, but necessary, function of immigration control--we do not support the detention of unaccompanied children. Some are detained if they arrive in the middle of the night and need to be handed over to social services the next morning, but no person under the age of 18 is knowingly detained by the immigration service. I have given clear instructions that that rule must be followed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Particular cases have been referred to me of unaccompanied children who have forged or adulterated passports stating that they are adults. Although it is obvious that the documents are fake, the immigration services still detains the children because of that and treats them like adults because the documents state that they are adults even though medical advisers may say that they are children.

<P>

<B>O'Brien:</B> Unfortunately, my experience is that medical advice is not as conclusive as we might like to hope. The message gets through to traffickers, in particular, that the immigration service's policy is not to detain persons under the age of 18. I have seen photographs recently of people who claim to be under 18, some of whom I would not be surprised were a day younger than 40. They had told the authorities that they were under 18, so that they could not be detained. There is a scam in people claiming that they are under 18 and, as long as they are detained, they will persist in claiming that. 
<P>
However, in the case of the boundary ages of 17 to 19 years, evidence has shown that it is difficult for doctors accurately to say the age of a person simply by looking at their teeth or whatever. Having to assess the age of people in the narrow age band of 16 and 20, when their age is unclear, is an extremely serious business, especially when they say that they are younger and have passports or other documents suggesting that they are older. Other corroboration may suggest that they are older--travelling with older people and so on. The difficulties in assessing ages are considerable. The immigration service tries to err on the side of the caution by suggesting that someone is older than 18. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I want the immigration service to be careful about detaining people under that age and not knowingly to do so. I cannot deny that mistakes have been made, probably far more than we would have liked. We must ensure that they are kept to an absolute minimum and that medical opinion is sought as quickly as possible, so that the age of the person can be assessed. As I have already said, such evidence is often inconclusive as the person involved may seem to be any age between 16 and 20. Some people, especially if malnourished--as may well be the case for a person claiming asylum--do not grow so quickly, so the problem is made even more difficult. 
<P>
Detention is a regrettable necessity in immigration control. Detention of minors is even more worrying, and we must approach it with a great deal of caution. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am listening to the Minister with interest. the amendments do not relate to unaccompanied children, an important matter to which we shall return. What is the Minister's reaction to proposed new subsection (5B), which relates to a detained person who looks after his or her children in detention? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am conscious that the amendment relates to accompanied children, and was responding to the quite proper anxieties about unaccompanied children raised by the hon. Member for Hallam. As they were in order, I thought it appropriate to deal with them. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about accompanied children. I acknowledge the anxiety that lies behind the amendment. Of course we are worried about the welfare of children and whether they are properly cared for. However, the consideration of bail relates to the detained person. The fact that the detained person may be the parent of a child will have formed part of the immigration service's consideration of that person's detention. In our experience, if there are family ties, the risk of absconding is usually minimal. Therefore when someone is detained, not merely pending removal but perhaps earlier in the process, it is rare for accompanied children to be detained for long. There is therefore no question of leaving children abandoned or to fend for themselves because their parents or carers are detained. 
<P>

<P>
I recognise that section 5(3) of the Bail Act 1976 requires magistrates to give reasons for refusing bail in many cases and that in a broader context, including other factors as well as that under consideration, the argument may require greater consideration. Having examined the amendment with great care last night--I do not think that it was tabled very long ago--I believe that arguments can be made for not merely telling magistrates that they should give reasons but specifying that in the Bill. Magistrates normally believe that they must give reasons for refusing bail, and normally do so. The hon. Member for Hertsmere argued that we need to consider obliging them to do so by specifying that in the Bill. I should like to give due consideration to that point not only in that context but in a wider context, to consider the issue at greater length. I should therefore like to consider the wider arguments relating to that part of the amendment as well as the narrower one that he advanced, write to him in due course and judge whether it would be appropriate to table an amendment on Report. 
<P>
Although the hon. Member for Hertsmere suggests that the other part of the amendment, proposed new subsection (5B), is easier to accept, I find it slightly more difficult. We do not feel that such a right of appeal is warranted. If, notwithstanding the fact that the person involved has been looking after children, it has been determined that he must be detained for other reasons, and if that person is subsequently refused bail by a magistrates court, it is entirely open to him to apply in some circumstances to judicially review either the immigration service's decision to detain him or that of the court to refuse him bail. 
<P>
Although Crown court judges have experience of dealing with criminal cases under the Bail Act, they are less involved with immigration cases. It would therefore be more appropriate for other forums such as the High Court to be available for reconsideration of a refusal of bail in that context. That being said, I am prepared to look at the issues raised by proposed new subsection (5B) to consider arguments such as the one that the hon. Gentleman has made. 
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
In other legislation, there are situations where appeal rights go to the Crown court. I am not convinced at the moment that that is necessarily the appropriate venue for an appeal, but I am prepared to look at the issue. Given my warmer welcome to the first part of the amendment than to the second part, I am happy to look at the issue, perhaps over a longer time, and write to the hon. Gentleman and members of the Committee to let them know my view on how we will deal with it and whether I feel that it is appropriate to table amendments on Report. It is likely that we will table amendments to deal with the problems in new subsection (5A). Perhaps it is now less clear in my mind that we will use the Crown court as the venue, but I shall look at the arguments for and against that. I hope on that basis that he will be prepared to withdraw his amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I hope that I can draw the Minister out on a couple of issues raised by the important amendment. The first is the way in which the bail decision is made in terms of the availability of appropriate accommodation. The Minister referred to the fact that he feels that the detention of a family group is a fairly routine matter--not desirable but routine--and that people will regularly be removed from the country the next day. We were more concerned about those disowned on coming into the country. However, will the Minister tell us whether magistrates, when making a decision to grant bail, will take into account whether there is suitable accommodation available for a family group? Will they decide in the abstract, in which case accommodation will simply have to be found, or will the fact that there is nothing available in the detention estate be a material factor? Also, will the Minister suggest whether he believes that suitable facilities are now available for families to be held in the detention estate, and whether that will change? 
<P>
The other group referred to in the amendment are those detained while other family members are outside. Similarly, will the availability of facilities for such a family member to be reunited with his or her family on a visitor or temporary basis be a material factor as to whether he or she continues to be detained? I am referring to people held in a place where they can have family contact on a visitor basis with their families, or on the outside as in the other part of the amendment. 
<P>
For example, when Roma families entered the south-east of the country, males of families were often held in detention, sometimes in prison estates. There were complaints from people outside that, because they were held in such estates, there was a much more severe impact on families than there might have been had they been held in other accommodation. Again, it would be useful to at least start to explore whether, if such people have to be held, the accommodation's suitability in terms of allowing family contact is a material factor that will be allowed for by those deciding on bail. 
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): I should simply like to point out to the Minister that the amendment makes a modest proposal. There is sometimes a tendency in immigration and asylum matters for notions of due process to fly out of the window. I remind the Minister that there is an absolute presumption in our criminal justice system against detaining or imprisoning children, and especially against doing so in adult facilities for all types of reasons, not least in the long term that they may be put at risk. To ask the court to give reasons for refusing bail is a modest proposal that would act as some sort of check for marginal cases. The right to appeal to a judge would be in line with other types of provision. Where children of asylum seekers are concerned, we cannot stand accused of having malice aforethought as they have committed no crime. We should treat child asylum seekers in the same way as we treat children elsewhere in the criminal justice system. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a short but useful debate. I welcome all contributions, including the Minister's. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I was caught on a previous amendment, which the hon. Gentleman withdrew rather quickly. Will he allow me to deal with some of the points raised before he withdraws this amendment?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have not got that far yet, Mr. Maxton. I was just getting everyone in the mood. 
<P>
I was pleased at what the Minister said when welcoming proposed new subsection (5A). I do not want to be difficult, but I made it clear in my opening remarks that I was more interested in proposed new subsection (5B). Subsection (5A) deals with cases where the parents are in detention but the children are not. That is serious enough, because the children are separated from the parents, but it is not nearly as serious as the children being in detention. 
<P>
As I said at the start, I understand the difficulties, but I am concerned about any children being in detention. We shall come later to unaccompanied children, but I do not want to jump the gun, because we shall be debating some important new clauses on the subject. There are many arguments to consider, particularly on the determination of age, and some helpful evidence has been supplied to the Committee. I want to focus instead on the matter of children being held in detention with their parents. 
<P>
The case to which I referred the Minister was mentioned on page 332 of the memorandum of evidence that we have received. It was a case from 1997, and the children were kept for between four and five weeks in a single cell. I accept that it is rare for that to happen, but it is clear that it sometimes does. It is that sort of case that I am trying to provide for in the amendment. Being held in detention might have serious and long-lasting consequences for the children. 
<P>
I welcome the sympathetic tone of the Minister's response, but I hope that he will not think that I am churlish if I say that he did not go quite far enough. I was not entirely taken with his argument on why there should be no right of appeal to a judge in the Crown court. I put forward what I believe to be a modest proposal and I hope that it is not a hugely controversial one. That right is enjoyed by all criminals whose bail applications are refused. Any criminal has the right to go to a judge of the Crown court. I hope that it is not so controversial for children, or for the parents whose children are with them in detention, to have the same right. 
<P>
I am not convinced that it will be beyond the powers of a Crown court judge. I heard what the Minister said about judges not being used to that sort of case, but neither are the magistrates used to such cases. We do not know what arrangements will have to be made to decide which magistrates deal with those cases, but I think that most Crown court judges could manage to struggle along and do justice to a bail application from parents whose children are in detention. 
<P>
I am a bit surprised by the Minister's response, but if he feels that the Crown court is not an appropriate forum and that such cases should go to the High Court, why not have an appeal on bail to the High Court? The amendment is not cast in stone; it does not have to go to the Crown court; a High Court judge would do just as well. I am saying, however, that we should get those cases to court as quickly and inexpensively as we can. 
<P>
I was also surprised to hear what the Minister said about judicial review. A bail application is a simpler, quicker and less expensive way of getting a case before the High Court than applying for judicial review. Why on earth go to the expense and detail of judicial review when it can be done as a bail application--if necessary in chambers before the judge hears the rest of his cases in the morning? That would be a much simpler way of doing it. I want to hear better reasons than those that I have heard already. I am not trying to be controversial. It is a modest proposal, which would assist in some important cases. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has once again been a little churlish. I have said that I am quite happy to look at the question, not only in the context of those with children, but in the broader context. He has raised two matters, which are perfectly proper and legitimate. The first is that reasons should be given in the Bill. I have given a sympathetic response to that argument. I said that it is a strong argument for putting conditions in the Bill, not only in the context of those with children, but in the broader context. Secondly, I have agreed to look again at the right of appeal. We need to consider how making an appeal on bail can be made most efficiently and effectively. 
<P>
I am not unsympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's argument for a right of appeal. He said that the Crown court would be the appropriate venue. The Immigration Act 1971 does not specify a venue of appeal, in immigration cases, from the adjudicator to other courts. That is one reason for the growth in judicial review. We must consider whether it is appropriate for the Crown court suddenly to start considering appeals in a new area of law. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will no doubt say that we are deciding that magistrates courts will consider those cases. Magistrates courts do, of course, have a broad jurisdiction; they do not hear only criminal cases. They deal with licensing matters, divorce and many other things. There is therefore no reason why they should not deal with immigration matters; they have a wide civil jurisdiction. 
<P>
If we took the suggested course of action and used the criminal court--the Crown court--as an appeal court, such cases would be treated similarly to criminal cases, about which the hon. Gentleman has expressed doubts. The hon. Gentleman may say--to some extent, it is true--that the Crown court has some civil appeal jurisdiction, but it is limited. We need to look at how the appeals system might work in a bail case. He said that a judicial review or an application for habeas corpus is not appropriate or cost-efficient--a view with which I have some sympathy, and I shall consider his proposition. We have so far shown ourselves willing to listen. 
<P>
I was not quite sure about the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) about absolute presumptions. I am not sure whether one can have such a presumption, but it is right that we should consider the issues surrounding appeals. We need to do so not only for those who have children, but in the wider context. If we have a right of bail, it may be appropriate to use it in a wider context, so that all those subject to a refusal of bail might have certain rights of appeal. If we grant a right of appeal, 1089 1090 it is difficult to argue that it should be restricted only to those who can show that they have children. Will it mean only children in this country--and in what circumstances? We might find ourselves in a complex, not to say difficult, realm of law if we start on that route. 
<P>
I have given a sympathetic response to the amendment. I am happy to reconsider its two points. Rather than suggest that I need to go further, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that such matters will be examined. I shall write to him and other members of the Committee about the amendment. As I have said several times, I take seriously the detention of children. I am not satisfied at present that we have put in place all the necessary protection for children, given the other propositions that are now coming forward. I am happy to consider how they apply to other detainees, too. 
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I detect from the tone of the Minister's voice that his remarks are coming to an end, but will he say whether the suitability of accommodation for respective families can be taken into account by magistrates when deciding whether to grant bail? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that accommodation for families is limited. There is one family unit at Tinsley house, for example, so accommodation for families in which they can be detained for any length of time is limited. That is why we need accommodation that can be converted at fairly short notice. It would not be appropriate, however, to detain families, especially children, in prison accommodation. Accommodation is a factor that courts will want to take into account when making decisions. If they were to detain a family, we would have to ensure that appropriate accommodation was available. 
<P>
It is relevant to consider the accommodation in which children will be detained. No doubt magistrates will want to be sure that, if a family is to be detained for a period, they are not detained in anything other than suitable accommodation. The provision will give families with children a right of appeal that they did not have previously and it is an important step forward. Given that we do not detain many people for the length of time that gives rise to concern, we do not anticipate that the provision will be used very much. We are discussing a tiny number of people. In any one year, the number of people who are likely to come under the framework of routine hearings that may result in their going before the magistrates court will amount only to the fingers of one hand. Furthermore, there will still be a very small number of people in that position over a number of years. I share the concern of Opposition Members about any situation in which families are detained. It is undesirable; it may be necessary to take such action, but it should be kept to an absolute minimum. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I assure the Minister that I was not being churlish in my response. I have heard many ministerial responses in my time--I may have given some myself--in which the Minister says that he will take something away, but then goes on to give reasons why he does not think that such arguments are acceptable and makes no guarantees. It is important for Ministers to listen to arguments before they take away matters for consideration. 
<P>
I was not convinced by the Minister's original arguments for not accepting the amendment, nor am I impressed by his new arguments. The issue should not be that controversial, although I recognise that it is a difficult area. The amendment is a modest proposal and I hope that the Minister will consider it sympathetically. He has agreed to take it away and write to me in good time for the next stage of our proceedings. I may return to this important subject on Report. Given that the Minister will consider the matter and to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B>  I beg to move amendment No. 499, in page 23, line 17, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) If the court which makes an order under section (1) is not a magistrates' court, it must-- 
<P>
(a) specify a magistrates' court which is, for the purposes of collection, enforcement and remission of the sum forfeited, to be treated as the court which ordered the forfeiture; and 
<P>
(b) as soon as practicable give particulars of the recognizance to-- 
<P>
(i) in England and Wales, the justice' chief executive appointed by the magistrates' court committee whose area includes the petty sessions area, or 
<P>
(ii) in Northern Ireland, the clerk of petty sessions for the petty sessions district, 
<P>
for which the specified court acts. 
<P>
(1B) Any sum collected as a result of subsection (1A)(a) must be paid to the Lord Chancellor. 
<P>
(1C) The Lord Chancellor may, with the approval of the Treasury, make regulations as to the times at which the manner in which accounts for, and payments of, sums collected as a result of subsection (1A)(a) must be made and for the keeping and auditing of accounts in relation to such sums.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment Nos. 515 to 517. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> These are consequential amendments. Routine bail hearings under clause 29 will often go before a magistrates court, or in certain circumstances, before an adjudicator, the tribunal or, indeed, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. Each of those courts or tribunals will be able to grant bail and each will have the power to require a recognisance before the date that a detainee is released. 
<P>
Under amendment No. 499, arrangements will be made for the collection and enforcement of recognisances if the court which grants the bail subsequently orders it to be forfeited. Those arrangements will apply to England and Wales and, indeed, Northern Ireland. Suitable provision is already made in relation to Scotland, where sheriffs have powers of collection and enforcement. Subsection (3) will make provision for other courts. 
<P>
The amendment specifies that the moneys collected must be paid to the Lord Chancellor, who in turn will be required to pay them into the Consolidated Fund under amendment No. 516. The amendment will allow the Lord Chancellor, with Treasury approval, to make regulations governing the keeping and auditing of accounts. 
<P>
The other amendments deal with the coming into force of a provision under clause 69 of the Access to Justice Bill, under which the title "justices' clerks" will be replaced by "justices' chief executives". Amendment No. 515 will substitute the new title for the old one where it appears in clause 114. Amendment No. 517 is a transitional provision, under which references to the new title are to be read as references to the old one until the relevant provisions of the Access to Justice Bill come into force. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 500, in page 23, line 21, leave out "an adjudicator" and insert "a court".

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 501.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 625, in page 23, line 27, leave out

<P>
No. 629, in page 24, line 19, leave out "is likely to" and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is reasonable suspicion that the arrested person will".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Clause 33 will update the powers of arrest under the Immigration Act 1971 in respect of someone who is believed to have broken, or to be about to break, the conditions of a bond granted under the Bill. Under amendment No. 626, we want to establish whether the conditions applied are alternatives and to ensure that there is no cumulative effect. We want to ensure that the power of arrest will be activated on two alternative grounds: first, that a person has broken the conditions of his bond or, secondly, that a person is breaking them. The third alternative is that a person is likely to break those conditions. The other amendments in this group deal with those alternatives. 
<P>
With amendment No. 625 we have tried to remove the third alternative. We want to leave it that the power of arrest is activated when someone has broken or is breaking the conditions of his bail bond but we are removing the third condition which is that he is likely to break the bond. That third condition allows action to be taken purely on a suspicion and is an imprecise way of ascertaining whether someone should be brought back into detention. Detention is a serious consequence of the breaking of bail and these amendments are an attempt to test the conditions under which a person can be arrested and brought back into detention. 
<P>
Amendment No. 627 takes away the right of the immigration officer or constable to arrest without a warrant a person released on bail when the grounds for that arrest are based purely on suspicion and speculation. I have already mentioned our concern about arresting a person simply on the basis of a suspicion that he is likely to break the bail bond. Doing that without a warrant would be of great concern as it seems to imply that the person can be arrested and brought back into detention on far too lenient a test. 
<P>
Amendment No. 629 is another way of addressing the same issue and looking at the "is likely to" provision again and suggesting an alternative wording. Here we are saying that there should be reasonable suspicion which is a more testable proposition than the "is likely to" test. "Reasonable suspicion" has a stronger basis in law and could be better tested by the courts, the justices or whoever was asked to approve the remittal of the bail. 
<P>
The aim of the amendments is partly to strengthen the test for saying that the bail has been forfeited or for bringing in the powers of arrest once the authorities have decided that the bail has been forfeited and to remove the suspicion element as far as possible. We are suggesting alternative positions which strengthen the notion of the suspicion that may be required to bring the arrest into force. The other objective is to test the Government's position on this. I hope that the Minister can tell us the circumstances he feels would be covered by the "is likely to" provision. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I understand that these amendments, like others tabled by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), arise out of suggestions made by the Law Society of Scotland. I certainly understand the civil liberties which underline these suggestions but I must emphasise that someone released on bail would not be liable to arrest on suspicion. The power to arrest under subsection (1) depends on an immigration officer or constable having reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned is likely to break the conditions of his or her bail. 
<P>
Once arrested the person would come back before the court; the power of arrest is therefore subject to a quick and keen scrutiny by the courts. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that that is an obvious and necessary safeguard. I am therefore unable to accept the 1093 1094 removal of the power to arrest in the event of a reasonable belief that a person would break a condition of his bail which would be necessitated by amendments Nos. 625 and 626. 
<P>
While we must naturally have regard to the rights of the detainee, I am also a little surprised at the indifference apparently shown by amendment No. 627 for the surety. That is someone chosen by a detainee and if that person begins to have doubts and wishes to be relieved of his or her obligations as a surety there has to be some way of addressing those concerns and bringing the matter back before a court. Amendment No. 629 would remove a court's power to reset bail where it is satisfied that the person is likely to abscond and replace it with a power to rule that there is reasonable suspicion that the arrested person will abscond. Notwithstanding the eloquence of the hon. Member for Hallam, I see no difference between the present and proposed wording, so I cannot accept his amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We were trying to test the provision and this part of the Bill. I wanted to hear the Minister's response on the effect of the words "reasonable grounds" in the first line of subsection (1) to see whether he believes that it would be sufficient to cover the concerns that I raised. I will take the amendment away and look at it again with my legal advisers. For the expedition of the Committee's proceedings today, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 523, in page 24, line 2, after "by", insert "reasonable". 
<P>
The amendment reflects a traditional concern of my hon. Friends and mine about the use of force, especially by the authorities, in the proper pursuit of their legal duties and the carrying out of their business as the state's agents, and about the need to balance the force used to the requisite end with the need to ensure that an individual's civil liberties are protected. Our concern reflects partly the fact that at a late stage in the Bill--I do not seek to pre-empt that debate--we will confer additional powers on immigration officers to act independently of the police, so that many functions undertaken by the police may be carried out independently by immigration officers. There is a range of anxieties about that, which we shall debate later. 
<P>
We are worried that either an immigration officer or a constable will use force to enter premises to apprehend someone. We wish simply to insert the word "reasonable" to clarify the degree of force, which could be tested in law if a person made a complaint about the extent of the force that had been used to achieve the aims of the immigration service's directive. 
<P>
We realise that clause 33 effectively updates schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, which allowed people to be pursued where they had broken an immigration bond. But my understanding is that the new subsection (5) to clause 33 is novel. Perhaps the Minister will comment on the relationship between subsection (5) and clause 117, which relates to the powers of immigration officers and allows the use of reasonable force, and tell the Committee whether it would apply in this context as well as more generally in the context of the new powers of immigration officers. 
<P>
The relationship between clause 33(5) and clause 117 is of interest to us, but I hope that the Minister will reassure us about the Government's attitude to the level of force that should be used, especially by immigration officers. I do not mean to question immigration officers' professionalism, but it is clear that they operate within a different set of guidelines from police constables, who have a different range of training and accountability structures. 
<P>
We want a belt and braces approach to ensuring that any force used is appropriate to the job, not least because the inappropriate use of force could create, or exacerbate unnecessarily, any tensions in a community. I can think of areas of the country where immigration officers going in and misapplying force to effect entry while properly arresting a person who has broken his bond, could give the immigration service a bad name, especially in a community where there is sympathy for the person who is to be taken away. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> To what extent does the hon. Gentleman think that existing law requires that force should be reasonable? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I understand that to be the general presumption in law. I was simply trying to explore with the Government the extent to which reasonableness would be the concept here. My general understanding is 1095 1096 that the courts will always test whether force has been reasonable, but it would be helpful if that were stated in the Bill; hence the suggested amendment. If the Minister were to say later that force, if used, would always be reasonable but that if it were found not to be, that would be unlawful, that again would be helpful. 
<P>
To return to my earlier theme, there is concern about the possible wider implications of the inappropriate use of force. This is clearly a very sensitive area. When premises are broken into, people will pay attention to the damage caused to property during an attempt to gain entry, and, using a common sense judgment, will take into account whether reasonable methods were used or whether immigration officers used excessive force. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I shall attempt to explore the notion of "reasonable force", and the degree of force that might be used. I remember well the case of the Oganwobe family in my constituency who spent years holed up in a church. It had always been possible to take the Oganwobes from the church by force, but the local police force and immigration service had to calculate the degree of force that would have been required and the ramifications for the community. In the end, the family came out through negotiations, in which I played a part. While no one would want to detract from the professionalism of the immigration officers, local police forces do have an advantage over them in that they know the community, the specific circumstances of an estate and the community that they are considering entering by force and are able to make quite careful calculations. In the context of some aspects of social cohesion in the community, I think that it is worth exploring the notion of "reasonable force" at this stage of the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): I shall be brief. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) is worth looking at. The Bill extends the powers of immigration officers. We are asking them to undertake tasks which at present are generally done by the police. It is perhaps true that the police are not enthusiastic about carrying out some of these functions because they do not feel that police officers should use their time in this way. But if immigration officers are to do this type of work, training is clearly an issue. I realise that we may come back to this later. 
<P>
Another issue is the degree of force that should be used in such situations. Subsection (5) refers to power to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"enter, if need be, by force".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could mean having to break down a door, or breaking a lock or a window, if the person inside the property would not let an officer in. It would be helpful if the Minister could give the Committee an idea of what that might mean. If it is true that the concept of reasonable force is generally enshrined in law, would it do any harm to specify it in the clause? At least that would give a familiar concept a place in the clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has noticed clause 117, which refers to the use of force in relation to the general provisions of the Bill and explicitly uses the phrase "reasonable force". In some ways, it seems unnecessary to specify force in this clause separately, without the word "reasonable", when we are quite happy to allow it with the word "reasonable" in another clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I was just turning to that clause. I suppose that it might be argued that in a sense the point is already covered, as clause 117 specifies 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any power conferred on him by the 1971 Act or this Act".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree that other parts of the Bill already specify that "reasonable" force should be used. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Paragraph 17 of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 covers similar issues. For the purposes of explanation and discussion of the current situation, it might be helpful if I read it, so that the hon. Member for Hallam knows the context in which it was originally examined. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person liable to be detained under paragraph 16 above may be arrested without warrant by a constable or an immigration officer."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision deals with people who breach bail. It continues: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If-- 
<P>
(a) a justice of the peace is by written information on oath satisfied that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that a person liable to be arrested under this paragraph is to be found on any premises; or 
<P>
(b) in Scotland, a sheriff, or a magistrate or justice of the peace, having jurisdiction in the place where the premises are situated is by evidence on oath so satisfied; he may grant a warrant authorising any constable acting for the police area in which the premises are situated, or in Northern Ireland any constable, at any time or times within one month from the date of the warrant to enter, if need be by force, the premises named in the warrant for the purpose of searching for and arresting that person.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is how the immigration service has been able to operate the bail provisions until now. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam referred to the phrase used in clause 117, which we are considering. We think that the word "reasonable" will be retained, but we are worried about whether the word "may" is appropriate: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may, if necessary, use reasonable force."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must be clear about the circumstances in which a person may use reasonable force. Having re-examined clause 117, I think that we shall examine how that is approached. I do not propose to delete the word "reasonable" from clause 117, but I may want to make some amendments to it. I therefore do not think that it is an especially good precedent for the hon. Gentleman to use. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington referred to the Ogunwobi case, in which a family sought refuge in a church, and on which she campaigned long and hard. It was a difficult case for the local police and the immigration service, because, as my hon. Friend will remember, the local community provided substantial support for the Ogunwobi family and wanted it to remain in the community. The police were consulted about whether it was appropriate to move in with force, and took the view that the damage to community relations would be considerable. They were not prepared to move in, and the case dragged on for a long time. I cannot remember, but I think that it continued for about two years; it was still going on when I became an Under-Secretary. 
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Yes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> With the assistance of my hon. Friend, we resolved the situation without the use of force, reasonable or otherwise. The police were pleased that it had been resolved without damage to community relations, and I wish to pay tribute to my hon. Friend for her efforts to ensure that the case was resolved quickly. Indeed, the family came out voluntarily from the church. It was a matter that we could deal with. 
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The particular issues that have been raised concern the circumstances in which force can be used. I have made it clear that, up to now, the immigration service has been able to use the provisions of schedule 2, paragraph 17 of the Immigration Act 1971, which do not restrict it to the use of reasonable force. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) raised the issue of what is reasonable force when someone is being sought for breach of bail conditions by a member of the immigration service and a police officer. He asked whether that meant that they could break locks or windows to gain access to people if they are inside the premises and whether it means that they can use a particular amount of force? We know that, in the case of health problems or other such difficulties, it is important that we do not allow or encourage officials to think that they can use more force than is necessary. All members of the Committee will be familiar with cases when questions have been asked about the amount of force used to detain a person. Unfortunately, in some cases of detention, deaths have resulted. It is right in such circumstances that police officers and immigration officers should be aware that they are expected to exercise reasonable force. 
<P>
I am conscious that the provisions of the 1971 Act will continue to apply in certain circumstances and that the provisions under the Bill will apply to others. However, having listened to the points made by my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Hallam, it is right that those who undertake the difficult exercise of detaining someone know precisely the restrictions that are placed on them. The hon. Gentleman is putting forward guidelines for immigration service officers under which they must be reasonable in the way in which they apply force and must consider whether they are being excessive or unreasonable. For example, they may have to break a lock to enter a house, but do they necessarily have to remove the whole door with a jack? The amount of reasonableness in certain circumstances requires judgment. 
<P>
Last night, when considering the hon. Gentleman's amendment, I was struck by the fact that the word "reasonable" was not in the 1971 Act. The word is familiar to the courts, to the police and to the immigration service in other contexts. We were proposing to put it into the Bill at a later stage. Although we shall amend the clause, we would keep the word "reasonable" in it. It is therefore difficult for me to justify saying to those whom we ask to do the job that we   would not give them the proper guidance that the hon. Gentleman suggests that we should do by putting in the word "reasonable". To cut a long story short, the Government will support the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was a helpful response from the Minister. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 533, in page 24, leave at lines 5 to 8. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 534, in page 24, line 9, leave out from beginning to "a". 
<P>
No. 535, in page 24, line 10, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as is practicable"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"within twenty-four hours of his arrest.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I do not anticipate the same response to these amendments, which deal with what happens immediately after someone has been arrested. I am trying to stress the Government's position that anyone arrested for being in breach of bail conditions should be brought before a court as soon as possible. 
<P>
Amendment No. 533 relates to subsection (6), which specifies a period within which a person must be taken before an immigration officer. Amendment No. 534 relates to subsection (7), which requires the fast-track approach only when subsection (6) does not apply. Both amendments attempt to minimise the delay when a person has to appear before an immigration officer. 
<P>
Amendment No. 535 is an attempt to tighten the wording. It has a Scottish dimension in that people arrested in Scotland will receive swifter treatment and have their bail conditions reviewed more quickly than people arrested in England and Wales. The 24-hour limit for a judicial review of a possible breach of bail in Scotland will not apply in England and Wales. 
<P>
The provisions in the clause are a means of replicating paragraph 33 of schedule 2 to the 1971 Act. By a remarkable coincidence, clause 33 replicates that paragraph 33 which, however, has some crucial differences. Bail is dealt with there by a chief immigration officer as well as by a court. Under clause 33, only an immigration officer--not a chief--is required. 
<P>
It is a serious matter to be deprived of one's liberty, so when someone is arrested for breach of bail conditions, judicial oversight should be as quick and fair as possible. It is not a common occurrence, but it is possible for someone to appear to have breached their bail conditions for reasons that are subsequently found by the court not to be sufficient to warrant deprivation of liberty. That could apply particularly to those released from immigration detention. Complex reporting arrangements involving different agencies could be responsible, or communications might have gone wrong between those 1099 1100 
<P>
agencies. That, rather than malice on the part of the person on bail, could underpin the apparent breach of conditions, which the judicial authorities might properly investigate and dismiss as insufficient to justify further detention. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 533 and 534 seek to delete provisions that would cause unnecessary delay before reaching the judicial oversight period; and amendment No. 535 seeks a UK-wide fast track that matches the speed with which the issues are dealt with in Scotland. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am concerned to discover that the hon. Member for Hallam is so cynical that he is already conceding that we will not properly consider his amendments. This enlightened and sophisticated Government will of course consider his proposals with care. 
<P>
The background to the matter is that a person may be bound to appear before an immigration officer for the purposes of further examination or removal. Where a person is in breach, having been bound to appear before an immigration officer for those purposes, that person should clearly be required to appear before that officer following his or her arrest, hence the need for subsection (6). The court should also be given the opportunity to consider forfeiture of recognisance in such cases, as it will be able to do so separately under clause 32. 
<P>
Also needing consideration is the question whether the person concerned, once arrested, needs to be brought before the court for the purposes of deciding what should happen to him or her next under clause 33(7) and 33(9). I am willing to consider that aspect of amendments Nos. 533 and 534. 
<P>
Amendment No. 535 would require a person arrested to be brought before a magistrate within 24 hours in every case. As presently drafted, such a person needs to be brought before the court as soon as reasonably practicable after his or her arrest. The Government would obviously prefer the person to be brought before the court within 24 hours in every case, but there are problems relating to holidays and weekends when a court would physically not be sitting. The present drafting allows for that contingency. However, I recognise the importance of introducing an amendment that would reflect the spirit if not the precise detail of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, so the Government are willing to consider further the arguments in favour of providing a 24-hour limit in the Bill as suggested in the amendment. In return for that undertaking, I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman withdrew his amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We appear to be on a roll. Certainly, I enjoy it when an amendment is accepted by the Government and it simply goes through, but the fact that the Government are seriously considering and making helpful noises is nearly as good. It is good enough to persuade me, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 506, page 24, line 8, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6A) A person arrested under this section must, if he was released under section 31 by the Commission, be brought before it within twenty-four hours after his arrest.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 507, 510, 511 and 513. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 33 provides a power to arrest those who have broken, are breaking or are likely to break one or more of the conditions attached to the grant of bail. The amendments are necessary to reflect the fact that bail under this part of the Bill may have been granted for a specific individual by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. Given the special nature of the cases dealt with by the commission--the fact that national security considerations apply--I am sure that members of the Committee will agree that it is obviously right that, where it has been necessary to arrest such a person, he or she should again be brought before that same body. For example, it should be for the commission to decide whether such a person had breached or was likely to breach a condition of bail, and if he or she had, whether the person concerned should be detained or released on the same or new conditions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Once again, these are drafting amendments. I shall explain the background. Amendment No. 485 gives the Lord Chancellor the power to make rules for the hearing of routine bail applications by magistrates. Amendment No. 490 makes it clear that any rules must be made in accordance with section 144 of the Magistrates Court Act 1980. The Lord Chancellor must therefore consult the rules committee before any such rules are introduced. That provision is designed to provide a greater background for the preparation of rules than is necessarily available to the Government, so it provides a more effective context for the introduction of new rules. 
<P>
I am happy to reassure the Committee that it is necessary that any rules that the Lord Chancellor chooses to make must include a provision to require the Secretary of State to inform a detainee that a reference under section 29 has been made and also that he must, if he is aware of the fact, simultaneously inform the detainee's representative that the reference has in fact been made.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> With amendments Nos. 486 and 489, we seek to respond to concerns expressed in evidence to the Committee by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, the Immigration Advisory Service and others. We initially intended to have matters dealt with as they are normally dealt with in magistrates courts; lawyers would represent a person applying for bail, and the person who wished to make a bail application would nominate an appropriate lawyer, who would be a solicitor or barrister. 
<P>
In magistrates courts, rights of audience are usually zealously protected by solicitors and barristers. Indeed, the High Court has seen considerable debate on the extent to which rights of audience should be granted. However, it has been suggested by voluntary groups that defence lawyers are engaging in restrictive practices because they trying to keep to themselves rights of  audience that could be properly be used by those voluntary organisations and others who are quite able to articulate their case and act as advocate on behalf of their clients. 
<P>
A number of steps have been taken over the years, and we have seen an opening up of rights of audience. For instance, Customs and Excise has for many years been able to bring certain matters before the courts and to speak in the courts. Other organisations are allowed rights of audience. For instance, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has the right to bring cases. There have been other precedents, in which the rights of individuals have been ably protected by those who are not qualified as lawyers. 
<P>
Nevertheless, it is often argued that court cases can quickly, and often unpredictably, become complex, when issues of procedure and of the broad legal application of rights can present themselves. In those circumstances, lawyers may feel that they are better able to set out the arguments that would protect their client most effectively. Voluntary groups have suggested that they could do that, too, particularly if they specialise in certain areas. 
<P>
Several organisations have gained a fair degree of respect in the courts and from their dealings with the authorities. The Immigration Advisory Service often employs people, who are not legally qualified and who are not lawyers, but who have successfully advised people with immigration problems for several years. They have a good record in dealing with many claims for asylum and claims for various categories of immigration status. 
<P>
It has been my experience and that of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary that officers of the Immigration Advisory Service, qualified or not, generally give a good account of themselves, present logical and careful arguments and fully understand most of the issues that are presented to them. When issues become complex and legally technical, they are also aware of what they do not know and seek advice from lawyers, when appropriate. 
<P>
There is an argument for immigration cases and bail applications in such cases to be opened up to persons who are not solicitors or barristers to act as advocates for the person who is before the court. We had expected resistance to that proposition but, after consulting widely and making it clear that we did not want to open it out to any old group, but wished to give some basis of proper representation, the response that we received was far more positive than we had expected. I very much hope that our wish to extend such representation beyond the use of solicitors and barristers will find general support in the community. Organisations such as the Immigration Advisory Service and others that ably represent immigration detainees should be able to put forward cases. 
<P>
We then asked ourselves whether we should identify a particular organisation under the amendment or whether there should be a broad-based right for the applicant to nominate his or her advocate. Schemes are in place in various parts of Britain whereby persons can become qualified to advise and authorised to give legal advice. 1103 1104 For some time, legal executives have had such qualifications and there are circumstances in which the Law Society and its local offices recognise particular individuals who can give advice at police stations. 
<P>
We are now going beyond that and want to deal with the situation in the court. In the past, Mackenzie friends have been able to advise people presenting their own cases before a court on the technicalities of the law and how those cases can be presented. Such a system enables a person to be his own advocate. There are grounds for going further than that. We are proceeding with some degree of care and I hope that our proposal that a person can be an authorised advocate will enable us to go that little bit further. 
<P>
At present subsection (6) specifically provides the Secretary of State to be represented at a routine bail hearing by a person other than a solicitor or barrister. That would enable the immigration service to appear before a court and put forward the information about why it believes that an individual should be detained. The courts should have the option of hearing from such a person who is properly able to advocate in the court and who understands the procedures, the way the decision was arrived at and the reasons for it. That puts the immigration service in a position, although not completely, not dissimilar to that of Customs and Excise in having a right of audience. 
<P>
We ought to go further than that. Detainees should also be able to be represented if they wish by persons other than solicitors or barristers. Amendment No. 489 achieves that by replacing the whole of subsection (6) with the words on the amendment paper so as to provide representation for detainees as well as for the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 486 makes a consequential change so as to refer to authorised advocates as defined in the new subsection (7) inserted by amendment No. 489. 
<P>
It will be for the detainees themselves to nominate those whom they feel are best able to represent them, even if those persons are not legally qualified. For the most part we envisage that the Secretary of State will be represented by persons who already represent him at immigration appeals and associated applications for bail. In order to protect the Secretary of State's own interest in ensuring that those who represent him are properly trained, no one else will in practice represent the Secretary of State unless he has received all the appropriate training. That is important and it is quite unnecessary to place a requirement in the Bill as amendment No. 255 proposes. For that reason the Government cannot accept that amendment. 
<P>
Where we accept that a presenting officer can appear before an adjudicator at a hearing, that ability should not be discontinued merely because we have now gone into the magistrates court. The detainees will nominate those whom they feel are best placed to represent them: the Government would like to look at the way all these provisions operate to ensure that we have made all the appropriate amendments to enable that to happen. 
<P>
Amendment No. 256 would mean that a detainee would be represented at a routine bail hearing by persons who are not legally qualified only with the leave of the court. Clearly, if the court refused leave, the hearing would have to be adjourned for an alternative representative to be found. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. These amendments were inspired by the concerns of the Immigration Advisory Service as set out in the evidence. He has now addressed them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I was aware--or at least fairly certain--that the IAS had proposed the amendments and I can understand its reasons for doing so. I will just finish these remarks and explain why the amendments are probably unnecessary. 
<P>
One of the problems with the amendments is that if the court refused leave the hearing would have to be adjourned for an alternative representative to be found. It would mean that the routine bail hearing could not take place as early as we would wish and might result in detention for longer than would otherwise be necessary. Such a measure would also lead to wasted court time and added financial cost for the administration of routine bail hearings. 
<P>
The Government amendments offer an opportunity for the Immigration Advisory Service to consider how it can ensure that authorised advocates are properly qualified. Advocates need not be solicitors or barristers, but they must be able to show that they are authorised. We can discuss with the IAS and other immigration groups how to create that status.

<P>
I do not want to make the requirements burdensome, so that those people must pass many exams, but I want to ensure that the courts can be satisfied that not any old person can turn up and speak in court. Those people must be able to handle bail applications. No one will benefit if unsuitable people can appear in court and advocate on behalf of others, and I am sure that the IAS would agree with that. What the Opposition want to do in opening up the courts is understandable. We have sympathy with that view, but we are concerned about the extent to which the amendments would go. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that I can help the Minister by saying that I shall not press each amendment to a Division. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
Amendment No. 255 states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No person shall be authorised by the Secretary of State to conduct proceedings under this Part unless he has received such training as the Secretary of State may direct."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not think that that need be stated in the Bill, although we understand why it has been suggested. We hope that we can reach agreement on such matters. 
<P>
Amendment No. 256 worries me a little more; it is too broad. It states 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any person employed by any voluntary Organisation in receipt of a grant under section 37 or any other person with the leave of the court".
<P>
</UL></FONT> That would present practical difficulties which I would not want to create for the courts. I have already outlined those difficulties; I shall not do so again. Under amendment No. 256, any organisation in receipt of such a grant could ask any person to go before the court, but that person may not be able to do the job. We do not want that to happen. 
<P>
We want to engage constructively with some of the immigration organisations on that matter. Our amendments provide room for flexibility. I hope that the Committee is reassured that the suitable flexibility and safeguards will be in place so that nonqualified people can represent both parties at routine bail hearings. Those people must be suitable and capable of doing the work, yet they need not necessarily be solicitors or barristers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister's explanation is interesting and the Government amendments are helpful. We all agree about the valuable work done in representing people by organisations, such as the IAS and the Refugee Legal Centre. It is helpful that we recognise that not everyone who is legally qualified is necessarily the best person to represent someone at an immigration case and that, on the other side of the coin, someone who is not legally qualified may do so perfectly adequately. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give some idea of his intentions in respect of legal representation. Under clause 37, the Government will have the power to make grants to organisations--such as, I assume, the IAS and the RLC--to do the work that is required for the bail hearings. Will the Government make it clear how comprehensive a service they expect to provide for legal representation? We must remember that many people will have no access to funds to pay for their own representation. 
<P>
I and many others in the legal profession believe that better decisions are made when people are legally represented. That saves everybody money. It saves the state money if a good decision is made at the seven--day hearing so that a subsequent decision does not have to be made at a later hearing. Providing adequate representation at the first hearing saves detainees from the experience of being detained and the state from the cost of detaining them. 
<P>
I firmly believe in the value of representation and my instinct is to make it universal in respect of bail hearings. Everyone facing such a hearing should have access to a qualified lawyer of, under the amendment, to someone else who might be equally effective though not necessarily qualified. 
<P>
As I said, it would he helpful to find out more about the Government's intentions on broadening the scope. Do they want to make the provision as comprehensive as possible? Do they want to enable workers of organisations such as IAS and RLC to take part in the hearings? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We are moving towards common ground. The Immigration Advisory Service and the Refugee Legal Centre have entirely understandable concerns about the ability of their caseworkers, in whom they have confidence, to conduct the hearings. They may not be fully qualified solicitors or barristers, but it should be within the competence of the sort of people employed by those organisations to conduct those hearings. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hallam asked about funding. We will ensure that advocates are qualified to do a proper job but I cannot provide an assurance that anyone who decides to be an authorised advocate will receive state money to do so. The Immigration Advisory Service and other reputable organisations receive public funding under clause 23 and have to determine the most appropriate way of spending it. The extent to which they allocate funding for supporting bail applications is a matter for them. 
<P>
The future funding of IAS and other organisations will be a matter for discussion in due course because the Bill will have substantial implications. IAS, the Refugee Legal Centre and others will want to adjust funding to cope with changed circumstances--and discussing the issues with those organisations is more appropriate than creating a broad legal framework in Committee. 
<P>
We propose that bail applications under immigration legislation be a relevant matter under part V of the Bill and a person who becomes an authorised advocate will be expected to be registered or exempt from registration to conduct a bail hearing for a detainee. We intend to table an amendment today to ensure that that will be the case. 
<P>
We are concerned about the authorised advocate idea going substantially beyond those people who are qualified to do it. Although all members of the Committee would join me in praising organisations such as IAS and others that operate in the area, we want to ensure protection. IAS and RLC have been approached and have shown a willingness, and a capacity to take on such work on bail applications under the grant-aid arrangements. We shall discuss in due course how they will decide to use their funding and how much extra, if any, they will receive. 
<P>
We have carefully covered the options. We have not gone as far as some lawyers might have feared and said that anyone from any organisation may advocate or represent someone else, but we want to ensure that a particular group of people who have in the past demonstrated the capacity, quality and willingness to represent asylum seekers and immigration detainees can do so when it is right and proper and in keeping with the dignity of the court. I therefore ask the Committee to support the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
