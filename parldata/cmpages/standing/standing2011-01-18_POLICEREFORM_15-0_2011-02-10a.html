Have you or the Clerks received contact from the Minister with respect
to the code of practice on operational independence? The Minister has
told us that he was working on it, but he knows the importance that the
Committee and I attach to the publication of a draft, even a draft of a
draft of a draft. I wish to put on record how important it is for the

                           </span> Good morning, Mr
Chope and members of the Committee. This is my first opportunity to
welcome you to the Chair, and it is a pleasure to serve under your

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause allows relevant licensing authorities to be classified as
responsible authorities. As the Committee is well aware, a responsible
authority can make representations based on the licensing objectives
under the Licensing Act 2003 on applications for the granting or
variation of licences, premise licences, club premises certificates and
reviews. Other responsible authorities are the police, fire authorities
and local authorities when exercising functions such as health and
safety,  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 524<a class="bkMark" name="Column524">&#160;</a>
                           </div>local planning, environmental health and child protection. Other
authorities can be responsible if part of the premises falls in their
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
press the Minister on why the clause is included in the Bill, because
it will create a situation in which a relevant licensing
authority can make representations to itself based on the four
licensing objectives in relation to an application or review, and then
decide the application or review. Various scenarios could arise as a
result—for example, when a licensing officer’s views
differ from those of a responsible authority or interested party. Are
the views of the licensing officer on behalf of the licensing authority
to take precedence? If a final decision on a matter has to be made by a
licensing authority, the presumption might be one of bias as an
inevitable consequence of the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000032">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising
that issue. There is a similar situation in Scotland, and I shall come
back to some problems that have arisen as a result of the responsible
and licensing authorities sharing functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
submissions to the Committee, many organisations have raised the issue.
In effect, they are worried that the relevant licensing
authority will become both prosecutor and judge, and hold a
dual role when they need both to be seen as impartial and neutral and
to act impartially and neutrally. Article 6 of the convention on human
rights guarantees the right of applicants to a fair trial and provides
the right to a fair and public hearing with public judgment, an
independent and impartial tribunal established by law, and a
reasoned
judgment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right to a fair hearing under article 6.1 is concerned primarily with
procedural fairness, and justice should be both done and seen to be
done. To pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Cambridge,
legal issues have arisen in Scotland when, under the Licensing Act
(Scotland) 2005, licensing boards are effectively in the position that
the Government now wish to place licensing authorities in England and
Wales. The clause could open up many legal challenges arising from the
decisions of the licensing authority to the magistrates court with
associated costs and
delays.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why
have the Government decided on such a provision, especially in light of
the changes to the Police and Crime Act 2009, which allowed councillors
to make representations about licences? Where is the evidence for the
need for the change? I would be grateful if the Minister set out his
thinking on why the clause is necessary. Is the present situation not
sufficient?<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000037">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
explanatory memorandum acknowledges the validity of my concerns about
clause 103 and talks about the need for statutory guidance. However,
such guidance is non-binding, so would it not be better to look at
separating the responsibilities, as set out in the Gambling
Act 2005? Will the Minister also look at the proposal to
nominate

submissions to the Committee, concern has been raised about scrapping
the Local Authorities (Model Code of Conduct) Order 2007, which
provides safeguards that businesses could rely on when dealing with

few years, the hon. Member for Gedling and I have spent long hours in
generally interesting and challenging debates, although we were in
slightly different positions. I always found his approach to Committee
debates fair, considered and reasonable, and I will seek to take a
similar approach in considering the issues before us, although I
suspect that we will not be able to get on to the judgment in R
<em>v.</em> McCann or the sliding scale of probabilities in relation to
the burden of proof. Such things have taxed the hon. Gentleman and me
over the past few years, but perhaps we will leave them for a future
occasion.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me turn
now to clause 103. Licensing authorities are expected to grant licence
applications, unless they receive relevant representations about the
impact of the application on the promotion of the licensing objectives.
That means that even if they have concerns about a new application or a
change to an existing licence, they can refuse the application, impose
conditions or revoke the licence only if local residents, businesses or
responsible authorities such as the police object.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In moving to
alter the current situation, we decided that the proposal would ensure
that licensing authorities are better able to respond to the concerns
of local residents and businesses by taking the necessary actions to
tackle irresponsible premises without having to wait for
representations from other responsible authorities. I heard what the
hon. Lady said about safeguards, and I will come to the Gambling Act,
which she specifically mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clear
point, however, is that any actions will need to be justified on the
basis of promoting the licensing objectives. Licensing authorities are
accountable for their decisions, which they must ensure are evidence
based. Moreover, licensing authorities’ decisions can be the
subject of an appeal to the courts, and that represents another
safeguard, ensuring the fairness of the process. As the hon. Lady would
expect, we have also considered compliance with the European convention
on human rights, and we are satisfied that the provisions meet the
necessary tests.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions will certainly strengthen licensing authorities’
powers and enable them to be more responsive to communities’
needs. We realise that the provision will mean that the licensing
authority will be able to make a representation regarding a licence
application, variation or review and then determine the same
application. I hear the hon. Lady’s concerns about the need to
ensure 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 526<a class="bkMark" name="Column526">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that the licensing process remains fair. We believe, however, that it
will do so and that there is a precedent in the Gambling Act for
licensing authorities to act as responsible authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Concerns
regarding procedural fairness have been effectively addressed in the
Act by ensuring that responsibility for different parts of the
application process are divided between licensing officials. In other
words, we seek to avoid any conflicts of interest, or any perception of
procedural impropriety. That ensures that the licensing official acting
as a responsible authority is not involved in the termination of the
same application. The statutory guidance that we will introduce through
this clause will state that this same separation of responsibilities
should arise, under the Licensing Act 2003, to ensure that the
licensing process remains fair. That is why we believe that the
provisions in clause 103 are appropriate and reasonable, and that there
are
safeguards.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000046">&#160;</a>

adds primary care trusts and local health boards in Wales as

can do to make representations on the basis of the Licensing Act
objectives relating to applications and reviews. Such authorities also
have a role in setting the licensing policy of a licensing authority
every few years. I would like the Minister to clarify one point about
which I am concerned. Under the coalition Government legislation that
is currently going through the House, we know that primary care trusts
will be abolished shortly. New structures in the NHS will change with
the GP consortia and with the role for local authorities to exercise
public health functions, as well as the creation of public health and
well-being boards. Will the Minister be able to give his view on where
this responsibility, if clause 104 becomes law, will

                           </div>sit in future, knowing jolly well that PCTs will not be with us in less
than two years’ time? I seek a little bit guidance from the
Minister. Will the local authority, exercising its public health
function, take up this particular role as a responsible authority? I am
also a little concerned about the drafting of the clause, as it allows
the PCT and the health board to make representations only if they are
based on the four licensing objectives set out in the Licensing Act
2003.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In Scotland,
they have already added an additional objective to the licensing
conditions to include public health, so there would be a clear role for
PCTs and local health boards to make representations on that
general health objective. However, as they will be restricted to making
their representations purely on the four objectives in the Act, can the
Minister give an example of how this would work? When I looked at the
Bill, I thought that it would be down to a PCT to identify a particular
bar, for example, that was making an application for a licence, or was
undergoing a review of a licence. To determine whether that bar was
affecting the local A and E at the general hospital in a particular
town or city, the primary care trust would be able to say, for example,
that 10 customers of bar X ended up in A and E and therefore
it wished to make representations on that basis. I am still a little
concerned that that would not necessarily fit into the four objectives
of the Licensing Act 2003.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000054">&#160;</a>

the Minister could clarify exactly how the measure will work, that
would be helpful. It seems that the clause is a halfway house and that
the Government will only make sense of it if they include public health
as one of the licensing objectives. Why not have the PCT or health
board as an interested party that could intervene when it has knowledge
to impart about a particular licence rather than a blanket ability to
make
representations?<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000055">&#160;</a>

recognised the health impacts that licensing can have. We are certainly
concerned about the impact of drunken accidents and injuries and the
contribution that they make to A and E attendances, in which we have
seen a significant rise of about 65% during the past five years.
Ambulance and other costs to the NHS may be as much as £1.1
billion a year. That is a substantial cost to the taxpayer and a
significant burden on our ambulance services and local hospitals. That
is why clause 104 has been introduced to make primary care trusts and
local health boards in Wales responsible authorities under the
Licensing Act
2003.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000056">&#160;</a>

believe that health bodies have a clear interest in the existing
Licensing Act objectives, which include public safety, prevention of

some PCTs already play a constructive part in licensing decisions, but
we want to give them a formal role in the process. Making health bodies
responsible authorities will ensure that they are notified of any new
licence applications or licence variations, and they will be able to
make representations directly to licensing authorities about the
potential impact on the licensing objectives. They will also be able to
request the review of a licence if they

pleasure—it probably is not a pleasure—of going out with

the licensing objectives, because she made a fair point about
experience elsewhere. We consulted on that issue in preparing the Bill,
and there was some support for the approach, although, as she might
expect, the representations were not universally in favour. We said in
our response to the consultation that we would keep the matter under
review. We see some merit in adding prevention of harm to health as a
licensing objective, but we want to do it in a considered way,
alongside wider work to address the harms of alcohol to health, which
is why we indicated in our consultation response that we did not intend
to legislate at this stage but would consider the best way to do so in
the future. We recognise the hon. Lady’s point and responded to
it in the consultation, and we are keeping the matter under close

                           </strong> PCTs will be able to provide robust and
targeted evidence for licensing authorities to consider, by sharing
anonymised A and E statistics and NHS data. Those data can include
statistics on alcohol-related admissions to A and E departments and
ambulance attendances, and can then be used as direct evidence and
linked to one or more of the four licensing objectives. For example, a
representation from a PCT could highlight a recurring association as
intelligence that the licensing objective might be undermined. The
crime reduction objective is directly relevant, as is the public safety
one, as it includes the prevention of accidents and injuries, but
clearly it will be for PCTs to work with their partners in the local
health economy, including the acute trusts and the ambulance trusts.
When patterns emerge, evidence and information is there, and that will
better inform some of the licensing panels’

                           </strong> These and the next two amendments relate to an
important part of the Licensing Act 2003 and what the clause sets out
to do. All members of the Committee will agree that it is important
that local people and businesses feel able to voice their concerns
about the granting, review and variation of licences. The narrow
interpretation of “vicinity” in the 2003 Act may have
inhibited that process. We all know that, currently, people making
representations on a licence application need to be an interested
party, and to have a relationship to the vicinity of the premises,
which usually means that they have to live or be involved in a business
in the
vicinity.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000072">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clauses that deal with licensing will remove the test of vicinity and
the category of interested parties, and will allow anyone to make
representations, although it is made clear that those representations
cannot be frivolous or vexatious. My concern is about a bit of
confusion in clause 105, which it would be helpful if the Minister
could clear up. Some people think that the proposal will mean that any
individual or business can make representations, no matter where they
are based geographically—for instance, on an application for a
licence in my constituency of Hull, representations might be made from
an individual or a business based in London, Manchester or Birmingham.
Is that what the Government intend? Looking closely, the clause refers
to the local authority area, but I may have become confused when
reading it. It would be helpful to have it made clear whether the
provision will open the whole area of making representations to anybody
or any business, or whether that is limited to individuals and
businesses operating within the area of the licensing
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000073">&#160;</a>

amendments that we will move this morning take into consideration what
is happening with the Gambling Act 2005, to which we have already
referred. The general view is that the relevant sections in the 2005
Act work effectively and give protection to people who now feel
excluded by the use of the vicinity test, but that they provide a
framework for a licensing authority in considering representations and
ensure that there is some link to individuals and businesses wishing to
make representations about an application or a review. Will the
Minister reflect on whether it would be helpful to the licensing
authorities, in making decisions about representations, to have that
framework in place to assist them? It may be helpful if he first set
out the purpose of the clause, because there is confusion at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000074">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to raise with the Minister the question, if the clause is so
drafted that it is open only to individuals and businesses in a local
authority area to raise representations, of what happens in London
boroughs, which often have a boundary down the middle of a road. In
areas of Camden and Islington, which have many licensed premises, the
middle of the road is the boundary, with one side Camden and one
Islington. If

                           </div>the drafting of the clause means that only people in Camden can make
representations on an application for a licence, how will people on the
other side of the road, in the other borough, feel? I understand that
the Government are trying to ensure that local people and businesses
have their say and can make representations legitimately, which all
members of the Committee will think right and proper. We need to be
clear, however, in the light of submissions that we have received,
which reflect a hazy view of how the clause will be implemented. It
will help, therefore, if the Minister sets out exactly what is
meant.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000075">&#160;</a>

the amendment, but I apologise for detaining the Committee. All of us
who have served as councillors are familiar with situations in which a
licensed premises is causing trouble. Sometimes the walk home route
from such a premises ends up going a way that no one predicted, and the
people who are affected are not in the vicinity as defined by the
current legislation. That is why I entirely welcome the
Minister’s efforts to try and improve matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000077">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am
concerned about the amendment because of potential applications such as
those that have been made in my constituency, where, on two occasions,
the British National party has wanted to hold its national rally. A
number of people may be affected by such activities and may, quite
rightly, not want them to happen close to where they live or work.
There was disturbance, trouble and violence at the BNP rally, which
could have extended in a huge direction around the area. If such
applications were received again, as many people as possible in the
area should have the chance to object, given the wide potential for
disturbance.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000078">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would make such objections hard to make, because there would have to be
a high test to show that people were affected. That is hard when it is
not known whether the potential trouble will go east into one town, or
south or north into another. I understand what the hon. Lady wants to
achieve with her amendments, but they might be a bit too tight for a
licence application, and a council could cope with broader objections
to the principle of an application. The amendment might have far more
power in relation to a review of an existing premises, but I cannot
support it for an application.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000079">&#160;</a>

Hull North has said, the clause and the amendment raise the question,
what exactly do the Government intend? It makes sense for the people
who are likely to suffer a direct adverse consequence of the activities
in a licensed premises to have grounds to object. There is a risk,
however, that a whole host of other people will have the opportunity to
object. What safeguards will be in place to stop that happening? If
there is not a classic vicinity test, the potential will extend across
the country. One of the briefings that we

someone in Brighton could object to a premises in Burton upon Trent.
The only reason why people would want to do so would be that they had a
hidden commercial interest, or a social interest that meant that they
wanted to take action against a particular licensed premises.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000080">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It strikes me
also that if such objections arise, the number of hearings could
increase phenomenally. I do not know whether anyone has thought about
the costs of such an increase; perhaps the Minister can say whether
that has been considered. If it is possible for anyone anywhere in the
country to object, in theory, to any licensing or renewal application,
it stands to reason that there is potential for a phenomenally greater
number of hearings. I cannot believe that the Government intend such a
consequence. I would be grateful for any clarification the Minister can

                           </strong> There is a misapprehension on the part of
Opposition Members on the application of the vicinity test. The clause
will remove the vicinity test for interested parties in licence
applications, but it also deals with the variations and the
consideration that will then apply. I am confident—I will
explain why—that there are adequate safeguards to ensure that
Opposition Members’ concerns will not prove
well-founded.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000082">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull North made a specific point on whether
this was somewhat limited and restricted. She is probably looking at
clause 105(3)(a), which gives a definition of
“interested parties”
as<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>which
is perhaps why she thought that there was an issue on boundaries and
that someone could not object if they lived outside the boundaries of
the relevant local authority. That speaks to section 17(5) of the
Licensing Act 2003, which deals with regulations relating to the
advertisement of applications. It does not deal with the vicinity of
objections; it deals with the notification of applications. It is
important for me to put that on the record, to ensure that there is no
misinterpretation of the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000084">&#160;</a>

to the hon. Lady for allowing me to set out how the provision operates
and to speak to her concerns on whether this would not apply for
someone on the other side of the road who live in a different local
authority area, for example, in inner London. This clause is a
consequential amendment that was required to deal with the specific
points on advertisements, rather than a means of fettering what
vicinity might
mean.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000085">&#160;</a>

carefully considered the issue of vicinity. I remember, as I am sure
other hon. Members who were around at the time do, some of the
frustrations over the Licensing Act 2003. It seemed to be the case that
unless someone lived within 100 feet of the licensed premises, some
local authorities would say, “Sorry, you cannot make any
representations.” Members of Parliament could not make any
representations. It seemed as if it was a means of excluding people,
rather than engaging the community and ensuring that it could have its
say on licensing applications, which can have a significant impact on a
town, area or community.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000086">&#160;</a>

opportunity to rebalance the 2003 Act and look at this again, we
decided that the best way to proceed was to remove the vicinity test
and leave it open, in the same way that, in a planning application
someone does not have to live next door or in the same town to make a
representation. The rules are prescribed by the regulatory regime that
sits behind applications. For a representation to be relevant, it has
to speak to the licensing objectives. Simply saying, “I do not
agree with this”, will not get someone very far. An objection
has to speak to the four licensing objectives, which the hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull North has rightly highlighted. Equally, it
cannot be frivolous or vexatious, as she has also pointed out. On the
issue of licence reviews, it cannot be repetitive either, which avoids
the risks of someone making a complaint again and again and again as a
means of seeking to frustrate a
licence.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000087">&#160;</a>

highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley. If we took
the sort of approach suggested by the amendment, just such
representations might not be available and, therefore, the better
approach can be seen in my analogy on planning: it is better to allow
people to make representations, but they will be constrained by the

amendments follow nicely from the exchange between the hon. Lady and
the Minister. They are probing amendments to understand what is
expected of councils, which are concerned about what might happen. The
costs of advertising for councils can be extremely high. In my days as
a councillor and the chair of the Cambridge traffic management
committee, we would often find that painting a small piece of white
line on a road somewhere cost us little for paint but a huge amount for
the advert. We are keen to avoid
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need to ensure that councils, when they do not have spare money, are
not required to spend large amounts on expensive advertising that does
not serve a purpose. Of course, I have no problem with advertising that
is essential to inform. The question is about the balance. The
applicant is also required to advertise, so ensuring that both parties
know what is and is not expected of them is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was delighted to hear the Minister say that he is expecting councils to
use websites. That is excellent. I hope that he can comment on what
else might be needed in both cases. The information should not only be
available on a website because, as he knows, there is a digital divide.
Even those who do not have access to a website might well have an
interest in what is happening. I hope that he can comment on how to
ensure that that condition is
satisfied.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000105">&#160;</a>

all that much. It says that the advertising should be done<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000106">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is interesting that we are dealing with this
amendment this morning, in the light of the letter that appears today
in <em>The Times</em> from a number of Liberal Democrat council leaders
who are obviously very concerned about their budgets and about spending
money in an appropriate way, considering the huge reduction in the
money that is being made available to them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The use of a
website is to be welcomed, but I want to raise a couple of issues about
that. Local councils have lobbied me about the costs of advertising and
the hon. Member for Cambridge referred to those costs. For example,
advertising in local newspapers can cost councils hundreds of pounds to
fulfil their obligations. Obviously, a website is a much cheaper way of
advertising.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, I
want to press the Minister on the issue of the digital divide. In areas
of the country where access to websites and the internet is more
limited, how does he envisage local people being made aware of
applications and reviews? There is also the issue of people who have
disabilities. As a constituency MP, people have raised with me concerns
about the current regime not being accessible to people with various
disabilities and I have been asked whether the law could be amended to
ensure that all members of communities can access information, in
particular about licence applications, which are often very contentious
in certain areas. In my constituency, there is an area called Newland
avenue where there is great interest in any licence application when it
is made, and in any request for a review. People are thirsty for
knowledge and information about what is happening and I want to ensure
that we are able to get that information to as many of them as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member
for Cambridge for highlighting that point about information.
Information is important, so that we can achieve the sort of community
engagement that we want. That builds on the debate that we have already
had this morning about stripping away the vicinity test. Now we are
debating how communities can be informed and information shared, so
that there is that direct engagement between individuals and
communities, and they can help to inform and be engaged in the
licensing process. Consequently I am grateful to him for tabling the
probing amendment, so that I can respond to some of the points that he
has made. It is essential that such licensing applications are brought
to the attention of the communities likely to be affected by
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions that we are introducing in the Bill to remove the vicinity
test for interested parties will enable any person to make
representations regarding licence applications. That is why we
introduced provisions in clauses 105 and 107 to require licensing
authorities to advertise premises licence and club premises certificate
applications, to bring those applications to the attention of anyone
likely to be affected by them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In our
response to the consultation document, “Rebalancing the
Licensing Act”, the Government committed to require licensing
authorities to publish online key information from licensing
applications. However, where I perhaps disagree with the approach
outlined in my hon. Friend’s probing amendment is about the
necessity to put that requirement in primary legislation, as the
amendment proposes. In some ways, the amendment 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 536<a class="bkMark" name="Column536">&#160;</a>
                           </div>addresses only in part the new provisions regarding publicity
requirements that we intend to set out in subsequent
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clauses
105 and 107 introduce provisions for such requirements for advertising
to be set out in regulations and we have committed to introduce a
requirement for licensing authorities to publish key information from
licensing applications on their websites. Setting out the publicity
requirements regarding premises licence and club premises certificate
applications in regulations is consistent with the approach taken with
primary legislation, whereby such detail is then set out in secondary
legislation. That is the right way to do it. It also ensures that the
requirements can be amended when appropriate to ensure that they
reflect the most effective method of informing the community at the
time. In addition, prescribing publicity requirements in regulations
allows us fully to consider the practical implications of the
requirements on both licensing authorities and
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are committed to ensuring that unnecessary burdens that might arise
otherwise are not placed on business or responsible authorities. It is
therefore important that we maintain a flexible approach in the
licensing process to ensure that requirements on parties can easily be
amended to take into account changes in the way in which things are
done. Therefore, we think that it is best to deal with the structure in
that way rather than specifying it in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Coming
to the point about information, I think that there are issues regarding
the digital divide and how best to notify people who may not have
access to a computer or the internet. We have said that we intend to
introduce secondary legislation to require licensing authorities to
publish key information from licensing applications online, and we are
committed to consult on the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is also worth pointing out the current requirements on licence
applicants, contrasted with those on local authorities, to publicise
information on licence applications. Currently, the Licensing Act 2003
requires licence applicants to advertise their application to bring it
to the attention of interested parties likely to be affected by
it—hence our earlier debate on interested parties and the
definitional change that we debated earlier in our deliberations. How
applications should be published is currently set out in the Licensing
Act 2003 (Premises Licences and Club Premises Certificates) Regulations
2005. They contain a requirement for applicants to display a notice of
the application on the premises and publish a notice in a local
newspaper or
newsletter.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000117">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I wonder whether the Minister will consider
making the information available in local libraries. I think that we
are all conscious of the need to encourage people to use their local
libraries, to have them as a centre for making information available
and, with the closures that seem to be coming down the road rather
quickly, to ensure that more is going into libraries so that they can
continue to exist. Will he look particularly at addressing the issues
of libraries and putting that in the

comments on the direction of travel. I think that we have established
quite clearly our intention to ensure that the burden on councils is
not excessive—many of us would rather they spent money on
libraries than on advertising in newspapers. I take entirely his point
and share the concern that mandating the exact form of advert in
primary legislation causes problems, as newspapers are fading, and
websites are current. I am not sure we yet want to write into
legislation to mandate the use of Twitter to advertise. I beg to ask

                           </strong> I would like to make a couple of quick points
before we get to the conclusion of the clause. I do not doubt the
Minister’s intentions, but I do not feel, from what we have
heard so far, that we have had an explanation on some of the questions
posed by quite a wide range of bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understood
the Minister’s point about the frustrations that local
representatives might sometimes feel about an application. However, it
seems that he has contrived to make it possible for a person to make
representations or to raise an objection without having any obvious
interest in the site, and without being affected by the activities of
the site in any obvious way. That seems fundamentally wrong. The clause
permits a person who, in theory, could be located hundreds of miles
from licensed premises, to make a representation. I do not see why the
Government intend to do that. It seems a funny demonstration of
localism from a Government who talk so much about it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The provision
gives all sorts of potential for lobbying across the country from
special interest groups, or possibly from people with a commercial
interest that could be disguised. It will be immensely costly for the
person who is applying for the licence to try to defend themselves. We
are told daily to support community pubs, but this is a recipe that
will put enormous pressure on people. The Government have explained why
they want to change the existing vicinity test, but not why they want
to open it up to challenges from almost anywhere across the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is an
issue about advertising and the need to ensure that the application is
brought to the attention of all persons who may be affected. The
Minister is right to state his intention to bring forward subsequent
regulations, but as things stand, unless he produces a draft of those
measures so that the Committee can see them before discussions on the
Bill are concluded, we will be passing a measure without having any
idea about how it will be implemented and what it will cost. That is
hardly a good use of parliamentary scrutiny, and it does not suggest
that those who will be directly affected by the legislation can be
confident that what we agree on today will not have an adverse effect
on them once the final picture of what the Minister intends is
revealed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000126">&#160;</a>

some important questions about the clause. Will the Minister tell us
what the effect on local authorities will be of the widening of the
representations? What approach should local authorities take to ensure
that the frivolous and vexatious are weeded out at an early
opportunity? What additional resources will be required to ensure that
they can deal with a potential avalanche of representations from
national bodies, particularly the anti-alcohol and anti-drinking groups
that may target local authority licensing committees with extensive
information and representations that need to be considered?<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000127">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The contributions we have just heard about
the clause are interesting. It is back to the old school—it is
about restricting and preventing representations from being made,
rather than engaging the public and allowing people to have their say
about the applications. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak
suggested that we should seek to impose restrictions on those
representations. Would he say that about planning issues, for example?
Would he say to his constituents, “We need to be more
restrictive about the representations that people make on planning
applications that come before us”? That is a prescriptive
approach. I am not trying to mischaracterise the hon. Gentleman or put
words into his mouth, but that seems to be the approach that he
suggests.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000128">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If I gave the Minister that impression, that was
an error. It is reasonable to expect that the person making the
representation should prove some obvious connection or interest,
otherwise we are opening the door to people anywhere in the country who
might have objections that have nothing to do with the specific site
and the specific activity. I do not think that the Minister has that in
mind and I do not want him to end up in a hole that he did not intend
to get himself
into.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000129">&#160;</a>

for trying to help us ensure that the clause will give effect to our
intention. However, as I explained— and why I made my point
about the Gambling Act 2005—such a test would inhibit or prevent
people from making representations. That cuts both ways. To pick up on
the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North about
potential representations, a positive representation could be made, as
happens with planning applications, saying that it is a good idea that
something should happen in the community. The matter is very much one
of giving the discretion to communities to say positively or negatively
what they think of an application. Such discretion is not given at the
moment. The clause allows people to say how much they support their
local pub, how they want it to continue and why an application should
be granted in respect of something. It is about discretion, and I am
surprised by the hon. Lady’s seeking to restrict
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000130">&#160;</a>

consider licence applications? I am trying to get a feel

as much time as the hon. Lady thinks it will. She can look at the
figures in the impact assessment in relation to relative burdens. It is
a point of principle whether “vicinity” can be prescribed
in a wider sense, and we concluded that that would not quite work and
that we would always be restricted to taking account of the point made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley in the previous debate
and how some things can have a wide impact outside a geographical area.
Even if the hon. Lady were minded to take that line of argument, how
could she prescribe it in such a way that did not restrict people
making representations along the lines of the example that was well
made by my hon.

he agree that the Licensing Act encompasses a huge range of activities
that need licences? We must not think only of a friendly local pub but,
say, a hugely controversial lap dancing bar in a prominent place in a
town. In such circumstances, we all recognise that people who visit a
town would have a right to comment about the impact it might have on
them if they were walking children past the site. If we base a vicinity
test on proximity to the site, it would be hard to let people in that
situation make a valid objection, which is why an application for new
premises in such circumstances, as proposed under the clause, is right
and a great
improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000133">&#160;</a>

going too far with the application for a review. If a planning
application for a building is approved, no matter how much I might have
disliked that building going up next to me, I cannot object every six
months to its existence and try to get it taken down; it is a one-off
process. Whereas with a premises license, in theory I can object
regularly to the fact that these premises still exist in some way that
I dislike. While it might be entirely appropriate, if I am living next
door and experience significant harm, that I get to keep

                           </strong> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is
trying to make. However, when you make an application, there must be a
process that the council goes through to decide whether to grant it.
Allowing the same person 100 miles away to request a review creates a
process that otherwise may not exist. If someone 100 miles
away is so concerned about the harm that this site is causing, one
would expect the near neighbours of the site to object and request a
review as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
distinction I am trying to draw is that when you make an application
there is a process that must be followed, and representations can be
received from anywhere and considered or rejected. When giving the
power to request reviews, we want them to be raised by people—or
their representatives—who are actually suffering real harm from
those premises. So those reviews are not just by national campaign
groups. If you go back to the lap dancing argument that I made, people
have very strong moral objections to those sites, but if a licensing
authority decides to accept one for a period, we do not want continual
moral objections to it—without the facts really
changing—from people who do not live anywhere near and are not
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000143">&#160;</a>

all want licensed premises to be well built, pleasant places to visit,

for people who set them up that they can be subject to regular review

harm.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000144">&#160;</a>

draw a distinction, but where we perhaps could have two tiers is on an
initial application and then at request for review. I would not be so
concerned if a review is requested by someone living near a site and
then additional representations are made from people living further
away. However, allowing people who are not suffering any harm from a
site the right to request a review puts in place a process whereby the
council has to decide whether to allow it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000146">&#160;</a>

dismissed, but that requires a process. I can imagine that campaign
groups will then challenge whether their requests were really
frivolous, repetitive or vexatious. If the Government reconsider
reviews, we may end up with a better result. Do they really want this
huge range of power and the risk of councils facing repeated requests
for reviews in situations where it is unlikely that they would ever
proceed with them or make any

local authorities already have the responsibility and ability to ignore

highlighted, for a representation to be relevant in terms of a
particular outlet, application or review, it must meet the criteria of
the four licensing objectives, which are the prevention of crime and
disorder, public safety, the prevention of public nuisance and the
protection of children from harm. As she knows, that is the basis on
which licensing panels make their assessment, and that was the basis on
which her Government set it up. An objection meeting those four
requirements has to show evidence, and the council has to take that
approach in assessing it. That makes the locality information relevant
in assessing against those four tests to see whether they are
satisfied.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000154">&#160;</a>

social clubs these days because of the number of planning applications
relating to housing developments in areas where social clubs may have
existed for a number of years. In the Birmingham area, I am aware of
objections that have been raised to licensing application renewals for
clubs that have existed for quite a long time. In this area, it would
be very easy for people to organise objections from quite a wide field.
For example, a housing body that has connections throughout the country
could quite easily organise to object to the renewal of an existing
club’s certificate. What safeguards will be in place to ensure
that that kind of activity does not happen as a matter of course,

relevant requirements. Therefore, even if the number might go up, the

Licensing Act 2003. In the various submissions to the Committee about
the clause, there is a debate about whether the Home Office has
overstated the burden currently imposed on licensing authorities to
justify the proposed change. I am still trying to find the evidential
base to explain why the Government feel that we need to introduce the
clause. It would be helpful if the Minister could set out what evidence
he has found and looked at to justify the change. All hon. Members will
have heard anecdotal evidence about the conditions that have been
attached to license applications, but we really need to have regard to
hard evidence and data when making policy. There has been enormous
criticism of previous Governments for making policy without the
evidence base to back up their decision to move in a certain
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000172">&#160;</a>

Northampton North for advice, but I understand that

legal minefield. Is that my hon. Friend’s

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an important point, which I
will address in one moment. The issue is causing a lot of concern among
organisations that will have to use the new licensing legislation, and
they want to be clear about its effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me stress
again the need for clear evidence to explain why the clause is
necessary. At the moment, I am not clear what that evidence is. There
is also concern that the Home Office has asserted in the past that a
licensing authority’s actions must be absolutely essential if
the authority is to justify them. It has been helpful to look at some
of the definitions of the word “necessary”.
“Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and
Phrases” makes it clear that “necessary” does not
mean absolutely essential or inescapable, but refers to a responsible
requirement or a need for something.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
many organisations that have made representations on the clause is the
Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers. It has received legal
advice that moving to the lower test of “appropriate”
would allow decisions that are reasonable and expedient to be reached
on a subjective view of the situation. My hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Selly Oak made the important point that
“necessary” has a clear legal definition; there is
certainty about what it means in terms of the licensing objectives. If
we introduce the clause, those who want to make a legal challenge could
have a field day. I am sure that the Government do not wish to open up
the possibility of there being many delays and costs as people pursue
the definition through the courts.<a class="bkMark" name="11021057000176">&#160;</a>

talked a little about the European convention on human rights, and
