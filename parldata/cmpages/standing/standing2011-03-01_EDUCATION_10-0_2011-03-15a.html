                           </span> I was about to tell the
Committee about Peter. We will call him Peter because that is his name.
Peter was permanently excluded at about 9.30 on a Monday morning, and a
fortnight later, that exclusion was upheld. My staff then asked
questions. The boy was not known to us or our behaviour support
services. The SENCO at the school was contacted, and she said that she
knew the boy, but he had never been any problem at all, was quite quiet
and had no behavioural issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once we dug a
little further, it turned out that on the previous Friday night, around
the kitchen table in the family home, which had witnessed much domestic
violence in the past, Peter’s mother had, in the midst of a row,
with all four children present, picked up a knife and stabbed the
father. An ambulance was called and he was pronounced dead at the
scene. The police came. Finally social services arrived and all four
children, of whom Peter was the eldest, were fostered with different
foster parents as an emergency over the weekend. The agreement was that
the social worker would ring the school on Monday morning and explain
the situation, but she did not do it quickly
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Peter
was excluded for assaulting a teacher and for the minor demeanour of
not wearing a school uniform. The issue had been around the uniform.
Clearly, the house was a crime scene and he could not go to
get his school uniform. The child turned up at school and the
teacher started asking him why he did not have his uniform. At 14, he
did not feel able to go in front of the class to explain the situation,
so he tried to leave the room. The teacher prevented him from doing so,
and he pushed the teacher to one side. The head teacher felt, when the
situation was explained, that he could not roll back from the decision
that he had made, and his governors felt that they had to stand behind
his decision. That is an example of good people doing bad
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I also wanted
to tell the Committee about another child I learned about when I was
working in London, of whom I am happy to give the Minister details. He
was a statemented child called Lewis, who was permanently excluded for
swearing, and he had a statement for Tourette’s syndrome. I
recount those examples so that members of the Committee understand that
head teachers do not always do what is right, and certainly do not
always act in the best interests of children, and those children need
to be protected.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The pupil
premium is awarded to children who have been highlighted by the
Government as requiring additional funding. I said earlier to the
Committee that if we look

			Column number: 373<a class="bkMark" name="Column373">&#160;</a>
                           </div>at the largest gaps between our highest-achieving and least-achieving
children, it is most often in the outstanding and highest achieving
schools and authorities, which we consider to be doing reasonably well,
where the gaps are largest. If schools fail to meet the additional
needs of such children, is it not right that they are held
to
account?<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the proposed new subsections relates to looked-after children and
children on the at-risk register. The previous Government had held a
spotlight to the attainment of that group of children, which, until
then, was a national disgrace. Although it has improved, it is still
far from what we would desire, and I think we would all consider that
to be a national disgrace. If a school fails to deliver for its most
vulnerable children or children in local authority care who have
additional needs, is it not right that it is held to account for that
failure?<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know that many young carers do not want to let schools, their school
friends or teachers know that they are young carers. If schools fail to
deliver on the needs of such children, is it not right that they are
held to account? These proposed new subsections are about such failure.
They are about the failure of schools to identify the issue and if they
have identified it, to make provision and follow up on that
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, on
what was said earlier around SEN and disability tribunals, let us
consider the case of a child who has a statement and is permanently
excluded—for example, a child who is permanently excluded for
swearing and has a statement for Tourette’s. If the parent feels
that there has been discrimination and if the tribunal agrees that that
is the case and refuses to change the name of the main school on the
statement, there is and will be reinstatement. Should the parents be
required to go through the process of having an appeals panel uphold
their appeal and then go on to an additional SEN disability tribunal?
Those parents have enough to deal with. Life is not easy for them and
we should surely be part of the solution, not part of the problem.
Unless we look at reinstatement where there has been clear failure, we
are making ourselves part of the problem for these families who,
frankly, have enough to deal
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000021">&#160;</a>

                           </span> On a point
of order, I do not want to put you in a difficult position, Mr
Williams, but when I asked your predecessor, Mr Walker, whether when
talking about my amendment on SEN training for members of review panels
was the appropriate time to discuss Government memorandum on how
independent review panels will operate and the fact that parents will
be able to call on an SEN expert, I was told that it was not. My point
of order, which I am making as long as possible to help you as much as
I can, Mr Williams, is to ask when in the process it would be
appropriate to discuss that? I felt that the relation of that point to
the membership of the panel and the support there would be for that
panel in making a judgment meant that that was an appropriate time, but
obviously it was not. I obviously accept the ruling of the

                           </strong> The Department for Education has produced
memorandum E45 to the Bill, which outlines how the new independent
review panels will operate, including 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>where a child has SEN. In relation to special educational needs, the key
proposal is to allow parents to request an SEN expert to advise the
independent review panel where SEN may be a factor. The memorandum
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Regulations
will provide for the constitution of the new review panels, how they
will operate and that the procedure that they will follow will be
broadly the same as for existing appeal panels. The main change is that
parents will be able to request that an SEN expert be present at the
review panel meeting , where it is a factor in the exclusion. It is
intended that the SEN expert will only attend in an advisory capacity
and will not be a full member of the panel with voting power; however
he or she will be paid to attend the panel.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is an interesting
innovation that suggests the Government are taking the issue seriously
and want to ensure that, at the panels, children with SEN are supported
and their needs are properly represented. That is extremely
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a number of questions about how this might operate in practice.
Will these experts carry out a formal assessment of the child? Of
course, that goes back to my amendment on the subject of the training
of the review panel because if those involved are not trained and are
unable to understand some of the issues, it will make it harder for
them to judge the evidence from the expert. Will they carry out the
formal assessment? Will they to do that alone or is it possible that
the experts will see the need, having made an examination, to call in
other experts? How will it work in budgetary terms? Do the Government
intend the expert to be independent of the local authority and/or the
school? Will the parents be able to choose the expert? Will the expert
be expected to know the child? To what extent will they be able to talk
about the specific child? That goes back to my issue about the
assessment. What will the experts be expert in? Will they be experts in
educational needs, on the law, or on behaviour management? What exactly
will they be expected to have as their area of expertise? Will they be
generic SEN experts, or will they have different areas of expertise?
What advice will they be expected to provide to the panel, and how will
that be assessed? Will parents who believe that their child has an
unidentified SEN also be able to request an expert, or will that
service be available only for children with a statement or for whom
there has been school action or school action plus? Who precisely will
be eligible to access the expertise? Who will make the final decision
on whether an SEN expert is required at the review panel? All that fits
in with the training of the panel and our general focus of ensuring
that the needs of SEN children are met and appropriately dealt with in
matters of
exclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000026">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I am a little nervous, because I
cannot match the direct experience, knowledge and statistics of the
hon. Member for North West Durham, my hon. Friend the Member for
Beverley and Holderness and other members of the Committee, so I shall
talk about my general impressions, and from my heart about children
with autism and the impact of the process of exclusion. I shall speak
aside of amendments 67 and 68, but try to prompt the
Minister for some further thoughts, particularly on the exclusion of
children with
autism.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
one has a child with autism, apart from the care and consideration of
how their learning will progress, a key concern is how they will
develop sustainable relationships and have a happy personal, social and

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 375<a class="bkMark" name="Column375">&#160;</a>
                           </div>perhaps married life in future. It seems to me that one of the most
devastating impacts on that journey is for that child to be excluded
during their time at school. The consequential impact of taking someone
away from their peers and friends will have a much longer term impact,
and it would be interesting to hear the Minister say more about that.
My general impression—I am not as knowledgeable as others on
this—is that we are still grappling to understand autism, its
impact on the sufferer’s life, and how we as a society can get
our schools and other care institutions in our community to help them
to overcome some of the major impacts on their
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
my impression is that we have asked our teachers to be at the forefront
in helping us to understand and to solve some of the problems. Progress
has been made over the past few years by the Government and with the
private Member’s Bill. I have seen for myself—I am sure
that this is repeated in schools in all hon. Members’
constituencies—how teachers do such work. I visited Daubeney
school in Kempston on Monday to look at how it tries to find ways of
taking children with emotional issues in the classroom outside the
classroom to calm down. The teacher deploys a rat as a way of calming
the child. The rat is apparently named after a former teacher, but
apparently with that teacher’s okay. That is just one of a
number of steps that teachers are taking to try to maintain children
with special needs in their mainstream
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the light of that and the Green Paper, will the Minister hold it as a
personal mission on his part that as we move forward with the other
reforms in the legislation, he will monitor, identify and reduce the
number of exclusions of children with autism. We have heard the
statistics, and we all understand them. It would be welcome
collectively to hear from the Minister that he will take steps and
measures to reduce
exclusions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000030">&#160;</a>

educational

                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 27, hon. Members and I will be largely in agreement on the
importance of what should happen in practice, but I hope to persuade
them that additional primary legislation will not help to achieve that.
The Government are committed to supporting the education of
children with SEN. The Green Paper “Support and
aspiration” sets out plans to support children with
SEN.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I recognise
that children with SEN are disproportionately represented among those
permanently excluded from school. In many cases, the SEN will be
behavioural, emotional or social difficulty, so it is not surprising
that their behaviour is more likely than that of other pupils to lead
to exclusion. That just reinforces how important it is that all those
dealing with the exclusion of a child with special needs give due
regard to those needs. I take on board the point made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Bedford on children on the autistic spectrum.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The governing
body of a school has an important role to play in the exclusion
process. Governing bodies will continue to have to consider whether to
reinstate a pupil who has been excluded in the same circumstances that
they do now. When doing so, they must have regard to guidance from the
Department for Education. That guidance will be reviewed and revised in
the light of the passage of the Bill and in the light of comments made
by members of the Committee. Governing bodies must take account of
relevant information pertaining to the child when considering an
exclusion. I will be happy to ensure that future versions of guidance
will make it explicit that they should take account of information on
the child’s SEN—that is currently implicit. In view of
the proportion of excluded children who have SEN, I have been persuaded
by the comments that I have heard in this debate and previous debates
that there should be an explicit reference to SEN in future
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would hesitate to be so prescriptive as to say that it must be a report
from the school’s special educational needs
co-ordinator—their SENCO—which is the subject of
amendment 27. In many cases the SENCO will be the appropriate source of
information, but I would rather limit guidance to the principle that
the governing body should take account of information pertaining to the
child’s special educational needs. We also intend to ensure that
proper account is taken of a child with special educational needs if a
case is brought to a review panel. I am pleased to be able to confirm
to the Committee that, as set out in the policy statement, which was
referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness,
parents will have the right to ask for a special educational needs
expert to attend the panel. We will have a relevant provision in
regulations. It

request and they will not have to prequalify by having a child with a
statement or who has been regarded as requiring school action or school
action plus by the school. To answer my hon. Friend the Member for
Beverley and Holderness, no the experts would not carry out an
assessment on the child. The local authority retains its duty of
identification and assessment of children with special educational
needs, which must be right. The panel’s remit must be confined
to that of the exclusion. He asked a number of important questions but
we will engage with the special educational needs sector to discuss the
practical details when we draw up the regulations for consultation. We
will welcome their input and appreciate the helpful advice they can
offer on these issues, such as the SEN experts. I hope that that will

believe that what we are proposing is sufficient to ensure that
governing bodies will take due account of a child’s special
educational needs when they consider an exclusion. In the light of that
I hope that the hon. Member for Cardiff West will withdraw his
amendment. I will come to his other amendment later but I will deal now
with amendment 67, the SEN trigger amendment tabled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness. I understand his intentions and
I have considerable sympathy with what he seeks to do. I hope that I
can persuade him that this is not the most effective way to address the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000046">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">“Support
and aspiration”, the Green Paper on special educational needs,
emphasises the importance of identifying behavioural problems and their
causes and addressing them at an early stage so that a pupil’s
behaviour can improve and he or she is not at risk of being permanently
excluded because no one has intervened to tackle the root cause of the
unacceptable behaviour. Early intervention should be central to any
school’s approach to behaviour management. One of the reasons
for the new approach to exclusions that we will trial from September,
under 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 378<a class="bkMark" name="Column378">&#160;</a>
                           </div>which the excluding school will be responsible for the choice of
alternative provision and the attainment of excluded pupils, is that we
believe this will leave schools to focus more on early intervention and
use some of the additional funding that will be delegated to them from
local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An
assessment of possible special educational needs can be an important
part of early intervention. Schools may well find it useful to have a
child’s needs assessed, possibly a multi-agency assessment going
beyond the special educational needs. If a child misbehaves regularly,
a second or third term exclusion could be a school’s trigger or
a reminder to them to consider an assessment. I have no problem with
the principle that is set out in the amendment—or, indeed, the
principle that is set out in recommendation 25 of the Select Committee
report—but I am concerned that the amendment may be too rigid in
what it imposes. That can sometimes lead to a box-ticking mentality
rather than effective action.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000048">&#160;</a>

a million miles from what my hon. Friend has recommended in the

to react to a specific trigger—the effect of which,
incidentally, might be that schools wait for that trigger to occur,
even though early indications are already there—we want to urge
them to consider early assessment, which should be effective
multi-agency assessment. Schools must have regard to guidance on
exclusions, which will be revised and reissued in the coming months.
The trial of the new approach to exclusion should also offer an
opportunity to assess how this approach to assessment can work in
practice. We will have scope to amend guidance further in the light of
what we learn from that trial. I believe that the approach that we have
taken is appropriate, and that it will be effective.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000057">&#160;</a>

training for panel members, and I agree that it is important that
independent review panels are properly equipped to consider the
particular needs of children with special educational needs or
disability. My hon. Friend has referred to the detailed policy
statement in relation to the proposed regulations, which includes our
intention that regulations will cover the establishment, constitution
and procedures of the review panels. We fully intend the regulations to
include a requirement that review panel members must be appropriately
trained, and we expect, broadly, to replicate the current training
requirements for independent appeal panels. We expect that panel
members will need to have training in respect of the law governing
exclusions and review panels; the duties under the Equality Act 2010,
which was referred to by the hon. Member for Cardiff West; and the law
on human rights, whether the Human Rights Act 1998 or the European
convention on human rights. Also, they will need training on judicial
review principles and the need to observe procedural fairness and the
rules of natural
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000058">&#160;</a>

make that clear in a moment. However, it is clear that he has accepted
the principle. I would point out that there is a particularly strong
link between children identified as having behavioural difficulties and
children who have unidentified speech, language and communication
difficulties. The Minister is absolutely right to say that it is so
important that review panels have the expertise to recognise that. I
know that there is no greater champion in Parliament of children with
such difficulties than the Minister, and he will want to ensure that
the panels are in the best position to recognise that
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000059">&#160;</a>

independent review panels, as they are now for training independent
appeal panel members. Local authorities and schools carrying out their
functions under this section must also comply with the new public
sector equality duty, which I covered in the debate on the previous
group of amendments. The general duty on public authorities will be to
have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination,
harassment and victimisation; to advance equality of opportunity
between people who share a protected characteristic; and to foster good
relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those
who do not. Schools and local authorities must have regard to their

will be able to request that an SEN expert be present at the review
panel. Additionally, as mentioned by the hon. Member for North West
Durham, once appeal panels are removed, parents will automatically be
able to bring disability discrimination claims in cases of permanent
exclusion to the first-tier tribunal. That will give them access to
additional expertise for disability-related exclusion cases. I hope

authority and make it harder for good discipline to prevail. Sally

                           </div>decision-making by a head teacher, the school’s governing body
will be aware of that and will need to take action to tackle it.
However, the Government are making a step change in the relationship
between the Department of State and the professionals who run our
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to make a serious point, not a partisan point.
What we are discussing is a change, and difficult
decisions will need to be taken as a consequence. Governing bodies will
have to—“up their game” is the wrong phrase, but
they will have to take very seriously how heads are responding to the
new trust that we are trying to foster in our schools. I believe that
that will work. Head teachers are professional people. They take
exclusion extremely seriously. It is the last resort for almost every
head teacher I have ever met, and I am sure that that is also the case
for the hon. Member for North West Durham and her family members who
are head
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
if there are head teachers who are not up to it, we need to know who
they are swiftly, not just for this issue but for general issues to do
with running a school. Therefore, governing bodies do need to take
these issues seriously and assess how their head teachers are managing
the
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also gave the example of a boy with Tourette’s
syndrome. We are safeguarding children from disability discrimination
cases that lead to exclusions by giving parents the direct right of
appeal to the tribunal. That should deal with cases such as that of
Lewis, to whom she
referred.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
return to the amendment, permanent exclusions will generally be the
last resort, after other interventions have been used to try to tackle
a pupil’s behaviour. A message that head teachers are always
keen to put over to us and which we heard clearly in the public
evidence sessions is that they do not want to exclude pupils, but there
are cases in which it is right and necessary to do so. I sympathise
with the hon. Lady’s aim of supporting vulnerable children, but
the amendment is not the right way to safeguard their interests. It
would give the new review panels the same power as current independent
appeal panels to order the reinstatement of an excluded pupil. In
2008-09—I have cited this figure before—panels ordered
the reinstatement of 60 pupils from 640 appeals
lodged.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
fact, the amendment would give review panels an even greater
power. They could not only order reinstatement, but direct the school
to make reasonable adjustments to support the child or to make extra
provision for the child. Those are not appropriate functions for an
exclusion review panel. There are important issues about how we
identify and support children with special needs, but we should not put
all that on to the exclusion

requiring schools to make reasonable adjustments and appropriate

with special educational needs, it is required to make reasonable
adjustments and to make reasonable provision. Yes, most head teachers
whom I have worked with have been highly professional, but there are
those who are not, and my concern is that the powers in the Bill allow
head teachers to fail, to act unreasonably and to get away with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000072">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There are many routes. If the review panel believes
that the procedure was flawed, it can quash the decision and request or
require, depending on what category its decision reaches, that the
governing body reconsiders the exclusion. The governing body could
reconsider the exclusion and decide to reinstate the pupil. Therefore,
there is a route for reinstatement that does not rely only on the case
being one of discrimination on the basis of disability. If that route
does not work, there is the other route that is confined to those who
believe that the exclusion was caused by discrimination as a result of
the child’s special need or
disability.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000075">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
recognise that children with special educational needs are
over-represented among those excluded. It is of the highest importance
that children have their special educational needs identified as soon
as possible, so that appropriate support can be put in place, which is
a key theme of the Green Paper—making sure that there is better
early intervention for that group of young people to prevent problems
later, and to improve their educational outcomes and life chances. I
have quoted what the Green Paper states about assessment and the
identification of children’s
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000076">&#160;</a>

head teachers will still wish to exclude a pupil with special
educational needs. We intend to prescribe in regulations that, in those
circumstances, parents may ask for an SEN expert to attend the panel
hearing and to advise on relevant issues. As I have just said to the
hon. Member for Walthamstow, if parents believe that the exclusion
involved discrimination on the grounds of disability, they will be able
to take their case to the first-tier

children. We want the local authority that cares for them to act in
those children’s best interests and to ensure that they receive
the support that they need. Local authorities have a duty under the
Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote their welfare,
and so have a

			Column number: 383<a class="bkMark" name="Column383">&#160;</a>
                           </div>clear responsibility to work closely with the schools attended by their
looked-after children to minimise the risk of a child being permanently
excluded.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is true that looked-after children are at greater risk of being
permanently excluded than other children. Clearly, they are a group of
vulnerable children, who may be coping with a whole range of emotional
issues when they go to school. Those issues will sometimes manifest
themselves in poor behaviour. It is worth remembering that schools have
developed a much greater awareness and understanding of such challenges
than they had in the past. All maintained schools and academies are
required to have a designated teacher for looked-after children, who
has a role in championing their education and acts as a source of
expertise and advice for staff. It is therefore not surprising that
some schools have not had any looked-after children permanently
excluded for several
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">No
decision to exclude a looked-after child or any child should be taken
lightly, and for looked-after children everything possible should be
done through discussion before the point of exclusion is reached.
Requiring a school to reinstate children whose behaviour led them to
being permanently excluded is not the right approach, but if the child
has special educational needs an expert can be put on the review
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
position will be similar for young carers, whose problems I appreciate.
Last week, I met the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and the
Children’s Society to discuss the problems faced by carers in
schools. Good schools do not exclude pupils without first seeking to
understand the underlying causes of bad behaviour, and ensuring that
the child and family have access to appropriate and timely support.
Indeed, schools are in a unique position to observe that all is not
well in the life of a child. Young carers, like all vulnerable
children, deserve support. There is no question in my mind but that we
need to do more to ensure that schools can identify young carers and
give them the flexibility—a word emphasised by the Princess
Royal Trust for Carers—to juggle school life and their home
responsibilities. But the exclusion panel is not the place to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000082">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
come to the final group of amendments on free school meals and the
children who will qualify for the pupil premium. The amendment tabled
by the hon. Member for North West Durham covered children eligible for
free school meals. The pupil premium is intended to help schools to
provide for the needs of disadvantaged pupils. We look to schools to
use that money effectively to support the pupils. I would argue that
those pupils do not necessarily have additional needs in quite the same
way as those with special educational needs and disabilities, or indeed
looked-after children or young carers, so their position is not quite
the same as those three other groups, although the pupil premium will
be payable for looked-after children. The same principle applies.
Reinstatement is not the answer for them or others in their
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000083">&#160;</a>

concerns about the provisions because, in the experience of my hon.
Friends, it appears that early intervention has not happened for quite
a few children. A child can get to exclusion and then find out
subsequently that they will not be reinstated, so the person who pays
the price for the failure of the school is the child, and we should not
underestimate the damage that is done to children by having to move
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do accept that. That is why I want to get the
early intervention right, and that is the drive behind the Green Paper.
However, if a child is not flourishing in a school—this is the
point about the quote that the shadow Minister gave earlier about the
inefficacy of multiple fixed-period exclusions. The continued poor
behaviour in that school is not in the best interests of the child. It
may be that the child needs a new environment, a new school, a fresh
start or more specialist help to be able to tackle their behavioural
problems. We hope that engaging specialist help, if the underlying
causes of that poor behaviour had not been identified, will
lead to that identification and therefore more
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000086">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Reinstatement
should not be a power of the review panel. Assigning a review panel
powers in relation to the identification of a child’s individual
needs and determining specific educational and specialist provision
changes the purpose of the panel and in practice will be beyond their
competence, so I would urge the hon. Member for North West Durham not
to press her

39 seeks to give the Secretary of State the ability to set out
circumstances in which a special educational needs assessment must be
carried out in relation to an excluded pupil. While I do not agree with
the amendment, I understand the sentiments behind it. It is important
that head teachers have the right and authority to exclude a pupil when
necessary, but I also know that it is preferable for all involved if
behavioural problems are stopped before they escalate to the point at
which a permanent exclusion is necessary. If a pupil who is at risk of
being excluded, or who is repeatedly excluded, has underlying special
educational needs that are a causal factor in his or her behaviour, it
may be possible to stop that behaviour if those needs are
identified. It is, of course, the provision of appropriate
support as a result of the assessment rather than the act of assessment
itself that can help to prevent any unnecessary
exclusions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000088">&#160;</a>

discussed at a recent meeting that I had with the Special Educational
Consortium, when faced with a child with persistently poor behaviour,

approach to the assessment of needs and the delivery of services, which
means we can ensure that children from families facing multiple
problems are dealt with. That is why we want to have an effective
multi-agency assessment for any underlying causal factors that will
bring in those home life issues, as well as any underlying medical or
emotional needs of the child. It is not right for the Government to
prescribe how and when a school should conduct assessments.
Professionals who have the facts of each child’s circumstances
are better placed than we are in this Committee or in the Department to
make that kind of judgment. The type of assessment required will vary
from case to case, and a number of different triggers could prompt a
school to arrange for one to happen. In light of what has been a

                        <p>That
is what the memorandum says, but we will consult on that to see how
widely the measure can be drawn and we will establish whether it can be
drawn widely enough to make it a right of parents to request an SEN
expert. The way the policy is developed at the moment, as is set out in
that document, means that it needs to be a factor in the exclusion.
However, we are not inflexible on that point. The local authority will
appoint the expert, which I think addresses one of the questions asked
by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness. All of the
issues will be put out for
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000099">&#160;</a>

have another question about the expert on the panel. Where did the idea
come from? It is all very well to say that all the details will be put
out for consultation with specialists in the area, but what was the
thinking behind that? Why is it seen as the right way to go, as opposed
to other measures that could be taken? Special educational needs are a
key part of the exclusion of so many children, so why is there not a
desire to have an expert on the panel even if they are not actively
acting as an advocate for the child, particularly if they have met and
assessed them in some way? I am still not clear about where that
thinking came from, but I am glad to accept the Minister’s
reassurances on amendments 67 and
68.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000101">&#160;</a>

for children with special educational needs and that not every
exclusion relates to the special educational needs of children. A
disproportionate number of children who are excluded have special
educational needs, but many exclusions are for a whole host of reasons
other than SEN. I hope that, with those words, we can press
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000102">&#160;</a>

require reinstatement. It also seeks to probe the Government on the
reasons for introducing the clause. The National Union of Teachers told

the Runnymede Trust shows that of the 8,110 permanent exclusions in
2007-08, only 710 (fewer than one in 11) were contested in front of

NUT says that, without the power to reinstate, the review panels are,
in effect, “toothless”—that is the word it uses.

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Children’s Society also took a similar position on this issue.
It is concerned that the removal of this power will leave vulnerable
children without the right of redress—even in cases of mistaken
identity or where the process was found to be deeply flawed. It
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000116">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
another point, we have already heard how children with special
educational needs and children from certain social groups have
disproportionately high rates of exclusion. The removal of the ability
for a child to be reinstated by an independent panel carries the risk
that these children might be discriminated against. Earlier on, we
talked about autism. I know that hon. Members from all parts of the
House are genuinely concerned about children on the autistic spectrum.
Ambitious About Autism told us that<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“removing the
right to reinstatement through the independent review panel may have
the unintended consequence of increasing exclusions among those groups
already more vulnerable to exclusion— including children with
autism and other
SEN.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we heard this morning, children with statements of special educational
needs will still be able to make a disability discrimination claim at a
special educational needs and disability tribunal hearing. In that
instance, the panel can order the school to reinstate the child if they
do not uphold the exclusion decision. That raises a couple of
interesting points. The Alliance for Inclusive Education told us that
it is worried that parents will be required to jump another legal
hurdle of proving that their child is disabled under the Equality Act
2010 in order to gain the right to have him or her reinstated on the
school roll. There is a danger that all we are doing is putting in an
additional hurdle or piece of bureaucracy in front of parents. It also
raises a point of principle. The Minister said a moment or two ago that
it was a step change in relationships to give head teachers the
authority ultimately to insist on exclusion. In fact, of course, he is
not giving head teachers the right to exclude under any circumstances,
because if the parents are able to take their case to the special
educational needs and disability tribunal and successfully argue that
their child is being discriminated against on those grounds, the
tribunal can order reinstatement. Before judicial review, we have a
legal body, in the tribunal, which can order a head teacher and the
school governors to reinstate an excluded pupil, even though the school
had insisted that it did not want the pupil to be reinstated after the
review panel had recommended reinstatement.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000122">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Although clause 4 makes significant changes to the
power of the appeals process to reinstate pupils, when I referred to
step change I meant the step change in the relationship between the
Department for Education and professionals, including head teachers.
That relationship is changing significantly, away from the top-down
prescriptive approach of the previous Administration to a new trust in
professionals. It is a significant change—it is a step
change—and it will require people to make difficult
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000123">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Government
are taking two approaches. In one sense, they are saying that they will
not prescribe what schools should do in all circumstances; in another
sense, they are saying that schools will be judged on whether they
deliver the English bac. The Minister may claim that that is a nudge,
but as I have pointed out before, it is a nudge with a loaded gun. If
the schools do not deliver the bac, they will feature badly in the
league tables endorsed by the Secretary of State and the Department. It
has had a significant consequence, given what schools are having to do
with their timetables for next year and the pressure being put on
pupils to opt for certain subjects. I shall not go too far down that
road, but I do not agree with the Minister that it is a significant
philosophical step change in the exact direction that he
indicates.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
would like to give the impression—I do not accuse of him of
trying to mislead anyone—that the consequence of clause 4 is
that, ultimately, head teachers cannot be gainsaid if they exclude a
pupil and the governors agree. In that regard, the head teacher will be
rather like Captain Bligh—still captain of the ship, and still
able to have his way, even if there is mutiny on the Bounty.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In reality, a
pupil may be excluded, that pupil may appeal against the exclusion, the
case may come before the appeals panel and the appeals panel may find
the school’s decision inadequate when considered against the
test of judicial review. Even under those circumstances the school may
insist on exclusion, but it could face a fine as a result—or a
financial adjustment or penalty, depending whose dictionary is
consulted. The appeals panel may say that the pupil should be
reinstated, quashing the school’s decision, but the school may

want to explore the Government’s thinking on the likely increase
in bureaucracy that the clause would cause for schools. The NUT warned
that, rather than reducing bureaucracy, there is a danger that removal
of the panels may lead to several parents taking legal action against
schools, which would involve schools in a lot more work and unnecessary
bureaucracy. In his April 2009 independent review, “Learning
Behaviour: Lessons Learned, a review of the behaviour standards and
practices in our schools”, Sir Alan Steer

essence of the clause. A review panel must not be able to direct a
school to reinstate a child who has been excluded. As I said in an
earlier debate on this clause, for a school to run effectively and with
good behaviour and discipline, it is vital that the head teacher has
authority to manage behaviour. Reinstating an excluded pupil may
undermine that authority, and adversely affect behaviour throughout the
school to the detriment of other pupils and

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have already discussed in depth the needs of vulnerable children with
regard to exclusions and the measures that we are taking to protect
them. We consider that the new arrangements comply with human rights
legislation. We are providing for an independent review in every case
of permanent exclusion where a parent, or a pupil if they are over the
age of 18, requests it. All public bodies, including schools, local
authorities and our new review panels, have to conduct their
decision-making in a way that is lawful in the light of the principles
applicable in an application for a judicial review. We are asking the
panel to look at the school’s decision in that light.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
principles are: legality; the body must act within the scope of its
powers and for proper purpose; procedural fairness, for example, giving
the individual the right to be heard; reasonableness and rationality;
taking into account relevant but not irrelevant factors and not making
a decision that no reasonable person could have made; and,
compatibility with the European Convention of Human Rights and EU
laws.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To reassure
hon. Members, arrangements for the education of permanently excluded
pupils are already covered in legislation. Their rights to education
are therefore protected. Local authorities have a duty to arrange
suitable full-time education from the sixth day following a permanent
exclusion of a pupil. There is an equivalent duty on schools to arrange
full-time education from the sixth day of a fixed-term exclusion. It is
extremely important for excluded pupils to be given the chance to
pursue their education in an appropriate setting and have the
opportunity to secure meaningful qualifications. Improving the quality
and range of alternative provision is a high priority for this
Government. We are considering the barriers to more involvement in
alternative provision from the voluntary and private sectors, as well
as looking at how to free up the sector as a whole and how to improve
provision in pupil referral units. One way would be by the new category
of alternative provision—academies—to be established by
clause 51. I will not go down that route
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand that children’s rights groups have expressed concerns
that this legislation will leave parents with no other route of appeal
to seek reinstatement, other than judicial review, which I think was
the point that that the hon. Member for Cardiff West was making. Since
the independent review panels will be using the same threshold as will
be used in a judicial review, there will be no point in pursuing a
judicial review. I am clear that we have taken steps to ensure that
procedures are fair and that a judicial review would not be successful.
The local government ombudsman will continue to have a role in relation
to the panel itself, as it does now. We are amending the relevant
section of the Local Government Act 1972 to provide for that. The
ombudsman will not be able to overturn the decision of an independent
review panel, nor able to reinstate a pupil. I think that I have
addressed all the concerns of the hon. Gentleman in relation to
amendment 35.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000144">&#160;</a>

that the exclusion will not count towards the two exclusions that would

financial adjustment, as the Minister sometime refers to it; a
financial penalty, as it is referred to in his note; or a fine, as I
refer to it. Nevertheless what is novel about this clause, and what is
unusual about the Bill, is that it introduces the concept that the
Government want ultimately to allow the responsible body in a school to
act unreasonably. I am not a lawyer, but I wonder whether down the road
that is something that might feature in some interesting cases versus
Her Majesty’s Government. I also wonder what they will make of

different from any court that imposes a fine or a punishment for the
behaviour of an individual. The fact that it does not require the

mean that it is condoning the taking of the television set from the

that, if a head teacher behaved in the manner suggested by the shadow

incorrectly accused and suffers—or there is a maladministration
resulting in injustice—surely natural justice requires that
person be restored to their former position. If they are not, would the
parents of children not go down the route of damages, and that some of
those damages could be
substantial?<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000157">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The law and procedures are clear and fair. If there
have been lax procedures in leading to the exclusion, or the head
teacher was acting unreasonably, it will be referred back to the
governing body. That is another group of reasonable people who will
re-examine the issue, consider and decide, on the basis of the facts,
whether to reinstate that pupil. An overriding principle is what is in
the best interests of the school; that is what we are trying to
deliver. We are trying to deliver a way of ensuring that our schools
have much better standards of behaviour, so that all vulnerable
children—and those not so vulnerable—are safe and happy
in a safe and secure environment. That is what we are trying to
achieve. In addition, we have introduced a huge number of safeguards to
try to minimise any unfairness in the

                           </strong> Of course not. I am saying they have to take into
account all these factors; they have to act in the best interests of
the pupil in the school, of course they do. The head teacher, when
making decisions and enforcing behaviour, has to act in the best
interests of all the pupils in the school, to ensure that they have a
safe environment. That was what Sally Coates described, when she said
that there cannot be a situation such as the one to which she referred
when the child comes back to the school. That is why we cannot have
reinstatement. We have introduced a huge number of safeguards into the
system, so that the governing body will reconsider

                           </div>whether to reinstate the child if required by the review panel. If it

                           </strong> I am struggling with the Minister’s argument
that one child reinstated is one too many. It makes an automatic
assumption that things are never going to go wrong. We have already had
some real-life examples earlier today. I am also extremely puzzled how
he can believe that a school that would wrongly exclude a child, could
be one that would act in the best interests of all children. It seems
pretty fundamental and easy to see that a school that does not look
properly at the situation of a vulnerable child, and ends up excluding
that child wrongly, is likely to be a school that is not meeting the
needs of a great many of its
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000161">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady makes a good point. It is the point
that I was making earlier. If there is a head teacher who is acting
unreasonably, the governing body will be aware of that and will see a
pattern developing, and will have to take action. It is unlikely that a
head teacher who is behaving unreasonably on those occasions would be
acting well in relation to other parts of how the school is run. It is
important that governing bodies take their responsibilities seriously
in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000162">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Of course it is important that governing bodies take
their responsibilities seriously. Earlier we had a more informal
conversation about human nature, and we know that it is often difficult
for people to take up these issues. The Government are putting head
teachers in an incredibly powerful position, something we do not do to
other professionals. In fact, with other professionals, such as GPs, we
have rowed back in recent years. They are putting them in an incredibly
powerful position and then expecting essentially a group of lay
people—governors are good people and many take their
responsibilities very seriously—to challenge a powerful
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000163">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The position of that reinstatement would bring us
back to where we are now. We have a serious issue in this country that
must be tackled and we are discussing one of many measures to solve it.
By not allowing the panel to reinstate, we are helping to deliver
higher standards of behaviour in our schools right across the board. We
will be benefiting disproportionately those pupils who have
vulnerabilities, care responsibilities, are looked-after children or
who have special educational
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the system, the decision can be reviewed by a review panel of
specialist people and experts. A child and parent can elect, if they
wish, to have an SEN expert in attendance and to give advice at the
panel 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 395<a class="bkMark" name="Column395">&#160;</a>
                           </div>hearing. If the panel believes that the decision was flawed in some way,
it can ask the governing body to reconsider the decision or, if it were
seriously flawed, it can demand that the governing body reconsiders the
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
reconsidering the decision, the governing body will have the benefit of
all the evidence from the independent review panel, which may be new
evidence and might influence its decision to reinstate. It might make a
different decision from the one that it took initially in supporting
the head teacher’s decision to exclude. Multiple layers of
safeguard are built into the system to ensure and minimise human
fallibility. There will always be human fallibility in the affairs of
men and women, but we have to devise systems that minimise it as much
as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having
given the issue a lot of thought along with many other Ministers and
officials over the months, I think that that such a provision is the
best approach to being able to incorporate the principle of not having
automatic reinstatement against the wishes of not only the head
teacher, but the governors and the head teacher. It has to be their
wish that the pupil is not reinstated. The decision is not just made by
one man or one woman. We have combined that principle with the
principle of justice and fairness so there will be a review
panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
will be extra support for pupils with special educational needs from
the panel expert. In addition, we have the direct route to the
first-tier tribunal if there is a belief that the child is excluded
because of their special educational needs or disabilities. Ultimately,
there is the possibility of complaining to the Secretary of State.
Taken as a whole, those measures have created under clause 4 a system
that will deliver the Government’s quality objectives, as well
as fairness to young people that is in their best interests and who
need extra
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
turn now to amendment 36. I fully acknowledge the importance of
regulations, and I can understand why the hon. Member for Cardiff West
is interested in them. That is why a detailed policy statement on the
regulations was made available to the Committee as long ago as 4.34 pm
last Monday, which is a long time. The regulations will be extremely
detailed, and we will be consulting widely on them. It would not
therefore be efficient use of parliamentary time automatically to
scrutinise them on the Floor of the House. Indeed, when exclusion
regulations were laid in 2002 by the Labour party, they were not made
under the affirmative resolution procedure, but there is always the
possibility that hon. Members can pray against the regulations and thus
make them subject to a
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Regulation-making
powers currently exist for the exclusion process because they cover
detailed procedures that it would be too complex to outline in the
Bill. New regulations will establish independent review panels, and set
out their procedures and powers. They will provide for the constitution
of the new review panels, how they will operate and the procedure that
they will follow. It will be broadly the same as for existing appeal
panels. The main change to which I referred earlier is that parents
will be able to request that an SEN expert be present at the review
panel meeting when they believe that their child’s SEN were a
factor in the exclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If the worry
of members of the Committee is in relation to the power to
make regulations under subsection (5), they should be reassured by our
detailed policy statement in which we have set out how we will use the
power. The Government intend that it will be used to regulate and have
set out the circumstances in which a panel, having heard a review, may
decide to mark a pupil’s record to note the outcome of the
review in cases when reinstatement is not the eventual outcome for the
pupil. That may provide some form of redress for parents, and will
ensure that the exclusion does not count towards the rule that, if a
pupil has two exclusions, they and their parents lose the right to
choose the next school.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The powers of
the review panel will be different from those of independent appeal
panels, and the differences are set out in the Bill. The new panels
will no longer have the power to reinstate pupils, as I have said, but
will be able to direct governing bodies to reconsider decisions that
they consider to be unreasonable. Additionally, regulations will set
out the circumstances in which the panel may direct an adjustment of
the school budget share. We intend to regulate to provide for
circumstances where the school’s decision has been considered
unreasonable by the panel but the governing body refuses to
reconsider.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding
amendment 35, which would empower the review panel to require
reinstatement, I remain concerned about the procedure. There is
something whiffy about it, to coin a phrase. I do not think that it
will get any clearer or more coherent as debate about it goes on. I am
not going to press the amendment to a vote in Committee because I want
to cogitate a little further on some of the things that the Minister
has said, and I want to think through the consequences. However, I
remain seriously concerned that the process is problematic, despite the
many hours of thought that the Minister, his colleagues, his officials
and their lawyers have put into it, the many meetings that they have
had and the many iterations that there have been of how it finally
ended up in the Bill. I do not know whether Members have seen the film
“Double Indemnity” with Edward G. Robinson. If someone
has a man inside them telling them that there is something wrong with
something, they should listen to him. We are not letting go of this one
just yet, however, even though I am not pressing the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000177">&#160;</a>

amendment 36, given the importance of the clause, it is worth having
the affirmative procedure. That would not involve the Floor of the
House; the regulations can be gone through upstairs in Committee. It
just means that they will not be slipped through without it being
noticed, rather like some note at 4.34 in the afternoon suddenly
emerging from somewhere. I would like to press amendment 36 to a
Division, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment
35.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000178">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This amendment
is essentially about pupils’ participation in the school
exclusion process. The amendment has three elements. The first would
allow children to participate and give them a right to be heard. The
second would allow children to appeal in their own right. The third
would ensure that pupils are given all information in language that
they can readily understand. That element is self-explanatory, so I do
not intend to talk further about it. It supports the other two
elements.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000203">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
you may remember, Mr Williams, it was a Conservative Government who
ratified that UN convention in 1991. Interestingly, that Government had
clearly been moving in that direction for some time, as they passed the
Children Act 1989, which made huge changes to how social workers in
particular operated in relation to children and young people. I
remember it clearly, having been a social worker at the time; I do not
know whether you were practising at that point, Mr Williams. It was an
important and fundamental change.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The 1989 Act
not only changed how things happened at the time but has remained the
bedrock for children’s work and children’s social care
legislation ever since, and it put in place a requirement, which the UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child wanted, for children’s
needs to be solicited and considered in all care-related decisions,
including any decision to remove a child from his or her family on
child protection grounds, and decisions regarding placement in foster
care, the development and review of care plans and visits with parents
and family. Governments must start from the presumption that all
children are capable of forming and expressing views, and it must be up
to authorities to disprove that presumption. Simply listening to the
child is insufficient; the child’s views must be considered
seriously.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A fundamental
change took place, and a lot of training was introduced to ensure that
practitioners understood the importance of those principles. Over the
years, that practice has become embedded, although not as well as we
would like in many situations. Indeed, many of the tragedies that we
see in child protection relate to the fact that children have not been
spoken to separately, their views have not been listened to and their
perspective has not been taken into account. However, the principle is
there, and the legislation has subsequently been amended by other
Governments, including the Labour Government, to improve the
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000208">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Participation
is a fundamental right of the child under a convention to which this
country is signed up. In 2008, the UN Committee on the Rights of the
Child, in looking at the UK’s record, recommended that we ensure
that such participation takes place. Its judgment was that the UK
should
ensure<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“that

                        <p>That specifically
relates to the amendment. Article 12 of the convention states that
children

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“be
provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative
proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a
representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the
procedural rules of national
law.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000373">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
am not proposing anything unusual or strange, but something that
Governments have been signed up to for some time.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those are the
rights of the child, but we should discuss whether they are sensible. I
do not need to go over the issues that we have already spoken about,
because hon. Members with more direct experience of exclusion panels
than me have set out situations in which a brief discussion with a
child might easily have led to what was happening to that child being
found out.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is not
only the issue of the importance of talking to the child; there is the
issue of fairness and justice. Does the child feel that they have been
heard? Hon. Members should think back to when something happened to
them as a child or a young adult that was unjustified, such as being
picked out as the one who was talking in class when they were
not—Members may never have had such an experience; you would
never have been in that situation, Mr Williams, I am sure. For a child
or young person to be put through a process in which they do not feel
that they have had the opportunity to be properly listened to or
represented can create a huge amount of frustration, and can add
further to the problems that they are already experiencing as a result
of that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
make this suggestion not only because we should be doing what the
amendment suggests—it is clear that the UN took the view that
the current situation is in breach of article 12—but because it
is an efficacious way of proceeding. That is particularly the case if
we want to bring up young people in a system in which they respect the
processes, and in which they have an opportunity to be heard and have
their views considered, regardless of whether they have influence over
their situation. I entirely accept the Minister’s view, which we
have discussed at length, about the importance of establishing the
authority of teachers in schools. They, or parents in families, can
listen and involve young people; that does not mean that they have to
do exactly what the young person says. Listening and taking into
account views is an important process in and of itself; it is not about
removing
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
come back to my earlier point: we would question how well a school that
did not take into account the individual needs of one child was meeting
all the needs of other children. In my experience, the schools that
have good discipline records and that deal well with children are those
where children feel able to speak, put forward their concerns and be
heard.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
children should have a right to be heard in the exclusion
process—not the right to make the decision, or override anyone
else’s right, but to be part of the process. Secondly—the
Minister dealt with this in response to my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow—the amendment would specifically introduce the right
for a child to appeal on their own. Again, that is only reasonable and
is in line with the principles set out in the Department for
Education’s memorandum E 45—not the dermatological 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>cream, but the memorandum. We are talking about a principle of
procedural fairness and giving the individual a right to be
heard.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
said that only parents, or a child over the age of 18—they
would, in fact, no longer be a child if they were over 18—would
be able to appeal. That is a very narrow position to take. As young
people get older, they have the ability to express their views and make
decisions for themselves, and we should encourage young people to do
that because it is part of the process of becoming an adult. That has
been a matter for debate and discussion for years. It is some
years—I cannot remember how long—since the Gillick
judgment. We went around for years talking about a Gillick competent
child. That judgment relates to the point that even though a young
person is under the age of majority, they nevertheless have the right
to make certain decisions about themselves. A young person could well
have parents who are not prepared to take the steps to appeal but might
feel passionately about the situation, believe that an injustice has
been done and want to appeal. Again, in such a situation, it would be
right for that young person to have that opportunity.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I shall make
a final, wider point that we have dwelled on already. If we do not
allow for any appeal, it is counter to natural justice. We should take
that into account and allow young people a proper place in the process,
so that they can be heard and positively contribute to the process.
Such an approach will not make the situation in any way worse;
providing the opportunity for the young person to put forward their
point of view and be heard in a way that recognises that they have
something to say can only be a positive thing. If a child gets to the
end of the process and feels that they have not been listened to, it
will feed into a huge sense of injustice that could lead to further
problems. Although I do not have any specific examples from experience,
we have certainly been given examples by organisations that have
submitted evidence to the Committee. I hope that the Minister will look
positively on the
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000218">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the
Member for Sheffield, Heeley on amendment 64. I understand
that currently a pupil needs to be aged 18 to appeal against an
exclusion. However, as you will be no doubt intimately aware, Mr
Williams, that is not the case in every part of the United Kingdom.
Under the Education (Pupil Exclusions and Appeals) (Maintained Schools)
(Wales) Regulations 2003, regulation 2 allows a pupil aged 11 or over
at the start of the school year in which they are excluded—in
other words, from year 7 onwards—to appeal against
exclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is perhaps
timely that we reconsider the matter in the Bill, because there have
been developments in recent years. It raises some interesting
questions, as my hon. Friend has pointed out. I do not think that
giving children and young people the right to exercise an appeal has
resulted in a great breakdown of law an order in Wales—I have
not noticed any particular problems in Caernarfon. It is therefore
worth considering whether now is an appropriate time to look again at
the issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some young
people who face exclusion might be living on their own at the age of 17
in independent accommodation. Are we seriously saying that such people
should have no right whatever to appeal against an exclusion brought
against them? As my hon. Friend has 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 401<a class="bkMark" name="Column401">&#160;</a>
                           </div>pointed out, what if they do not have particularly motivated or capable
parents? Often, children with the kind of problems that lead to
exclusion have parents who themselves are not particularly responsible.
Such parents are highly unlikely to go through the process of launching
an appeal, even if the pupil, student or young person—who might
be aged 17 and living independently, or living at home in difficult
circumstances—feels that there has been an injustice.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I know that
the Minister sincerely gave his commitment to the looked-after children
agenda, which has developed a cross-party consensus in recent years.
Great progress has been made, although it has been hard progress all
the way. I recognise that progress as a former Minister with
responsibility for such matters. I worked hard to try to improve the
situation for children in care, introducing legislation and
implementing the “Care Matters: Time for Change” White
Paper. I remind the Committee, however, that the agenda for children
and young people in care—for which there was cross-party
support—involved the local authority improving their parenting,
improving their aspirations and trying to raise their ambitions,
providing them with greater stability in their lives and education, and
giving them a greater voice.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We believe
that looked-after children might be subject to exclusion in the way
that we have discussed, and that they are statistically more likely to
be subject to exclusion than other groups. We are not, however,
extending to them a voice in the form of an ability themselves to
appeal if a local authority is not exercising its function as a
responsible corporate parent in the way we would expect it to. The
question of whether such children and young people should have an
opportunity to appeal is, therefore, worthy of debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On that
basis, I ask the Minister to respond and to consider my hon.
Friend’s amendment. If he cannot accept it now perhaps he will
give it further consideration, because we might want to return to the
matter. At this stage, it is worth rethinking whether young people and
children under the age of 18 should be able to appeal in their own
right against an exclusion, particularly given the changes being made
in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000224">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will make only a few brief comments on the
amendment. The whole premise of the Bill is that the head teacher and
the school are always right, which we know is not always true. We heard
from my hon. Friend the Member for North West Durham about the cases of
Peter and Lewis, in which justice was clearly not served within the
school setting. There must be at least 60 more cases in which the
school was not right in what it did, because reinstatement was ordered
by an independent body. There were occasions, therefore, when the
decision-making process was not
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000225">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
natural justice, the accused have the right to defend themselves. If we
do not accept that young people have a right to put their views
forward, then we see them as purely a problem and not part of the
solution. As someone who worked in informal education for a number of
years, I would frequently hear young people’s side of what they
considered was being done to them by the school. I heard only one side,
and perhaps I would not have agreed with the young person if I had
heard the other side. We have a responsibility as adults in society 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 402<a class="bkMark" name="Column402">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to listen to what young people have to say. They have a responsibility
for their actions, but they have the right to be heard and to say,
“This is what happened; this is why this has
happened.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The whole act
of being expelled affects people’s futures enormously. Young
people can be stigmatised for life. It is therefore a very serious act.
In the past, some schools have perhaps not seen it as significant,
which it can be, for a young person to carry that stigma. On being
expelled, they like to talk about “exclusion”, but
actually, the school has chucked them out and said, “You are no
longer welcome and we have to find somewhere else for you to
go.” It is a very serious event in a young person’s life.
Given the difficulty they have in that period of transition—that
time when they are perhaps out of school altogether—it is a very
serious situation for young people to be in. As we know, the vast
majority of young people that this happens to are
disadvantaged.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If there is
any justice in our society, it should include being just to young
people and saying that they have a right to have a say, and we have a
responsibility to hear them. To be honest, if the young person is wrong
and what they are saying is not good, they will not win their appeal.
However, they should be able to learn from a process in which they can
say, “This is my side of the argument, but actually, my side is
not one that everyone thinks was right.” The amendment is
therefore important and I hope the Government will consider including
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000228">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I rise partly to reiterate from a slightly
different angle the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton
West made. I have worked in a voluntary capacity with many young people
who have been excluded. The amendment is important because it is part
of the process of getting young people to recognise that their
behaviour is unacceptable. One of the challenges that we often face in
working with young people with difficult backgrounds and challenging
behaviour is finding opportunities for them to take responsibility
directly for their behaviour and to see how that impacts on their
lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope the Minister will consider the amendment and realise that many of
us are concerned about exclusions. Because an exclusion has such a
dramatic impact on a young person, it is important that they have a
role to play in acknowledging inappropriate behaviour and what has
happened to them. It is important that they have the opportunity to put
their case, but also to recognise the situation and to take
responsibility directly. We fear that if we delegate that role solely
to the parents, there is a danger that a young person, who, for a
variety of reasons, might not have a very constructive relationship
with their parent, will not begin the process of having their behaviour
challenged and accepting responsibility for their own conduct. Those of
us who have worked with young people understand and value the
opportunities—big and small—to have such relationships
with them and to challenge them in that way. If the Minister does not
accept the amendment, I hope he will at least consider how he can
encourage young people to lead each other into better forms of
behaviour, even in the context of an exclusion
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000230">&#160;</a>

bodies, local authorities and review panels to ensure that excluded
pupils are more formally involved

			Column number: 403<a class="bkMark" name="Column403">&#160;</a>
                           </div>throughout the exclusions process through being able to make
representations, to appeal and to have access to information. I have
some sympathy for the principle that the pupil’s views should be
heard during the process, and I thought that the debate was very
interesting and informed. However, I still believe that the amendment
would not be the most appropriate way to achieve that. I want to
clarify that we are talking about pupils under the age of 18. Pupils
over the age of 18 already have the same rights as parents in terms of
making representations to the governing body and appealing to an
appeals panel. We will ensure that pupils who are 18 have similar
rights to apply to a review panel for a review, and the
regulation-making powers in the clause will do just that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000231">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I believe
that sufficient safeguards are already in place to ensure that pupils
under 18 are consulted and able to participate in the exclusion
process. The Department’s current guidance on exclusions gives
significant weight to pupils’ participation, and where
appropriate, it encourages pupils to participate at all stages of the
exclusions process, subject to their age and understanding. For
example, before excluding a pupil, the head teacher should inform them
of the reason for the intended exclusion—and, if it is for a
fixed period, the length of that exclusion—and give that pupil a
chance to have their say.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000232">&#160;</a>

                        <p>I
should perhaps highlight the use of the verb “encouraged”
in the two sections that I have quoted. We want schools actively to
seek the views of the pupil who is being excluded. That guidance will
need to be revised in the light of the changes proposed in this Bill,
but we will retain messages of that sort and the use of the word
“encouraged.” It is not a matter of tolerating young
people’s participation; their participation should actively be
sought wherever appropriate, and I agree with the way the that previous
Administration crafted that guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000235">&#160;</a>

pupil’s parent to have the right to make representations or
apply for a review. Parents are the guardians of their
children’s interests. They have legal responsibilities for their
children in school, including ensuring their attendance, and they
should decide whether or not to make representations or seek a

prepared to look into how such an approach could work because I
understand the point being made. In the special educational needs and
disability Green Paper, “Support and Aspiration”, which
was published last week and to which we have all referred many times,
we describe plans to run pilots in two or three areas within which
children would have a right of appeal to the first-tier tribunal, the
SENDIST, for all tribunal hearings. The pilots will test whether the
right to appeal is something that children would use, the best way to
handle those appeals and the cost implications of such a change. We can
learn from those pilots and that can inform our future policies in
other areas, such as review panels. If that works well, it could in
time be extended to other regions and possibly to other areas of
education practice. I am not making any commitments in the course of
the debate—because of the need to modify primary legislation,
the trials for the first-tier tribunals cannot begin until 2012-13 at
the earliest.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000241">&#160;</a>

us to be flexible in the longer term. The regulation-making powers
contained here would allow us to place requirements on governing bodies
and/or review panels were we to wish to do so at a later stage. I am
not persuaded that we should extend formal rights to pupils on that
question. We will keep, in future versions of guidance, our expectation
that a pupil’s voice should be heard, but the legal right to
make formal representations, or seek a review, should remain with the
parent.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000242">&#160;</a>

possible in regulation at a later date, if the Government were so

                           </span> The Minister is going a
long way to reassuring people who may read our deliberations later on
about the Government’s intention in that regard. I cast my mind
back to my time in sixth form. One of my friends had been in the care
system in a local authority in another part of the country. He moved
down to Cornwall with foster parents and then left their care at 16. He
ended up living on his own, independently, in a mobile home while he
was taking his A-levels—an example similar to one mentioned by
the hon. Member for Cardiff West. He was absolutely fine and was given
support by friends. The care system let him down and I think the local
authorities let him down, but he went through. If, however, he had had
a breakdown in his relationship with a member of staff that had led to
these sorts of proceedings, would that be an example that the Minister
would consider in his deliberations on the guidelines that the
Government may issue? Someone like that, who did not have a parent or
local authority acting for them, might then have the ability to trigger
a review. Is that something that he might consider in
future?<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000245">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend raises an important point. I will
consider that issue, which was also raised by the hon. Member for

                           </strong> This has been a helpful debate that has explored the
important issues. I welcome the spirit in which the Minister has
responded to the debate and I welcome the fact that he confirmed that
he wants to continue with the involvement of young people, as is
currently in guidance, when the guidance is revised. I urge him to
consider further whether this might be a time to consider lowering the
age, as he himself has identified. There are other provisions in which
16 is the appropriate age and, given the number of situations where one
can make decisions at 16, now might be the time to decide this as well.
I am perfectly satisfied, however, that the Minister has understood all
the points we have made and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000248">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>Amendment 37 seeks to clarify the range,
funding and use of the fine, or the “financial
adjustment” or “financial penalty”—whatever
we are going to call it; I think it is a fine—that a school will
be required to pay should the review panel consider, in the light of
the principles applicable on an application for judicial review, that
the decision of the responsible body was flawed. The amendment also
probes when such an adjustment may be
ordered.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has given us some idea of the range and size of the possible
fine. Organisations such as the Alliance for Inclusive Education have
told us of their concerns. The alliance says that the
clause<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“gives

to exclude the pupil and face a reduction in school budget than to
provide for the pupil’s needs within the

                        <p class="hs_brev">“this
may have a knock-on effect upon other children’s support, which
may increase their likelihood of being excluded in the

                        </p>
                        <p>We
therefore need an assurance from the Minister that schools will not be
able to use funding intended for other purposes, such as that allocated
to a school for special education needs, to pay any such fine and, as
we heard earlier, we also need more clarity about what will 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 407<a class="bkMark" name="Column407">&#160;</a>
                           </div>happen with the pupil premium. I seek assurances that the payment of
fines will not be detrimental to disadvantaged children or those with
special educational
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister confirm that it is the local authority that will receive
the fine, and explain what will happen to the money when it gets there?
Do the Government intend there to be any limits on what the recipient
of the fine can do with the money? Do they intend that it should bear a
direct relationship to the funding of the education of the excluded
pupil?<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
my concern is that the Bill gives schools legal powers to act
unreasonably, as long as they pay the fine. It says that when the
review
panel<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“considers
that the decision of the responsible body was flawed when considered in
the light of the principles applicable on an application for judicial
review”,<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000378">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>it
may quash the decision of the responsible body and direct it to
reconsider the matter. The panel may also order an adjustment of the
school’s budget share for a funding period. Alternatively, in
plain English, the Bill says that where a review panel finds that the
decision was unreasonable the school does not have to change its
decision and instead can get away with paying a fine. Meanwhile, the
child who was found by the review panel to have been excluded by means
of a flawed decision remains excluded. The Bill is introducing a funny
kind of
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is intended to clarify several different aspects of the
implementation and impact of the proposed fine, and to probe whether it
was the Minister’s intention to give school head teachers and
governing bodies the legal right to act unreasonably as long as they
are prepared to pay to do so. Most teachers probably tell their pupils
that to act unreasonably is irresponsible, and that is probably right.
In the Bill, the head teacher and the governors are referred to as
“the responsible body”. So what the clause is doing is
allowing “the responsible body” to act irresponsibly.
That seems to be the Minister’s intention, albeit with the
consequence that the head teacher and governors may have to pay a fine,
which of course the Minister is not allowed to call a fine. He has to
use the term “financial penalty”, even though the
Chambers dictionary defines a fine
as:<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“an
amount of money to be paid as a
penalty”.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000379">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>So
we have probably skewered that argument—it is a fine. A
“fine” and a “financial penalty” are one
and the same thing. Unless the Minister can give me an example of where
a “financial penalty” is not a fine and can explain the
difference between a “fine” and a “financial
penalty”, we should just settle on that nomenclature of
“fine” for the remainder of our deliberations on the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000285">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There may not be universal assent for that
opinion, including from my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool who is
speaking from a sedentary position, but I never find the Minister to be
in any way ridiculous or bizarre. I understand where he is coming from
and what his intention is. As I have said at various stages of our
deliberations, I am keen that we promote a consensus on the need for
good behaviour and good discipline in our schools, and on the
requirements for that good behaviour and discipline.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, I am
trying to avoid a situation in which we make bad law, which I think is
what my hon. Friend the Member for Preston is getting at, and end up
regretting that bad law in years to come because of the potential
consequences in terms of legal challenges and so on. The analogy that
the Minister drew is not entirely appropriate. The point that he was
making was that the criminal would not have to return the television
set if they stole it even though they had been found guilty of a
criminal offence. We are not talking about a criminal offence here,
obviously. We are talking about the finding, after careful
consideration, of a review panel that a school had acted unreasonably
in excluding a pupil. However, the consequence of the panel
establishing that the school had acted unreasonably, quashing the
original decision and recommending reinstatement of the pupil will be
that the head teacher and governors are free to reject the
panel’s reasonable finding, which was based on the same
principles as judicial review. That is a peculiar and novel innovation
in the Bill and therefore I am sure that it will be the subject of more
discussion as we go through the parliamentary
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000290">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
38 would enable the review panel to make a recommendation about
arrangements for the future education provision of the excluded child.
In tabling the amendment, we seek to probe the Minister’s
policies on the future education of a child once he or she has been
excluded. The amendment complements amendment 30, which follows, in
seeking to probe the Government’s intentions around a new
approach to managing exclusions, whereby schools will be held
accountable for the pupils they
exclude.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000291">&#160;</a>

ask the Minister what he intends to happen when children are excluded
from schools, including how suitable alternative provision will be
ensured, and by whom. Does he intend that pupils who are excluded from
schools should be automatically sent to pupil referral units—I
believe that he said earlier that that was not the case, but that seems
to be the approach that is envisaged in some of the language in the
Bill—or that serious arrangements will be made to ensure that,
where appropriate, they can be found a place in another mainstream
school? If he intends that arrangements will be made to secure an
excluded pupil a place at another mainstream school, what arrangements
will be made? Which body will make such arrangements should clause 6,
which comes later, stand part of the Bill? In summary, the amendment is
intended to probe the Government’s intentions on future
provision for a pupil who is excluded.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000292">&#160;</a>

when I saw Simon and Garfunkel in concert. Art Garfunkel said that the

to call the group Garfunkel and Simon, and Paul Simon’s riposte
was that he should do so. I say to the hon. Gentleman that if he wants
to call this a fine, he should do so, but it is a penalty. In fact, the

reassure hon. Members that I gave full consideration to the possibility
that a budget adjustment might be set to cover the additional costs
incurred by the new school or provider of meeting the excluded
child’s needs, but there are difficulties with that approach. It
would require the independent review panel either to meet a second time
to assess the child’s needs and the costs of meeting them and
set out how and when the financial penalty would be used, or to go
through that cost-assessment exercise before the governing body
reconsidered the case, which would be a waste of resource if the
governing body decided on reconsideration to reinstate the child. That
process would be more bureaucratic and time-consuming than the current
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000303">&#160;</a>

would also have to cap the sum. If not, a school that wrongfully
excluded a year 7 pupil could find itself committed to funding up to
five years’ support, and there would be no incentive for the
local authority or the new provider to seek value for money, as the
excluding school would have an open-ended commitment. The system would
also need a complex accountability mechanism to ensure that the money
was spent on an individual child or on support from which he or she
directly benefited. We wanted an approach that was fair and

                           </strong> That will be a matter for the local authority. The
money will go to the local authority, and it will be up to the local
authority to disburse it as it sees fit. If the local authority wants a
bit of it back to pass on to the new school, that will be up to the
local authority in discussions with the schools. The hon. Lady is
trying to predict all kinds of future circumstances. Again, it will be

                        <p class="tabbed">Separately
from the financial penalty, the age-weighted pupil unit funding sum
will continue to be transferred with every excluded pupil. I should
also address the position regarding the pupil premium, which came up
during a previous sitting. The intention is that from 2012-13, in all
cases of permanent exclusion, the age-weighted pupil unit funding and
the pupil premium figure, if relevant to the child, will transfer to
the receiving school, as schools accepting excluded pupils need funds
to educate those pupils. If a financial penalty is set by the panel and
the budget share of a school is reduced, it is for the school to decide
what adjustments it makes to its planned spending. The hon. Member for
Cardiff West asked what happens to it and wanted to be sure that the
school would not be able to use other funding to pay the fine. Head
teachers are best placed to make decisions about that and we would not,
therefore, want to prescribe how they manage it. An important
exception, however, is any special educational needs funding that
follows a statement. It cannot be used as a result of a reduction in
the school’s budget share. The pupil premium is a separate grant
and is not part of the school’s budget share. As such, the
financial penalty cannot be taken from any pupil premium that the
school has
received.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
must remember that governing bodies will be well aware that, if their
decision is quashed by a review panel, they could become involved in
the time-consuming, lengthy and costly process of judicial review if
they decide not to reinstate a pupil. Importantly, however, I believe
that it is right that they have the final decision on the matter. For
the same reason, I do not think that heads will exclude unfairly if
they have calculated that they are prepared to pay the price. We trust
head teachers to use exclusion as a last
resort.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand the sentiments behind amendment 38. It is, of course,
extremely important for excluded pupils to pursue their education and
have the opportunity to secure meaningful qualifications. Arrangements
for the education of permanently excluded pupils are already covered in
legislation. That is why it is important to diversify the alternative
provision sector—schools and local authorities need a wide range
of good provision from which to choose in order to meet their
pupils’ needs. We will use the planned trials of our new
approach to exclusion to inform future legislation, which I will
discuss in more detail when I speak to amendment 30 in a moment.
Therefore, I do not think it would be sensible at this time to change
the existing duties on schools and local authorities to provide
alternative provision after the sixth day of an exclusion. I therefore
ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment to a vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000314">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 30
points in a direction that we may well wish to take, but we believe
that it would be premature to legislate at this stage. We said in last
year’s White Paper that we would want schools to take
responsibility for the alternative provision for and the attainments of
pupils whom they excluded. Head teachers must retain the authority to
exclude pupils whose behaviour is violent, threatening or persistently
disruptive. We do not want review panels to undermine the authority of
heads by ordering the reinstatement of pupils. We want to balance that
authority with clear responsibility for both the quality of education
that excluded pupils receive and what they achieve in that alternative
education.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Schools
would be free to exclude pupils, but would be responsible for finding
and funding alternative provision for them. Schools could work with
other schools or buy places from the local authority, colleges or the
voluntary sector. Some of the funding currently retained by local
authorities for alternative provision would be delegated to schools for
that purpose. One of the issues that we need to investigate in the
trial is the proportion of funding to be delegated—if
authorities are to retain responsibility for alternative
provision—and how it can be most fairly allocated. I believe
that schools may wish to invest much of that funding in early
intervention to tackle poor behaviour before exclusion becomes
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000316">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the approach that we set out in our White Paper, but discussions
with head teachers have convinced us that we should not rush into
legislation on this. A number of practical issues need to be identified
and tackled in relation to, for example, funding, the availability of
suitable provision, transition from primary to secondary, and perverse
incentives that might dissuade schools from accepting pupils who might
be difficult or challenging. More than 50 local authorities have
expressed an interest in taking part, which should enable us to
identify and work through all the relevant issues with 10 or 12 of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000317">&#160;</a>

think it is fair that I do the same. He kindly said that I should call
it whatever I want and told the story of Garfunkel and Simon. In years
to come, we may still disagree about exactly what we should call this
final financial penalty. It is rather like another duo, Eric Sykes and
Bob Monkhouse, who did not speak to each other for 40 years. When they
finally found themselves in a television studio make-up room, Bob
Monkhouse turned to Eric Sykes and said, “We haven’t
talked to each other for 40 years. Can you remember what the original
argument was about?” Eric Sykes replied, “No, but
it’s too late to change now.” I think that we have
reached that stage with the fine or financial penalty.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000319">&#160;</a>

model—is essential to creating the additional capacity to
innovate, which lies at the heart of the academy programme. I shall
deal with matters briefly. I am happy to confirm that we intend to
apply the provisions and regulations to academy schools, and that is
what the hon. Member for Cardiff West wishes to determine. It is clear
that they must have arrangements that mirror those for maintained
schools and that they will also be subject to financial penalties that
the review panel may impose on a school. I want to be absolutely
categorical about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman will press me on why, in that case, the Bill uses the
word “may”, rather than the word “must”. As
he mentioned earlier in our scrutiny, that is something that we often
debate when considering a Bill so closely, with the kind of vigour and
diligence that is personified by the members of the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
word “may” is used not to offer a way out to academies or
to exempt them from the financial penalties, as I have already said,
but to allow us to deal with the complexities of legislation that may
arise, particularly as we are establishing new categories of academy
elsewhere in the Bill. The application of existing legislation to those
new categories will be a complex matter, involving the law on schools,
academies and pupil referral
units.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
that is rather technical, we have been advised that using
“must” here would commit us to making regulations on
academies or the description of academy for all our provisions,
including what is in the Bill and what will be in the regulations made
under the clause. We were advised that it would not be appropriate to
take that kind of inflexible approach. We prefer the flexibility
provided by the clause as drafted, while committing to make regulations
to ensure that academies are subject to provisions equivalent to those
for maintained schools. That will be a reasonably complicated area in
applying and disapplying legislation on academies. Regulations under
the clause have not yet been
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
“may” in the wording of the clause, which amendment 31
seeks to change, will allow us to deal with any technical issue that
may arise in the taking the proposal forward, in how the provisions
will apply to academies. For the same reason, we need to distinguish
the new types of academies by including “a description”
of academies, which amendment 32 seeks to remove. For example, while
arrangements for academies mirror those for maintained schools, the new
categories of 16-to-19 and alternative provision academies, to be
established under clause 51, which we will debate in due course, might
be in a different position because of the students they deal with.
Therefore, the procedures and penalties may need to be different in
turn and in kind.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I reassure
the Committee again that we will make regulations as needed to ensure
that all relevant provisions are applied to all categories of academy
wherever appropriate. There is certainly no intention to exempt
academies from the provisions. With those reassurances, delivered
in—I think—a record short time, I urge the hon. Gentleman
to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11031620000336">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It may be a record for the Minister, but I do not
think that it is a world record for delivering a speech in Committee.
However, I congratulate him on

                        <p class="tabbed">I take it
from the Minister’s comments that the word
“academies” is insufficient to describe the new forms of
academy that are in the Bill and that the phrase “description of
academy”—I can see nods from knowledgeable sources close
to us—relates to the new forms of academy. That explains the
point that I was trying to tease out from him in the amendment. He has
pleaded for mercy on the “may” and “must”
question because of the complexity of the issue, and I am prepared to
give him the benefit of the doubt given that he gave us a categorical
assurance that the Government intend to ensure that the provisions
apply to all forms of academy, but that he wants to have
