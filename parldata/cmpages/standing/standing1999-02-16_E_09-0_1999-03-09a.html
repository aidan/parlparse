<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I wonder whether you have had any indication from the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope), who is sadly not in his place at present, that he intends to withdraw from the Committee in the light of reports at the weekend, notably in The Mail on Sunday, that a sex discrimination case may be brought against him at an industrial tribunal next month by his former secretary. I refer to the matter because it is most important to know whether, in the light of that incident, the hon. Gentleman judges it wise to withdraw from the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has made his point. Membership of the Committee is a matter for the Committee of Selection. It is, of course, up to Members themselves to declare anything that they may think relevant to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I am most grateful to you for your guidance, because you are obviously an authority on such matters. I wish to establish whether it is in order to describe another Member of the House as a hitherto obscure piece of parliamentary plankton. I, being customarily polite in my dealings with other Members of the House, did not refer to the hon. Gentleman in those terms&#151;but Black Dog in last Sunday's edition of The Mail on Sunday did.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a noval piece of parliamentary description, but it is not a point of order. Indeed, I do not think that calling someone plankton is unparliamentary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Further to that point of order, Mr Atkinson. While the Minister is gathering strength for the substantive debate, and following what my hon. Friend said, I am concerned that we do not add to a sex discrimination matter a possible size discrimination, because it may involve more than one member of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If we could talk about the Employment Relations Bill, it would be good news all round.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Unfair dismissal of striking workers</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I want to give a detailed response to the amendments and to the substantive points that have been made, many of which were in support of the points made by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). I shall also respond to specific points raised by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) and others.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry, in his customary fashion, engaged in a bit of knockabout. As he was speaking, I noted that he might find a new career in theatre&#151;perhaps in writing scripts. First, he accused me of being a carnivore. I have watched ``Jurassic Park'' and I quite liked the young raptor. That description did not work, however, so the hon. Gentleman turned to Father Christmas and whether, in political terms, I was a good fairy or a bad fairy&#151;or just a fairy. He then spoke about Red Robbo, the Greek gods and Spanish practices. ``Kavanagh QC'' was mentioned, and he offered to join forces with me in a new legal company called Sue, Grabbit and Runne. He then talked about U-turns.
<P>
When it came down to it, however, the hon. Gentleman had nothing new to say about the way forward or about the new era of employment relations in the United Kingdom. It was all a cover for the same tired stories&#151;the Conservatives still prepared to support bad practice rather than good practice, resulting in an imbalance in the workplace between employer and employee, even giving employers who acted unfairly the benefit of the doubt if employees had been sacked and lost their occupations.
<P>
Most of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry were concerned with probing the Government. Others went to the heart of the issue. There is nothing wrong with that, because Opposition Members are opposed to the new clause and the new schedule. The hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) referred to consolidation. It took the previous Government 13 years&#151;from 1979 to 1992&#151;to consolidate the employment legislation that they had introduced.
<P>
Ussing that time as an average, it may be 2010 before we return to Committee to consolidate Labour's measures. Whether the hon. Member for South Dorset will be retired by them or whether his present electorate will have grown tired of him, I am not sure. However, he made a pertinent point about Parliament finding the time to consolidate legislation, making it more user-friendly. I agree in principle with that concept.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) talked eloquently, in her usual fashion, about conciliation and partnership and about ridding ourselves of macho-style management. In the 1980s, in particular, and the early 1990s, such management bedevilled employment relations in the United Kingdom. Thank goodness, throughout the country came a sea change in how management perceive themselves and the relationship with their work force. That is why good practice is spreading throughout the United Kingdom. It is not spreading quickly enough, but the Bill will assist that process. In developing minimum standards alongside best practice, we shall see a different style of management and response to workers at the end of this decade than we did at the end of the previous decade.
<P>
Amendments (a) and (b), tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry, deal with selective dismissal. Naturally, we shall be inviting the Committee to resist them, but that will be at a later stage. If it were not for the insertion of the proposed new subsection (2B) into the existing section 238 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, the proposed new section 238A would not work because all the conditions in section 238 would apply to proposed new section 238A. In effect, the new entitlements contained in proposed new section 238A would apply only when employees had been selectively dismissed or selectively re-engaged. That is an attack on the heart of the concept of the new clause and the new schedule.
<P>
Employees would, therefore, be completely free to dismiss employees en bloc. There would be no automatic period for those workers when dismissal was unfair. For them, there would be no incentive for the employer to negotiate a settlement to a dispute. By tabling the amendments, the hon. Member for Daventry showed the true colours of the Conservative party. It would sit on its hands, permit mass sackings and say, ``Just sack 'em all, and the law won't touch you.'' That is an appalling concept.
<P>
Despite all the rhetoric about partnership and not having unfair dismissals, at the heart of the amendment is a complete defence for the employer. From the moment a worker takes part in an industrial dispute, he can be sacked with impunity as long as all the workers are sacked. That does not represent decent standards at work. It would encourage the worst possible behaviour by employers and would perpetrate an anomalous arrangement under which there were some rights when sackings were selective, but none where they were general.

<P>

<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): The Minister referred broadly to the current legal situation. Will he share with the Committee his view on the percentage of instances in which the entire work force is dismissed in such circumstances? It is a tiny percentage and to suggest that such cases would be rife as a result of the amendment is inaccurate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is precisely in those cases that such disputes drag on. When no dismissal takes place, the incentive is to end the dispute early because there is not the animosity between the employer and the employees. That is why disputes overwhelmingly end in a matter of days. When the employer sacks the employees the day that a dispute starts, or a few days thereafter, strikes last for not just weeks or months, but longer, as with Critchley Labels, where the dispute has lasted two years and is still continuing. The purpose of our proposals is to get away from such industrial action and disputes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I did not seek to intervene earlier because I was waiting for the second part of the Minister's response on amendment (b). However, does he concede that if an employer were to go through the hoops of the protected period&#151;which would be difficult, as we have explained&#151;he could dismiss employees on the day after the expiry of that period, when the initial circumstances of the dismissal might be forgotten, making it even more difficult to resolve the dispute?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, because during the eight-week period, it will be incumbent on the employer, and on the union, to use their good offices to conciliate and attempt to resolve the dispute. If that did not happen at the end of eight weeks, the employer could dismiss the employees, but they could take their case to an employment tribunal, which would determine the fairness of the dismissal.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): Will my hon. Friend confirm that 49 per cent. of stoppages are resolved on the first day and that fewer than 1 per cent. last more than eight weeks? The lack of dismissal proceedings is a crucial part of the resolution of those disputes. The new clause will deal with the problem of the small minority of employers who use the tactic of sacking their workers to sort out a dispute and then re-engage them or engage other staff. It will encourage reconciliation and settlement, but discourage dismissals, which only escalate the enimity between the two sides.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> My hon. friend is right. Of course, the employer could exit the eight-week period in eight seconds or eight minutes. The purpose of the proposal is to give employers an opportunity to sit down with the employees' representatives and reach a resolution that does not involve dismissal, unfair or otherwise.
<P>
The rights under section 238 of the 1992 Act will apply when the employer has complied with proposed new section 238A, but still dismisses or re-engages employees selectively. In those circumstances, employees can still apply to a tribunal to determine whether they have been dismissed unfairly, even though the employer has taken all reasonable steps to resolve the dispute. That will ensure that employers do not victimise union activists or strike leaders. It is a sensible additional protection. At the end of the eight-week period, an employer who sought to resolve the dispute reasonably might take individual action against those involved in the dispute. That cannot be fair, and it is why we have included the proposal.
<P>
Amendment (b) would render section 238 ineffective. Under the current law, those selectively dismissed for taking unofficial action cannot apply to a tribunal to determine whether they have been dismissed unfairly. I wonder who the hon. Member for Daventry thinks could benefit from the amendment. He might as well have come clean and sought to delete section 238 altogether&#151;that would be the effect of the amendment.
<P>
The proposed new section 238A provides some protection against being dismissed for taking unofficial action, but, as I have explained, cannot cover all cases of victimisation. However, where it cannot, section 238 can be invoked to provide the necessary protection and, therefore, has an important role to play.
<P>
No protection against unfair dismissal will be provided in unofficial actions, even if an employer selectively dismisses or selectively re-engages the employees. In cases of protected action, however, two protections for employees will be provided, first, under proposed new section 238A if dismissed in the first eight weeks or if the employer fails to take all reasonable steps; and, secondly, under section 238 if selectively dismissed after eight weeks and the employer has taken all reasonable steps.
<P>
In theory, the employee is also protected under section 238 if selectively dismissed in cases of other official action such as when a union declares a dispute or strike official but has not followed all the legislative requirements that give it protection. Amendment (b) would remove that protective role and open the way for selective victimisation of individuals. We therefore oppose it.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is terribly important to understand what is in the Minister's mind and in his proposals. I understood him to say that protection would be extended to unions that had deemed action to be official: even if that action had not quite followed the procedures, the benefits of protection against selective dismissal would be available to employees. Did he say that, or did I mishear.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> In theory, that is so, but in practice, unions in such circumstances would abandon or not precipitate the action, because there is no advantage in being outside the legal mechanisms and placing employees outside the protection of section 238 and proposed new section 238A. In theory, they could ask for protection under that section. It is important that the amendment is rejected, because it would remove that protective role.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To return to the substantive point behind the amendment, which was to probe the Government's intentions in relation to common-law dismissals, as I construe what the Minister said&#151;although I may be wrong&#151;the rights extended under the provision to a protected period override the common law, so there would be no possibility of a fair common-law dismissal in that period. Will he confirm that that is what he proposes?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I are not lawyers, and a little legal knowledge is dangerous. Existing law places parameters on common law. An employer may selectively dismiss or selectively re-engage. That leaves a major loophole in existing law, whereby if an employer dismisses all the work force, none of his employees have protection. We are therefore extending that protection to all the work force. In addition, we are providing a framework for the resolution of the dispute. We are synchronising the principle of improving the law and the balance of arrangements in law.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West referred to the health warning, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If you take part in a strike or other industrial action, you may be in breach of your contract of employment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The warning is worded in a way that will remain accurate after the Bill is enacted. However, we note his points, and shall consider whether the health warning contained in section 229 should be amended in the light of the new protections that we are introducing. The health warning must be accurate under the law as it will be, and not only as it stands.
<P>
Amendment (c) would shorten the automatic period to four weeks. Our proposals are designed to stop employers dismissing workers soon after action has begun, and to encourage the negotiated settlement of disputes. We want to set a period that allows reasonable time for the parties to resolve their dispute and therefore avoid dismissals. In out judgment, eight weeks will allow sufficient time for detailed and serious discussions to take place, possible involving third parties such as the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
<P>
A period of four weeks&#151;the proposal of the hon. Member for Daventry&#151;is too short to allow sensible negotiations in the more difficult cases. Obviously, we hope that disputes will be settled within a shorter period&#151;our proposals do not discourage that; indeed, they encourage it&#151;but it is not our intention to put pressure on the parties to reach agreement within a period when that is simply not possible.
<P>
Our proposals give employees a right to claim unfair dismissal if they are dismissed after the eight-week period, and if the employer has failed to engage in reasonable procedural steps to try to resolve the dispute. Amendment (c) would put that aspect of our proposals into effect sooner, after just four weeks. In practice, employers and unions would therefore be placed under extreme pressure to complete all reasonable procedural steps within that four week period; that is simply too short a period. A period of eight weeks is much more sensible; while putting some pressure on both parties, it would also provide them with sufficient opportunity to hold constructive negotiations and to explore thoroughly all avenues that might lead to a resolution. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale West raised the question of small and medium-sized enterprises. For such employers, he proposes that we should set a period shorter than eight weeks, in which dismissals would be automatically unfair. I cannot agree with that. Our new schedule creates an important employment right, which should apply to all workers and to all employers in the same way&#151;not more to some than to others.
<P>
Our measures will encourage the negotiated settlement of disputes. Negotiation is to be recommended for large and small employers and our proposal ties in closely with the right to accompaniment&#151;a right that will also apply to employers of all sizes and which will encourage negotiation.
<P>
Small companies stand to gain from our proposals. Instant dismissals are often a recipe for prolonged disputes, as we have seen in small companies such as Critchley Labels.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon Central): Does my hon. Friend agree that there is nowhere a greater awareness of the interrelationship between employees and employer than in small business? The small business culture is such that people employed in it realise their financial destiny is allied to that of their company. We can expect proper dialogue to occur in that sector. Conservative Members' argument that employees of small businesses will try to bankrupt their companies, thereby suicidally jeopardising their own futures, is beyond belief.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his comments, which form part of the family of comments made by my hon. Friends on the urgent need for partnership in the workplace, for each side's rights and responsibilities to be recognised, for both sides to understand each other and for employees' worth to be appreciated.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West raised the spectre of strikers gladly seeing their employers go to the wall. My hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) has dealt with that point, but I repeat that the purpose of the legislation is not to deprive a company of its income or workers of their livelihood. That will not happen. The purpose of the eight-week period is to try to ensure that employees are included in the process of dialogue and that the employer-employee relationship does not break down totally; employees will remain inside a company during a dispute so that it has a greater chance of being resolved. The dynamics of the legislation are opposite to what the hon. Gentleman said they were.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the valid question of why we set a period of eight weeks for the time after dismissal, not after the ballot. Clause 5 proposes that the period of a ballot's effectiveness should, if both parties agree, be extended from four to eight weeks. That change is critically important. We would all want the period between a ballot and the legal start of an industrial dispute used to ensure that a dispute never starts. That is why we propose the extension, by agreement, of that period, which will mean a big gain for employers. If employees agree to extend the period to eight weeks, their rights will still be protected, but they will have significantly longer to conciliate, negotiate, and so on. Employers working in tandem with their employees should be able to use that period far more productively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): An important aspect of any industrial dispute is that the agreement reached is a lasting settlement that has the confidence of everyone involved. Consultation with employees by the trade union and discussions with managers on the employer's side are an important part of the process. Such consultations are just as important as the original ballot on whether to take industrial action. A four-week period would not allow much time for consultation. In many industries, especially when bargaining and distribution units are spread across huge geographical areas&#151;across many countries in some industries, as is recognised in the seafaring industry&#151;that period of consultation is very important. I am worried that four weeks will be too long and may jeopardise the stability of the settlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I think that my hon. Friend meant ``too short'' in his final sentence. He is supporting the Government's position.&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his generous comments, although I am slightly disturbed that I am about to say something to which he has no objection.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Just that narrow point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am pleased to hear about the voluntary extension of the period between the ballot and the commencement of industrial action, but I am intrigued that the Government have chosen a voluntary approach to that aspect of the legislation which, as the Minister says, could be of great benefit to business, when they have taken a mandatory approach in every other aspect of the legislation that could conceivably damage business. Will the Minister please consider a mandatory approach on that issue, making the period longer?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Parties must agree to talk to each other and should have a commonality of interest. That is why we said that it should be by agreement. In the four-week period, employees have the right to take industrial action, but we are suggesting that they give up that right for the purpose of negotiating with their employer. It is only right that that should be by voluntary agreement. The negotiators may say that they need only one more week. They may need not eight but five weeks. At the end of the four weeks, they may be close to an agreement.
<P>
The perversity of the current system is that even if they are so close to an agreement, the union has to protect itself and take industrial action. That is a perverse system, but it is what we get when there is a mandatory four-week period. We are trying to get away from the perversity created by the legislation from the Conservative party. At the end of four weeks, when they are close to an agreement, they can take an extra few days, or an extra week&#151;up to a maximum of eight weeks. Each dispute and relationship is different and our proposal provides a voluntary arrangement to get away from the straitjacket that the only way for a union to proceed is to take industrial action. That is perverse in the extreme and the major intellectual reason for framing the proposal in such a way.
<P>
Amendment (d) deals with intermittent action. The hon. Member for Daventry seeks to ensure that the period when the dismissal is automatically unfair begins on the first day of industrial action, even when the action occurs intermittently during the protected period. Amendment (d) explicitly adds wording to that effect.
<P>
We have no difficulty with the purpose of the amendment. The Bill states expressly that employees will be protected from automatic dismissal for a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``period of eight weeks beginning with the day on which the employee first took part in the industrial action.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whether the action is intermittent or continuous is irrelevant. Even if the action is intermittent, the period of protection from dismissal will begin with the first day of the first bout of action. It will not be extended past the eight weeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> That seems clear and we welcome what the Minister said. Will he confirm that that remains true in respect of intermittent action the reason for which is different on the second occasion?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was just coming to that. I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will see that his amendment is redundant in that the issue is already being dealt with in a clear and specific way.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry and others wanted to know whether a union could add new grievances or new issues to a dispute and still retain the protected status of the action. As the law stands at the moment, the answer is that it depends on the circumstances of the case.
<P>
Action is protected where it has been lawfully organised by the union&#151;observing, for example, the relevant balloting and notice provisions in the existing statute. It is not a requirement of the statute for the union to specify on the ballot paper or elsewhere what the dispute is about. In practice, unions voluntarily provide such information to their members.
<P>
Of course, different issues can be raised as a dispute develops in the normal course of negotiation without changing the fundamental nature of the trade dispute. For example, a dispute about pay can develop into one about manning levels as well, if the employer offers a compromise involving more pay in exchange for different working practices, entailing fewer jobs.
<P>
However, if the union were fundamentally to change the nature of the dispute by raising entirely unconnected issues, questions might indeed arise as to whether the action would be protected. The courts might consider in such circumstances that a different trade dispute had arisen and that a new ballot should be held.
<P>
It might help if I gave an example. If union members took action concerning the sacking of an individual at plant A, it would be unlawful for the union to continue the same action, despite the reinstatement of the individual concerned, on the grounds that the workers now wanted new enhanced rights at plant B.
<P>
Of course, that is a hypothetical case. Unions would be very unwise to behave in that way, and it is interesting to note that may lawyers are aware of no cases in which employers ever questioned whether a new dispute had arisen and a new ballot should therefore be held. Those circumstances simply do not arise in practice. I have no reason to believe that the wording of our new right will create confusion in practice, or lead to a rash of litigation as has been suggested.
<P>
Why would a union run the risk of having immediate court action taken against it? As to the proposed amendments, why should a union risk the protection of its employees against automatic unfair dismissal by taking such action? In practice, as I said, no such cases have arisen and there is no record of litigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): The Minister states that no such action has ever taken place, but that is because there has never been a time limit on a particular trade union right. Yet under the Government's proposals, a trade union might well say, ``We are worried about our people being dismissed. We will send them all back to work but we will then organise another ballot.'' There is no point in doing that at the moment, but there would be under the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. Why would that happen in the eight-week period, during which dismissal will be viewed as automatically unfair? At the end of that period, it will be incumbent on the union, as it will be on the employer, to show at the tribunal that any action was commensurate with good practice under the Act. If the union did not show that, the employer would undoubtedly win a fair dismissal claim and any unfair dismissal claim would significantly fail. There are no grounds whatever to suggest that a union would, in those circumstances, take the action suggested by the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
It is interesting to note that the current law was introduced by the previous Government. They must have made a correct judgment about the matter. As I said earlier, my legal advisers said that since the Conservative Government introduced their proposals, there has been no litigation of the sort that was mentioned. I believe that there will not be a rash of litigation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is being generous in conceding the wisdom of his predecessors. I support the point that he makes on that specific and narrow issue by suggesting that if a union recklessly introduces additional material and thus potentially invalidates the original dispute by creating a new one, disaffected members of the union might have a suit against their officials for withdrawing the protected employment rights, for which the clause provides.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No union will deprive its members of its protection. The hon. Gentleman puts up an Aunt Sally&#151;I have said that about six times. His proposals will not work in the way that he suggests.
<P>
Amendments (e), (f) and (h) deal with reasonable steps. The essential reality of the employer-employee relationship is that the employer dismisses people. He or she makes the decision, and issues the dismissal letter and the P45. Employees do not sack themselves, and unions do not sack their members on behalf of employers.
<P>
In assessing the rights and wrongs of a dismissal, it is essential that the employer's behaviour is examined. The tribunal must, first and foremost, consider whether an employer has acted fairly in the case. We have drafted a schedule, which provides that it is up to an employer who dismisses an employee outside the eight-week period to show that he or she has acted fairly. The complainant must show that the employer has acted unfairly. The test of fairness is whether an employer has taken all reasonable procedural steps to resolve the dispute.
<P>
The amendment would blur the issue and lead to confusion. That does not mean that tribunals cannot or should not take account of the behaviour of other interested parties. They could and should do that. We are providing for assessing whether the employer has acted fairly. The employer does not live in a vacuum.
<P>
Proposed new section 238A of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 explicitly directs tribunals to examine the behaviour of the union when assessing the circumstances of the case. All four factors in subsection (6) mention both the union and the employer. The employer can defend his or her actions by pointing out an unreasonable failure by the union to respond to the overtures that he or she made to resolve the dispute.
<P>
We want to put pressure on both parties to negotiate a settlement and I suspect that the hon. Member for Daventry shares our enthusiasm for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I can confirm that we share that enthusiasm, but I want to ask about a separate issue. The amendments would provide for the individual employee's conduct to be considered. I appreciate that we are discussing an official dispute, but could there be cases in which the employee might have behaved badly, and in which a union would have restrained him from doing so? Might that create a further problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall deal specifically with that later because the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West also raised the matter.
<P>
The amendment specifies that the procedural steps taken by employees should be considered. I do not know what steps the hon. Member for Daventry has in mind. We are considering official industrial disputes that have been organised and run by unions on their members' behalf. The union acts as the representative arm of employees; the union, not individual employees, takes procedural steps. If the employees took over and excluded the union, the dispute would become unofficial and fall outside the Bill's provisions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry may be worried that tribunals might not be able to consider individuals' actions when assessing whether they have been unfairly dismissed during a dispute. For example, he might be worried about violent or intimidatory behaviour towards fellow workers, managers or employees who have been brought in during a dispute. I can reassure him on this point. Violent behaviour towards colleagues invariably represents a fair ground for dismissal, whether employees are at work or on strike. The Government cannot support the amendment when we have already ensured that tribunals can fully take into account the behaviour of unions in assessing whether employers have acted fairly. The reference to the action of individual employees is therefore misplaced.
<P>
I will come back later because that does not cover the point made by the hon. Member for Daventry as it relates explicitly to action in disputes, The hon. Gentleman raised an issue concerning an action before a dispute which may impinge upon a dispute so I shall deal with that separately, in case he is worried.
<P>
The other two amendments are consequential upon the main amendments so I shall make no comment about them. I turn to amendment (k) and legally binding agreements. Our proposals are designed to encourage employers and unions to resolve disputes sensibly. Again, we want to stop the precipitate dismissal of workers and promote the negotiated settlement. That is why we are urging the parties to make use of established dispute resolution procedures and the established collective bargaining agreement to help them end disputes.
<P>
Opposition Members seek to restrict the use of existing dispute resolution procedures to those that are legally binding. Virtually no collective bargaining agreement in this country is legally binding. They are voluntary arrangements and that is why employers and unions on the whole want to continue with voluntary arrangements. The whole purpose of clause 1 and schedule 1 is dispute resolution where those voluntary arrangements cannot apply for whatever reason and the employees are frustrated. It will help to resolve disputes involving collective bargaining and recognition for those purposes.
<P>
Perhaps unwittingly, in trying to make a probing amendment, the hon. Gentleman is placing employers in a position which they would never want to be in. They do not want legally binding agreements; they want voluntary agreements, voluntarily entered into by both sides. We cannot accept an amendment that negates the use of existing dispute resolution procedures. That will serve no purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying matters in a helpful way. Could he consider the situation in which the arrangements are so informal as to be pretty vague? It would presumably ultimately be for the tribunal, if it got to that, to decide whether the procedures were so vague that they could not be properly invoked and that would become one of the facts of the case that would determine whether the employer had acted reasonably.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> In the eight-week period, the party might decide that the dispute resolution mechanisms in their collective agreement were insufficient to resolve the dispute. I mentioned access to ACAS and other methodology in my opening statement, and that would be available. The hon. Gentleman's amendment seeks to exclude all of the voluntary agreements when they are in fact the overwhelming majority of dispute resolution mechanisms in the labour force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Are not the official Opposition mixing up dispute avoidance with dispute resolution?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It that it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> Aye.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> My hon. Friend took me by surprise. I thought that he was going to give me a breather for five minutes. I doubt whether the hon. Member for Daventry is mixing them up, he wants to tie us up in legalism. Where there is a voluntary agreement, he does not want it to be used validly to determine the outcome of a dispute which is nonsense. It belies the reality of what happens in the labour market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that possibly the wrong motive has been attributed to me, uncharacteristically by the hon. Member for Eccles. My primary concern in tabling the amendment is to ensure that in determining the reasonability of the behaviour of either employers or unions, people should not be able to pray in aid an extraordinarily vague understanding, which may not be written down or which may be described as custom and practice, without having good evidence for it. When a court is making an evidential decision, it should have a fairly clear understanding of the agreement that the employer or employee has or has not complied with when trying to resolve the dispute.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a completely different point. I am sure that even where processes are ineffective or badly drafted, the new schedule will boost practice in grievance and disciplinary procedures and in dispute prevention and dispute resolving procedures. I believe that he and I are at one; where there is poor practice, or if processes are inadequate, the Bill will give a boost to all concerned to ensure improvements.
<P>
There can be nothing more effective than a common approach at local company level to solving disputes&#151;or to preventing them; it is critical that the parties should feel that they have ownership of the process. The hon. Member for Daventry's amendment would exclude them from using it. That is not sensible or reasonable. I take it that he tabled the amendment simply to probe our view on the matter.
<P>
Amendment (g) is about negotiating in good faith. Again, we may share a common objective: we, too, want to encourage negotiated settlements. I think that the hon. Member for Daventry concedes the advantage of ensuring that the new protections against unfair dismissal may offer some incentive to the parties to resume negotiations before dismissals.
<P>
We have tried to draft such incentives in a way that is clear, objective and reasonable. The hon. Gentleman, however, wants to add an important caveat to our wording. In effect, he wants the tribunals to judge whether the parties&#151;the employers or the unions&#151;had acted ``in good faith'' when they offered to open or resume negotiations. In reaching a judgment, the tribunals would therefore have to assess the motivations of the parties. It is notoriously difficult to apply a good faith test. That would lead to countless arguments about what may or may not have influenced either party's behaviour, and would inevitably widen the scope for the parties to appeal against the tribunal's decisions.
<P>
Our proposals deal with the sort of problem that the hon. Member for Daventry raised but without resorting to tests of good faith. Under our proposals, the tribunal would be asked to consider whether an employer had taken reasonable steps before dismissing an employee. Whenever a procedural step was proposed, the tribunals would have to consider whether it was reasonable in the circumstances. If an offer was made to resume negotiations, the tribunals would have to judge whether it was reasonable for the employer to make an offer to resume negotiations, or to refuse to accept an offer to negotiate from the union. They could not judge on the facts whether an offer was reasonable.
<P>
For example, an employer might offer to open negotiations on the last day of the eight-week period and sack the work force the next day. The union would have no reasonable chance to respond to the offer, let alone begin the negotiations. Such an offer would be empty and would not represent a reasonable step. That point was made by the Confederation of British Industry and the scenarios painted by the hon. Member for Daventry are catered for in full. The amendment is therefore unnecessary and unworkable.
<P>
Amendment (i) deals with unofficial action. It has been a long-standing feature of trade union law, and the policy of this and previous Governments, to discourage unofficial industrial action. Such action can be particularly damaging to employment relations. It is by nature difficult to control and resolve. The main agency for negotiating a settlement&#151;the union&#151;is absent.
<P>
Under existing law, some protections are given against unfair dismissal if workers are dismissed selectively when taking official industrial action. Those protections do not apply when the action is unofficial. Subsection (4) of section 237 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 describes what would happen if official action became unofficial because the union had repudiated it. The protection against selective dismissal would be withdrawn at the end of the next working day following the repudiation. We have adopted the same time limit in relation to the new protection that the Bill introduces.
<P>
There is no evidence that the existing time limit has caused problems in the past. For example, no one has suggested that the time period is too short for the workers concerned to learn of the repudiation, or that there is insufficient time for them or the employer to adapt their behaviour.
<P>
I am pleased that, in this regard at least, the hon. Member for Daventry, appears anxious to extend the employment rights of striking workers. However, his good intentions are misplaced on this occasion. I cannot support the amendment.
<P>
Amendment (j) relates to reinstatement orders. Tribunals cannot issue reinstatement orders until the strike is over. It would make no sense for them to issue such orders when the employees are unwilling to work. The hon. Member for Daventry and I are agreed on that matter: the question is when the tribunal should be empowered to issue reinstatement orders. We propose that the tribunal could issue such orders from any point after the action has ceased. He wants to put that period back by a week. It is important to remember that these are employees who have been dismissed unfairly. When the strike is over, most will be ready and willing to return to work, so what purpose will be served in delaying their return? We hope that in the majority of cases, employers will voluntarily offer to reinstate the workers following the cessation of action. They will not wait for a tribunal to issue an order of reinstatement when the few cases in which they do not would not impose a further delay in relation to workers' entitlements.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry may argue that employers need time to prepare for the return to work of their employees. However, he should bear in mind that tribunals will not make an order for reinstatement until the industrial action has ended. We are therefore giving employers the duration of the action to make provision for the return of their workers. How much more time do they need? Reasonable employers, having suffered damage to their business operations, will want normal service to be resumed as soon as possible.
<P>
It is up to tribunals and the parties to determine how to deal with these cases. However, tribunals already have the power to delay holding the full hearing until what they regard as a suitable time. Tribunals are prepared to exercise such powers especially when the parties ask for a delay. Tribunals can hear a case and decide whether dismissal was fair or unfair or they can delay ordering the remedy until a later hearing. Tribunals may choose that course when they think that the parties can agree a remedy between themselves. That option may be very attractive to tribunals when considering dismissed strikers, because part of the settlement of the strike may involve reinstatement.
<P>
If tribunals award compensation while the strike is continuing, it might be low. For example, the tribunal can award compensation for loss of earnings between the day of the dismissal and the hearing if the worker was on strike all of that time. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West asked when an employee can be dismissed under normal disciplinary procedures after industrial action has begun. He cites the case for procedures to be invoked before the action is started. In such circumstances, the principal reason for dismissal is unconnected to industrial action. The individual will not be able to claim unfair dismissal just because he or she was taking industrial action at the time. The dismissal would relate to the behaviour of the individual concerned. The tribunal would examine such dismissals in the usual way, judging whether an employer had acted reasonably in the circumstances. 
<P>
I hope that that clarifies the position for the hon. Member for Daventry who, on reflection, might consider withdrawing the amendment so that we can return to the matter at a later stage. I thank the Committee for its forebearance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The debate has been complex and extended. The Minister has had to work hard and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have made helpful and constructive contributions. If it has done nothing else, it has reinforced in my mind the importance of the Standing Committee procedures for teasing out the implications of some points. It is cynical to say that sometimes they do not matter. I readily acknowledge that the Minister has teased out certain points and that his assurances have been most helpful. That is true not only for us, because we are here to raise the issues, but also for the CBI, the Engineering Employers Federation and the Trade Unions who will have to implement the legislation and who are anxious to get things right in practice.
<P>
I have not finally decided which of the amendments we want to pursue on Report. We are still concerned about the length of time although, as the Minister readily conceded, that is a matter of judgment.
<P>
One point that amazingly was not discussed, although it was perhaps implicit in something that the Minister said, and may well have intensified or improved his argument, was the proposed new section 238A(7), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In determining whether an employer has taken those steps no regard shall be had to the merits of the dispute.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I and others are worried that, if tempers are running high, real issues may get dragged in, although I appreciate that such matters would be considered in a tribunal ex post facto rather than in the heat of the moment. It is important that tribunals understand that they are not conducting industrial relations negotiations. Given that there are one or two lawyers on the Labour Benches, I must say that I have always understood that judicial review for Ministers was procedural rather than substantive&#151;although it does not always end up that way and the Minister of State needs to be aware of it.
<P>
The exchanges on the health warning were extraordinarily helpful. The Minister of State was right to say that he will have to consider changes in the health warning and I hope that he will share his deliberations with us on Report or by correspondence. His response was particularly helpful when he ruled out people trying, as an aggravation, to start and stop industrial disputes to extend the protected period into the sunset. His assurance about linked disputes was a little less precise, however. That is perhaps inevitable but, ultimately, a court would have to decide the matter. Perhaps the Minister can reflect whether it would be possible either here or elsewhere to produce better guidance or advice to tribunals deciding how to resolve such matters.
<P>
The Minister of State has been helpful with his detailed responses and we shall reflect on what to do about them. As for the new schedule, it would be fair to say that Conservative Members remain unconvinced of the need for it. We are not clear that the ill is there to remedy. Even though the Minister has given us helpful assurances, we are not certain that the remedy that is proposed, complex as it is, will necessarily even work as he says he intends it to work.
<P>
I was a little nettled&#151;but we need a little knockabout to lighten this place&#151;when the Minister implied that we had nothing new to say. We are not sure that that is a problem and, with respect, our job is to probe the Government on the rationale of their proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend is making that point. I listened intently to the Minister and it struck me as curious that he was effectively appealing to the Conservative Opposition to think up better legislation than the poor version that he has produced for our consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend always makes helpful interventions. Metaphorically, he is my left hand, and we share the moment of anticipation when we will again be able to introduce legislation&#151;if not to the same effect, it will certainly have the same objectives.
<P>
As I said, I was a little nettled by what the Minister of State said, although I forgive him because of his helpfulness in other respects. He sought to caricature the Conservative party as one that enshrined bad practice. That is the last thing that we want to do. We want good and modern industrial relations practice. We do not want employers to behave badly, in a macho way or to fall foul of tribunals, or to go as far as they dare without falling foul of tribunals. We want them to go beyond minimum standards and to achieve the highest standards of conduct.
<P>
It is sometimes not as easy as it may seem. If there is not clarity, there will be disputes, which will be about the lack of clarity rather than substantive issues. I have a sobering analogy in the back of my mind. The then Conservative Government introduced the Industrial Relations Act 1971, which prescribed a statutory cooling-off period. New schedule 1 could be interpreted as imposing a cooling-off period on the ultimate right of an employer to dismiss his labour force. I note that the hon. Member for Eccles is nodding.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the clock happens to be striking, I warn the Committee that the evidence, including that from America, shows that such cooling-off periods do not always work as intended. To remove from employers the right to dismiss their employees, even if that is long-standing principle of common law, even if it is not used often and even if we would wish it to be used only in exceptional cases, is not the same as allowing that right to continue and trying to ensure that it is used only in the most extreme cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> The hon. Gentleman's analysis is that of reciprocity. Both economic partners have a reciprocal responsibility to resolve disputes by agreement as soon as possible, which is to everyone's advantage. However, there is no equity of power. The imbalance of power has been acknowledged during the debate. The power to take strike action on occasion is different from the power to dismiss an employee. The hon. Member for Daventry has acknowledged that employers, who wield more power, can be severely tested.
<P>
The new clause is about dispute resolution. It involves a cooling-off period, as the hon. Gentleman put it, or a back-off method that will allow disputes to be resolved in the most amicable way&#151;without using the extreme of dismissal. That is what the Bill is intended to do, and I welcome it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that that was an interventon. I entirely accept what the hon. Gentleman is driving at. I have no problem with his motives or the exemplary standards that he wants to impose. I am trawling back into my memory to the time&#151;in a sense, it was a scarring past&#151;when the unions and organised labour were not regarded as an entirely benign influence. I regret that very much.
<P>
The trade union movement came into existence to provide exactly the sort of countervailing effect to a powerful employer that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about. I respect that proper use of trade union power. I understand why he is interested in the new clause, but removing the employer's contractual rights would tip the balance.
<P>
These are matters of judgment, and the Minister's remarks have informed and, to an extent, reassured the Committee, but we still have problems with the new clause. As someone once said, a person went to a conference because he was confused and returned still confused, but at a somewhat higher level.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
