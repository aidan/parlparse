                           </strong> The Minister will be surprised to learn that I
do not necessarily agree with him. He made a suggestion to me in
relation to the provision that was being referred to, clause 28(3),
which relates to clause 29. Clause 28(3)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
performing their duty under subsection (1) OFCOM must have regard
to—<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000320">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>Having
looked again at the clause, I believe that it prioritises the financial
needs of the universal service provider over all other stakeholders
whose needs should be considered by the regulator. My understanding is
that that prioritisation is not normal in respect of universal service
obligations. With regard to Ofcom—I see that the Minister who
straddles both camps, the 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the hon.
Member for Wantage (Mr Vaizey), is not in his place—there is no
such prioritisation in the communications industry, for example.
Instead, statute makes consumer interests the priority interest.
According to my understanding of these provisions, the regulator is
required to adapt the level of public services required, depending on
the profitability of the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000021">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to ensure that the hon. Gentleman has read
the provision properly, because it talks about the need for the

economic terms, sustainable. It is not possible to see what else the
phrasing could mean, if it were litigated. It seems to me illogical to
have a universal service obligation tied to a requirement of
profitability. The whole point of the universal service obligation, in
all the utility sectors, is to require the bidder to carry on providing
services that would not be

                           </strong> I am surprised at the Minister for saying that.
There is no suggestion of that. If I am right, his contention this
morning was that my reference to profitability in clause 28(3) was
untrue, because the words used were “financially
sustainable”. I think that that is what he said. My response is
that financially sustainable must mean profitable, because a
non-profitable universal service is not, in economic terms,
sustainable. He shrugs his shoulders. <em>[Interruption.]</em> I am not
sure whether he is confused—I certainly would not want to say
that anyway. He might want to come back to me when he reflects on the
matter, as I have, and I take the further point that he
makes.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision, as it is written, potentially empties the universal service
obligation of any sensible meaning. It means that the regulator is
legally required to provide only services that are profitable, because
“financially sustainable” cannot mean anything but
profitable in economic terms. How can we have a non-financially
sustainable universal service in economic terms? I see that my hon.
Friends the Members for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and for
Kingston upon Hull East are nodding in assent. Running 12,000 post
offices is not profitable. The effect of prioritising the financial
sustainability of the universal service provider will be to increase
the price that a purchaser will pay for Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will explain why that is the case. Let us reflect for a moment on the
bidding process: No. 1, a number of buyers want to buy Royal Mail; No.
2, the statute does not require Royal Mail to maintain post office
numbers or use post office services; No. 3, not maintaining
unprofitable post offices lowers Royal Mail’s operating costs;
No. 4, lowering Royal Mail’s operating costs increases Royal
Mail’s profitability; No. 5, given that those four points hold,
buyers must thereby increase their offers vis-à-vis their
rivals, and I will explain why; No. 6, if a bidder bids too low and its
potential profit is too high, it will effectively allow a rival to buy
Royal Mail. If a bidder bids too high, the cost of the debt taken out
to finance the acquisition will eat into profits, and there is no
reason to buy Royal Mail over any other potential
investment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000034">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yet another flaw in the hon. Gentleman’s
argument is that he seems to suggest, from his economic analysis of
Royal Mail’s fortunes, that Royal Mail’s profit and loss
is fundamentally dependent on its relationship with Post Office Ltd. If
he looks at the revenue flows of a postal administration such as Royal
Mail, he will see that they are—surprisingly enough—from
delivering letters and parcels, and its relationship with the post
office with a retail counters network is not as significant to its
financial fortunes or profitability as the hon. Gentleman makes
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000035">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that intervention. Let
me complete my interpretation of the bid process, leave it on the
record and allow the Minister and others to reflect on it or otherwise.
As I was saying, if a buyer bids too low and its potential profit is
too high, it will effectively allow a rival to buy Royal Mail, but if
it bids too high, the cost of the debt taken out to finance the
acquisition will eat into profits and there is no reason to buy Royal
Mail over any other potential investment. No. 7 is that the bid price
will therefore rise until operating costs, plus the costs of servicing
debt, produce a “normal” level of profit for a potential
buyer. If operating costs are lower, debt costs can be higher, and
competition between bidders will raise the price of Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the Government can thereby raise the sale price of Royal Mail by
refusing to adopt statutory protection for post offices. That is my
interpretation of a bidding process; there may well be others, but I
want to put that on the record for others to reflect on. On that point,
I will sit
down.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000037">&#160;</a>

wishes to have his cake and eat it, because, as my hon. Friends have

are not backed up by clear and specific clauses in

suggest a descriptive analogy for the current clauses in the Bill, the
“Fifteen Ways To Lose Your Mail Services” clauses,
because the Bill contains no less than 15 provisions that will allow
Ofcom to either alter or water down the universal service obligation.
The Government claim that the one-price-goes-anywhere, six-days-a-week
universal service obligation is protected by the Bill in its current
form under a privatised Royal Mail. Indeed, the Secretary of State said
as much in the House on 27 October. If that is the case, why does the
Bill require Ofcom to review the universal service obligation within 18
months? And, as I have mentioned, why does it contain those 15
provisions? Why do the Government continue to refuse to correct the
apparent loopholes in the Bill, which our amendments seek to
do?<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000040">&#160;</a>

that the USO is costly to provide, and we have already heard from my

private mail company has said that it is not economically viable and
needs to change. Therefore, the commercial imperative for a privatised
Royal Mail company would be to seek to reduce the scope of the
universal service obligation or at
least—<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000041">&#160;</a>

privatised Royal Mail company may well look at commercial alternatives,
if this were to be blocked, rightly, by the Government in terms of the
USO being too expensive. After all, a privatised Royal Mail
company’s prime obligation will be to safeguard the profits of
its business and the dividends of its shareholders. What if a
privatised Royal Mail company were ever offered a cheaper alternative
to the post office network? That is not an impossibility. What if a
national retail chain decided to provide such services? We have heard
about many examples of shops, and indeed pubs, providing post office
services, so why not provide services to Royal Mail,
too?<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000044">&#160;</a>

No. In a way, it is like TUPE—fine at the time, but no guarantee

had transferred. It is, therefore, vital that the Government enshrine
in legislation, as we have often heard in the cases in other countries,

because the definition of an access point also includes letterboxes,
and yet we have not heard a single mention of them during the debate.
There are 115,000 letterboxes around the country, part of our great
tradition, and we have not heard a single defence of Royal
Mail’s letterboxes with Her Majesty’s insignia upon them.
I am shocked, frankly, that Her Majesty’s Opposition have failed
to mention the case for letterboxes.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000049">&#160;</a>

problem with the amendments is that many of them are unnecessary. They
would include post office branches in the definition of access points
and place a statutory commitment on Ofcom to include post office
branches as access points. The definition of an access point used in
the Bill should be familiar to hon. Members, because it is drawn from
the definition used in the Postal Services Act 2000 and is identical to
the definition used in the 2009 Postal Services
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me be clear: as drafted, the definition already includes post office
branches. Currently, post office branches are access points through
which Royal Mail satisfies its universal service obligation. That is
because they are

                        <p>The

so much is absolutely unnecessary, and I ask hon. Members not to press
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
74 and 89 seek to oblige Ofcom to include post office branches as
access points. Amendment 78 seeks to include, as a minimum
requirement of the universal service, a number of access points that
must be provided by post office
branches.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
basis of the amendments seems to be Opposition concern about the
long-term sustainability of the post office network. That is in spite
of the Government’s recent announcement on the future of the
post office network and the clear pledge that there will be no further
programme of post office closures, as seen under the previous
Government. That is in spite of the commitment that the network of at
least 11,500 outlets will be maintained throughout this Parliament.
That is in spite of the innovations that will see the network of
outlets open for longer, a reduction in queues and offering access to
new services. That is in spite of the £1.34 billion funding
package, which will enable the Post Office to deliver all
things. That is in spite of the fact that the Government have acted
swiftly to end the cycle of decline that, for years, previous
Governments did so little to arrest. If Opposition Members had done a
rather better job of defending post offices, we might have taken the
amendments seriously. We have a clear policy to deliver and support the
post office network; they do
not.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000057">&#160;</a>

as I have suggested. The post office where my father collects his war

Minister’s answer to the amendments seems to be that this

efficient and, more importantly, economically viable. If we accept that

access points to give reassurance to all

amendments, but I have dealt with amendment 75 and made it clear that

unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is through our measures to protect the post office network, not through
additional layers of regulation, that we will create conditions to
ensure local people continue to see post offices as a natural,
convenient place to access Royal Mail services. Royal Mail will
continue to see the Post Office as its retail partner of choice as long
as that is what its customers want. That was made absolutely clear to
the Committee by the Royal Mail chairman and chief executive. It is by
attracting customers for all types of services that the Post Office
will ensure its future success, and the Government’s support and
funding will help the Post Office to achieve
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments go much further and would impose requirements on Ofcom to
tie the Post Office and Royal Mail together through regulation. When we
debated the inter-business agreement, we had a long discussion about
such matters and I lost the drift of the arguments then, and I am
losing it today. As Conservative Members know, we discussed in relation
to new clauses 3 and 4 why legislation is not the right vehicle for
establishing the terms of trade between two independent
businesses—or any businesses, in fact. We do not need to go
through those arguments again, as I have made them
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
argument that was completely unacknowledged by Opposition Members is
that the Bill will strengthen the current position of access points. We
are enshrining in law that the reasonable needs of users have to be
taken into account when ensuring there are sufficient 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 550<a class="bkMark" name="Column550">&#160;</a>
                           </div>access points. At the moment, that is just in Royal Mail’s
licence, but we will have in the statute that the regulator must take
account of those needs, and I want to say a little more about that
later. Moreover, when making its decisions on that, Ofcom has a wide
range of general duties to which it must have regard—far more
than Postcomm has—so that is an
improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000068">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Sometimes,
it feels as though Opposition Members have not read the Communications
Act 2003. The Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage, who is not in the room
at the moment, is a fantastic Minister and has responsibility for
Ofcom, and I am sure that he has read some of the 2003 Act. He will be
able to refer Opposition Members to the relevant duties that will apply
to Ofcom as it regulates the postal industry. I refer Opposition
Members to section 3(4), which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000069">&#160;</a>

could read out many of the other paragraphs in that subsection, but the
point is that when Ofcom is judging whether there are sufficient access
points, under the Bill there are much more specific and detailed duties
involved in its reassuring itself that it has taken account of consumer
needs, and that is a real strengthening of the current regulatory
framework, which was put in place by the previous Government. The hon.

We put “universal postal service” because that is the
service that we are concerned about. That is what our constituents use
and what small and medium-sized enterprises depend on, and it is
Ofcom’s duty to defend it. That is why we won the argument last

will ensure that the needs of all users of postal services throughout

right measures are in place to ensure a vibrant, ongoing, long-term

previous debate, when we made it absolutely clear that, currently, the
IBA is negotiated not by the Government but between Post Office Ltd and
Royal Mail. It is not an open and public agreement; it is commercial
and it goes into huge detail. I am told it is more than 100 pages. That
is why we resisted the legally dubious proposal from the Opposition
when we debated whether it could be enshrined in statute. It is why,
very interestingly, the chairman of Royal Mail, Donald Brydon, made it
clear in his evidence to the Committee that before privatisation he
would secure the longest possible IBA that was legally permissible. One
would have thought that that would have reassured the hon. Gentleman.
The hon. Lady almost accepted and then rowed back. It is impossible to
put such an agreement into
statute.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000108">&#160;</a>

suggested that we are antipathetic towards the market, but I am only
applying what should be obvious market logic. We will have negotiations

fundamentally, Donald Brydon can say that there will be an IBA, and we
can agree with him. As the Minister has pointed out, however, that
agreement goes to thousands of pages. What is in it—the
stipulations, when it is renegotiable, the terms of the deal? We have
no idea; neither does the Minister. That is the slow-burning fuse that
is at the heart of the

philosophy. The hon. Gentleman and the Labour party seem to believe
that it is the job of Government and Parliament to put complicated
business agreements into legislation. That was not the Labour
party’s view when it was in government—not only in this
area, but in others—and it is certainly not our view. I want to
discuss matters in the Bill—not just the words of Donald

Gentleman has discussed the statutory protections in Germany, Holland
and elsewhere, which he lauded as superior to this country’s
protections. However, unlike Germany or any other country that I looked
at when I asked for some analysis, we have a double protection: we have
the access points, which are regulated by Ofcom on to the universal
service provider; and in addition we have the access criteria, which
relate to Government funding of Post Office Ltd. The
combination of those two protections is extremely powerful. We have the
power of the regulator, and the power of the Government through a legal
contract that relates to the funding that they have provided, which, in
the case of this Government, has been very
generous.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000112">&#160;</a>

apply to the post office network, but if Royal Mail is not obliged to

if Royal Mail were to use the Post Office—obviously, in an
IBA—it could ask for a certain number of outlets; it would not
have to use the whole network. Will the Minister explain how the access
criteria that are relevant to post offices can be put together with the
access points in the Bill, which could be any outlets and any number of
them? The two do not seem to match up.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000114">&#160;</a>

seems that they tabled the amendments to protect the post office
network and I have been making a set of arguments to suggest that those
are unnecessary. I have discussed the funding, the services and
stability, and I am now discussing the access criteria that Post Office
Ltd is legally obliged to meet. In a previous debate I explained how
Post Office Ltd’s access criteria are monitored on a monthly
basis. The criteria are therefore extremely significant and have been
completely downplayed by Opposition Members during this
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000115">&#160;</a>

Mexico, Argentina and elsewhere, he clearly has knowledge of mail

his confidence in the measures that he is taking to improve the post
office network’s viability? It is not that we do not think he is
doing a good job, or that we think he does not have some good ideas;
but when two thirds of the network is economically unviable, as Paula
Vennells said, there needs to be a remarkable turnaround, and we merely
looking for some statutory protection. If the Minister gets it right,
what is the harm? He has protected the network and the statutory
protection is in place if it goes wrong. That is not an unreasonable
position.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000116">&#160;</a>

set of reasons. I started my remarks—astonishingly, the
Opposition have failed even to comment on this point—by saying
that the legislation tightens up the requirements on Ofcom to meet
consumer needs. That is a greater requirement than on Postcomm. The
truth is that consumer needs change over time, so it may well be that
how such things are defined and implemented will have to change. Tim
Brown, the chief executive of Postcomm, made that point in his evidence
to the Committee. I want to come back to comparisons with other postal
networks, but at this point I should move
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Consumer
needs might change in the future, and therefore how the service is
defined and how it is regulated by Ofcom might need to change. For
example, because there has been such an increase in parcels,
particularly due to online retail, one would expect that Royal Mail
will need to invest in changing its production processes to meet that
increasing consumer demand. Equally, one would expect that Ofcom, to
meet its requirement to respond to consumer needs, might have to change
how it considers access points and other obligations set out in the
Bill. One can easily imagine that it might want to think about that in
a much broader way than the Opposition have talked about.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
frustrations for consumers using the postal service is not so much the
question of where they can take a parcel—I have never had a
complaint about that, although I do live in a suburban
constituency—as the fact that people cannot be at home all the
time to receive a delivery. Traditionally, as defined in the European
directive and as reflected in how Opposition Members want to amend the
Bill, the provision of access points takes no account of the point that
consumers want to be sure that they can pick up their parcel if they
were not at home when a delivery was
attempted.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
has been an awful lot of innovation, which we will come on to when we
debate a group of amendments about parcels, but some examples are
germane to the point about Ofcom needing flexibility over how it meets
its obligations to reflect consumer needs on access points and such
matters. In the future, we will see more innovation on how people can
receive a parcel: there will be secure lockers outside homes,
including—I should not advertise—two well-known devices,
the Hippo box and the ParcelPod, that are being used; there is the
Safeplace scheme, which has been introduced by Royal Mail; and several
parcel operators offer a service under which they will text a consumer
about when they expect a parcel to be delivered and the consumer can
phone back to say, “I won’t be in, so can you deliver at
another
time?”<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
we are most aware of is the need for Royal Mail to think in a more
customer-friendly way about how late its depots open, so that people
can collect a parcel that could not be delivered. I am keen on the
notion of using post offices as depots in the future. They can actually
be already, but this is a potential growth market. At the moment,
people can pay £1.50 to pick up a parcel from a local post
office. In considering access points and the way those markets will
deliver, we will have to think differently—in ways that the
Opposition have not thought of, but in ways that Ofcom will be
empowered to think by the Bill. We are trying to future-proof the Bill
and not to set in rigid statute, or by regulation, ideas that in five,
10 or 15 years might be completely the wrong way of protecting the
consumer
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to go back briefly to that point, because I want to put to rest
the issue of legislating. The access points that Ofcom regulates and
the access criteria that the Government funding agreement will uphold
provide a double protection. If we analyse whether the impact of our
access criteria and access points is more effective in ensuring a
viable post office network than in Germany or other countries such as
France—I am using Postcomm material—the evidence suggests
that we have stronger, not weaker,
protections.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000122">&#160;</a>

us look at individual countries, which I have had research on. If we
look at the statutory protections in Germany, which the hon. Gentleman
is so keen on, I am not sure whether he is aware that the protection in
rural areas is for a post office every 80 square kilometres—I am
sorry, but we are not keen on that protection, because it would
undermine the needs of consumers. Our protection, which comes from the
access points and access criteria, is stronger for rural users. Once
again, I am afraid, the hon. Gentleman has shot himself in the foot by
citing Deutsche
Post.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000123">&#160;</a>

makes an interesting point and his colleague, the hon. Member for

the Germans have statutory protection, which we do not. The Minister

at subsection

am sure “gamble” is the right word—for the future
of the post office network comes off, we will be left with Ofcom
bearing down on post office numbers, on the “financially
sustainable” criterion, because at some level
“financially sustainable” must mean profitable, and
certainly it does not mean unprofitable. More importantly, we will be
left with the taxpayer picking up the tab to maintain the post office
network. All we would like to see is, in those circumstances or
otherwise, some statutory protection. Is that too much to

the great things about being a constituency MP is having regular
surgeries. I do not know how many surgeries my colleagues have, but I
have two  a week, one at 8 am every Monday morning at
21 Berrylands road, Surbiton, and the second one on Thursday
or Friday night, or Saturday morning, depending on the week, at
different locations. One makes oneself accessible, with many access
points and open access criteria for one’s constituents. When one
does that, one gets lots of good ideas from constituents, and that is
why I have christened the group the Francois Greeff
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Only
a week last Monday, Francois Greeff came to see me. He had a letter
with him which I am passing on to the chief executive of Royal Mail,
Moya Greene, because it contained four interesting ideas about how we
could cut costs at Royal Mail—he said at the Post Office, but he
meant Royal Mail. That is already worrying the hon. Member for
Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East. Three of the ideas might
be tricky to implement in the UK. Paragraph 3 of the letter
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
America, each house has a post box at the gate, on the perimeter of the
property. The postman never leaves the pavement, except for recorded
deliveries. He covers a far shorter route.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000342">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The suggestion is that
every property in the UK have a postbox at the end of the drive. We are
not going to take up that idea, but I am happy to pass it on to the
chief

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are two other ideas that I am not sure will catch on. One
is:<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“selling

that will raise revenue, and from which a profit can be
made.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We
know that the hon. Gentleman would obviously not want profits to be
made. The third proposal
is:<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“wheels

                        </p>
                        <p>I
think that there would be some serious health and safety issues with
that innovation, so I could not agree to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000136">&#160;</a>

idea that has direct relevance to our debate today about access points
is

into this system means that the entire cost of maintaining the pillar

                        <p>That
is an ingenious idea, and I have discussed it with officials. It would
mean 28 million access points for the collection of mail, which would
be a radical shift. I am afraid, however, that there are a few
practical difficulties, and I therefore do not think that we will
introduce the idea by way of a Government amendment. I suggest,
however, that Francois Greeff shows an ingenuity in thinking about
access points that is sadly lacking in the Labour
party.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is something in my constituent’s suggestion, in the sense that
in rural areas it might well be appropriate for the Royal Mail employee
who delivers letters also to collect parcels. I am not saying that that
is Government policy; Royal Mail operates at arm’s length, of
course, and in due course will be privatised. It shows, however, that
the crux of the debate is that consumer needs change and that we need
our universal service provider, supported by the regulator, to be
responsive to those needs and not be tied up in knots by statutory and
regulatory provisions. The approach that we have put forward is in the
interests of the users of both the post office network and Royal Mail
and I therefore invite hon. Members not to press the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000140">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall try to understand the Minister’s comments. On the one
hand, he is extremely keen to see the maximum number of access points,
even talking about 28 million boxes. I am really surprised that among
all the exciting ideas that he cited he did not mention his friend the
former MP for Montgomeryshire, Lembit Öpik, and the idea of
every postman and woman having a Segway, to roll along the pavement
with and from which to hop off and deliver letters. If anyone does not
know what a Segway is, I am sure that they can google the former MP for
Montgomeryshire, if he can be found behind the Cheeky Girls
somewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000142">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a gap between wanting to ensure that the consumer has all the access
points—something we seem to agree on—and not having in
the Bill any firmer statement than “reasonable needs of
users.” We are told that the great strengthening of the Bill is
the fact that Ofcom has to take note of the reasonable needs of users.
To me, that does not give much of an indication of the number of
necessary access points. It is very dubious indeed whether any
provision would make sure that the access points are well distributed
throughout the country and within a certain distance of peoples’
homes. That is not covered by the Bill. It seems to have nothing to do
with the post offices and the good work that everyone wants put their
way.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
seem to have one mention of the access points, but we have nothing in
the Bill that will make those access points happen. Furthermore, we do
not have anything that will tie the post office in with the Bill. It is
a tremendous lost opportunity because that would be a way forward, and
at one fell stroke would link in the post office network. If it was for
the Royal Mail to use the post office network and access points with a
specified number of outlets, obviously that would give a tremendous
boost to the Post Office. However, the Minister clearly does not wish
to give the Post Office that
reassurance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
does not seem to be the will to make the fine words translate into a
proper guarantee for the Post Office. That is a tremendous
disappointment to the National Federation of SubPostmasters, which said
that it would have liked a 10-year IBA, but cannot see it coming. Our
proposal is a way that it could have had such security for the post
offices in the future. It is a great disappointment for many customers
that, without such a guarantee, a third of post office business could
disappear. It could be difficult for some local post offices to be kept
open and some people could miss
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000145">&#160;</a>

am worried that we have not received a better proposal than that Ofcom
be required to take note of the “reasonable needs of
users”. That is not helpful. It is not good enough. I wish to
return to the topic later in our proceedings, so I shall not press the
amendment or amendments 75, 78 and 89 to a Division. I beg to ask leave

76 is designed to ensure that any universal postal service order is

are not disadvantaged by any changes that Ofcom might make. Why is that
important? I can speak for myself only, but I do not believe that I, or
my constituents in rural areas, should be subject to an inferior level
of service, or to a more expensive one than people who live in other
areas. Without providing for such individuals, we run the risk of
having a universal service that is not

individuals in rural areas should be protected by paragraph (a), those
in urban areas should be protected by paragraph (b). I can probably
hear a few cogs turning as the Minister thinks, “First rural
areas—now urban areas.” The proposal aims to ensure the
protection of the service, and its availability to individuals
throughout the UK. A future review might be focused on, for instance,
business mail, and if that were the case, it would be unacceptable. The
proposals in paragraphs (a) and (b) would also be of great service to
businesses because although business-to-business communication is
important, so is business-to-individual communication.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000158">&#160;</a>

businesses do not necessarily make a judgment about whether to deal
with someone in a particular area based on the quality of the available
communication networks, but they might do so in future. We might see
individuals who are currently disadvantaged because they have poor
access to, say, digital communications networks, becoming even more
disadvantaged by a reduced or more expensive access to the mail
network. That will not happen if the Minister accepts the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000159">&#160;</a>

is a safeguard in reverse to paragraphs (a) and (b)—I
hope that hon. Members are still with me. I am not saying that one
section—public or business—is more important in relation
to any universal postal service order or modification, but the
amendment is all about that—it is about spelling out what is
important in such a consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000160">&#160;</a>

on an earlier amendment, which concerned the inclusion of medium-sized
businesses in clause 11(3), I accepted the Minister’s assurances
that “small” would include up to 250 employees. I shall
do the same in relation to this amendment, however the Minister may
have some work to do, because this subsection does not mention
businesses at all. As ever, I want to help the Minister, but for me to
do so, he must accept that the important interests of small and
medium-sized businesses have not been considered in this part of the
Bill. We have heard how, in future, small and medium-sized businesses
may make up the core of Royal Mail’s business, therefore we must
ensure that their interests are not overlooked in any order or
modification.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000161">&#160;</a>

calls for any order or modification to consider disadvantaged
individuals. The proposal would not make any judgment of whether such
people were disadvantaged and living in a rural area or in an urban
area; it goes one step further to protect all individuals living in all
areas. We want those who are disadvantaged— wherever they
live—to have a status in any order or modification in relation
to clause 29(3). They do not have such a status in the Bill as it is
written. It is important for those disadvantaged individuals to have
additional rights in this situation, and any modification or order that
resulted in their being further disadvantaged would be
unacceptable.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000162">&#160;</a>

mail services and post office services. I understand that the relevance
in this case is to postal service orders, but we know that there is a
dependence and a reliance on post offices and Royal Mail. We must also
recognise that those potentially disadvantaged individuals may be
disadvantaged in a

                           </div>temporary way, so Ofcom would therefore have to ensure that the work it
did in preparation for any order or modification was complex. Surely
that is nothing less than the Minister would
expect.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is very important that disadvantaged individuals, as in paragraph (d),
are not confused with low-income individuals. On occasion, they may be
the same, but often they are not. The amendment would ensure that there
was no confusion and that both sections of the population would have
proper recognition. Low-income individuals would be recognised as
having a dependence on a mail service that does not disadvantage them
because they are low-income
earners.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
paragraph (f), I hope that the Government would always take those with
disabilities into their considerations in a positive way. As written,
the Bill does not do that, but our amendment does. The rights of an
individual with disabilities should be protected in the clause, as
should the rights of those in paragraphs (a) to (g), who I have already
referenced. Disabled individuals have every right to have as full and
as competitive a service as others, but the Bill does not recognise
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause, as amended, would allow individuals and support groups to play
a role in the construction or amendment of any order, to ensure that
they were not disadvantaged by the outcome. The challenges of life with
a disability are severe enough, and it is little to ask of the Minister
to recognise that and take action here and now to ensure that the
impact on disadvantaged individuals of any future action by Ofcom is
fully evaluated, so that individuals are protected in the immediate
future. Of course, if the Minister wants to go further and extend our
amendment from “immediately disadvantage” to
“permanently disadvantage”, my hon. Friends and I would
not object. The amendment, with the inclusion of paragraph (g), would
protect the service experienced by elderly individuals. Some might
argue that I am being selfish here. I know that I am getting on and
that I am not as young as I used to be, but we all have elderly family
members and the argument for them is the same as it is for the others
who are mentioned in the amendment. It is only by considering all the
sectors of the community that are referred to in the amendment that the
Government’s objectives in subsection (3) can be
met.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
admit, once again, that we are pushing the Government a lot further
than they would like to be pushed, but that is because my hon. Friends
and I feel that the clause as it stands is deficient. All sectors of UK
life deserve to be referred to in the clause. They deserve to have
their needs and requirements evaluated and not disadvantaged by any
such order or modification. The amendment does that and the Bill, as is
stands, does not. The amendment is designed to ensure that those living
in rural and urban areas, small and medium-sized businesses,
disadvantaged, disabled and elderly individuals, as well as those on
low incomes, are not disadvantaged by any actions that Ofcom may take
in modifying or making a universal postal order. As I have said, those
groups do not have their specific needs recognised in the Bill. My hon.
Friends and I believe that the Bill should recognise those groups,
which is why we tabled the amendment. I am interested in the
Minister’s response to amendment
76.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000167">&#160;</a>

                           </div>the fulfilment of the obligation. The implications of the new clause
are, arguably, not too dissimilar to the requirement in clause 11,
where a post office company must send the Secretary of State a report
each year on its network of post offices. My hon. Friends and I tried
to strengthen that at that point in our deliberations, but the Minister
would have none of it. When we look at this part of the Bill, there
appears to be nothing that mirrors this requirement on Royal Mail as a
service provider. My hon. Friends and I believe that this is unwise,
because under clause 34 it
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000168">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
such, a report—or reports—becomes even more necessary.
That should not be confused with any role that Ofcom has to play in the

mouths.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000169">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Many
of the requirements in new clause 7 are similar to those in amendment
76, to which I have just spoken. Amendment 76 refers to Ofcom making or
modifying a universal postal service order. When it is approved by the
Committee, new clause 7 will form a relationship between universal
service providers and the Secretary of State, and a relationship
between all universal service providers and, indeed,
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
continue my remarks on new clause 7, such a report would be useful if
there were a single provider, but invaluable if there were multiple
providers. The providers should be able to put in an official report of
their own creation their view on the fulfilment of the universal
service obligation and provide this to the Secretary of State, who must
lay it before
Parliament<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
36 calls upon the universal service provider to publish information
about the extent to which it is providing specified postal services in
accordance with specified standards, and also to publish an
independently audited performance report. We believe that new
clause 7 goes further in some respects, but we would not be
averse to keeping anything in the Bill that was felt to be
superior.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the Bill as drafted, the report that a universal service provider has
to produce does not appear to have to be passed to any specific person.
As a result, it could be argued that there is an opportunity missed
here for the Secretary of State and Parliament to be legally entitled
through powers in the Bill to scrutinise the report. Furthermore, the
report does not seem to be held to any timetable. It does not appear to
be expected annually, as per clause 36. Perhaps the Minister will
explain
why.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 7(2) stipulates the details that must be covered by the report,
and I will go through each of these in a little more detail. Paragraph
(a) states that the report must contain details

                        <p>about
which there was a significant discussion earlier. The range and extent
of the service are important as they empower the reader of the report,
and therefore the Secretary of State and Parliament, with details of
the service being provided, and how the provider views

                           </div>their own efforts to meet with the content of the Bill in relation to
the minimum requirements set out in clause 30. This section
would also require details on the access points. My hon. Friends would
be delighted to see that as it will allow the inter-determination
between the universal service provider and the access points to be
clear. It would allow further scrutiny, and comparisons between such
interdependency and multiple universal service providers, if there were
to be more than one, as the Bill provides
for.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have heard throughout our sittings about the importance of access
points— dare I say post offices?—in relation to Royal
Mail. I do not wish to be criticised by the Minister at this moment in
time, but I will come to something else later. With a third of Post
Office Ltd footfall and revenue coming from mail services, there is an
importance both ways, and it would be useful to monitor it provider by
provider. It could be argued that, whereas post offices are currently
the access points we refer to, there is no guarantee, as we have heard
this morning and early this afternoon, that that would be the case in
future. No doubt the Minister is thinking “here we go
again”, but it is
true.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
the possibility of varying providers comes the possibility of varying
access points. This part of new clause 7 would allow a comparison to be
made not only between providers but also between the added value that
access points deliver to the varying universal service providers and
their universal service provision. Not wanting to be subjected to the
wrath of the Minister, for forgetting about postboxes, we should put on
the record that we also consider postboxes as access points and we
intend them to be so treated in this part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p>It
may be argued that that is already covered in clause 30, but
as that clause has no reporting requirements, it is important and
necessary to include customer service utilisation here. The service
provider will or should have that information, and I would argue that
it needs to have such information. The information should also be
available for consideration by the Secretary of State and
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(2)(c) would ensure that the report contained details of “any
surveys, or studies,” on the use of the universal service. That
would be important for gauging how, how often and to what level
providers are engaging with their customers and markets. Some of the
studies might be published in their own right at different times
throughout the year, but such reports would have to contain an analysis
of each of the pieces of work, by referring to the availability of
those various surveys and studies. At a time of multi-layered universal
service providers, that would be excellent information for making a
comparison on the level of engagement that each business was embarked
on, and for allowing different solutions to the same problems to be
made clearer and to be better
evaluated.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000180">&#160;</a>

universal service provision to be detailed, which would in turn not
only allow there to be public provision of such a fact, but provide
closer scrutiny and allow comparisons to be made between universal
service providers with similar exceptions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000181">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In new clause
7(3) there is a similarity of detail to the words in amendment 76,
which I have already discussed. I was going to say that I do not want
to go into them all again; I do want to, but that would probably try
everyone’s patience, so I will make only one or two references.
New clause 7 would place a responsibility on the universal service
provider, whereas amendment 76 would place a responsibility on Ofcom.
It could be argued that both are required for consistency, and that in
each case they are required to ensure that the areas covered in
paragraphs (a) to (g) remain at the core of what Ofcom is regulating
and of the service that is being provided by potentially more than one
universal service provider. As I said earlier, paragraphs (a) to (g)
would possibly be of added importance if there were numerous providers
of the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will comment on one or two of those areas in relation to new clause 7.
The report would call on the service providers to give details of how
they were adapting their service continually to ensure that the
universal service provision is accessible to the aforementioned groups.
That is a very different proposition from Ofcom having a responsibility
under amendment 76, as it would allow each of us and each of the
provider’s customers to see clearly the steps that it was taking
to comply. A particular service provider may have little or no
responsibility for those living in a rural area if it is predominantly
concerned with covering an urban area, but another provider may have a
huge responsibility in an area of rural coverage and
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Reports
from universal service providers would allow scrutiny of performance of
that responsibility to take place on a provider-by-provider basis in
the Department and in Parliament. Subsection (4) would allow the
Secretary of State to expand on our very reasonable list as he felt was
appropriate. My hon. Friends and I are very happy to have that power
bestowed on the Secretary of State by new clause 7, and we are
reasonably sure that he would use it appropriately and
fairly.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
the new clause would come a responsibility for the Secretary of State
to lay a copy of the report before Parliament. Again, I can imagine
that cogs are going around about there being more responsibility for
the Secretary of State, and about his doing something that would enable
Parliament to have some scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have tried
to be consistent throughout the Committee stage, and have argued well
for increased parliamentary scrutiny of the many actions that result
from the Bill. We have asked that Parliament be consulted on the final
offer accepted by the Secretary of State for the purchase of Royal
Mail, but the Minister has refused. We have argued for Parliament to be
consulted on the employee share scheme, but again he has refused. We
have argued for Parliament to be consulted on Post Office ownership
but, guess what, the Minister has refused. He has built up a bit of a
reputation, not only for wrecking my Christmas by saying that there is
no Santa Claus, but also as someone who appears not to want to extend
parliamentary scrutiny to the proposals in the Bill. This is an
opportunity for him to redeem himself. I do not suppose that he can
reinvent Santa Claus, but he can accept the new clause and the
amendment. He can wipe the slate clean and embrace our requests for
greater parliamentary
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000186">&#160;</a>

Committee should the Minister want to take that extra step. We have
asked him to ensure that the Secretary of State behaves in the same
manner in relation to new clause 7 as he expects him to behave in
relation to clause 2. In the words of my hon. Friend the Member for

Whatever the Secretary of State does—whether he decides, as his

to do something a little more extensive—that is a better level
of scrutiny than is currently in the Bill. We will settle for him

Amendment 76 and new clause 7 are important because they strengthen the
Bill, and they strengthen the ability of the sections of the community

fact—in the regulatory process and in the business plans of
individual service

77 is on the possible assessment by Ofcom of the universal postal
service. The timetable in clause 29(4), for an assessment to take place
within 18 months of new arrangements being put in place, is
misguided. The cynic might say, “Oh, we can see what’s
going to happen here. The Ministers would like to get the privatisation
out of the way and, as soon as that’s done, the regulator can
come in and decide to change things, probably in some sort of
negotiation with a privatised monopoly that might of course influence
how things go.” Lo and behold, things might be
changed—respecting the norms of the EU directive,
obviously—and made detrimental to the service, giving a less
good service. That could happen very quickly. A five-year period,
however, would give us the opportunity for a sense of stability and for
the newly privatised company to be required to meet certain standards
for a long enough period to embody those standards and make them more
likely to be upheld in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Moreover,
we need to look at how the timing will work out in practice. If we look
more closely, we will see that if the review or assessment is conducted
within 18 months of the privatisation of Royal Mail, that
review or assessment might well—depending on the

when the current inter-business agreement between Royal Mail and the
Post Office is up for renewal. Depending on the exact timetable, by the
time the privatisation of Royal Mail goes through, only about 18 months
might be left of the current IBA—what a coincidence! We could,
therefore, see a privatised Royal Mail driving a hard bargain with
whichever provider it chooses to make its contractual arrangements with
when the current IBA comes to an end. At around the same time, Ofcom
could be conducting some sort of consultation as part of the
assessment, so it would not be at all surprising to find a privatised
Royal Mail not only driving a hard bargain with potential providers of
counter services, but also exerting pressure on Ofcom to relax the
requirements that it imposes on Royal Mail as the universal service
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000193">&#160;</a>

would we be left with? Fewer access points, fewer deliveries, higher
prices, and different prices in different parts of the country and for
mail going to different parts of the country. The temptation to
maximise profit and reward shareholders will always exist, because that
is how private companies work. The pressure will increase against the
background of ever-falling mail volumes and Royal Mail’s desire
to continue investing in new high-tech equipment, not to mention an
economy that will be making a slow recovery—slower than from the
recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, and that is official, from the
Office for Budget Responsibility this

falling mail volumes, the desire to invest in new high-tech,
responsibility to shareholders, maximising profit and so on will no
doubt put a lot of pressure on the privatised Royal Mail, and in turn
on the regulator, to make the conditions less stringent. That will
happen at the same time, potentially, as the negotiation of a new
contractual agreement with someone to provide the access points. That
is why it would be much better to have stability, which could be
offered by keeping the present requirements for a full five years. That
would enable the current requirements to become the established norm
for a privatised Royal Mail. For those reasons, as explained, we would
like to see the Bill
amended.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000198">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Before I address the points made by the Committee
on the group of amendments, I will say a little on what the clause
does. We have discussed how clause 28 gives Ofcom the primary duty to
secure provision 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 568<a class="bkMark" name="Column568">&#160;</a>
                           </div>of the universal service, and we will soon discuss the minimum service
requirements of the universal service under the hard-wiring of clause
30.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
29 recognises that the postal market might change over time. It must
continue to meet customers’ needs as it develops, and we must
therefore make sure that Ofcom is able to reflect those changes. That
is why subsection (1) gives Ofcom flexibility within the bounds of the
minimum requirements of the universal postal service to describe the
specific services to be provided as a universal postal service and the
standards those services must reach. That is not a new responsibility.
Currently, Postcomm determines the specific products that Royal Mail as
the only universal service provider in the United Kingdom must provide
as a universal service. Under old legislation, Royal Mail did that when
the licence was granted by Postcomm. Now such provision will be under
the universal service
order.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
aim of amendment 76 is laudable. The hon. Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire wants to ensure that the result of the making or amending of
a universal postal service order is that none of the main categories of
persons would be put in any worse position than they were before.
Indeed, it is such a laudable amendment that we have already provided
for it. Under section 3(4)(i) of the Communications Act
2003, Ofcom is already required to take into account the needs
of<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000201">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
41 would put responsibility on the first universal service order in the
hands of the Secretary of State rather than the regulator. Before I
come to the detail, it might be helpful if I explain what the universal
postal service order will do. To put it in context, clause 30 sets out
the minimum requirements for a universal service. They replicate those
requirements currently in place. The order will play a similar role to
that currently played by Royal Mail’s licence, as I said a few
moments ago. It is the level of detail below the minimum requirements
that will specify more precisely the types of products and services
that Ofcom, having assessed the market, considers should be provided as
a universal service. It is important that that is based on a detailed
understanding of the market and of user needs. For that reason, it is
appropriate for it to continue to be specified by the
regulator.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the independent regulator, Ofcom will have a detailed understanding of
the market, the powers and ability to assess the needs of users. The
Secretary of State does not and will not. That is just as true for the
first universal service order to which the amendment refers as it is
for any other. If the concern of the hon. Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire is that, for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 569<a class="bkMark" name="Column569">&#160;</a>
                           </div>some reason, Ofcom decides to make sweeping changes to that currently
required when it makes the first order, I shall reassure him about
that. Ofcom will have little incentive to do that and will face a big
risk. It would need a compelling set of evidence, and will have had no
time to gather it. It is its intention to make an order at the end of
2011, to come into force in spring 2012. Our expectation, following
discussions with Ofcom, is that it would simply roll over into the
order whatever the Royal Mail licence at the time requires to be
provided as a universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ofcom
has the power to remove a licence provision that it considers no longer
necessary, which is to say that it has the power to deregulate where
appropriate. I hope that I have reassured members of the Committee that
it is wholly appropriate that the first universal service order should
be set by the acknowledged independent experts, Ofcom, and I ask the
hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
77 deals with a fundamental feature of a universal service, which is
that it must be able to respond to user needs. Indeed, that requirement
stems from a European directive. The effect of amendment 77, however,
would be to prevent Ofcom from assessing user needs for five years. It
would be unable to reflect in the universal postal service order any
change in user needs for that length of time. That is an incredibly bad
idea in such a fast-changing market. It is partly the rapid pace of
change in the communications market that has led to the need for the
Bill in the first place. Users must be able to have confidence that
what is in their universal service reflects their needs. To ensure
that, Ofcom needs to be able to research those needs and have the
flexibility to make regulatory decisions based on sound evidence. Given
that, I hope hon. Members will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 7 would require the universal service provider to send an annual
report to the Secretary of State on the provision of universal
services. I accept the importance of ensuring that there is
transparency about the provision of the universal service; in many of
our debates I have willingly accepted that, but I cannot see how the
amendment would contribute anything new to that aim. Clause 36, which
we will come to, already provides that if Ofcom is to impose any
condition on the universal service provider, that condition must
include a
requirement<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“to
publish information about the extent to which it is providing specified
postal services in accordance with specified standards, and…to
publish annually an independently audited performance
report.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
report must
contain<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“information
about the provider’s performance in complying with specified
requirements under the designated USP
condition”.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
can see that the proposed new clause is more specific in seeking to be
precise about the issues that the USP should cover in its report.
However, it is for the regulator to set out the universal service
requirements on the universal service provider in accordance with the
provisions in the Bill. It would be a significant additional burden if
the universal service provider was required to produce a report
covering similar but not identical grounds as a separate
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The points
covered in proposed new subsections (2) and (3) seem to be things that
must have been considered by Ofcom in setting the universal service
standards, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 570<a class="bkMark" name="Column570">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are therefore likely to be covered in the report on performance against
those standards. No such requirement was included in the 2009 Bill,
because it simply was not necessary. It is an additional burden when
there are already reporting provisions in the Bill. That remains the
case, and that being so, I ask the hon. Members to withdraw their
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000212">&#160;</a>

will conclude by restating that the Government’s first priority
is to secure the provision of a strong universal postal service. People
value the ability to receive and send a letter at the same affordable
price everywhere in the UK six days a week. That is why the Bill
enshrines in legislation—in clause 30—the minimum
requirements of a universal postal service. We also recognise that the
postal market will change over time. It must continue to meet
customers’ needs as it develops. We must ensure that Ofcom is
able to reflect those changes. Clause 29 provides the necessary powers
and flexibility to enable Ofcom to determine which services should be
included in the universal service, based on the sound evidence of
customer need and the changing market. That is why we do not need the

                           </strong> I rise to speak to amendments 56 and 57, which
relate to clause 30. Clause 30 details the minimum requirements that
should be required in the universal postal service. Requirement 1 of
the clause states that there has to
be:<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“At
least one delivery of letters every Monday to
Saturday”—<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000356">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>to
every home in the UK
and—<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“to
such identifiable points for the delivery of postal packets as OFCOM
may
approve.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000357">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although
there have to be six-days-a-week deliveries of letters, requirement
1(2) provides that there has to be at least one delivery of
“other postal packets” on only five days a week, namely
from Monday to Friday, where the term “other postal
packets” means any parcel, packet or other article transmissible
by post other than a letter. As it stands, the clause implies that
there does not have to be a delivery of such items on a
Saturday.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 572<a class="bkMark" name="Column572">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 56
and 57 would remove the distinction between letters and postal packets
by including “other postal packets” in requirement 1(1)
and deleting requirement 1(2). That would make the requirement stronger
and would much better reflect the needs of real life. Letters can be
pushed through letterboxes without anyone being at home, but, by
definition, “other postal packets” might easily include
items that are too big to push through the letterbox and require
someone to open the door to receive them. When are people more likely
to be able to be at home to receive such parcels? It is on Saturdays,
of course. Plenty of people have to work on Saturdays, but children do
not go to school and many offices are closed, so people are far more
likely to be at
home.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, with internet shopping and activities such as eBay, there has
been an increase in the number of packets sent through the post, at the
same time that the volume of letters is declining. Therefore, it seems
sensible to move forward by providing the sort of service that people
want, which is to have all shapes and sizes of parcels and packets
included in the obligation to provide a delivery six days a week, from
Monday to Saturday. That would be a definite improvement on the
universal postal service as required under the clause. Certainly, it
would please the public, as it can be difficult and time-consuming for
people to get to their nearest depot to collect packages if they are
out when the postman calls. If there were a requirement to deliver such
items on Saturday, people who were not at home to receive a package
during the week would have the option of asking for a Saturday
delivery.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
its oral evidence, Consumer Focus said that the public valued the
Saturday delivery, and it is precisely for items that will not go
through the letterbox that that is so important. I am speaking about
all those people who do not have a Hippo box outside their house,
although perhaps the Minister might at some point decide to provide all
the 28 million homes in the UK with a Hippo
box.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000253">&#160;</a>

for 28 million addresses, but I should tell the hon. Lady that,

ask whether the previous Government were going to change planning

box-style

amendment would ensure that it is a requirement to provide a better
service for the public, which I am sure would be very welcome. I hope
that the Minister will consider including in the Bill the requirement
for a higher level of service, as that better reflects what people

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
7, in the name of the hon. Member for Angus, seeks to achieve a similar
purpose by a slightly different means, in suggesting that we keep
requirement 1(1) and (2) as in the current text of the Bill, but that
we strengthen requirement 1(2) by replacing “Friday” with
“Saturday.” As this is in keeping with what we are

                           </div>asking for, we would support such an amendment to some degree, but we
feel that our amendments are much stronger, because they make it
absolutely clear that all such postal items would be in one category,
with no case for separating them out or for making any kind of
differentiation. We feel that our amendments are better, but we
understand the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman tabled his. The needs
of small businesses are important, as well as those of the home
consumer, because small businesses also value that Saturday service.
People can do a lot of work from home if they have that facility and
can use services on a Saturday, as well as from Monday to
Friday.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall discuss amendments 58 and 59, which are in my name and that of
the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire, and I shall refer to
amendment 8, which is in the name of the hon. Member for Angus.
Amendments 58 and 59 would make a similar change to requirement 2 of
clause 30, which concerns the collection of postal packets. In the
Bill, the requirement is that on a Saturday there must be a collection
of only letters from every access point in the UK that is<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“used for the
purpose of receiving postal packets, or any class of
them”.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000358">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our
amendment would strengthen such a requirement to reflect the needs of
the public.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many people
find that Saturday is the best day to be at home to receive a
package—equally, Saturday is the only day on which they can
easily get to an access point. At present, “access point”
means a post office, and our amendments relating to other aspects of
the Bill seek to ensure that that remains so. Amendments 58 and 59
reflect lifestyles—we aim to improve matters for consumers and
ensure that they get an improved level of service. The only way to do
that is to include stronger requirements in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again, we
understand that the hon. Member for Angus wants to achieve something
similar—by slightly different means—by keeping
requirements 1(2) and 2(2), but altering the word
“Friday” to “Saturday”. That would be in
keeping with what we seek, but it is not quite the same, therefore we
support, first and foremost, our amendments. If they were not
successful, however, we might consider supporting amendment 8. For the
sake of guaranteeing a better service for the public, I hope that the
Minister considers our proposals and accepts our amendments
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000261">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The whole point of the Bill is securing the future
of the universal postal service. The Committee is aware that the market
is undergoing big structural changes. Postal volumes have declined by
15% in the past five years; Richard Hooper predicted declines of up to
40% in the next few. The evidence that was presented to the Committee
was unanimous in acknowledging that action must be taken to save the
universal postal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 30
sets out the minimum requirements of the universal service, which are
identical to those in the Postal Services Act 2000, and to those that
were proposed by the previous Government in their 2009 Bill. Although
one might say that our approach to ownership is different, I cannot see
how ownership could affect minimum requirements. It is interesting that
the hon. Lady seeks to change minimum requirements that are identical
to those that were in the 2009 Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000263">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have
mentioned more than once that the minimum requirements in clause 30
gold-plate the minimum requirements of the European postal service
directive. I assure hon. Members that we share the view that it is
possible to regulate too much, and Whitehall often gold-plates
directives that come from Europe. I make no apology, however, for
gold-plating the European postal directive. It is important to set that
out to the members of the Committee, who I am sure have read the
directive, which goes back to December
1997.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
directive sets out in detail what is required, but we gold-plate that.
We have a six-day instead of a five-day collection service, and we have
a six-day instead of a five-day delivery service. We have uniform and
affordable pricing instead of just affordable pricing. We have a free
service for the blind and partially sighted, which is an option but not
a requirement for member states. Also, we have, under requirement 7, on
“legislative petitions and addresses”, a free service to
convey a qualifying list of petitions and addresses, which is not
required in the postal directive from Europe. We have gold-plated the
European requirements, and the effect of the amendments before us would
be to impose even more gold-plating and additional regulation on Royal
Mail’s operations, which would risk undermining the provision of
the very universal service that we are trying to
save.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
evidence to the Committee, Royal Mail spoke of the need for
deregulation in competitive parts of the market if it is to survive.
The most competitive part of the market is in packets and parcels. The
amendment, therefore, would do precisely the reverse of what Royal Mail
says that it needs. It would thus risk undermining the universal
service, rather than enhancing it, so we cannot accept
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
parcels and packets part of the postal market is a growth area,
and it is highly competitive. As things stand, there is no requirement
on Royal Mail to provide a six-days-a-week parcels service in the
Postal Services Act 2000, passed by the previous Government, or in the
licence issued by Postcomm. Yet Royal Mail provides a six-days-a-week
parcel service. Why, if it is not required under legislation, would
Royal Mail provide a six-day
service?<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
answer is simple and goes to the heart of many of our debates in
Committee. Opposition Members want to do everything by regulation, but
Government Members have said that commercial, common-sense competitive
pressures will make Royal Mail provide for the needs of consumers, if
that is what consumers want. Royal Mail provides a six-days-a-week
parcel service, over and above what is required, because it makes
commercial sense to do so. That is the best incentive for any
business.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are committed to reducing regulatory burdens. We do not wish
to impose regulation when not necessary. It is vital that businesses
are able to operate free of the spectre of excessive bureaucracy that
serves no purpose. If, as predicted, that part of the market continues
to grow and become ever more competitive, a six-days-a-week parcel
service from Royal Mail is likely to become even more attractive to
customers. A combination of customer demand and an effective market
should ensure that consumers still have a six-days-a-week service for
packets and parcels. There is, therefore, no need to require Royal Mail
to provide six days a week something that it would do anyway.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">In short, the
amendments are unnecessary, as the outcome they seek already happens
for commercial reasons. Interestingly, we had a press release last week
from Royal Mail, in which it unveils the fact that not only will it
keep to its normal six-days-a-week delivery of parcels and packets, but
in order to assist in the run-up to Christmas, it will extend that.
That is an example of Royal Mail gradually beginning to listen to
consumers and consumer pressures—I give it credit for
that—which means that it will have extra delivery rounds and
will extend the opening hours of delivery offices for the two
weeks beginning 13 December, increasing convenience for customers who
need to pick up packets and parcels. Royal Mail is improving its
service in response to the needs of
consumers.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
be helpful, I remind the Committee that the last recommended posting
dates before Christmas are Saturday 18 December for second class items,
Tuesday 21 December for first class mail and packets and Thursday 23
December for special delivery. I always like to be of
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120249000271">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to continue the debate, especially in respect of packets and
parcels in Scotland, but in the absence of the hon. Member for Angus I
cannot address the points that I think he would have made. He might
wish to return on Report, and we could have the debate then. I do not
wish to detain the Committee when we have not heard his arguments, and
I urge hon. Members not to press the amendments that we have
