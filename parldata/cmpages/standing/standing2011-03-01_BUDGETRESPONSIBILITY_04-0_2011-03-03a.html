rise to speak in support of amendment 28, tabled by my hon. Friend the

supporting the amendment, and, based on some private conversations that
I have had with Government Members, I suspect that they, too, might be
tempted to see the reason of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000030">&#160;</a>

amendment would not just ensure that the Office for Budget
Responsibility was based physically outside the Treasury but would
allow it to be based elsewhere in the United Kingdom. I am sure that
many hon. Members on both sides of the room will make articulate cases
in their own right for the benefits of that. The hon. Member for
Scarborough and Whitby would be a true champion of the merits of
Scarborough, the hon. Member for Bury North would argue the case for
basing the OBR in the north-west, and the hon. Member for Witham would
make an equally powerful case for her constituency. Of course, it goes
without saying that my hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham East and
for Bristol East and other hon. Friends would make powerful cases, as
would the hon. Member for
Chippenham.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000031">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right about the
merits of locating in a rural part of the UK. As a Member for a
semi-rural constituency, I would echo that sentiment. However, I do not
want to get tempted into a debate on the merits of individual
locations. Suffice it to say that I think the amendment would produce
an excellent clause. It is highly reasonable, and I am sure that the
Minister, who has an excellent reputation as someone who keeps a tight
hold on the Treasury’s purse strings, will see the strong case
for it. We would not have to pay the exorbitant central London rates
and office rents. A location in Bury, Witham, Livingston, Edinburgh or
another place would save the Treasury a great deal of money. I very
much hope that the Minister will be able to find some merit in the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000034">&#160;</a>

understand the rationale behind amendment 28, and, in many respects, I
agree with it. We briefly touched on the OBR’s location
yesterday, when I recounted the potential for a Treasury Minister to
bump into Robert Chote, for example, in the Treasury. I said that I was
sure that would not happen once the OBR had moved. Actually, it has
already moved—that demonstrates just how independent it
is—and is not located in the Treasury. In October, Robert Chote
announced his intention to move the OBR out of the Treasury, and it
moved in December. It now co-locates with the Attorney-General’s
Office.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000036">&#160;</a>

independent OBR and its chair. I have no doubt that Committee members
who wish the OBR to be located in their constituencies will be able to
make a passionate case to its chair on behalf of their local community.
However, because the OBR is independent, such requests would have to be
made to the OBR itself. It is important that the OBR is seen to be
independent, and its location is relevant to that. At the heart of what
we are trying to do is ensuring that it has an independent working
relationship. That is the ultimate test.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000037">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Congressional Budget Office was mentioned earlier, and I wondered where
it was located—in particular, was it in a separate location? It
is located in the Ford House office building, one of four buildings for
House of Representatives staff on Capitol Hill in Washington
DC. The Ford House office building is the only building not connected
underground to the other office buildings or to the Capitol, and it is
the only office building that does not contain offices for Members of
Congress. There, as with the OBR, we see the use of ensuring that the
office is located in a different place. However, the interesting thing
about it being the only office building

the OBR, and will report to the chair of the OBR. As we heard earlier,
the chair will be independent. The process for appointing the chair is
fully independent, and the appointment can be vetoed by the Treasury
Committee. The OBR staff are absolutely independent.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000043">&#160;</a>

employed solely by the office, I am reassured that Robert Chote will
have complete discretion in the people he takes on. The Minister said
that the forecasts would be transferred over and that sounded as if it
was an automatic process based on people’s job

understandable that it will draw from the talent that was in the
Treasury. In future I would expect it to be able to draw more staff
from other areas into its overall staffing levels. But it is absolutely
in charge of hiring and

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that reassuring
response. There is one point that may still concern us. As she says,
some people have already gone over from the Treasury to the office that
is currently running. There is a potential conflict of interest if
during the course of their career progression some of them return to
the Treasury. Obviously within the civil service as a whole there will
be far more career opportunities than there are in the OBR because it
is a much smaller entity. We would not want to restrict people’s
career development, but at the same time, if they spent a few years in
the OBR and then returned to the Treasury, and if there was quite a lot
of that cross-fertilisation going on, it would give cause for concern.
That is something that needs to be kept under scrutiny once the office
is put on a statutory footing and starts to bed down. I beg to ask

amendment is fairly self-explanatory. Again, it addresses the point
that we have discussed already about how the functions of the OBR
should be as transparent as possible so that it can be as accountable
as possible to the public and to Parliament. Obviously the Monetary
Policy Committee publishes minutes of its meetings, albeit with some
delay. We think the minutes of the Budget Responsibility Committee and
any of the sub-committees that are established under the Bill should
also be published. I should be interested to know whether the Minister
agrees. If she does, perhaps she will be prepared to accept the

a matter for the OBR whether it chooses to publish the information
relating to its committees and its contacts with Ministers. Schedule 1
allows the BRC to determine its own procedures and the OBR to determine
the procedures of its committees and sub-committees. As I said, that
supports independence. Minutes are probably not the best way to
communicate the OBR’s conclusions. The hon. Lady may have in
mind the Bank of England and the publication of the Monetary Policy
Committee’s minutes. Those minutes are the principal means by
which it explains its monthly policy decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000053">&#160;</a>

a policy-making committee, so it is appropriate for the Budget
Responsibility Committee to explain its forecast judgment in its
reports. That is one reason why, in the charter and the Bill, we make
it clear that those reports should set out the risks considered by the
OBR, the assumptions that it makes and the various methodologies that
it uses, so that there is complete transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000054">&#160;</a>

the Government to say that the OBR should have to publish its minutes.
There would be a danger of slight overkill if it had to publish the
minutes of every meeting. However, it is important that when the OBR
has finished its work, it is put into the public domain and that it is
transparent and comprehensive. The provisions in the Bill ensure those
very things. It makes it clear that all OBR reports must be published.
As I said, those reports must include key risks and assumptions. The
OBR has the underlying duty to act transparently. I assure the hon.
Lady that there is a transparency safeguard. As for the questions that
people might have about how the OBR goes about its reporting, I hope
that that will be covered by the report.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000055">&#160;</a>

and other sittings, she has stressed that the OBR is independent and
should therefore decide for itself how to conduct its affairs and
exercise its own judgment on whether to publish minutes. However, it is
we in Parliament who are setting up the OBR. We are not just saying,
“Here you are, get on with it.” The purpose of the Bill
is to set out and prescribe in detail how the office should be run.
This is our one opportunity to ensure that the office is given certain
guidelines. I appreciate the Minister saying that the office will
publish regular reports, outlining its reasons and giving the
methodology on which it bases its forecasts. That is little different
from publishing minutes of meetings.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again, we
come to the question of the relationship between the OBR and the
Treasury. For example, it would be in the public interest to see
minutes of any regular meetings the OBR had with Treasury officials. I
do not suggest that a full transcript should be made of everything that
it discusses, because some matters will obviously be confidential. It
would also be a huge burden. I would be interested to know to what
extent it would be covered by the Freedom of Information Act, but it is
entirely reasonable to suggest that the OBR should publish minutes of

                           </strong> The Minister will be aware that this part of the
schedule was substantially amended in the Lords at the
Government’s request, after the Grand Committee debate. It now
includes the proviso:<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        </p>
                        <p>All
four amendments in this group deal with the same point, a factor that
was discussed in the other place when the Government amendments were
debated. They suggested that five years is too long. It is important to
revisit the question. I have two concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First, if the
OBR waits the maximum five years before commissioning an external
review of its reports, it will take us beyond the next general
election. When setting up a new body, it is important to review its
workings at a fairly early stage. I appreciate that there will always
be the opportunity for people such as the Treasury Committee to look
into the matter, but this provision is about an independent review to
be set up by the non-executive committee. It will be an ongoing
process, and getting it in motion fairly early in the life of the OBR
is important.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
there are obvious political concerns, particularly if we have five-year
fixed-term Parliaments. It is always possible that the external review
could be carried out just after the general election, but I believe
that it is important to put the OBR under a little more scrutiny before
the election to ensure that it is up and running and doing its job
properly. It is up to the office to decide when such a review is
carried out and I am sure that the Minister will say that it will be a
maximum of five years, but there is a danger that the office will
decide that it wants to carry on in its own sweet way for as long as
possible before asking someone else to pass judgment on it. Giving it
five years’ leeway is too long. We believe that it should be
three.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> It is important for the OBR periodically to have
an independent external review. As the hon. Lady pointed out, when the
Bill was debated in the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 117<a class="bkMark" name="Column117">&#160;</a>
                           </div>other place, the question was asked how often the
process should take place. We amended the Bill in the light of that
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ultimately,
if we have non-executives in place—they are an in-built external
check on how the Budget Responsibility Committee is working—we
have to allow them the independence to take a view on when external
peer reviews should be carried out. As the hon. Lady said, they must be
carried out at a maximum of every five years, and it is important that
there is a periodic external assessment of how the OBR is working. Of
course, there is nothing to stop those non-executives deciding that
they want an external peer review earlier than that; for instance, they
could decide to commission a review every three years. However, there
is no doubt that such external reviews are not the only means by which
the work of the OBR can be scrutinised between
times.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
OBR’s work will be scrutinised under a package that comprises
various factors. There is the duty under clause 5 to act transparently;
its work will be open to ongoing challenge and review by well-regarded
think tanks and academics whose time is spent commenting on economic
matters. There is also a statutory requirement on the OBR to produce an
annual assessment of the efficacy of its fiscal and economic forecasts.
That will be done in the presence of the non-executives; they will be
there on a day-to-day basis, to challenge internally how those
forecasts are being done. Behind that, the OBR has said that it intends
to establish an advisory panel of experts to support and challenge its
work. We spoke earlier about the Congressional Budget Office; these
provisions bring us into line with US practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
OBR’s integrity depends on whether people believe that it
fulfils its role of producing independent, robust and credible economic
and fiscal forecasts. In the difficult economic times of recent years,
it has been a challenge for independent groups to achieve that, but in
an underlying way they will be expected to be robust. The OBR will have
every incentive to carry out its work to the highest standards of
accuracy. It will set up a panel to advise it, and the non-executives
will be there from day to day. We also have the peer review, which will
be entirely external, and the OBR will publish its reports. There will
be a huge amount of transparency on whether its forecasts and estimates
are accurate. We do not need to fetter the responsibilities or
decision-making powers of the non-executive directors.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I assure the
hon. Lady that she has raised an important matter, but we believe that
leaving the Bill as stands will allow us to ensure that the external
review happens and is of high quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000077">&#160;</a>

                        </p>‘(3) The
Treasury’s decisions on payments and the budgets for the
operations of the Office shall be subject to the approval of the House
of Commons Treasury Select
Committee.(4) The

am sure that some members of the Committee will be pleased to hear that
this is the last amendment to schedule 1, but it is one of the most
important. We have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 118<a class="bkMark" name="Column118">&#160;</a>
                           </div>already discussed the matter in passing. It is about
the OBR’s budget. The Minister said that a five-year budget had
been agreed under the spending review, but given the precedents
mentioned earlier of what happens in other countries, I believe that it
ought to be subject to some sort of check from outside the Treasury
rather than being announced in the Treasury’s spending review.
We believe that the Treasury Committee should act as watchdog, to
ensure that the OBR is properly funded.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
says that funding is secure for five years. We do not know at this
stage quite how much work the OBR will have to do; it will depend on
economic circumstances. A certain degree of leeway has been given to
the office to undertake additional work, and there is no limit on the
number of reports that it can produce. The office may want to revisit
the matter before those five years are up and make a plea for extra
funding. It should not be a matter for debate between the OBR and the
Treasury; the Treasury may say that the OBR has already made far too
much noise and ought to be kept in its box. We therefore suggest that
the Treasury Committee should be involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that the Minister will seek to reassure us that the Treasury wants the
office to be able to do its work to the full, and that it will want to
give it the resources to do so. I have already mentioned the concerns
expressed in the other place by Lord Eatwell about the Parliamentary
Budget Office that was established in Canada in 2008. A year later,
after it had produced two reports critical of the Government, its
annual budget was frozen, despite earlier promises that it would be
boosted by a third. Sweden’s Fiscal Policy Council was set up in
2007 by the incoming Conservative Government, but on 18 November last
year the council wrote to the Government pointing out the discrepancy
between its remit—what it had been asked to do—and the
resources that it had been given. The Swedish Minister of Finance is
reported to have reacted negatively, suggesting that the
council’s budget be
cut.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Sweden
and Canada are fairly respectable countries to which we would normally
look for examples of best practice; there was another example from
Hungary as well, which I will not go into now, not that I am suggesting
that it is not as respectable and well thought of as Sweden and Canada.
Those are examples of democratic countries that operate in a
transparent and accountable way pulling the plug on resources for the
equivalent of the OBR when they did not like how it was operating. They
did that in the early
stages.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
cannot imagine the Minister standing up in public and saying,
“We don’t like what you are doing. Therefore I’m
going to speak to my friend the Chancellor and take all your money
away.” I am sure that she would not be so indiscreet, but there
is obviously a danger that the budget could be gradually whittled away,
whether by the front door or the back door, to try to hamper the
OBR’s work. That is why it is important to ensure in the Bill
not just that the OBR is properly funded but that there is check and
balance through the Treasury Committee, which should have a remit to
ensure that the funding is in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We agree with the spirit of the amendment to the
extent that it recognises transparency, and parliamentary scrutiny of
the OBR’s budget. Clearly, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 119<a class="bkMark" name="Column119">&#160;</a>
                           </div>parliamentary scrutiny will be a hugely important safeguard of the
OBR’s independence. However, the Government have already put a
number of arrangements in place to ensure that there is confidence
about resourcing for the OBR. Perhaps I could run through them and then
back up the fact that they are sufficient by quoting what the current
chair has said about the resourcing that he has to run the
OBR.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would give the Treasury Committee an additional role in
looking at payments and budgets. Aside from the logistics—it
would be extremely difficult for the Treasury Committee to have, in
effect, sign-off on the OBR making payments—the Treasury
Committee has not asked for those powers, and it would be hard to make
them work
constitutionally.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
line with the Treasury Committee recommendation, the annual budget of
the OBR will be identified separately in the Treasury’s
estimate, so it will be available for the Treasury Committee to
scrutinise there. The hon. Lady will be aware that the OBR has been
provided with an agreed and publicly documented multi-year budget, so
the annual budget exercise that she was concerned about cannot be used
to exert pressure on it. In fact, that aspect of how the OBR has been
set up has been welcomed by the IMF, which has, no doubt, looked at the
examples of different countries that she gave and recognised that there
is a real
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
the hon. Lady mentioned the Canadian example. The Canadian
parliamentary budget officer was not given an agreed, published,
multi-year budget, which I think was one of the reasons why it was
easier to reassess that budget downwards, if that is what happened. In
the UK, we have set up an independent OBR, and we have been very clear
about setting a five-year budget for it which is now in the public
domain.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Additionally,
in line with the Treasury Committee recommendation, the OBR will also
be able to submit to the Select Committee an additional estimates
memorandum alongside that of the Treasury in which it can explain for
itself the reasons for changes in the available budget for the year
ahead. The Bill gives the OBR’s non-executives a duty to report
on anything that appears to them to constrain the OBR’s
discretion, which could include any attempts to control the OBR by
manipulating its budgets. I understand what the hon. Lady is trying to
achieve with the amendment, but I do not think that it will deliver
anything over and above the safeguards that are already in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
other concern is that, in expanding the role of the Treasury Committee,
we could end up with a situation in which the Committee, having signed
off on various payments made by the OBR, finds itself being summoned to
the Public Accounts Committee, which might decide to inquire into the
financial running of the office. That would start to muddy
parliamentary
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the Chair of the Treasury Committee, speaking of his ability to look at
the financing and funding of the OBR,
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
is vital that the OBR has the resources it needs. The Committee will
monitor this carefully: the Terms of Reference suggest that the

disclosure, and we will have the information we need to do our
work.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000226">&#160;</a>

                        <p>He clearly feels that he
has enough transparency to do his job. There is the question of whether
the amount in place will allow the office to do its statutory duty, and
the hon. Lady made the point that one can ask someone to do something
and then not give them the resources to do it. The chair of the OBR has
already made it clear that he feels that he has adequate resource, and
has said that he will promptly raise any funding issues with the
Treasury Committee. In talking before the Committee he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000093">&#160;</a>

                           </span> It is probably worth
noting that we are moving on to part 2 of the Bill, which is about
amendments to and reforms of the National Audit Office and the office
of Comptroller and Auditor General, and to the architecture that
accompanies those important elements of our constitution, which oversee
the sound and prudent use of public money. In many ways, the NAO and
the work of the CAG and the Public Accounts Committee are more
important and far more serious than the subject of some of the
discussions that we have had today, but because they are of long
standing—I think that the Comptroller and Auditor General post
has existed since 1866—they often pass without much
comment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
term “comptroller” is derived from a conjunction between
the English word “controller” and the French word for
account—“compte”—and hence the notion of
the “controller of accounts” was set up. In Welsh, as
stated in the Bill, the term is Rheolwr ac Archwilydd Cyffredinol. This
is an important appointment, and I am glad that the office will
continue and that the appointment will be made by Her Majesty in
response to an address of the House of Commons, prompted by a motion
from the Prime Minister. Those are fundamental issues. This whole part
of the Bill, in some ways, reflects a rather unfortunate piece of the
most recent history of that office respecting certain expenses,
accounts, allowances and so forth that were reported in the British
media, prompting many people to query whether the structures for
checking expenses and the accounts of the office of the CAG were
adequate. The Public Accounts Commission commissioned John Tiner to do
an inquiry and review.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000101">&#160;</a>

consequence, a series of recommendations were made, including a set of
reforms to the law, which the previous Labour Administration sought to
put into what is now the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010,
but due to the wash-up before the general election, there was no time
to give the provisions full and proper scrutiny, so the Government
rightly brought them forward and appended them to the Bill. The new
structures are already in place. As with the OBR, we are essentially
doing a bit of post-hoc scrutiny, given that the new arrangements are
up and running but we are here debating the legislation. I always
dislike that approach to legislation slightly—I find that I
would rather legislate before changes happen—but it seems to be
a recent trend in certain circumstances. I suppose needs
must.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My specific
point on clause 11 concerns the change taking place to the tenure of
the office of the CAG. Committee members will see on page 4 of the Bill
that the person appointed holds office for 10 years and may not be
appointed again. It is a single term of appointment, for a decade, and
is not renewable. That is a change. Sir John Bourn, a
distinguished Comptroller and Auditor General with whom I worked on the
Public Accounts Committee, held the post for 20 years in total. I
suspect that, partly to reflect the Tiner review, Ministers and others
thought that if we were legislating, we should take the opportunity to
consider that tenure of office.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister explain why 10 years was chosen? It might have been debated in
the other place. One anxiety that has been voiced is whether that
length of tenure will affect the type of candidate who may be deemed
appropriate for appointment or may apply. Obviously, it is a long
period in office, but because office holders cannot be reappointed, it
would be a significant career choice for an individual to apply for the
role. Provisions later in the Bill prevent an individual from working
for the Crown, for example, for at least two years thereafter, so doing
that job would mean working for 10 years and then moving on to an
undetermined something else. Does the Minister have any observations
about the career attractiveness or otherwise of the construct? It does
not seem massively objectionable to me, but it is quite unusual for a
public office. We will come to other aspects of the legislation as the
clauses
progress.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000107">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It might be the right moment for me to give some
background to this part of the Bill. Overall, the coalition programme
makes it clear that the Government will take significant steps to
increase the transparency of public spending to enhance accountability.
The first stage, which we have been debating in the first part of the
Bill, is to subject the Treasury’s fiscal judgments to external
scrutiny by making economic and fiscal forecasts independent.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000108">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The same
applies to the scrutiny of public expenditure. Modernising the
governance of the National Audit Office will also help advance those
coalition Government objectives. The provisions in part 2 strengthen
the resilience and integrity of the body that is best placed to assess
the Government’s use of public funds. Effective independent
oversight of the efficiency of Government spending will be particularly
important when public resources are under
pressure.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Part
2 implements the recommendations in the Public Accounts
Commission’s 15th report. Its proposals were designed to balance
two considerations: the need to ensure that the CAG has the authority
to form completely independent judgments about the audits and
value-for-money studies conducted by the NAO; and the need for the NAO
to maintain systems of governance and internal controls that are
consistent with best practice. The provisions in part 2 introduce a
number of checks and balances to achieve those
aims.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
summary, part 2 modernises the governance arrangements for the national
audit. It continues the office of the CAG as an independent officer of
the House of Commons, but limits the term to a single appointment of 10
years. I shall answer the hon. Gentleman’s questions about that
in a moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Part 2
provides for the establishment of a new corporate body, the new
National Audit Office, the functions of which will include providing
resources for the CAG’s functions, monitoring how those
functions are carried out and approving the provision of certain
services. Importantly, it will be able to support and challenge
constructively the CAG’s decisions without, of course,
preventing him from carrying out his statutory
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The NAO will
have a majority of non-executives and will be led by a non-executive
chair. The CAG will be the chief executive, but will not be an employee
of the NAO . It is important to stress that, within the new governance
framework, the CAG will continue to have complete discretion in forming
audit judgments and carrying out value for money studies. Schedules 2
and 3 set out details on the new NAO and the relationship between it
and the CAG.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 11 is
straightforward in that it provides for the office of the CAG to
continue. It carries forward the appointment process in section 1 of
the National Audit Act 1983, under which the CAG is appointed by Her
Majesty by letters patent, following an address in the House of
Commons. It is a legal requirement that the Prime Minister agree the
appointment of the CAG with the Chairman of the Committee of Public
Accounts. The choice of CAG will continue to require cross-party
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To address
the point made by the hon. Member for Nottingham East, subsections (6)
and (7) limit the term of office to a single 10-year appointment
instead of the current unlimited term. A time frame of 10 years is
significant, but it gives the incumbent time to settle into the role
and to become a strong and effective leader. On the other hand, it
mitigates the risk of the office becoming too closely aligned with the
personality of a single individual. Refreshing the leadership of an
organisation at appropriate intervals is widely recognised as a driver
to improving performance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000115">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have always been sceptical of term limits,
perhaps because I began a particular career choice early on in my
working life. When people suggested that Members of Parliament should
be appointed only for two terms, or that Prime Ministers should serve
for a fixed term, I always thought that that would fetter the choice of
the public if there were a really good candidate. In many American
presidential elections, potential presidents have been unable to be
appointed, even though they were popular. Is the Minister certain that
term limits, as a principle, are a good
thing?<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000116">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is probably unwise for me to make broad
comments that do not relate to this role. That would be an entirely
different debate about roles that might have different requirements.
The hon. Gentleman’s points about politics are separate from the
situation that we are discussing; in the case of the CAG it is right to
have a single term. High-quality candidates will always be available to
carry out the role. There is no question of the CAG seeking
reappointment. That means that there is no danger, either in reality or
perception, that his or her judgments will be compromised as the period
for the renewal of their term approaches. The clause reflects the
position of the Public Accounts Committee as set out in its 15th
report.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
how our approach compares with that of other countries, many other
countries have fixed-term appointments for their similar auditor
generals. In Norway, the fixed term is five years, but in the United
States it is 15. By setting a tenure of 10 years we have hopefully got
it about right. It is a substantial role that needs a substantial
person in it. That tenure will give them time to come into the role and
develop the leadership that they need.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000118">&#160;</a>

Why are the remuneration arrangements to be made between the Prime
Minister and the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, rather than
with that Committee itself? I understand that the PAC used to have a
role as it is a Committee of the House of Commons, but that has now
been limited to the Chair.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000123">&#160;</a>

number of interesting provisions in the clause. Subsection (6) seems to
suggest that the pension arrangements are wholly under the
Treasury’s control. That seems slightly at odds with the salary
arrangements, but I may have got that wrong and be misreading the
legislation. A reasonable recommendation was made by, I think, the
Public Accounts Commission that the CAG’s salary be tied in
law—pegged—to the salary of the Permanent Secretary of
Her Majesty’s Treasury. That seems a reasonable provision, but
it did not make it into the Bill. Will the Minister explain

                        <p class="tabbed">The provisions
were debated in the House on 4 November 2009, before the general
election. They were pretty much in the form in which they exist today,
with a couple of small exceptions. The current Exchequer Secretary to
the Treasury, then in opposition, proposed an amendment. Given the
attention that had been paid to the CAG’s allowances and
expenses, he moved an amendment proposing that all remunerations and
allowances should be published monthly online so that there would be
more transparency about them. That amendment was put to the vote in the
House, and the Minister, as she now is, voted in favour of it during
that debate. Unless I am missing it, however, that provision does not
seem to have made it into the legislation before us. Will the Minister
explain why just over a year ago she thought it was necessary for the
CAG’s remuneration and allowances to be placed online on a

                           </strong> The clause provides for the determination of the
CAG’s remuneration arrangements. Those provisions have been
prepared with a view to the overriding requirement of preserving the
independence of the office, in order not to constrain the CAG’s
operational decisions. The hon. Gentleman raised a number of questions,
which I will come on to in a moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000126">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On what is
contained in the clause, it provides that the remuneration arrangements
have to be agreed in advance by the Prime Minister and the Chair of the
Committee of Public Accounts; that it can include an automatic uprating
during the term of the CAG’s appointment; that it precludes
performance-based incentives, in order to preserve the CAG’s
operational independence; and that, as of now, it is to be charged on
and paid out of the Consolidated Fund, with no need for the resources
to be voted on annually by Parliament. The main change to the current
arrangements relates to the requirement for the remuneration
arrangements to be agreed between the Prime Minister and the person who
chairs the Committee of Public Accounts. There will no longer be a
direct link to a particular salary or salary range.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000127">&#160;</a>

across Departments at the moment, or in roles going forward. We try to
get over that by ensuring that we set the salary at an agreed level, at
the beginning of the CAG’s employment, and alongside that we
have a suitable uprating mechanism so that any incoming candidate

Morse is paid a salary of £210,000 per annum. That will be
uprated each year on the anniversary of his first day of office, in
line with the consolidated pay increase of the senior civil service. As
the senior civil service will not receive consolidated pay increases
for the next two years, Mr Morse’s salary will remain at that

                           </strong> The rate that has been set is one that has been
agreed by all parties. The hon. Gentleman wanted to link the salary
rate of the CAG to that of permanent secretaries. Permanent secretaries
receive between a minimum of £140,000 and a maximum of
£273,000, which is clearly a wide range. He makes a good point
on salary levels, which is one reason I made the point to him that
maybe over time, as we get incoming permanent secretaries, that range
will narrow.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000134">&#160;</a>

half-yearly, so there is transparency there, and I urge the hon.

because it is important, as he points out. Maybe it will be prepared to
publish all those details on a monthly basis—we will see if he

do not want to labour the point about the salary of the CAG, because
obviously we can come back to this at another time, but it seems
unusual for this Administration—having made such a great fanfare
about tackling high salaries in the public sector—to be actively
legislating, but not taking the opportunity to do something about high
salaries when they are before us in the clause. The Minister did not
say whether she was content with this particular salary level, so I am
none the wiser as to whether the Chancellor is going to haul the CAG
before him. He seemed to suggest before and after the general election
that he would do that before he granted permission for any public
office to have a salary higher than the Prime Minister’s. We
will wait and see whether the CAG will have to come and account to the
Chancellor because he is to be paid more than £142,000.
Obviously the Chancellor has some say in the remuneration arrangements.

leave. That is perfectly reasonable in many ways. However, there was
some debate in the House of Lords about why the period of two years was
chosen to prevent a person ceasing to be CAG from holding Crown office.
I think there was an original proposal by the Commission that the ban
should be for life—that the person leaving should never be able

years.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000146">&#160;</a>

apply for permission to the advisory committee if she wishes to take up
office after she has left her political career. That applies to a
number of senior posts in the public sector, but such a stipulation is

the points that the hon. Gentleman raised about why we put in place the
period of two years. Clause 15 restricts the former CAG from working
for the Crown or providing services to persons acting on behalf of the
Crown for a period of two years after they cease to occupy that role.

return to clause 15, a two-year employment restriction, with a related
requirement to seek advice after that period, is necessary to protect
the independence of the office, without making a former CAG subject to
disproportionate restrictions in their ability to work. A five-year ban
could result in discouraging candidates, particularly younger ones,
from applying. We do not want the post to become a role that somebody
does before they retire, for
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000153">&#160;</a>

is just one exception to the two-year ban. Subsection (7) allows a
former CAG to hold office as Auditor General for Wales or for Scotland
and as Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland. It would
seem perverse for former holders of that office to be denied the
opportunity of making their experience and knowledge available to the
devolved Administrations if they so wish. Apart from that, we think
that a two-year period of restriction gets the balance right. It
ensures that their independence is not compromised when they leave
office, and it is not so long that it would discourage candidates from

clauses clearly establish the way in which the person who has
previously been in the role of CAG can go forward should they wish to
go into a role that may conflict with their previous position. That is
unlike the position that exists for MPs. People who have been Ministers
can take roles, but the advisory committee looks at whether those roles
are restricted. In this case, it is very clear cut that a full two-year
ban is in place. The process maintains the independence of the role of

suspect that this clause relates primarily to audit support for other
domains and territories and so forth. Given that the Government have
decided to abolish the Audit Commission, which clearly has had a role
in auditing local authority activities in England and Wales for a
considerable period, and given that there is an opportunity for the
National Audit Office potentially to take on some of those residual but
necessary audit and scrutiny functions that the Audit Commission
formerly pursued, I take it that this clause also then allows the NAO
to extend some of its scrutiny role into local public service
activities as well as Whitehall and other Departments. Will the

                           </strong> The thinking behind this clause was mentioned by
the hon. Gentleman when he started his comments. As he pointed out, the
NAO supports a wide range of international institutions. Some of its
work can be helping to build up financial management and audit skills.
He mentioned that it can work in different countries—Vietnam is
one example—as well as auditing a number of international
organisations such as the World Food Programme. He will be aware that
the NAO also supports and encourages the professional development of
the international community of audit offices. The Comptroller and
Auditor General has been elected to the UN board of auditors, which is
responsible for auditing the United Nations.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Closer to
home, the NAO also provides support to a number of Select Committees,
including the Public Accounts Committee. That is the backdrop to
clause 16. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there is any
link to the Audit Commission. Ultimately, the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government is taking forward work to create a new
local audit framework. This clause is not designed to tackle that.
Future local audit arrangements will allow local authorities to appoint
their own auditors, and it is proposed to move the Audit
Commission’s in-house practice to the private sector. Some

                           </strong> Many people may be surprised by the clause. People
may think that the National Audit Office has been in existence for a
long time, but if we look at the swirling mists of the British
constitution, such as it is, with its still-undefined character, we see
that in many different ways the NAO has never found its way properly on
to a statutory footing, so the clause will create a body corporate
called the National Audit Office. The clause also triggers schedule 2,
which hon. Members will see is a quite a considerable schedule at the
back of the Bill, detailing what the NAO shall do.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I
mentioned earlier, the Tiner review, and the set of circumstances that
prompted the thinking about modernising the governance and
constitutional arrangements of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the
NAO and the scrutiny of the UK’s public accounts, have opened
the box on a number of different areas, and we welcome the
modernisation process. However, a number of anxieties have been voiced
at different times about certain aspects; for example, it has been
suggested that parliamentary oversight of the NAO and the CAG may be
unwittingly diminished by the creation of a whole panoply of boards of
directors and executive and non-executive directors for the NAO, and
accountability will in some cases be redirected. I think Professor
David Heald, a former adviser to the Public Accounts Commission, said
that when the NAO begins to negotiate internally between its board and
the CAG, there will be fewer opportunities for the PAC, and by
extension the House of Commons, to have the same effective
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not quite clear that I agree with the professor’s view, but
there have been criticisms of all that activity, not least by the noble
Baroness Noakes, a Conservative peer who suggested that the House of
Commons ought to have pulled its finger out when the expenses and
allowances issue arose for the CAG. That perhaps showed that the House
of Commons procedures for keeping close account of what was going on
were lax, and that it was creating all the arrangements almost as an
excuse. She described the arrangements
as<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p>To a
certain extent, I sympathise with her anxieties. Will the Minister put
on record her estimate of the total costs of creating the board, the
non-executive directors and the new governance arrangements? On
balance, the arrangements are probably necessary, as there is an

Baroness Noakes made a fair point: the legislation is not exactly light
touch. It is belt and braces, and there is a cost involved. It would be
illuminating if the Minister could give a figure. Obviously, there are
a number of issues that we will come to in schedule

that at the moment, the National Audit Office is not a corporate body,
and the clause will establish it as a new corporate body. He is also
right that there is a range of issues on governance, structure and
constitution related to the establishment of the NAO as a separate
legal body. However, I think we should proceed to schedule 2, where we
can debate some of the
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000173">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Essentially, I wish to reiterate—I
mentioned this in debating the previous clause—that if the
Minister is able to give us a sense of the total cost of the governance
structures and arrangements, it would be useful. There are a number of
other little observations that are worth mentioning. We had an
interesting debate earlier about how it was exceptional and perhaps
inappropriate for the Treasury Committee to have oversight of the
appointment of non-executive members of the OBR. However, I note that,
under schedule 2, all non-executive members of the NAO are to be
appointed by the Public Accounts Commission. That is obviously a slight
problem in her argument. There are parliamentary processes regarding
the appointment of non-executive members. If the Minister could explain
the consistency of her argument on that point, it might be
useful.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are no restrictions under part 4 regarding terms of
appointment—determination of appointment—on the severance
or compensation provisions. In fact, there is no mention at all of
severance or compensation provisions. As I read the Bill, whereas in
relation to the OBR the Treasury is taking a power in a general sense
to make a payment in those circumstances, there is no provision for
payment at all to be made on the termination of appointments.
Therefore, I am assuming that whether because of voluntary or
compulsory removal from office or departure from office, no
compensation would be allowable for those persons either appointed to
the board or employed at the NAO. That might be something that has been
accidentally missed from the drafting. Obviously, we have time to
address those things. By and large, the provisions seem otherwise to be
fairly straightforward.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000178">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, schedule
2 sets out the various details of the National Audit Office’s
constitutional functions, including rules on its membership, status and
the appointment of members and staff. There are several different parts
to that, as the Committee can no doubt see. He raises the question of
whether all this governance will be somehow unwieldy in relation to
Parliament’s role in scrutinising. That is a fair point to
make.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I, too, have
a huge amount of respect for Baroness Noakes in the other place. She
has raised the issue of the challenges and concerns surrounding the
expenses of the previous incumbent. She also referred to how, at the
time, the House of Commons had not picked up on that or expressed
concern. It may be that, with hindsight, we will see that the
challenges that Members of this House had surrounding their expenses
were part of the backdrop to an environment in which it was felt that
the CAG’s expenses were not something to be raised. However,
schedule 2 sets out a strong governance structure for the
NAO.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000180">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also asked about the total cost of change and of setting
all this up. I do not have a specific figure for him right now, but I
am happy to write to him with that. Our expectation is that the cost
will be very small. As he is aware, there is already an NAO; it is just
not a body corporate. In many respects, we are putting in place in
legal footing for something that is already there. I take on board that
point, but I suggest that the costs will not be
excessive.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000181">&#160;</a>

the rest of the questions that the hon. Gentleman raised on
parliamentary oversight, I should point out to him that the Public
Accounts Commission will have to hold accountable not just the
CAG—who is, of course, chief executive of the NAO—but the
NAO chair. The Bill increases the Commission’s scrutiny role by
requiring it to approve more of the NAO’s work than it did in
the past. That includes the NAO strategy, the estimate, the code of
practice on the relationship between the CAG and the NAO in paragraph
10 of schedule 3, and the annual report. He is right to point out that
there is a desire to ensure that we are clear-cut about how the NAO
will work alongside the Comptroller and Auditor General, and how both
those roles will work alongside
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the hon. Gentleman asked about non-executive appointments to the NAO
being made by the Public Accounts Committee. That happens because the
NAO and its members are Officers of Parliament. The OBR is entirely
independent and is a non-departmental public body. That is the reason
for the difference, although he was right to pick up that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000183">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I sense that the Minister is winding up, but there
was a specific point about compensation and severance arrangements; I
could not see provision for that in the Bill, and I am anxious that
that might fetter the Treasury’s ability to make those payments.

                           </strong> Schedule 3 sets out the relationship between the
National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Given
that this complex architecture is being established, it was felt that a
set of memorandums of understanding, codes of practice and so forth
needed to be established so that the workings could be clear. The
situation is becoming slightly convoluted because of the number of
players involved, including the Public Accounts Committee, the Public
Accounts Commission, the Prime Minister, Her Majesty, the Comptroller
and Auditor General, the NAO, the chair of the NAO—Members will
get the sense that this is a complex process. By and large, we can see
that the code of practice that is being set up is
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are a couple of points that I want to make. Paragraph 4 of schedule 3
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“NAO
must, in such manner as it considers appropriate, monitor the carrying
out of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s
functions.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Paragraph
5
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Comptroller and Auditor General must have regard to any advice
given.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is behavioural monitoring by the NAO of what the CAG does, even though
the CAG is the chief executive of the NAO. I get the sense that an
organisation, subordinate to its chief executive, has a monitoring role
of that chief executive. There may be some circularity of
accountability there, but perhaps the Minister will elaborate. For
example, I do not see any reference to the role that the Public
Accounts Committee or the commission might play, although they might
have been more appropriate bodies to do the monitoring; that was my
first
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
second point relates to the code of practice. There are several
provisions that it might cover, but the schedule mentions a
provision<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“restricting

General’s

                        </p>
                        <p>In
other words, people appointed as non-executive members of the NAO will
be gagged when it comes to discussing the carrying out of the
Comptroller and Auditor General’s functions. I do not know what
circumstances the Minister envisages. Why would we need to restrict the
making of public comments by a non-executive member of the NAO? The
whole point of non-executive appointees is often to provide a challenge
and a level of scrutiny to ensure that there is a balanced point of
view. Essentially muffling the voice of the non-executive members seems
entirely counter-intuitive. That is on page 29, line 19. Those were my
only two queries about the schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000195">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Schedule 3 is crucial because it sets out where
and how the NAO will work with the Comptroller and Auditor General. It
would probably be worth while if I explained the principles set out by
the Public Accounts Commission that led to the arrangements in the
schedule. The proposals by the commission were designed to balance two
considerations: the CAG needs the authority to form completely
independent judgments about audits and value-for-money studies
conducted by the NAO, but at the same time the NAO needs to maintain
systems of governance and internal control that are consistent with
best
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
governor’s framework set out in the schedule is designed to
ensure that in delivering the CAG’s independent audit judgment,
the NAO and the CAG are themselves operating to the best standards of
probity and efficiency. Paragraph 10(2) reflects the principle set out
in clause 17(1) and (2), which grants the CAG complete
discretion, subject to any limitations agreed by the commission, the
NAO and the
CAG.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
schedule provides for the NAO to provide resources for the CAG, but as
the hon. Gentleman said, it also gives the NAO a duty to monitor, and
form a relationship with, the CAG. Further details on how the
relationship will work are set out in the code of practice, which is
prepared by the NAO and the CAG and approved by the commission. The
schedule also sets out where the Public Accounts Commission, on behalf
of Parliament, has a role in regulating the relationship between the
CAG and the
NAO.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the potential conflict of interest that
arises from the fact that although the CAG is the chief executive of
the NAO, the NAO has a role in monitoring the CAG. The monitoring is
really part and parcel of the NAO’s role in providing the CAG
with advice and support. Ultimately, the Public Accounts Commission
will hold the CAG to account. That is the point that Baroness Noakes
was making when she questioned whether that had happened in the recent
past. The NAO’s duty to monitor is necessary because it is a
body that does things, as well as a body that advises. That is the
reason for that aspect of schedule
3.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned his concern about the restriction on public
comments by non-executives of the NAO. We do not want the
non-executives to undermine the authority of the CAG by going public,
but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is an opportunity for
non-executives to make their point; however, that needs to be done in
the meetings of the NAO board, rather than in the public domain. That
is really more of a professionalism safeguard to make sure that the
authority of the CAG is not unwittingly
undermined.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000200">&#160;</a>

final point in the debate on the Bill. I am curious because page 38
contains a number of changes to the Corporate Manslaughter and
Corporate Homicide Act 2007, and simultaneously IPSA is mentioned in
paragraph 33. As hon. Members know, I should not have mentioned that
acronym in Committee. That now means that the sky will fall in and the
performance has been jinxed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000206">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions stretch quite a long way. Am I correct in presuming that the

some of the board members of IPSA needing certain qualifications to be

interesting points. In setting up the new corporate body for the NAO we
need to ensure that the other laws into which it needs to fit are
amended as appropriate. This part of the schedule contains a series of
consequential technical amendments to existing legislation, which
ensure that the establishment of the new NAO on a statutory footing
fits into the existing legal framework of other Acts.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000208">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Having
debated the Bill, we no longer need the original section of the Finance
Act. The Committee will be aware that much of the original legislation
that established the code for fiscal stability, for example, was set
out in an earlier Finance Act. Because the Bill overrides and renews
what was in the code by setting up not only the Office for Budget
Responsibility but the charter, we can now effectively rescind that
previous legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000216">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding
amendment 1, when a Bill starts its passage in the House of Lords a
privilege amendment is inserted by the Lords at its final printing. By
claiming that nothing in the Lords’ Bills imposes a charge on
the public funds or on the people, the amendment preserves the
financial privilege of the Commons to authorise such charges. Once a
money resolution has been passed by the Commons to authorise a charge
on public funds, which for this Bill took place after Second Reading in
the Commons, the privilege amendment is routinely removed by the
Commons at the first opportunity, having served its purpose, in other
words when the Bill is in Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11030414000217">&#160;</a>
