<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 179, in page 289, line 30, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) Where a pension sharing order or equivalent has been implemented the return of eligible contributions will be made to the member or if dead, the member's estate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 186, in page 306, line 24, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) Where a pension sharing order or equivalent has been implemented the return of eligible contributions will be made to the member or if dead, the member's estate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Paragraphs 8 and 28 of schedule 12 make it a requirement for a refund of contributions to be made if the member who paid them was not eligible so to do. The amendment, which relates to both paragraphs, is designed to make clear the position when a pension-sharing order or equivalent has been implemented, even if the relevant member is deceased. It is debatable whether all the moneys should be returned to the person who paid them or whether some apportionment should be made with the ex-spouse. In that sense, the amendment is a probing amendment, but it seems necessary for the position to be tied up and specified in the Bill in order to avoid the potential for massive dispute over the issue.

<P>
On consideration, it is almost impossible to have any other arrangement than that the money should be returned to the member who has paid it in error as it is not, and, therefore, should not have been, part of his pension scheme. The other financial arrangements that exist between the estranged parties can deal with the money involved. That point has not been tackled in the Bill; hence the amendments.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I believe that I can help the hon. Gentleman. I concluded that it was probably a probing amendment, although I was not sure.

<P>
Section 632A of the Taxes Act 1988 specifies the conditions under which people are eligible to contribute to a stakeholder or personal pension. Included in the section is a provision to ensure that any contributions paid when the member was not eligible to contribute are returned to the person who paid them. That will follow even if part of the pension rights has been transferred to an ex-spouse following a pension-sharing order. The refund will be paid from the remaining part of the scheme member's pension rights, and will be given to the scheme member, not his or her ex-spouse. I believe that that is the point on which the hon. Gentleman wants reassurance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary. The position is now clear. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 180, in page 289, leave out lines 46 to 48.

<P>
This amendment, too, is a probing amendment. It has been axiomatic in the Revenue for a long time that non-UK resident employees of a company cannot be members of a UK pension scheme. That was not a problem when businesses were not global, but it has become a material problem. We touched on that issue in relation to employee incentive schemes. If members of a UK-based group are employed elsewhere in the world, and therefore paid elsewhere, there cannot be any question of a refund of UK tax. Therefore, what is the tax problem associated with such people being members of the UK pension scheme during their sojourn abroad? Current arrangements permit a degree of temporary membership, which, on occasions, can be extended. I do not understand the basis of the Revenue's opposition, as, with proper organisation, no tax would be lost. Under the stakeholder arrangements, that outdated rule continues. I ask the Government to explain that, and to reconsider the matter.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for setting out his understanding of the amendment, although it is still not absolutely clear. I shall tell him my understanding of the amendment on a literal reading. Its effect is to restrict slightly the eligibility criteria for the payment of personal stakeholder pension contributions. People would not therefore be able to take out a pension in the first year in which they became resident and ordinarily resident in the UK, unless they had net relevant earnings or had been resident and ordinarily resident in the UK in one of the previous five years. That has little practical effect, which is why I suggest that the Committee rejects the amendment.

<P>
I was not sure whether the hon. Gentleman had in mind the intention to extend eligibility to non-UK residents.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman nods. Clearly, that would have far-reaching consequences. Alternatively, I wondered whether the hon. Gentleman's intention was to allow individuals to continue to pay into pensions when they go abroad. However, on the basis of my literal interpretation of the amendment, it does not have significant practical benefits.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment simply deletes the condition that in the relevant year the member is resident and ordinarily resident. It therefore raises the issue that, in a particular year, a member can be not resident and not ordinarily resident. I repeat that the context is simple. Certain Revenue indulgences enable people who are sent overseas for six or nine months to remain a member of their pension scheme. There is an increasing trend, especially in the European context, for people to work for the same group in different places, and, if they belong to the UK scheme while they are in the UK, but other provisions apply if they go to France or Hong Kong, that is a nightmare. I repeat my point that, with proper organisation, there is no fiscal loss in relation to permitting individuals to be members of a UK scheme.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would give me the benefit of his considerable expertise in these matters. If someone is employed by a UK company and has a non-contributory scheme, can that membership be maintained if the person is posted abroad?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That is the situation to which I alluded. There is a Revenue indulgence whereby it can be maintained, usually for a year or two but no longer. A five-year posting, for example, would be a problem.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I think that I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which is that he wants individuals to be able to continue to pay into pension schemes when they go abroad. I reassure him that changes that have already been introduced improve the position for those who go abroad and are non-resident in this country. In fact, people can continue to make stakeholder pension contributions and receive basic tax relief for up to five years after the year in which they cease to be a UK resident and ordinarily resident in this country, after which time the provision will expire. I hope that I have met the concerns expressed by the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary. Will she clarify that the new arrangements in the schedule mean that the Revenue tops up the tax relief and that the payment is made net of tax? Will that provision be extended to non-residents? At the back of my mind is the argument that perhaps that should not be the case, but that non-residents should remain members of the scheme. However, I took the hon. Lady to be saying that they will be subject to the tax benefit, too, for five years.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, the tax benefit would apply for the period that the non-residents can continue to make contributions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I tabled the proposal for probing purposes, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 181, page 290, line 17, leave out paragraph 9.

<P>
The changes proposed by the amendment would do a great deal more than merely switch the tax relief from the time of payment of the rate of insurance premium to the later time when the insurance payment is used to cover pension contributions. The provision discriminates against those who contribute larger amounts to their private pension provision by ensuring that, if there were a long period of ill health, disability or unemployment such that the recent history of net relevant earnings was low, the retirement benefits that can be provided from then on would be limited to those that can be bought for £3,600 per annum. A proper case has not been made for removing the tax relief from the premiums for waiver of contributions.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The current position is that up to 25 per cent. of pension contributions can be used to insure future contributions against sickness and incapacity. That reduces the amount of contributions going into the pension fund. Our proposals will directly boost the money entering people's pension funds rather than subsidising insurance contributions that reduce payments into the pension fund. In future, payments arising from a claim under the insurance policy will be subject to a tax benefit when they are paid into the pension fund. Like all other contributions, tax at the basic rate will be added to them. That means that a lower sum can be assured and that the change in the treatment of waiver insurance will not increase what is being paid. In fact, some companies have suggested that that might reduce the level of premiums.

<P>
Providers can now extend the insurance to cover other situations, such as unemployment and not only ill health. Overall, the arrangements that we are introducing will improve the existing provisions. We cannot therefore support the amendment, which would reintroduce the existing arrangements. I urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Economic Secretary will be aware that both the pension fund industry and the insurance industry are not happy with the arrangements. Separate pension and life insurance policies are frequently taken out by taxpayers and the life insurance policy may be paid on a monthly basis or in an annual contribution at the start of the tax year. Although it may be the taxpayer's intention to make sufficient personal pension contributions during the year to ensure that life insurance premiums do not account for less than 10 per cent. of the total, there are occasions when that can prove not to be the case. The insurance arrangements in paragraph 16 do not improve the situation. The problems that might arise on death would be prevented if the qualified life insurance premiums remained as the percentage of the available capacity of a tax year rather than of contributions actually made.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is worth pointing out that we have broadened tax relief and have done so at the best point, namely at the point at which the money goes into the fund. That should lead to cheaper waiver policies as well as extending the range to cover for things such as unemployment. I hope that I am persuading the hon. Gentleman that a number of benefits will result from our proposals.

<P>
<H5>8.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> First, I apologise to the Committee that I mentioned the insurance issues raised in paragraph 16, which will be dealt with in the next debate, under amendment No. 182. The two amendments go together, however.

<P>
We are not persuaded that the new arrangements are entirely satisfactory. The Economic Secretary knows that many in the life insurance and pensions industries have taken the matter up with the Government. When a taxpayer dies and a policy is claimed on, the premium may prove to be non-qualified because the taxpayer died before making it. The issue is not a major one, and we would not want to put it to a vote, but we ask the Government to consider it further before the Bill reaches its final stage. They should consult the industry about its discomfort with the new arrangements. I appreciate that they have mainly been motivated to improve the situation, as the Economic Secretary said, but there are the problems that I have highlighted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I just want to clarify something about the Economic Secretary's body language. My hon. Friend asked if the Government would give further consideration before the die was finally cast. The Economic Secretary nodded, but I was not sure whether that nod meant that she would definitely do so. Will she clarify the Government's position on that point?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I was actually nodding in agreement with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs when he said that he recognised the improvements that we were making by introducing the measure. I have listened carefully to his points, and we will always continue to consider matters and to investigate the need for fine tuning. However, I give no specific commitment that I will come back to the Committee with proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Flight to move amendment No. 182.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I apologise for dealing already with the territory covered under amendment No. 182, which is another insurance issue. Given the undertaking that the Government will consider further the concerns of the pensions and insurance industries, I do not want to move the amendment.

<P>
I beg to move amendment No. 183, in page 298, line 35, leave out paragraph 17.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 184, in page 298, line 38, leave out paragraph 18.

<P>
No. 185, in page 299, line 4, leave out paragraph 19.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments would prevent the proposed changes to carry-back and carry-forward arrangements. The Government claim that they offer an improvement to the present arrangements, but there are several practical problems for the self-employed. Their earnings may fluctuate and not be known, and the measure could leave them in a considerably worse position than under the present rules pertaining to carry back and carry forward. Our amendments would therefore prevent the changes in those rules.

<P>
When there is a regular premium contract-when premiums are payable monthly, or when annual premiums fall due in the last two months of the year-it should be possible for an election made by 31 January to include premiums to be paid under such a contract during the remainder of the tax year, as well as those paid before 31 January. The provisions do not envisage election before payment, but at the time of payment. If there are to be changes, it must be spelled out that elections can be made before payment, so as to cater for premiums paid under the regular premium contracts and to include those paid in the early part of the tax year.

<P>
What are the policy reasons for precluding the making of an election after payment of the premium, provided that election is made no later than the filing date? We feel that the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>at  the time when he pays the contribution,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should be replaced with a reference to an election made on or before 31 January.

<P>
There is a new facility to base contributions for the carry forward on the highest net relevant earnings figure of the six years up to and including the year of contribution. That is welcome, but we remain concerned at the abolition of carry-forward relief because contributions are restricted by reference to the earnings cap. That could seriously affect the level of pension provision able to be made by the self-employed, who devote significant portions of their taxable earnings to investment in their businesses and frequently have lumpy earnings records. The existing carry-forward relief has existed to accommodate such situations.

<P>
It would be unfair to change that so that such people should be deprived, due to other calls on funding in earlier years, of the opportunity to bring their pension provision to the same level as could have been achieved by using their full year-by-year entitlement. It would be especially unfair to those who have hitherto based their financial planning on the existing carry-forward rules in the expectation of being able to make use of brought-forward relief.

<P>
Carry-forward relief should be preserved, by not changing it at all or by other means, to continue the relief obtained. If the Government have set their face against so doing despite the unfairness that the change imposes, we would urge strongly that the abolition take the form of phasing out rather than a sudden cut-off.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to clarify my hon. Friend's generally clear exposition in one respect. Our final concern is for those who have legitimate expectations. Our amendment does not specifically cover them, as it seeks the more ambitious goal of the removal of the removal of the carry forward and the carry back.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household):</B> Carry on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We would rest content if the Economic Secretary could assure us that something will be done to grandfather those whose legitimate expectations will be falsified. As my hon. Friend said, one rather anaemic solution would be a phasing out, but it would certainly be acceptable if those who had not already used the carry forward that they would have had were to be allowed to use it in future.

<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friend agrees that we do not want to ensure that people who start fresh in future-those who have not contributed to a pension fund-should benefit from carry forward and carry back, given the other provisions in the Bill. I hope that the Economic Secretary will attend to that matter; otherwise, those people who seem to have no one to speak on their behalf will be treated unfairly. I doubt that they can riot successfully about it in Trafalgar square. My hon. Friend mentioned the lumpy earning, self-employed person. [
Interruption.] I really hope that that sedentary intervention was so amusing that the Government will reduce in volume. It is difficult to pursue the debate with repeated interruptions.

<P>
People's total pension entitlement on retirement may be affected significantly by the provision. For example, if they are close to the age of retirement and have had a recent period of low earnings, yet now have a period of high earnings and have been relying on them to build up a nest egg, that situation could have a disproportionate effect on their future retirement earnings. I hope that the Economic Secretary can solve the problem for such people.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall deal first with the carry-forward rules and explain where we are coming from and how the process will work. We have made such changes because we seriously wanted the system to be simpler. Some people have said that abolishing the carry-forward rule would be unfair, especially for those on fluctuating earnings, that the existing rule is easy to handle in practice and that removing it would be one simplification too far.

<P>
However, the existing rule is far from simple. It involves keeping records for a rolling six-year period of the maximum possible relief that a person could have claimed each year and the amount that that person actually claimed over that period. Furthermore, when a person has decided to use up all the previously unused tax relief, he must not have exceeded the overriding limit based on the total earnings for the year in which the carried-forward tax relief was being used up. Such a process was not simple, which is why so many mistakes were made.

<P>
I shall explain the way in which the new arrangements are simpler, because that is an attractive part of the scheme.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Economic Secretary say how many times the carry-forward facility was used in the previous tax year, so that we can gauge the number of people who used it? Can she tell us how many mistakes were made, so that we have some idea of the problem?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The number of total claims in that category may come to me in a moment. However, I can help the right hon. Gentleman with his second point. In audits, one in two of all carry-forward claims are found to be wrong. The system is used by about 3 per cent. of personal pension payers. Such a mistake is the most common source of error found by the Inland Revenue when auditing personal pensions. Taking out the carry-forward rule means that we can remove six pages from the Inland Revenue self-assessment return help sheet, which is a significant deregulatory burden. Eliminating that source of difficulty and error will help providers to reduce their costs and make pensions products easier to understand. The change has considerable advantages.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope that the Economic Secretary understands that we agree with that and have no difficulty with it if it relates exclusively to future pensions. She would achieve the benefit for which she hopes. We are simply worried about people who are caught in the existing trap.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, and I shall briefly respond to that point. The question of phasing is obviously complex. The hon. Gentleman mentioned passporting people through. People with unused relief have from September 1999, which was when the proposals were announced, until January 2002 to elect to use the relief, giving them some time to plan ahead. I hope that that deals with the anxiety that the hon. Gentleman expressed. Is he assenting to that? I do not want to spend time arguing the point with him if he is convinced of it.

<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am heartened that provision for phasing has been made, but I am not convinced that the provision covers future carry forward in the case of self-employed people, whose earnings may fluctuate. If I understood the Economic Secretary correctly, she said that 3 per cent. of people who have personal pensions have made use of the provisions. As, I believe, about 8 or 9 million people have personal pensions, that is a lot of people.

<P>
I agree and appreciate that the existing rules are a nightmare and need simplification, but I believe that in this case the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater. In the case of the carry-back arrangements, too, self-employed people often will not know about their taxable profits for the relevant year until the following December. Why are the Government insisting that the decision must be taken in advance? It should be possible to embody an on-going element of carry forward and create a carry-back regime that will not give people major problems because they do not know how much they may put in their pension schemes when they must decide.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have had many dealings with babies and bathwater, and I have always kept the baby and seen the bathwater go. He may find that reassuring.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman expresses particular interest in the position of people who are self-employed. About 1.1 million, or 88 per cent., of self-employed people make contributions of less than £3,600. Obviously, abolition of the link between stakeholder pension contributions and earnings will give them flexibility when they need to pay more, up to £3,600. For higher contributions, one year's earnings can validate the next five years' contributions. People can therefore pick a high-earning year in order to validate for the following five years, which removes much of the problem encountered with fluctuating earnings. The scheme meets the needs of self-employed people well.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In that five-year arrangement, how do people choose? Do they choose every five years for the previous five years? How does it operate?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I believe that I am right in saying-but, obviously, divine inspiration might change my mind-that people can either elect to pick up a high-earning year to validate for the following five years or retrospectively choose the highest year and pay back only for the period covered by the new carry-back arrangements. However, people will be able to pay forward for the rest of the period from the year elected to be the chosen point. I believe that that explanation is correct.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is extremely helpful. I had not understood that there was an ability to choose under paragraph 22, no doubt because I had not deconstructed it properly. Is the Economic Secretary referring to paragraph 22?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Economic Secretary has not satisfied me on the timing issue. Why could the pension carry-back claim not be made after the contributions, as current procedure allows? That would solve the year-to-year problem simply.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It may be useful for me to cover the carry back in more detail, as the hon. Gentleman is asking further questions.

<P>
The carry-back arrangement is that people must calculate their earnings for a tax year before the following 31 January when their tax returns are due. That is sensible and, as a good tie-in, aligns an earnings-related relief to the date when earnings must be quantified.

<P>
There is no need to delay electing to carry back. Contributions up to £3,600 can be made without reference to earnings, and allowing contributions to be based on the highest earnings in the previous five years gives certainty regarding contribution levels for the coming period. At the beginning of each year, an eligible contributor would therefore know the minimum payment that could have been made in the previous year. That will never be less than £3,600, so most people will know straight away what they can put in to top up their pension contributions for the previous year.

<P>
For the few who want to increase the level of their contributions using increased earnings in the previous year, a 10-month period is allowed by the self-assessment rules for quantifying what the earnings are. That will give people considerable flexibility without the complications to which the existing system has led.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I did in the previous debate, I shall make the point that the industry either has not fully understood the arrangements or is still not entirely happy on some counts. If the issues are solved in the way outlined by the Economic Secretary, especially the five-year maximum arrangement, there must be clear communication with the industry. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Thirteenth schedule to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The schedule is important. It raises some big issues and contains much that the Opposition support. It is intended to make group personal pension schemes and occupational money purchase schemes wither on the vine. As the same regime will be available as for stakeholders, companies will increasingly opt for the stakeholder formula and may in some cases even transfer into the schedule 13 arrangements.

<P>
There is a problem for occupational money purchase pension schemes, as the arrangements do not permit the flexibility to top up funding towards the end of someone's career if he or she is underfunded to date. The Government might think about that in relation to the new arrangements.

<P>
Anyone who heard about or saw ``Panorama'' last night will know that companies are largely shifting away from final salary schemes towards different forms of money purchase schemes, and probably towards using the schedule 13 arrangements. That rising tide of money purchase pensions-under which there is an eventual obligation to purchase an annuity at 75-has coincided with a virtual drying up of the supply of long-dated gilts, and, as a result of the Conservative Government's legislation, rising demand for them from occupational schemes. That has resulted in artificially low long-term interest rates and artificially high annuity costs. The annuity issue cannot therefore be ducked for much longer, especially when schedule 13 comes into force and accelerates the drive to money purchase pensions.

<P>
The Opposition have been committed to abolishing the obligation, and have supported the findings of a report produced under the leadership of Oonagh McDonald. We have waited for a response from the Government, but none has been forthcoming. A leak from the report on ageing-a small paragraph at the bottom-suggested that the annuity age would be extended to 80. I understand that that was not the Government's intention, and the Treasury still is not supportive of the idea. The issue needs to be addressed urgently, because of the massive shift away from the more generous final salary schemes towards the less well funded money purchase schemes that employers provide.

<P>
The second big issue is that of concurrence, which is highly technical. Participating in different forms of money purchase pension scheme at the same time is broadly permissible, but participating in final salary and money purchase schemes is not. There is a sound principle behind that, as final salary schemes do not have fixed scales of contribution depending on age; instead, they operate according to whatever contribution the actuary says is theoretically needed to meet the promise of the final salary scheme. In reality, however, such contributions often do not differ greatly. A strong view exists that if stakeholder arrangements are to be taken up by people who are not provided with an incentive to take them up, concurrence should be widened. The Economic Secretary will be aware of considerable lobbying on that front. The following groups cannot currently participate in concurrence: members of defined benefit final salary schemes; retirement annuity policyholders; members of occupational defined contribution schemes, the trustees of which have elected that the scheme remains subject to the defined benefit legislation; and members of occupational contribution money purchase schemes, which remain approved under the benefit limited regime.

<P>
I should be interested to know whether the Economic Secretary has anything to say on widening the concurrence territory. I understand that the Government want to make concurrence as wide as possible in order to help the stakeholder arrangements move ahead successfully. Much of the territory where concurrence might be possible-although there are problems, to which I have alluded-is currently excluded.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee long. I shall add two points to my hon. Friend's contribution.

<P>
First, I want to emphasise the importance of his remarks about annuities. We are distressed that nothing appears to have emanated from the Treasury in response to Oonagh McDonald's excellent set of propositions. The problem under discussion will afflict all of us, for a long time to come, under any regime. The Chancellor's extreme efforts at fiscal prudence, combined with his taxation policies and his current funding policies, are creating a serious technical deficiency of long-dated gilts. If the Government had a different fiscal policy or funding policy-or both-the Oonagh McDonald propositions would be important academically, but less practically urgent.

If the Government are intent on firms having a significant incentive to move towards money purchase schemes without changing their funding policy-which may not be feasible in the current circumstances, although it might be possible along the lines of Oonagh McDonald's proposals-a crisis will be imminent. It will visit on those nearing retirement and will worsen year by year. Funding policy alone will not prove to be a sufficient solution because the Chancellor's own projections in the Red Book are conservative. Almost everyone believes that, including I believe, the Chancellor himself. They are based both on the income and expenditure side; his fiscal surplus may even be greater than he predicts.

<P>
The Chancellor will have a dreadful problem at the short end of the gilt market if he switches significant funding to the long end. Furthermore, if he generates a significant additional surplus beyond that which he is currently projecting, he will find that no amount of movement by the funding committee will resolve the problem. Annuity rates will fall to an extent that will become a scandal. People will find that their pensions, for which they have saved hard throughout their lives and about which they had a reasonable expectation that they would be good pensions, are dreadful simply because of a technical deficiency. None of us should allow such a situation to materialise. The crisis will become more severe next year and perhaps excessively so the year after. There is not much time to be lost and we all urgently hope that the Government will reach a resolution. We are more than willing to conspire with them to find a solution to the problem because, if it occurs on a major scale, it will be almost irresoluble.

<P>
Let us consider those people who have been forced into buying annuity at a return of two or three percentage points. It will be difficult subsequently to buy them out of their misery. I can gesture mentally-as I am sure can the Economic Secretary-towards the most ghastly difficulties in separating people, as happened with the pensions from the mis-selling scandal where there were great problems in separating those who were genuinely deceived from those who were merely incautious. The same difficulties will occur and the problem will have to be addressed.

<P>
The Minister is a representative of a party that has been through a turmoil that was not generated by Conservatives, but happened under our stewardship. I draw to her attention that if there were to be a subsequent turmoil, generated in a well-intentioned way, but nevertheless by the Chancellor's policies and a failure to deal with Oonagh McDonald, the political consequences would be severe. A national interest is at stake, and from the Government's view, a political interest is also at stake. I hope that the hon. Lady will take my remarks in the spirit in which they are meant; I am not playing party politics, I am trying to achieve a reasonable result.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs is one of the country's leading experts in the matter of personal pensions and is most concerned to avoid some of the early-leaver problems that are associated with final salary schemes. I hope that he will forgive me, however, when I say that it is sad that the pendulum has swung as far as it has. I offer my next remark in the spirit of a possible erroneous prophecy: there will come a time when the Economic Secretary, if she is still in power and in the Treasury, will come back to a similar Committee and argue for steps to be taken to slightly adjust the balance. People may be encouraged to join money purchase schemes-with and without the annuity problem-who may later feel that it was not after all in their best interests to lose the flexibility that occupational pension schemes used to offer. By carrying on enthusiastically with a line of development that started under the previous Administration, the Government may be ignoring the warning signs that began then. However, if we are to take the route down which the schedule will rapidly lead us, we must deal with the annuity problem, which is the urgent test.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> First, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised the issue of concurrency. Full concurrency is unfocused and does not represent good value for money. It would give more tax relief to high earners who already receive significant relief on their pension contributions, and encourage providers to cherry-pick among the rich rather than persuading moderate earners to increase their pension cover, which is the main thrust of our policy.

<P>
We are grateful for the input that we have from employers, employees and pensions industry representatives, who worked hard to identify a better value approach than full concurrency that focuses on the relief for low to moderate earners. The term ``low to moderate earners'' belongs to the parlance of the Department of Social Security, so must be viewed in the context of that Department's definition of that group. We continue to consider whether limited concurrency is appropriate, and will make an announcement in due course. Any change that we want to make would be introduced as an amendment on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I wonder whether I correctly heard the Economic Secretary. Is she saying that she might reconsider the abolition of the facility to carry forward unused relief?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No, I was talking about the appropriateness of limited concurrency, and I said that we would introduce proposals on Report if we decided that we wanted to make an announcement on that subject. I think that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon probably misheard what I said; perhaps I should raise my voice.

<P>
Secondly, there are many issues surrounding the purchase of annuities, annuitisation and the supply of long-dated gilts, and this is not the moment at which to address all those issues at length. Hon. Members will be aware that we are keeping the issue under review. We are grateful for and are considering the report that Dr. Oonagh McDonald and the retirement income working party have produced. I note that Opposition Members are interested in the outcome of our considerations.

<P>
Other things are happening that are relevant to the debate. The minimum funding requirement review will come to a conclusion in a while. The Myners review, which the Chancellor commissioned at the time of the Budget, will report in time for the next Budget. The Government are actively considering all those issues, because we agree that they should be discussed and resolved. We shall obviously make any announcements at appropriate times.

<P>
I am grateful for the Opposition's offer to help us on the matter. The idea that the press could report a positive conspiracy between the Opposition and the Government to achieve something on the subject is tantalising. I am glad that the Opposition like our pension policy proposals. I am sure that they shall also like our savings policy when they hear that the background to stakeholders is one of individual savings accounts as a savings vehicle. The first year of ISAs has been a great success, with more than £28 billion placed in 9 million accounts. That is an increase of around a third on the £21.3 billion put into personal equity plans and tax-exempt special savings accounts in 1998-99. The past quarter's figure of £11 billion was far greater than in the previous quarters. As with stakeholders, that shows that people are attracted to the flexibility and choice that ISAs offer for tax-free saving. We believe that that shows a good result for the first year of ISAs, which will help people to save and possibly to move savings into stakeholders in the future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Economic Secretary's reference to ISAs has reminded me of the sister of ISA, the lifelong independent savings account or LISA. When the stakeholder proposals came out, the Treasury proposed arrangements that would create individual pensions savings accounts without trustee requirements. I understand that we might hear a little more on the subject in the next week or two. Can schedule 13 accommodate what was envisaged by the Treasury's original LISA proposals? Do the Government expect further amendments on the assumption that LISAs might come back to life, as might be possible in the not too distant future?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is for the hon. Gentleman to speculate. I cannot join him on this occasion.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Schedule 13 agreed to.

<P>
Clause 61 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Enterprise management incentives</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 154, in page 308, line 30, leave out ``within 30 days after'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within 90 days after the end of the Company's accounting period in which occurred'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
As we work our way through these many amendments, the Committee should bear in mind that some of them cover the same issues on schedules 14, 15, 17 and, in some cases, 18. The situation is therefore not quite so ghastly as it looks.

<P>
Amendment No. 154, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), is a simple and practical amendment that proposes that the 30-day period under which notice must be given to the Revenue for the award of a qualifying option be extended to 90 days. Many companies review options over Christmas holidays, so half of those 30 days may be lost. We cannot see any good common-sense reason for having a period as short as 30 days. Whether 90 days is ideal is debatable, but 30 days seems too short. It is also obviously important as to whether 30 days means 30 business days or 30 calendar days.

<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, the Bill allows 30 days in which to give notice to the Inland Revenue of the grant of an enterprise management incentive option. The amendment would extend that period to 90 days. It would allow a company to delay reporting the grant of an option for up to 15 months, as the period specified is 90 days from the end of the accounting period during which the option is granted. As a company may choose any date for its accounting period, if the EMI option were granted immediately after the start of a company's accounting period, the amendment would allow the company 12 months, to the end of that period, plus 90 days.

<P>
Under the existing approved company share option plan, which the previous Government introduced, options must be approved before they can be granted. That does not seem to have caused problems for the companies that have set up the 5,022 plans currently registered with the Inland Revenue. EMIs are designed to be even more straightforward than approved schemes. Companies will not have to send in options for approval before they are granted. One of the few administrative requirements is that the company must give the Inland Revenue notice of an option within 30 days of granting it.

<P>
The Bill specifies the details that the notice must contain, which include confirmation that the option meets the qualifying requirements at the time that it is granted. Extending the reporting period for as long as 15 months would mean that the company and its employee would have to keep records over that period to ensure that they can provide the information retrospectively. If they are going to do that, I do not see the problem with their sending the information to the Revenue at the time.

<P>
It might be argued that people who run small, developing businesses are busy and need more time to take care of such matters. However, it is difficult to see how their time would be less pressing as their business developed; I should have thought that the opposite would be true.

<P>
The amendment does not seem to be justified. Giving notice to the Revenue imposes no great burden on the company. The requirements are straightforward. A simple specimen notice is available on the Revenue's share schemes website for companies to use and can be downloaded free of charge. All that companies have to do is complete and send it, along with a copy of the option agreement, to the Inland Revenue. Drafting the option agreement is likely to be a far more time-consuming process than notification to the Revenue.

<P>
It is not clear why a company should require as long as 90 days following the end of the accounting period to fill in a simple form and send it in. Moreover, I cannot understand why the time for giving notice should be related to the accounting period. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, but if he does not, I invite the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her response. In my experience, options are usually granted at the end of a financial year, as part of a process of reviewing remuneration, among other matters. It is generally rather a hasslesome time for companies, involving finalising the annual accounts, conducting salary reviews and sorting out option arrangements. As the Economic Secretary pointed out, under the present arrangements, options must be pre-approved. Although that may be a hassle, at least when granting the option people know that it is for real.

<P>
My anxiety is that under the arrangements staff who have been granted options may subsequently discover that the company secretary failed to notify the Revenue in time and that the options are invalid. That seems unsatisfactory. The suggestion of a longer time period is intended purely to reduce that possibility.

<P>
I pose the question another way. What would happen if the staff had received all the documentation but the company secretary was a week late under the 30-day rule? Do the Government propose that in such circumstances the Revenue should have some sort of sensible flexibility, or might people wake up to find that the options that they have been told that they have been given are not valid because, unfortunately, the company secretary blew it?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I still believe that 30 days is plenty of time in which to notify the Revenue. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman invites me to endorse inefficient company secretaries or expects us to take action against inefficiency and people who are clearly not doing their jobs. As I said, the notification process is simple. The details can be sorted out before offering the option, too, so notice does not have to be given at the last minute. I am sure that the Revenue would accept a good reason, but it would not make allowances for incompetence, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman would not expect that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Economic Secretary has given me the answer that I was looking for. If a good and fair reason is given, people's options will not necessarily be invalidated. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 188, in page 311, line 2, leave out from ``reasons'' to ``and'' in line 3.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 189, in page 311, line 5, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) Sub-paragraph (1) shall not apply where before an option is granted the Board have on the application of the relevant company notified the company that the Board are satisfied that the option will be granted for bona fide commercial reasons and not as part of such scheme or arrangement as is described in sub-paragraph (1).

<P>
(3) The provisions of subsections (2) to (5) inclusive of section 138 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 shall mutatis mutandis apply to any application made under this Paragraph save that for the first reference in subsection (5) of that section to ``Special Commissioners'' there shall be substituted a reference to ``General Commissioners or if the relevant company so elects (in accordance with section 46(1) of the Taxes Management Act 1970) the Special Commissioners'' and for the second reference to ``Special Commissioners'' there shall be substituted a reference to ``General Commissioners or Special Commissioners (as the case may be)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Committee will be aware, the purpose test for the new enterprise investment scheme has been criticised. That test may make it difficult for a company to know whether its scheme will be accepted as qualifying. There are two ways of ameliorating that problem. One would be to get rid of the difficult words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in order to recruit or retain a key employee in a company,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which appear in the test and which are reflected subsequently in replacement options, whereby the test is to be met even at the time of replacement. Alternatively, the test could be supplemented with a clearance procedure that would enable the Revenue to say whether it thought that a bona fide commercial activity was contemplated. That would also provide certainty for the taxpayer and the recipient. The appeal procedure would then mirror the ordinary procedure provided under the scheme.

<P>
The present arrangements are troublesome on both counts-on the lack of certainty and on the difficulty of defining the ``key employee''. Are the Government willing to consider some form of revenue approval arrangement as an alternative?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As hon. Members will hear in relation to several amendments tabled under the schedule, the policy behind EMI has largely been shaped by what business experts say is needed. They say that dynamic, growing companies need to be able to offer tax-advantaged share incentives to encourage high calibre people to move from safe jobs in mature companies to join smaller, more risky companies. EMI will help those small high-risk companies to recruit and retain key employees with the skills needed to make those companies succeed and grow.

<P>
The amendment would alter paragraph 9 of schedule 14, which sets out a statement of the Government's intent and makes it crystal clear that the EMI is about recruiting and retaining key employees. It uses simple language that has its ordinary meaning. There can be no difficulty in understanding the terms ``recruit'' and ``retain'', which need no further definition. A ``key employee'' is one who makes an essential contribution to the business of the company, which is best placed to decide who can make such a contribution. It would be unhelpful and restrictive to attempt a further definition in the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 189 would introduce an Inland Revenue clearance procedure in which the Revenue would provide confirmation to the company that the option would be granted for genuine commercial reasons and not for tax avoidance. The schedule is a product of extensive consultation and, of all the representations received about the draft legislation, none proposed to introduce a clearance procedure. Respondents favoured the notification approach for its flexibility and ease of use.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Am I not right that there are certain transactions in company shares of a general nature that require prior approval by the Revenue to meet the section 508 anti-avoidance requirements? A precedent exists that would meet the requirements of my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. Can the Economic Secretary refresh my memory?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall be happy to refresh the right hon. Gentleman's memory in a moment. I was about to say that, when talking about the scheme's flexibility and its ease of use, the Confederation of British Industry said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We believe that by its very nature, the scheme will be self-regulating.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Surely Opposition Members support that. The CBI emphasised:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In designing the detailed rules for the scheme, self-regulation by existing shareholders should be the overriding principle.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Responsibility lies with companies to ensure that the option meets the requirements of the schedule. The Inland Revenue will be happy to provide guidance to help companies and their advisers to ensure that they are acting within the rules.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde asked about the relationship of the scheme to other procedures. Under the EMI, the purpose of a plan must be to recruit and retain employees. With company reorganisation, there can be a multitude of reasons for the change in its structure. We must consider the facts in each case, however, to decide whether those reasons are acceptable or whether there is an avoidance motive that should rule out the relief on offer. A clearance procedure is therefore appropriate in such cases, but not with regard to EMI overall.

<P>
EMI is designed to ensure that there is a minimum of red tape for companies, so that they can get on with what they do best-running the businesses. A clearance procedure would add complication and costs, and slow down the way in which EMI works. Those running the company-not the officials of the Inland Revenue-are best placed to know the reason why they want to grant the option. How can it help businesses to have to give chapter and verse to the Revenue each and every time they grant an EMI option? Is that really a good use of people's time? It serves only to penalise the honest. And even for those who might be looking to use EMI for tax avoidance motives, it would provide no comfort. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My interest in the matter has been sparked by our exchanges. In its submission to members of the Committee, the Law Society made an interesting point when it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This dual requirement is unreasonable given the terms of the rest of the legislation. If the Revenue are concerned about the abuse of this valuable relief, then they should announce that if there is abuse a provision of this nature may be introduced.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Economic Secretary may say that that would be bolting the door almost before it has been opened. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs is suggesting a way in which to establish certainty in the actions of companies. I am intrigued by how the options that are to be granted would be tested in reality.

<P>
Let us imagine that someone was out to recruit a person in the circumstances described by the Economic Secretary and a deal was being done in a hotel between a go-getting marketing director and the managing director of the entrepreneurial new enterprise at which it was said, ``I cannot afford your £150,000 salary, so to get hold of me you will have to carry out the deal in share options.'' Such a deal may be clothed in a wrapper that looks like recruitment, but in reality it is to do with reward. I do not believe that it will be easy in reality to differentiate between the two deals. One could use the same logic in the case of retention. If the Revenue asked a company what its motives were, what kind of proof will be required to satisfy the Revenue that the options are qualifying options, in terms of the schedule? If the wording of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs had been followed, there would be certainty, because the terms of the scheme would be given to the Revenue, in a way that resembles the operation of the anti-avoidance scheme for certain types of share transaction. The Revenue considers the matter and says yes or no.

<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I accept the Economic Secretary's point that the scheme is supposedly simple, but it is odd that while one part of the Revenue is giving the tick for certain types of share transaction, another is telling us, ``It is up to you to work out whether the scheme qualifies.'' I am not certain what tests the Revenue will use during examinations to decide whether schemes are valid under the terms of paragraph 9.

<P>
We need to decide why we need the paragraph in the light of what the Law Society says and how the scheme will operate, given the contradiction in terms of certainty versus uncertainty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We greatly welcome the scheme and know that companies need such schemes if they are to find good people. We do not deny that the Government have received the response described. I was trying to get at the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde. The problem under the arrangements is that one may put a scheme in place, give out options to certain people who work jolly hard then-oops!-five years later the Revenue may decide that the scheme is not bona fide, because one person is not a key executive and is simply having a free ride as chairman, or some such reason. That is the certainty problem.

<P>
I thought that the Economic Secretary said that she envisaged some form of informal clearance, but I may not have picked up the comment correctly. I have no objection to informal rather than formal clearance. It is great that the scheme is easy, quick, streamlined, not too bureaucratic and so on, but it is no good if, as time goes by, the participants do not know whether it will qualify. That is the circle that has not been squared.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has asked some weird questions this evening. I hope that he is not asking us to square any circles, as that is tricky. I said that the Inland Revenue would provide guidance to help companies and their advisers to ensure that they are within the rules. People will be able to check with it.

<P>
On its website, the Inland Revenue has already provided guidance based on the draft legislation. Because of the overlap with the EIS and the venture capital trust rules, there is already a lot of experience on matters such as what counts as a qualifying trace. Many of the issues are covered by those rules, and people can draw on that experience when dealing with the new arrangements.

<P>
Did the right hon. Member for Fylde suggest that people might skew their remuneration in terms of share options?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The point that I was getting at was that paragraph 9 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An option is a qualifying option only if it is granted for commercial reasons in order to recruit or retain.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When private discussions take place between the company management and the person that they want to bring into the company, what is said between them to cobble together an acceptable deal might not coincide with whatever definition of recruitment or retention is being used. Ultimately, money, or pay, is the issue. Shares-or options-and pay may have been manipulated to be put in a wrapper of recruitment, even though the real motive was pay.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Both recruitment and retention are issues, and firms must make decisions within the framework of Inland Revenue guidance. The purpose is to allow schemes to be flexible enough to decide which of their staff are key, and to recruit and retain them using the EMI package. The hon. Gentleman may not be concentrating sufficiently on the potential cost to the company. Clearly, if the share options are exercised, and the shares have increased in value, there could be a large payout to key staff. However, the joy of such a scheme is that it will lead to such payouts only if the company is successful, thereby linking success with remuneration. Such a recruitment and retention arrangement is therefore worth while.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will accept that there is no reason to be anxious. In response to the point that lawyers like certainty, the clearance procedures will, ultimately, produce total certainty. The cost in time and effort is unnecessary and counterproductive for those companies granting options to recruit and retain key employees. We have listened to business, and we have struck the right balance. Business wants this kind of scheme, which is simple and straightforward to operate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am happy that the Economic Secretary indicated that the Inland Revenue will be providing guidance. Even if it is not full clearance, it substantially addresses my point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 190, in page 311, line 8, leave out ``100,000'' and insert ``250,000''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 191, in page 311, line 18, leave out ``100,000'' and insert ``250,000''.

<P>
No. 192, in page 311, line 27, leave out ``100,000'' and insert ``250,000''.

<P>
No. 193, in page 325, line 50, leave out ``100,000'' and insert ``250,000''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As has been confirmed, the objective of the scheme is to attract and motivate top-flight executives whom smaller businesses especially might not otherwise be able to afford. Executives may be required to work for a period before the fruits of their labour are seen, and to work for considerably less than their market-rate salaries. The £100,000 limit on option value at grant is on the low side, certainly by north American standards, if it is to encourage executives to join higher-risk businesses at significantly lower pay. That is the reason for our suggestion-it is echoed by the amendments in different places-that the figure should be increased to £250,000 per executive.

<P>
I cannot resist commenting in the light of my experience. During the past 20 years, I was involved in building a business using the prior option scheme. The team of people involved had options and had to work for 10 to 12 years at about half their market rate of remuneration before reaping the fruits of their efforts. To attract key people, it would be necessary to have more than £100,000 available.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I hope that the Economic Secretary will comment on the contrasting situation for types of companies other than those envisaged for the scheme under discussion. For example, under an unapproved share scheme, significant numbers of options can be granted to executives and senior employees but without some of the laudable objectives of this scheme. Does the Economic Secretary think that an established enterprise should be able to be more generous than the embryo company that the scheme seeks to encourage?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The EMI scheme is generous and will be by far the most generous approved share option available in the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is nodding enthusiastically at that point. The company share option plan, by comparison, has a limit based on a total of £30,000-worth of shares; obviously, there is a quantum leap to be made from that to the £100,000 that we are discussing. Opposition Members should remember that the options will be granted by small companies with gross assets of something like £15 million or less and that £100,000-worth of shares in such companies could constitute a significant amount of the enterprise. Holders of EMI options stand to gain substantially, free of income tax, if they succeed in making their company grow.

<P>
There is no evidence that such an increase as the amendment proposes would make the EMI more successful. During the consultation process that led to EMI, most respondents had no problem with the £100,000 limit and felt that it would be more than sufficient to entice key employees to small, growing companies. Moreover, unlike the large merchant banks and City firms, with which hon. Members are perhaps more familiar, few small companies would be prepared to offer options of that size. Even under the old executive share option scheme, which allowed companies of any size to offer shares worth up to £100,000 or four times the salary, whichever was greater, the average option was around £25,000-worth of shares.

<P>
I am sure that Opposition Members will recall how the previous Government scrapped that scheme because it served only to reward executives in large-risk firms. So concerned were they at the time about the excesses of fat cats that they originally proposed a new limit of £20,000, which, under pressure, they increased to the £30,000 that I mentioned. We are prepared to be far more generous than that, but only to the small higher-risk companies who need EMI to help them to grow. Extending the amount would simply feed money, staff and skills to lower-risk companies rather than to the high-risk companies that we want to assist.

<P>
The amendment is unnecessary and would probably cost around £15 million in addition. I suggest that the Committee rejects it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The scheme is undeniably attractive and makes up for the abolition of the old option scheme to which the Economic Secretary referred. I do not know whether the Government intend to index the £100,000 but, within the new economy and the companies with which I am familiar, that figure is not much for a key executive. Companies would certainly have to find more than that to attract a chief executive, who is a key individual. I am surprised that if, as the Economic Secretary says, the cost would be only £15 million, the Government do not want to earn praise for going the whole hog and providing the sort of schemes available in the United States. We do not want to put the matter to a vote but, in our view, if one introduces such an attractive scheme, one should make the amounts per individual sufficient to make it succeed completely. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 194, in page 312, leave out lines 1 to 3.

<P>
This is, in a sense, a probing amendment. It is understood that the scheme is intended to apply to a limited number of key executives, but what is so magic about the number 15? Depending on the nature of the business, 15 could be too few or too many. Surely it would be possible to be slightly more flexible rather than set in stone the number 15?

<P>

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman suggests, the amendment would allow any number of employees to be granted EMI options. The scheme is supposed to involve key employees. It is hard to imagine how everyone, even in smaller companies, could constitute key employees.

<P>
We cannot accept the amendment because it goes against the aim of EMI and our philosophy and approach. The advice that we have received on the matter-

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The chief executive of such a company is not going to want to give away any more than he has to in order to attract the key people that he needs. The people who control such schemes will be motivated not to involve more people than they can avoid involving, because doing so might result in dilution. One possible approach would be not to specify a particular number. If the Government remain worried that the provision might be abused, might a way be found-as I said, it is a probing amendment-to avoid specifying that inflexible number of 15?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not suggest specifying a different number. He is cheating, because he has not proposed an alternative number. The notion that some employees are key but no limit should be specified rebounds on the notion that key employees exist at all.

<P>
The proposal was the result of several reports that we received, first, from the Bank of England on financing technology-based firms, secondly, from the Confederation of British Industry on ``tech stars'', and thirdly, from the Government's own study group, which was chaired by Sir Peter Williams, chairman of Oxford Instruments plc. All the reports found that the main barrier to growth experienced by smaller high-risk start-up business was the lack of highly qualified and motivated key employees, as I constantly emphasise. They recommended targeted tax relief, not general relief for companies, which is, in effect, what the hon. Gentleman proposes.

<P>
We received several representations in support of that point. In its representations last year, 3i said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We believe the number of key employees suggested, i.e. six, is about right but we would prefer it to be ten.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of the extent of public consultation that has taken place on the matter, as early announcements were followed by draft clauses made available for examination. Following the publication of the draft rules last November, the British Venture Capital Association expressed its support for an increase in the number of key employees specified from six to 10. At that time, the CBI, too, told us:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We welcome the confirmation of the basic scheme as originally suggested and also the extension of the number of participants to 10.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A large firm of advisers said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We agree that there is a limit to the number of key people that a smaller company needs to attract in order to make it grow.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We have gone further than the number 10 to which several of those respondents referred, and have increased it to 15. It would make a nonsense of the proposal, and would make the proposal a great deal less effective, if we were to remove the ceiling. By specifying 15 we are being generous in identifying key employees. We are dealing with small businesses, and the proposal will give firms the flexibility to identify 15 key personnel.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are grateful for small mercies and that the figure is 15, rather than 10. I remain of the view that the focus is the result of the wrong approach to the matter. Businesses will want to restrict numbers to those that are necessary. However, it is not an issue on which we need spend time voting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give an undertaking that she will keep an eye on one particular type of enterprise that may not have been in the minds of those who commented? Just because a large number of organisations put forward a figure that the Government better, it does not necessarily mean that the Government cannot do even more. I can envisage a situation arising, not so much with a start-up company, but with a management buy-out from a moribund company when a partnership arrangement was formed with those involved in the management buy-out and when a number greater than 15 would be an appropriate way in which to operate.

<P>
Let us suppose that a group of employees had decided to use their redundancy money to buy an enterprise and wanted to share collectively in its growth. They may satisfy the requirements of a recruitment and retention scheme-especially the retention aspect-but it would be difficult for, say, a group of 40 or 50 employees to decide who were the 15 key employees. If one were looking to develop and enhance business, circumstances other than start-up companies should be encouraged. I understand the hon. Lady's argument in the context of start-up and high-tech companies and I take her point, but other types of enterprises should be monitored to see whether in time, the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs might have greater application.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> All employee share option plans are available with tax relief. The right hon. Gentleman posited circumstances in which a group of 40-odd employees may have difficulty deciding which 15 employees should receive the relief. Under a company share option plan, all can have options in the company and alternative arrangements can be made. We have incentivised a way that industry agrees will be most effective and the limit of 15 key employees is the right path to go down. I note the concerns of the right hon. Gentleman, but obviously officials in the Inland Revenue will always be monitoring policies to see how they are working out on the ground.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendments Nos. 195 and 197 would change the gross assets test. The Economic Secretary will agree that it has been criticised significantly, first, for there being an element of gross rather than net and, secondly, because it is too small. Given United States businesses and depending on whether businesses are capital intensive or not, there is no logic in the requirement of companies having £15 million of gross assets. Our amendments would cover all unlisted companies and those with listings of up to £100 million market capitalisation. Those are still small companies by any measurement and they are very much businesses that need certain talent to drive them forward. While Conservative Members are great supporters of small businesses, it is wrong to think that only the tiny companies-those with £15 million of gross assets-drive an economy forward, when it is certainly those of the size suggested in our amendments. I hope that the Economic Secretary will say that the Government may at least reconsider the test of £15 million of gross assets, which she may agree has attracted some criticism.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 240 to 243 address similar territory and would double the size requirement for the corporate venture scheme from £16 million to £32 million. That would make more sensible the range and size of businesses for which the incentives are appropriate. Amendment No. 274 would increase the figure to £32 million for EIS investments that have rested on the gross assets test. The Economic Secretary must be aware of the widespread unhappiness of the venture capital industry in dealing with EIS, owing to the modest size that is permitted.

<P>
The various increases that we propose are a long way from the abuses to which the Economic Secretary referred when she spoke of fat cats in established old economy companies. A business that fell within the category defined by our figures would be a small one of the size that, in the United States, has received the enterprise incentives that have enabled the economy of that country to do so well in the past decade.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have a few small points to make about amendment No. 197 and the gross assets requirement. The amendment does not necessarily refer to small companies but, for the sake of simplicity, we should be clear that the companies that we are discussing are small and will not want to spend too much money on legal and accounting fees. It would help both the Committee and those companies to know more about how gross assets are to be determined. Presumably they will be determined in audited accounts subject to the practices of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and the Revenue will be able to challenge account figures. I believe that the Committee and the companies that will take advantage of the relief, of which I hope that there will be many, would like to know exactly how they will stand in relation to a challenge by the Revenue. How will matters change when the assets of the company increase from £15 million? What effect will that have on the benefits that have been acquired from the relief?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> It may be best if I begin by discussing the EMI amendments, which would abolish the size test altogether for unquoted companies and would exclude only those quoted companies with a market capitalisation in excess of £100 million. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs has mentioned the doubling of the limits-

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Economic Secretary kindly said earlier that she would speak up a little. Some of us at this end of the Room are on the deaf side.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have to say-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If hon. Members were quieter, they might hear more clearly.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon for his remarks. It has seldom been said that my voice is too quiet, so it is a pleasure to have that complaint levelled at me.

<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The changes proposed would mean that in no sense would the schemes remain targeted on the small companies for which they were intended. The costs involved would considerably increase as well. For EMI, the changes would undermine the policy of the scheme, which is to help the smaller, more risky companies to recruit and retain the key employees that they need to make them grow, especially if the same benefits could be obtained by staying put. An unlisted company for which there would be no test of size under the proposal could be large. Some private companies, if quoted, could be large enough to be considered for the FTSE 100.

<P>
Market capitalisation would be unreliable as a test for quoted companies. A newly floated company, for example, may have a high share price but no profits and few assets. The small companies at which EMI is aimed often have volatile share prices, and some of the small dot.coms that would otherwise qualify would be excluded because of their large market capitalisations. The proposal would run the risk of excluding the very companies that EMI is designed to help.

<P>
The enterprise investment and corporate venturing schemes, which encourage equity investment in small companies, are targeted in that way because smaller companies experience the greatest difficulty in raising funds for growth and development, and benefit most from corporate venturing relationships.

<P>
By no stretch of the imagination do I believe that a company with gross assets of £30 million can be regarded as small. Raising the requirement in that way would open the scheme to much larger companies, which do not share the same problems in raising finance. Worse still, because such companies are more secure, bringing them into the scope of the scheme would divert funds away from the small companies that incur greater risks. The purpose of the scheme would be undermined and costs would escalate sharply.

<P>
The gross asset requirement of £15 million to £16 million was introduced for EIS as recently as 1998, and was adopted for CVS because the focus of both schemes was the same. Our policy is to keep the rules of the venture capital schemes in line so far as possible, for obvious reasons of simplicity for all concerned. We keep the requirement under review, but it is too soon to consider an increase. An increase of this magnitude would be inappropriate, as it would completely destroy the small business focus of the scheme. The amendments would vastly increase the costs and undermine the purpose of the scheme, so I hope that the Committee will reject the proposals.

<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon made a point about the gross asset test and how companies apply it. The test has been used for EIS and VCT for the past six years and has not produced any problems. The Inland Revenue's statement of practice was last updated in 1998, and will be extended to cover EMI and CVS. There are no problems in practice from the EIS and VCT rules. Normally, the figures from ordinary balance sheets are used.

<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised the question of the gross assets limit. Did he argue that net assets were better?

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My point was that gross assets make for a strange measure, as there may be tiny net assets. Also, the degree of gearing will vary depending on the nature of business. There seems to be no great logic for the figure of £15 million of gross assets, other than simply inheriting it from the EIS regime. If we wanted to copy the success of the US, and were to stand back and ask what sort of business we wanted to get going in this country, the conclusion would be that £15 million of gross assets did not provide a definition at all. Our suggestions may have been too wide for the reasons that I have articulated.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> My concern about the net assets notion, which the hon. Gentleman attempted to argue for-indeed, ``attempted'' describes his position well-is that it could include a large company with great debts and borrowings. It would not be a good way in which to focus on those companies that we want to target. Setting any limit is an arbitrary matter and I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that it makes good sense to pick a figure that is working well in other contexts and one that has been only recently used. It will enable simplicity throughout the system because it relates to existing arrangements. I shall be encouraging him to withdraw the amendment because it would not take forward the proposals in the way that we would wish.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Presumably, the gross assets test is applied annually. If, and when, the £15 million limit is exceeded, will the Economic Secretary explain the effect on the rolled-up benefits that have accrued up to that date?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The test is taken when the investment is made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> So when the investment is made, a company must then do the accounts. Is that what the Minister is saying?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The existing accounts at the time would form the base. Presumably, the last existing set of accounts would be the relevant accounts. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman in more detail about the matter if that would be helpful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Minister tell us what happens to the benefits that had already accrued before the £15 million gross value test is exceeded?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> There will not be any loss of relief-if that is the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. CVS is raising money only, so exceeding the limit will not jeopardise the relief. I hope that that is helpful, but if the hon. Gentleman has any remaining points on which he wants information, I shall be happy to write to him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Let us suppose that the investment was made and the relief is being given. If the company exceeds the limit, will the relief still remain?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We shall press the amendment to a Division, not because we consider that our proposals are necessarily the correct ones, but because we feel strongly that the sum of £15 million is too small and undermines substantially what the Government are trying to do. They are trying to create a fully entrepreneurial economy like the United States, and it would not be correct to focus it on the bottom layer. The provision must include the layer that is slightly above that.
