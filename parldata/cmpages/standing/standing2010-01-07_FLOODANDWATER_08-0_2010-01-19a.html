Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): May I welcome you to
the Chair, Mr. Martlew? It is a pleasure to serve again
under your chairmanship.</div>
<a name="1001204000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The biggest
change under clause 22 is the change of status of regional flood and
coastal committees from advisory to
consultative.</div>
<a name="1001204000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000581"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Will you speak up a
little?</div><a name="1001204000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000582"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b>
Indeed.</div><a name="1001204000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister justify the impact that the change to the regional flood
and coastal committees&#146; status would have in each region? Under
the clause, what direction would potentially be given by the
Environment Agency to local communities? Will the Minister assure us
that, through subsection (2), the Government are not seeking to
overrule either local communities or the role of the Environment
Agency? We are putting down a marker to show that we are concerned by
the change in status of the regional flood and coastal committees. Is
the Minister minded to lay before the House the regulations that he
proposes in subsection (2), so that we might be able to debate them in
the usual
way?</div><a name="1001204000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001204000583"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship again, Mr.
Martlew.</div><a name="1001204000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want the Minister to address two issues in the clause. One is a general
concern that what people agree is a valuable route to local democratic
involvement in the flood risk management process may be diminished by
the arrangements for regional flood and coastal committees. In the NHS,
the parlance now is about expert patients. In many fields, it is
recognised that the people who actually experience a problem may have
insight that even the best academics and professionals sometimes cannot
impart. It is valuable to have a route for local people to have a
formal role in the flood risk management process. Until now, regional
flood defence committees have been one such route&#151;I have met
local councillors who have expert knowledge, even though they may not
have the professional qualifications of a hydrologist with a complex
mapping system at their disposal. Computer models do not know
everything and such committees have an important
role.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div><a name="1001204000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
hear from the Minister a clear expression of how the regional flood and
coastal committees will fit between the national oversight role of the
Environment Agency and the new lead local responsibility of the local
authorities. Ultimately, I am asking what the Government see as the
purpose of these new committees. In a sense that is not clearly defined
on the face of the Bill; we are left to infer
it.</div><a name="1001204000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second specific concern is over the subsection of this clause that
gives the Secretary of State power to establish the regions in which
these committees are based. We are all familiar with Government
regions, some of which are not appropriate at all, certainly not for
something of this scale. The hon. Members for Tewkesbury and for Stroud
and I labour within the south-west Government region, which places
Tewkesbury in the same region as somewhere it is as close to as
Scotland&#151;the Isles of Scilly. That is a crazy scale of region; I
hope that is not what is envisaged for these regional flood and coastal
committees.</div><a name="1001204000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Organisations
involved with the Blueprint for Water campaign have suggested that the
natural regions for regional flood and coastal committees should be
based on water catchment areas. That seems to be a natural and very
sensible thing to do and one which would reinforce the thrust of the
remarks that I have been making since the beginning of the Committee
stage.</div><a name="1001204000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001204000584"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): I am interested in
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal. May I find out whether he is in
favour of the Severn, including that part which is in Wales, being in
one
unit?</div><a name="1001204000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000585"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman may have got the better of me.
I am not absolutely sure where I would draw the boundary based on water
catchment, and I have not really sat down with a map and thought that
through. The Severn vale seems a logical area, but I am not sure
whether that would include the Wye. I would leave that up to people
more expert than me. The thrust is, again, that we should wherever
possible try to work with nature and look at natural landscapes. The
obvious regional designation in this case would be water catchment
areas and water basins. It would be very welcome if the Minister
committed to that now. If he does not find that possible, will he at
least say that he would treat that suggestion
sympathetically?</div>
<a name="1001204000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000586"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> Some good issues have been
raised. Let me deal with the issue of the boundaries and that of
Wales.</div>
<a name="1001204000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The boundaries
of the regional flood defence committees were fixed under the
Environment Act 1995. They reflected the boundaries that had existed
previously under the National Rivers Authority and, before that, the
water authorities. On the matters under discussion and the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about catchment areas, there is absolutely no
benefit in continuing to fix the boundaries rigidly from the centre.
Committee areas would need to take account of a range of factors,
including the natural factors relating to river catchment areas and
coastal erosion, the size and scale that is feasible and practical for
committees to work on, and administrative boundaries. That approach
would be in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div>line with the Environment Agency&#146;s current advisory committees
dealing with environmental protection and fisheries, the areas of which
are determined by the Environment Agency under the Environment Act
1995.</div>
<a name="1001204000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raised the issue of whether there should be one single
committee that is wholly and mainly for Wales. Currently, there is one
flood defence committee on Wales, and the Environment Act 1995 provides
that in relation to the other statutory committees. One of the
committee regions consists wholly or mostly of Wales. However, we do
not see a need to require that there is only a single committee for
Wales. For example, it may be sensible to have two or more committees
that cover the whole of Wales between them. We need to retain the
flexibility for now and the future.</div>
<a name="1001204000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question about the role of local people, we will
continue to make sure that there is a local role through the RFCCs.
They will continue to have local authority membership, which we can
perhaps talk more about when we come to the various amendments and the
subsequent clause. In schedule 2, an additional provision for local
authorities&#146; scrutiny increases the scope for public
participation.</div><a name="1001204000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York raised the issue of the change in
executive status of regional flood defence committees&#151;I am sure
that we will return to that too. The current requirement for the
Environment Agency to carry out its flood defence functions through
regional flood defence committees creates blurred responsibility
between the agency and those committees. It is a fuzzy edge. It also
creates potential conflict when it comes to the allocation of funding
by the EA and the achievement of Government targets. That arrangement
was appropriate when committees raised the majority of flood defence
funding through the local levy. However, that has not been the case
since 2004, when a system of direct grant from central Government to
the agency was introduced. Therefore, the Bill aims to bring the law
into line with the present and the intended funding arrangements.
However, it also brings matters more into line with the Environment
Agency&#146;s existing consultative committees, which are entirely
advisory, although the regional flood and coastal committees will have
decision-making powers relating to local funds.</div>
<a name="1001204000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that is a helpful
explanation.</div><a name="1001204000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001204000587"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): I was not sure of
the answer to a question asked by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, and I
am not sure that the Minister has quite answered it. He said that we
will return to the issue of the membership of regional flood and
coastal committees, but I am unclear about the actual role of the
committees, and how they sit between Environment Agency strategy and
the lead local authority strategy. What exactly will they
do?</div><a name="1001204000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000588"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The interface between the Environment
Agency, the regional flood and coastal committees and local authorities
is key. As is described in the Bill, the RFCC is an advisory committee,
but it also provides peer support and advice. There is an interface
between the organisations, but the RFCC will be on an advisory, rather
than executive,
footing.</div><a name="1001204000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000589"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> That is the key point, which the Minister did
not address. Will he now tell the Committee why the Government have
changed and possibly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>downgraded the role of the regional flood and coastal committees, unless
he feels that it is more appropriate to address that under clause
23?</div>
<a name="1001204000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000590"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I suspect that we might come back to it,
but I have already stated why that is. The Bill brings the position
into line with the changes in funding since 2004. At one time these
regional committees raised the majority of funding themselves. They do
not do that any longer. The Bill aims to bring the legislative vehicle
into line with the funding vehicles that are there now and are
anticipated in future. We may well return to this matter, but that is
the clear rationale behind it.</div>
<a name="1001204000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not
entirely understand the issue that was raised with regard to subsection
(2). That provides the power for the Minister to make regulations to
make transitional provision for the move from regional flood defence
committees to regional flood and coastal committees. It also allows
regulations for the process by which the EA divides countries into
various regions. It is fairly straightforward. I suspect we might
return to the matter, but the rationale behind the change in status is
to reflect the current funding commitments, which have changed since
the historic basis.</div>
<a name="1001204000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000591"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> To help the Minister, we are querying why he
needs to make these regulations. He cannot have it both ways. Does the
clause serve the purpose of putting into place the consequence of
changes? Personally, I disapproved of those. The way in which the
previous regional flood defence committees raised money was much
better. They were locally accountable, and the fact it is being
centralised is regrettable. I do not quite know what the Minister is
hoping to achieve through these regulations. What is the purpose of the
transitional provision? Is it there because we are replacing the
previous committees with new committees? He will detect from Committee
members&#146; line of questioning that we are not clear what purpose
the clause
serves.</div><a name="1001204000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000592"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The clause creates a new vehicle. Based on
the historic precedent of the previous committees, it gives them a
different remit. It puts them on a structure that reflects the current
funding arrangements. I appreciate that the hon. Lady preferred not to
have central funding, but there are national strategic aims that need
to be delivered. We cannot do that on a purely local or regional basis.
Based on the evidence, which has increased over the years, imperatives
show where we need to make strategic decisions and where that also
requires an interface with local areas. If we pull back and do not have
such grant funding, we have the potential for one area to make a
decision based on its allocated funding that may have a detrimental
effect on an area downstream.</div>
<a name="1001204000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pitt was
absolutely clear on the issue in terms of risk management. We need the
strategic overview and the local aspect as well. That is what we are
trying to do. We need subsection (2) because the detail of how to
proceed is not set out on the face of the Bill. With regard to the
transition, we need practical rules to make clear how to move from
where we are now. That is what subsection (2) is all
about.</div><a name="1001204000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000595"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
clause stand
part.</div><a name="1001204000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000596"></a>Mr.
Grogan:</b> I listened to every word that all three
Front-Bench spokesmen have said, and the words &#147;local
democracy&#148; and &#147;localism&#148; came up a lot. The
amendment is infused with the spirit of localism, local democracy and
the ancient liberties of our land. When I talk about local democracy, I
do not talk about it in the way that some have talked about it in
recent years, perhaps most notably my right hon. Friend the Member for
Salford (Hazel Blears). They speak about focus groups and consultative
panels that keep going until they provide the right answer to whichever
arm of Whitehall is consulting. I mean elected local bodies making
decisions on local
issues.</div><a name="1001204000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regional flood defence committees are one of the little-known marvels
of our system of Government. They have brought local and central
Government into partnership over the years. There are 11 of them at
present. The chairman is appointed by the Secretary of State, and more
than half the members are local government members. We will consider
the composition of the committees in future
amendments.</div><a name="1001204000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, the committees have the role of approving Environment Agency
expenditure in a particular region. It is a historic role. The clause
changes it to an advisory role: the committee will become an advisory
body like other bodies that advise the Environment Agency. I think they
should continue to have the role of approving the regional flood plan
of the Environment Agency. It is a good
check.</div><a name="1001204000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says that the funding system has changed. It is true that it
changed marginally in about 2004. The central grant previously went to
local councils, which then passed it on in a levy to the regional flood
defence committees. It was always central Government money, but it was
routed through the councils. I do not think that it is game, set and
match to diminish the role of the
committees.</div><a name="1001204000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the great joys of my life is being a vice-president of the
Association of Drainage Authorities&#151;a title I hold as dear as my
membership of Yorkshire county cricket club or my chairmanship of the
all-party group on beer. The association&#146;s members are experts,
and they often sit on these committees. They said that if the powers of
the regional flood and coastal committees, as they will become, are
diminished and the committees are made consultative bodies only, they
will not have councillors of the same calibre wanting to give up their
time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div><a name="1001204000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">My neighbour,
the hon. Member for Vale of York, will know Councillor Peter Sowray,
who gives up a great deal of his time to work on the Yorkshire regional
flood defence committee. He does that because it is a job with meaning
and purpose. He and his colleagues, whether they are councillors or
not, can scrutinise the Environment Agency. I believe that the flood
plan for Yorkshire is better for the fact that it is scrutinised by the
committee that ultimately has to sanction
it.</div><a name="1001204000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no evidence anywhere up and down the land that regional flood
defence committees behave irresponsibly, turn down Environment Agency
plans carte blanche or cause trouble for the sake of it. There is no
evidence at all. The system works, and if it ain&#146;t broke,
don&#146;t fix it. It would be much better to leave the committees
with an executive role, not just over the levy, which is raised
locally, but also over the regional flood programme of the Environment
Agency.</div><a name="1001204000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
comes down to this: when the day comes that I am no longer a Member of
Parliament&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> That day will
come, sooner or later. I might be looking for a job, and perhaps a
Minister of whatever colour might decide to make me the chairman of the
Yorkshire regional flood and coastal committee, which would be the true
honour of my life. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Yes, it would
be a true honour. I am too old to open the batting for Yorkshire, so I
have to put my aspirations
elsewhere.</div><a name="1001204000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I were meeting the regional official of the Environment Agency, I would
be treated differently depending on whether my committee and I had to
approve the agency&#146;s budget, or just had to be consulted. If it
was a question of my being consulted, they would give me tea and
biscuits but they would not treat the committee in the same way. It is
only human nature. If one has to get approval from a body, one treats
it with more respect. That is one of the great hidden gems of our
democracy. We sometimes wonder how we can make the health service more
responsive at a local level. It could learn a little from the success
of the regional flood defence committees.</div>
<a name="1001204000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Committee to keep the executive role of the flood and coastal defence
committees, give councillors and the other people who serve on them a
proper job of work, and keep the Environment Agency responsible to a
locally accountable body. When it comes to deciding on flood management
and expenditure in Yorkshire, I would prefer that the final word went
to the men and women of the white rose county who sat on the committee
rather than the men and women from
Whitehall.</div><a name="1001204000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000597"></a>The

stand part as
well.</div><a name="1001204000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000598"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I congratulate my hon. neighbour on his
eloquence; I could not have expressed it better myself. The white rose
league is exemplified by the co-operation on the Committee. We may be
few in number on the Committee, but I hope that those who bat for the
white rose county will punch above our weight. Before we take on that
battle, I do not know whether there any Lancashire representatives
here. I support the hon. Gentleman in his quest to have
amendment 156 adopted. I have more difficulties with
amendment 157, but I think I know where he is coming from. Perhaps the
Minister will expand on that when he makes his remarks.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div><a name="1001204000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to join the hon. Gentleman in paying a huge tribute to County
Councillor Peter Sowray, who I have the honour to represent in this
place, and to compliment him on the sterling work that he and others do
on the regional flood defence committees.</div>
<a name="1001204000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
understand what the Minister and the Department hope to achieve with
clause 23. In addressing some remarks on the content of the clause in
the stand part debate, should the hon. Member for Selby fail in moving
his amendment, I should like to associate myself with the Association
of Drainage Authorities, which strongly disagrees with the move to
alter the status of the regional flood and coastal committees from an
executive to an advisory role. I do not condone what the Government did
in 2004-05. I spent five years of my life campaigning to get the Cod
beck, which floods frequently, enmained. I did not do that because it
would become the responsibility of the Environment Agency but because I
thought that it would follow the money, which was then with the
Environment Agency and would have been disbursed by the regional flood
defence committee and the Environment Agency together. No sooner had I
succeeded in my campaign in 2005 to have Cod beck enmained, than the
Government changed the system and moved the decision to a central body.
I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to apologise and go
back to the system as was, which is what the hon. Gentleman is trying
to do with his
amendments.</div><a name="1001204000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s own Department draft and floodwater management
consultation stated that the rural flood and coastal defence
committees</div>
<a name="1001204000505"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ensure local
democratic input into the decision making
process&#148;.</div><a name="1001204000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
altering their role to an advisory one would diminish their influence
on the process. It goes on to say that the committees have already
undergone major amalgamation from the previous local flood defence
committees, and that the firm view of the Association of Drainage
Authorities is that a further reduction in status is likely to
undermine the committees&#146; ability to act on their current key
strengths: their ability to raise money and to represent the local
communities they serve. The Government&#146;s proposed changes are
also likely to deter local authority councillors and others from
joining the committees if they are merely advisory. The likes of County
Councillor Peter Sowray and his colleagues throughout the country will
not see any purpose in or be attracted to serving on those
committees.</div><a name="1001204000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to link my comments to the levying powers, and to echo the
comments by the Association of Drainage Authorities that the regional
flood and coastal committees must retain their executive powers and the
opportunity to decide where the levy funding and the internal drainage
board precept funding to the Environment Agency should be spent under
the clause. Only thereby can we meet local democratic accountability in
prioritising funds and giving local communities the confidence of
knowing that the money they raise is being spent and accounted for
under local scrutiny. The funding should reflect local priorities, not
be part of a national pot that the Government can requisition as they
go along. That has been the tendency since 2005, and the fact that Cod
beck has not received any funding, to my personal chagrin, shows that
that is the
case.</div><a name="1001204000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
long-term certainty of finance is essential to sound water level and
flood risk management. Water level management is a daily job, requiring
regular action 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>that must be planned well in advance. In contrast, flood-risk mechanisms
may be tested infrequently, but must meet the standard demanded of them
on those critical occasions. Both activities transcend political and
spending periods as set out by the Government. The mechanisms to which
I referred&#151;the special levy and the way in which the
agricultural drainage rate through which the internal drainage boards
raise their money&#151;may seem complex, but they have been proved
over time to work. They ensure democratic accountability and scrutiny
and, more important, they ensure the appropriate degree of financial
security for internal drainage
boards.</div><a name="1001204000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
associate myself with the comments of my distinguished neighbour, the
hon. Member for Selby. I am sure that there will always be a place for
him here or as a chairman of the new committees that he so desires. I
draw the Minister&#146;s attention to my comments about the
levy-making powers, and I hope that he will exercise his powers under
clause 23, particularly subsections (2) and (3), with great
circumspection. I also hope that he will be minded to accept his hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment to subsection (1)(a) and (b). I associate
myself with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments and particularly with
amendment 156, but we would like further clarification of amendment
157.</div><a name="1001204000541"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000599"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I will not take much of the Committee&#146;s
time on this, but it might be worth reflecting on why acts of God seem
to have affected great cricketing counties such as Yorkshire and
Gloucestershire so much. Perhaps the explanation is that God
is from
Lancashire.</div><a name="1001204000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is welcome, and similar in intent to our earlier amendment 95
and new clause 23. Liberal Democrats could trace the thinking behind it
back to John Stuart Mill&#146;s &#147;On Liberty&#148;, and the
basic idea that even public services and the exercise of authority are
not only better theoretically for a bit of scrutiny, democracy and
openness, but produce a better result. That has been a theme in many of
our proposals for decentralisation and democratic scrutiny in the
exercise of all sorts of
authority.</div><a name="1001204000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have a slight habit of substituting the mantra of
consultation for proper democratic involvement. Anyone who has been
involved in regional spatial strategies, and has been through the
grinding five years of consultation, which produced almost no impact
whatever on the final document as I see it, would be wary of that
substitution of consultation for proper involvement. It would be a
regrettable end to the noble history of regional flood defence
committees if their role were diminished in that way. The amendment
would, effectively, give them a right of veto over the implementation
of EA flood risk management in their particular regions. That would
concentrate minds considerably and lead to the improvement of the works
planned. The Minister&#146;s remarks, which tried to clarify the new
role of the regional flood committees as defined in the Bill, did not
really satisfy. They seem to be left with a purely consultative role
with some residual powers of levy. That would be a diminished role; we
want to see a role that would be fit for the hon. Member for Selby to
chair at regional level in Yorkshire&#151;that would be a fine
end.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div><a name="1001204000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000600"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am pleased to respond to that. However,
before I turn to the amendment, the hon. Member for Vale of York asked
me to apologise. I simply will not apologise for a system that, with
grant in aid and local levies, has now delivered double the spending;
has given a real strategic national evidence-based overview to flood
and coastal erosion management; and, by March 2011, will have allowed
us to deliver additional better protection to 160,000 homes. I cannot
apologise for that. It is important to make centrally funded decisions
based on the best available evidence, but tying that into local input
is equally critical; that has been a theme of this.</div>
<a name="1001204000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">To refer back
to why we are making these changes, hon. Members may not recall that
prior to 2004 there was great criticism by several independent reviews
throughout the late 1990s. Those identified a lack of strategic
planning, poor value for money and a system that was dogged by
bureaucracy. So we have not arrived here by accident. I do recognise
the role of these committees and I will clarify that in a moment. That
strategic overview is also important. Let us not pretend, however, that
prior to 2004 everything was hunky-dory, because independent review
after independent review showed that it was not. We do not want to
return there.</div>
<a name="1001204000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
would require the Environment Agency to consult each and every regional
flood and coastal committee about how it, as the EA, proposes to
exercise its flood and coastal erosion risk management functions within
that region. The EA has to go out there and consult on every proposal.
It will be required to take into account any representation that the
committee makes whether or not it is in response to a consultation. If
the committee that my hon. Friend the Member for Selby heads decides,
&#147;We have picked up on something that they are not consulting on.
We want to tell them that it is wrong or it is right,&#148; the EA
will have to take account of that regardless of whether it is in the
consultation. The clause provides for the committees&#146; new
largely consultative role covering both flood and&#151;of course, the
change within this&#151;coastal erosion risk
management.</div><a name="1001204000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause also requires the EA to obtain the consent of the relevant
committee before it may issue local levies. Local levy raising and
local input to add value to the whole process are key. We have
repeatedly said that as a Government. The provision, therefore, leaves
the decision-making power regarding the local levy
in the hands of people such as my hon. Friend chairing the
regional flood and coastal committee, reflecting the present
arrangements with the regional flood defence committees. It also
requires the EA to obtain the consent of the committee before spending
revenue under section 118 of the Water Resources Act 1991,
which includes not just the local levy, but other local
funds&#151;general and special drainage charges and contribution from
IDBs. IDBs are critical in this matter, with their enhanced role. We
want to ensure that regional flood and coastal committees have the
decision-making power over how locally raised funds are
used.</div><a name="1001204000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is entirely plausible that there will be local influence over the
Environment Agency&#146;s regional programmes through the local levy
and the contributions to EA costs, through scrutiny and through
challenge. I expect that to happen. I rebuff the idea that the
committees are toothless. They will, and should, hold to account and
challenge as part of an open and transparent system. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>They should also be able to work co-operatively and add value to what is
being done. We have to have the national and strategic elements, but we
will also have the added value that only local input can
bring.</div><a name="1001204000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
cannot allow, and I am not willing to allow, RFCCs to overrule the
EA&#146;s direct accountability to Ministers. The RFCCs will not sit
at the desk opposite me and account for their actions or mis-actions.
That will be done by the EA, which is accountable not only to
Ministers, but to
Parliament.</div><a name="1001204000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York raised the issue of RFCCs having powers
over local levies. The powers for RFCCs to approve levies and the
spending of levy money are set out in clause 23(2) and
(3).</div><a name="1001204000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the spirit behind the amendment. It would introduce a
requirement for the EA to seek the consent of regional flood and
coastal committees before it implemented its regional programmes. We
discussed a similar point last week in relation to local strategies. As
hon. Members know, the Government could not have made it clearer that
we recognise the important role that RFCCs will play at the regional
level. In line with that, clause 23 places a duty on the EA to consult
the committees about how it proposes to carry out its flood and coastal
erosion management activities in their areas. The agency must take
account of any representations made by the committees. That means that
it will have to follow the recommendations of the committees, unless it
has reasonable grounds to do otherwise. It will have to justify those
grounds.</div><a name="1001204000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Selby is right to ask for examples of that
being a problem in the past. I would be hard pressed to find examples
because of the co-operative relationship. Both the EA and the
committees try to do the right thing on the ground. To extend the
logic, if a committee challenges something good and early, the EA will
have to work with it. If the EA will not do what the committee says, it
will have to say transparently why it will not do so. Ultimately, the
EA will be sitting in my office if my hon. Friend, in his future life
as the chair of a committee, says to me, &#147;What on earth is the
EA doing in my region? It is doing brilliantly in 98 per cent. of the
country, but in my patch it is not even listening to us. It has given
reasons that are completely mad.&#148; That would be an issue that I
would be concerned
with.</div><a name="1001204000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
23 requires consent to be obtained for any local levy. The ultimate
responsibility for allocating funding on a national basis must rest
with the Environment Agency in England and with Welsh Ministers in
Wales, if it is to be allocated systematically and equitably. I know my
hon. Friend will understand that. There is a real issue of equitable
distribution of funding and social justice. It is not just a matter of
looking at the evidence and deciding what sort of defence is
appropriate in each place and what strategies will be adopted from
region to region. We must ensure that all the funding is not allocated
to areas that have greater powers of persuasion or more money to prime
the process and assist it. There is a real issue of social justice.
That is why the national approach is so
important.</div><a name="1001204000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
committee&#146;s formal approval role will mean that it has a power
of veto over programmes. I hope that it will never come to that. I will
give my hon. Friend the corollary of his argument: I cannot see it ever
coming to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>that, because if it did, there would be somebody sitting with the
Minister saying, &#147;What on earth has gone wrong here?&#148; The
proposal would blur responsibility and risk causing a
stalemate&#151;a delay&#151;in bringing forward measures that are
so important to people and to businesses. It could also hinder the
Environment Agency in exercising a national overview of all forms of
flood and coastal erosion risk, because the committees can only
consider the risk within their own areas and region.</div>
<a name="1001204000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select
Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, of which the hon.
Lady is a member, was clear on that. It agreed with the proposed
approach and stated in recommendation
17:</div><a name="1001204000506"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill should require decision making bodies to explain how they have
taken into account any advice from regional advisory bodies, or their
reasons for rejecting
it.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
has been enshrined in the Bill. However, let me acknowledge that I can
see where my hon. Friend is coming from and that there is real tension
between&#151;this is at the heart of the matter&#151;enabling local
views to influence the Environment Agency works programme, delivering
the strategic national aims that I am talking about and achieving best
value for
money.</div><a name="1001204000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the past, when RFDCs controlled regional spending, as I have said,
there were many parts&#151;not every part&#151;where there were
underspends, and there were many examples of poor value for money. It
is not me saying that; it was in report after report. Under the
EA&#146;s current national programme, which was criticised by the
hon. Lady and from which I simply will not walk away, we achieved far
greater value for money for the taxpayer from the funding. Although I
recognise the passion with which she has spoken and with which my hon.
Friend has moved the amendment, I do not have a solution to hand to
what he is proposing. I cannot simply walk away from the national
strategic overview. However, if we can, I am keen to try to find a way
forward that effectively reflects local priorities without putting the
improvements I have referred to at risk. I am happy to explore the
possibilities of that with both the Environment Agency and my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="1001204000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
on a minor technical issue, my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment does not
accurately reflect the situation of the Welsh Assembly Government
within Wales. I am happy to explore the matter further as long as he is
willing to consider the context of the debate that we have had. I do
not want to sacrifice the gains that we have made from having that
balance between the national strategic and the
local.</div><a name="1001204000097"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000601"></a>Mr.
Grogan:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply. I am going to
press the amendment to a vote for four reasons, which I shall explain
briefly. First, the Minister mentioned equity and equitable funding.
The argument of centralisers throughout the ages is that the plans of a
central body cannot be disturbed in any way by local circumstances
because doing so would spoil the beauty of the plan.</div>
<a name="1001204000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, on
the meetings in his office and the chair of the regional flood defence
committee being at odds with the Environment Agency, that is precisely
what I want to avoid. Those sorts of things should be sorted out in the
region, because the Minister has far too many things to do to get
himself involved with them. If the regional flood defence committee has
to approve the plan, that is precisely what will happen.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div><a name="1001204000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, that
element of regional accountability means that there will be more value
for money. Fourthly, I think that we all feel that there is no point in
delaying the issue until Report. The Minister is a very busy man who
has plenty of things to do, and there is no need for him to have
meetings with me and the Environment Agency. If the Committee votes for
the measure, we will all feel better for it in the
morning.</div><a name="1001204000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

witnessed. My only regret on this rare occurrence of a non-Government
amendment being made is that the hon. Member for Stroud was not here to
enjoy it, as he is a well-known rebel. We should also record our
congratulations to him on becoming a grandfather, which I think is the
excuse for his absence, and a very good one.</div>

and 109 also address the issue of local democratic input in the
regional flood and coastal committees, as they seek to make explicit
the possibility of either the direct or indirect election of members.
As a liberal, I happen to believe that democracy is a healthy and
positive thing and that the concentration of power in the hands of the
few is dangerous and leads to bad decisions. The possibility that the
committees could be either directly or indirectly elected is one that
we should certainly incorporate in the Bill.</div>

that under the current wording of the clause the only options for
membership of the committees appear to be selection or appointment.
Given that we are trying explicitly to have democratic input at that
level in the process, that is regrettable. The amendments are not
prescriptive. They do not say that there must be direct elections or
even that local authority members must be elected from within their
authority, but it makes it clear that it is at least possible that
people can be elected and represent their communities on that basis.
Otherwise, there is a risk that the regional flood and coastal
committees will simply be creatures of central Government and will lose
their distinct value and purpose. I am strongly supportive of amendment
156 for similar
reasons.</div><a name="1001204000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001204000620"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): I have a lot of sympathy for
the points the hon. Gentleman is making, but is there not a risk that
we could end up with local committees designed to address flood issues
that, if their membership is composed on a purely elected basis, will
pursue populist causes without perhaps the necessary depth of
knowledge, understanding and research? I have the greatest sympathy for
democratic elections and appointments, but are there not obvious risks?
I am trying to reach common ground.</div>
<a name="1001204000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000621"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think similar arguments were made against the
Great Reform Bill. The point is that the amendment would allow the
possibility of appointment and selection and of indirect election
whereby members of a local authority would elect from within their
number. I think that enough safeguards against demagoguery would remain
intact in the clause even if the amendment were made. I would be happy
to have at least the possibility of clearer
accountability.</div><a name="1001204000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000622"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> As flattered as I am to be compared to Robert Peel,
that really was not the point I was trying to make. The point I am
trying to make is that we want to get things done on the
ground and we want to get them done quickly. We all know from our
constituencies that certain people have certain issues regarding
certain water features, and even with the work we are doing we may not
resolve the issues that those communities are facing. I am sympathetic
to the points that the hon. Gentleman is making, I am just trying to
reach common ground on how we address that
problem.</div><a name="1001204000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000623"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I take the serious point that the hon. Gentleman
is making. There were strong arguments from my constituents for the
flood defence work that was done in Cheltenham at a cost of &#163;23
million and which probably saved hundreds if not thousands of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>properties from flooding when the floods of 2007 happened. It was very
welcome that those flood defences were already in place, even though
they did not save everybody. Similar arguments were made that there was
a pork barrel approach to flood defence, but we are talking only about
the regional flood defence committees. As we have established, they are
largely consultative bodies; they have the power to raise levies for
specific projects but most of the strategic work would still be in the
hands of the Environment Agency and the other flood risk management
authorities. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s fears are
likely to be realised and I am happy to support this amendment along
with
mine.</div><a name="1001204000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000624"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I offer two congratulations. First, in his
absence, to the hon. Member for Stroud on his good news. Secondly, I
congratulate the hon. Member for Selby on achieving a pyrrhic victory
with his amendment. I am minded to support his amendment 157and I hope
that the Committee will do so too. I would like him to clarify what the
position of the membership of the internal drainage boards will be in
relation to subsection (2)(b). I would also like him to
clarify the role of farmers, landowners and parish councillors. It
would be very helpful if he could do that when he sums
up.</div><a name="1001204000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see where the hon. Member for Cheltenham is coming from, but we had
a good debate on critical infrastructure earlier and we adequately held
the Government to account. There will be opportunities later to vote on
our new clauses concerning the failure to come up with the proposed
register for critical infrastructure, which I understand is part of the
Pitt recommendations that the Government admit is still outstanding.
The same goes for amendment 107&#151;I believe it has been amply
covered by the new clauses that we will have the opportunity to vote on
later.</div><a name="1001204000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has on previous occasions said that in setting up the
membership of the committees he is minded to look at the local
authority proposal for catchment area flood management boards. As this
is a clause stand part debate, could the Minister confirm that he is
minded to look favourably on Select Committee recommendation 17 in
paragraph 55 of the substantive report, which makes just such a
proposal? The Committee clearly states that the Bill should require
decision-making bodies to explain how they have taken into account
advice from regional advisory boards. This might be the opportunity to
illustrate that the Government are minded to do so in this
regard.</div>
<a name="1001204000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am
mindful of the restrictions I mentioned earlier, I note that clause 24
allows the Minister to make decisions about the membership of a
regional flood and coastal committee, including the number of members,
the size of the area covered and the selection of appointment methods.
Clause 25 also allows the Minister to direct the Environment Agency on
payment. We feel that this is all-embracing. Who will the Minister
consult when making those regulations? The clause talks about the
proceedings of the committee, but it would be helpful if the Minister
could expand on the provisions in that
regard.</div><a name="1001204000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000625"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am slightly puzzled. I realise that the hon.
Lady has moved on from amendment 108, but I am not quite clear whether
she is now supporting the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>explicit possibility of electing people to the regional flood and
coastal committees. If she is not supporting amendment 108, I would
take it that she is, in a sense, supporting the current wording of the
Bill, which seems to rule out the election of members of those
committees.</div>
<a name="1001204000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000626"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I think amendment 157 covers that eventuality
and leaves the option open. It should be for the local authorities to
decide. The whole thrust of my remarks in this regard is about letting
local communities decide what they want to do and about us not being so
prescriptive as to write it into the Bill. Given the choice, my
preference would be to support amendment
157.</div><a name="1001204000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000627"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am not quite clear what election means in these
circumstances&#151;whether it is election from the whole world within
the area or election from members of one of the
committees.</div>
<a name="1001204000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000628"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> My hon. Friend is at one with me. My preference
would be to support amendment 157 on the basis that we should let the
locals decide what works best for them in their area. Obviously,
democracy is best, but if committee members are to be appointed, it
should be for fixed terms, possibly with the ability for them to be
renewed for one further term. The Government are being slightly
cack-handed, and perhaps a little too prescriptive in what they are
trying to do. It is part of the centralising versus local idea, and we
would prefer to see more local decision making and less centralisation
in the
clause.</div><a name="1001204000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000629"></a>Mr.
Grogan:</b> At the moment, local authority representatives
have a majority on the regional flood defence committee. What has made
this an issue is that, at the moment, the Bill just gives powers to the
Minister to appoint who he or she thinks fit to the regional flood and
coastal committees. I was encouraged by what my hon. Friend the
Minister said in the scrutiny session when he was asked about this by
me and others. He
said:</div><a name="1001204000507"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think that I am correct in stating that those local committees will
have the majority of local authority members
there.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Flood and
Water Management Public Bill Committee, </i>7 January 2010;
c. 14.]</div><a name="1001204000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
the Minister will say explicitly that local authorities will continue
to have a majority and the other members will be, as the hon. Lady
mentioned, farmers and representatives of internal drainage boards,
people who currently are appointed by the Minister to make up the rest
of the committee. Of course, the chair of the committee is also
appointed by the Minister. Therefore, I hope the Minister can confirm
that will still be the case.</div>
<a name="1001204000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
business of electing or appointing, I am sure that the Minister does
not mean to say that in Yorkshire, for example, he would be choosing
the majority of local authority councillors. It would not be
Whitehall&#146;s favourite six or seven councillors. I presume that,
as of now, the local councils themselves will be deciding. Not every
local council is represented on a regional flood defence committee, so
they have to choose between themselves and I think their practice
varies on how they do this. Possibly, they have an election between
themselves to decide who is going to put forward a representative; or
if they are a unitary and there is only one council, it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>would presumably be an appointment from an individual council. That was
what I was trying to tease out through my amendment, and I am hopeful
that the Minister can reassure the Committee that it will be pretty
well business as usual in terms of appointments to the new committee as
it was to the old
committees.</div><a name="1001204000545"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000630"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Amendments 108 and 109 in the names of the
hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and Radnorshire are intended
to ensure that the members of the regional flood and coastal committees
can be elected. The current provision in the Bill allows for them to be
&#147;selected.&#148; Let me make it clear&#151;that allows for
both election or appointment by local authorities, Ministers, or the
Environment Agency. The precise way of doing it is to be decided and
will be set out in regulations. There will be further consultation with
all relevant persons and authorities before a decision is arrived at.
However, as I have said, the current drafting of the provisions will
actually deliver what the amendments seek to achieve, which is the
ability to have elections, within the phrasing
&#147;selection&#148;. We have taken advice from parliamentary
counsel that this is perfectly permitted within the measure, so the
amendments are not actually necessary in that context.</div>
<a name="1001204000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Selby has tabled amendment 157 which, like amendments
108 and 109, relates to the composition of RFCCs but in a slightly
different context. It seeks to ensure that there are local authority
elected or appointed representatives to regional flood and coastal
committees and that representatives from local authorities form a
majority on each committee. Current policy is in line with that. We
intend to use the regulation-making power under clause 24 to ensure
that local authorities have a majority on the committees. We are clear
that this needs to remain the case, at least as long as RFCCs retain
the right to raise local levies. We do not disagree with the aim of
that proposal.</div>
<a name="1001204000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
clause is drafted to allow flexibility on membership and on the
selection of members, rules, majorities and quorums so that we have a
framework that can be adapted to changing circumstances in the longer
term. The precise numbers will not be set by me. The numbers, the
composition and means of selection&#151;which could be by election or
appointment as I have said&#151;are yet to be decided on. We will
consider the matter further and will consult before coming to a
conclusion on the guidance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000631"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> This is a new point that has not been raised. Is
the Minister confirming that lead local flood authorities who pay the
levy to the regional flood and coastal committee will have the right to
be represented, on his reading of the Bill and if we were to adopt
amendment 157? It is not entirely clear. Will he ensure that a method
for proper representation of the lead local flood authority will be
guaranteed?</div>
<a name="1001204000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000632"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Well, indeed, and it can be part of the
input in the consultation that will lead to the actual regulations.
That is what that particular debate needs to have. I have re-emphasised
where current policy is and the fact that we intend to use the
regulation to make sure there is a majority of local authority members
on those committees.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div><a name="1001204000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I note
that the hon. Lady also raised the issue of whether we would be minded
to look favourably on local authority flood management boards. We do
look favourably on such proposals. There is the flexibility to do so.
We do not think legislative provision is needed. Why do we need to be
so prescriptive right here, right now? What we need to do is make sure
that it can be allowed, so local authorities will be able, under the
Bill, to put in place their own arrangements for such joint
working.</div><a name="1001204000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we agree with the aim of amendment 157, we do not consider it
appropriate. It would introduce rigid rules now when we need

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000633"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister is obviously a man of his word. If
he says that parliamentary counsel gives explicit legal opinion that
election is still possible, I see no need for amendments 108 and 109 to
be pressed. However, I cannot help thinking this is a triumph of law
over the use of English, because &#147;selection&#148; to me means
something very different, but that is not unknown in legal circles and
I am not a lawyer so I cannot judge.</div>
<a name="1001204000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would,
however, still be content to vote for amendment 157 to put the matter

Irranca-Davies:</b> There we are. Such payments may be made in
relation to remuneration, allowances, pensions and compensation. To
give an idea of where we are, we must allow committee chairs to be paid
so that committee members can receive allowances to cover their costs.
Hon. Members will appreciate that that is reasonable, and it continues

&#163;17,503 precisely, except in Northumbria where the figure is set
at &#163;14,002 precisely. I do not know the reason for the
difference, but I suspect that it relates to the number of days per

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000643"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I shall address amendments 110 and 111 together.
Only last night in my constituency, I was at an inspiring public
meeting, as many of our public meetings concerning the regional spatial
strategy are. It was addressed by one Jonathon Porritt, who, as I am
sure the Minister is aware, was recently the chairman of the
Sustainable Development Commission. He described a process that he
called sustainable development abuse. It was the use, particularly by
Government agencies and Departments, of the phrase &#147;sustainable
development&#148; to justify almost anything that they cared to do.
There is a loophole in the clause that would allow exactly that process
in this
case.</div><a name="1001204000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, the Bill allows the Minister to issue guidance not just about
how authorities are to discharge their duty in the clause, but about
the meaning of &#147;sustainable development&#148;. I am sure the
Minister is a busy man, so we are helpfully pointing out in the
amendments that he does not have to do that, because there is already a
definition of sustainable development. It has been provided by the
Sustainable Development Commission, which was set up by the Government
for that very purpose, and which Sir Jonathon
chaired.</div><a name="1001204000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition is the one given, broadly speaking, in amendment 111, which
states
that</div><a name="1001204000508"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;sustainable
development&#146; means development which enables all people
throughout the world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better
quality of life, without compromising the quality of life of future
generations, pursued in an integrated way through a sustainable,
innovative and productive economy that delivers high levels of
employment; and a just society that promotes social inclusion,
sustainable communities and personal wellbeing and will be done in ways
that protect and enhance the physical and natural environment, and use
resources and energy as efficiently as
possible.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a much more comprehensive, detailed and well thought-out definition
than some of the ones that I have seen from Departments, mentioning no
names except Communities and Local
Government.</div><a name="1001204000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001204000644"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I wonder
whether this is yet more evidence of the new-found centralising
tendency of the Liberal Democrats. The clause as it is currently
constructed at least allows some local interpretation of the guidance,
whereas the amendment is prescriptive as to exactly what local
authorities should do. We should allow the case for localism in
interpreting the Minister&#146;s
guidance.</div><a name="1001204000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000645"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That was a clever debating point from the hon.
Lady, but the fact is that the English have been striving for the past
1,000 years or so to centralise the use of terminology on the basis of
common understanding about what general terms
mean.</div><a name="1001204000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
meaning of sustainable development has been abused&#151;Sir Jonathon
is right about that&#151;by Departments in particular, which have
neglected the environmental sustainability element of the meaning of
the phrase. It has already been a theme in many of our discussions in
the Committee. It is an important theme for the Bill, as the use of
flood defences in concert with natural processes and in harmony with
the natural environment is something that we need to encourage and
reinforce at every possible opportunity. The two amendments would force
the use of a definition of sustainable development that respects the
environment and the natural processes involved. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>has been developed by the very body commissioned by the Government to do
the job of defining sustainable development. On that basis, I am sure
that the Minister will be
supportive.</div><a name="1001204000546"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000646"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I would like to make some comments on clause
stand part, but before I do let me say that I enjoyed the exchange
between the hon. Members for City of Durham and for Cheltenham. On
round one, I am minded to support the hon. Member for City of Durham,
but the hon. Member for Cheltenham should not be discouraged because he
has had one or two positive victories as well.</div>
<a name="1001204000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Country
Land and Business Association has stated that sustainable development
is a fairly nebulous concept and could mean whatever the user of the
term wants it to mean. It is happy that the Minister is under an
obligation to issue guidance on what it will mean in the present
context. Perhaps he can let us know what parties will be consulted.
However, the CLA goes on to say that because the contents of the
guidance is likely to have significant implications, it
believes&#151;and I think that all of us would wish to support its
point of view&#151;that the guidance could have been made available
either at this stage or before
Report.</div><a name="1001204000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000647"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am astonished that the hon. Lady is prepared to
reject the Sustainable Development Commission&#146;s definition of
sustainable development knowing, as I am sure she does, that Government
Departments under this Labour Government have, on occasion, produced
the most astonishingly vacuous definitions of sustainability and have
used them to justify the most unsustainable practices imaginable in
housing, economics and local communities. There are many examples of
sustainable development abuse, as Jonathon Porritt calls it. I find it
astonishing that she is not prepared to support putting that clear
definition in the
Bill.</div><a name="1001204000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000648"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has such a
good relationship with Jonathon Porritt, who seems to be a voice from
the past. There are alternative definitions, which I will put to the
Committee, so we do not necessarily have to take this one. One such
definition comes from the Royal Commission on Environment and
Development, which says that sustainable development is a process of
change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of
investments, the orientation of technological development and
institutional change are made consistent with future as well as present
needs. If we are to have a debate, there are a variety of definitions
from which we can choose. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire
will recall, when we were in the Select Committee, we lamented the fact
that no definition of strategy was given.</div>
<a name="1001204000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to ask the Minister to support the comments of the Local Government
Flood Forum, which has given the matter some thought. It says that the
meaning of sustainable development is clearly defined in Government
policy&#151;so it would obviously take issue with the hon. Member for
Cheltenham&#151;and that it has been used to develop sustainable
community strategies. It says that to issue new guidance with a new
special flooding definition of sustainable development would be
unnecessary. It is particularly concerned about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>clause 27(2). I have thrown that in the pot as a debating
point, because there is confusion about what sustainable development
means in this context.</div>
<a name="1001204000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000649"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> As the hon. Lady argues that we should not have
logical definitions of sustainable development and a special flooding
definition, she should support my amendment because it is designed to
ensure that there are not multiple definitions across Governments and
that there is only the one supported by the
SDC.</div><a name="1001204000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000650"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I want to hear from the Minister about what
definition the Government are using in this
regard.</div><a name="1001204000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000651"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I want to make a couple of comments on
clause stand part. Unlike the hon. Member for Cheltenham, I was pleased
to see the inclusion of clause 27 in the Bill, because it is important
that authorities are able to think about future sustainability. I pay
tribute to the hon. Member for Vale of York for making that
point.</div>
<a name="1001204000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has told the Committee that authorities are already able to refuse
planning applications that might in some way conflict with
sustainability under PPS25. However, I think a number of us have had
particular issues or circumstances in our constituencies relating to
that. I am dealing with an issue where an application is being made for
development on Durham&#146;s flood plain. We are not at all confident
that it will be refused under PPS25. Indeed, PPS25 is being used to
approve the development because of resilience measures that are being
included in the development. However, the nature of the development
impacts on the possible sustainability of the whole area because it is
being developed inappropriately. I would like some reassurance from the
Minister that under clause 27 there will be strong cause for local
authorities to be able to refuse development where they think it
impacts negatively on the long-term sustainability of the
area.</div><a name="1001204000190"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000652"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The amendments would remove the
requirement for ministerial guidance on sustainable development and
would mean that guidance on the meaning and definition of sustainable
development would be placed in the Bill. That definition would be fixed
in primary legislation for ever and a day, until we revisit
it.</div>
<a name="1001204000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is interesting, and I have sympathy with what the hon. Member for
Cheltenham said. He asked whether I would be supportive and I can tell
him that I support the intention, not the substance of the amendment. I
accept the need for clarity, but the meaning of sustainable development
has already been defined in various ways. For example, as many
Committee members will know, in the international context, there was
the well known Brundtland report, &#147;Our Common
Future&#148;&#151;the 1987 report of the World Commission on
Environment and Development. More recently, in the UK context, there
was the Government&#146;s 2005 sustainable development strategy,
&#147;Securing the Future,&#148; which includes the definition that
is in the amendment.</div>
<a name="1001204000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think we
know where we are, but the problem is&#151;I hate to say
this&#151;ever since the blueprint for growth in the 1960s and the
Brundtland report, there has been much work on improving definitions of
sustainable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>development, and I have no doubt that Jonathon Porritt and others will
continue to improve those definitions. For example, we can look at
definitions from Jacobs on weak sustainabilities and strong
sustainabilities.</div>
<a name="1001204000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We already
have definitions of sustainable development, but let me just add to
those. If hon. Members were looking for a current definition of
sustainable development beyond what the hon. Gentleman refers to,
DEFRA&#146;s website contains pages on sustainable development,
including a definition and details on the principles that underpin it.
The principles are equally important and include living within
environmental means, ensuring a strong, healthy, just society,
achieving a sustainable economy, promoting good governance and using
sound science responsibly. We all know that the overall goal of
sustainable development is to enable people throughout the world to
satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life without
compromising the quality of life of future
generations.</div><a name="1001204000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guidance
provided by the Minister under section 4 of the Environment Act 1995
and clause 27(2) of the Bill will allow us to be more explicit about
what sustainable development means in the context of flood and erosion
risk management in England and Wales. Clause 27 requires that
ministerial guidance is given to clarify that definition in relation to
flood and erosion risk management. We do not need to bang it in the
Bill for ever and a day because we might get the definition wrong, or
it might move on or be improved&#151;tweaked, refined or made more
specific&#151;by Jonathon Porritt or whoever
else.</div><a name="1001204000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000653"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="1001204000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000654"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> If the hon. Gentleman has confidence that
the definition he proposes is the definition par excellence and that no
Minister would have to return to it over the next few years, I will
welcome his
intervention.</div><a name="1001204000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000655"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister seems to be presenting this as
Jonathon Porritt&#146;s personal definition, but it is not. It is the
definition used by the Sustainable Development Commission. As has been
pointed out, it is the official definition of the Government. I believe
that it is agreed in the shared framework with the devolved
Administrations, so it is also their official definition of sustainable
development. Of course it will not be the end of conversation,
discussion or debate on the
matter.</div><a name="1001204000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister made a commitment to table an amendment that made the
definition the same as the wording in the shared framework between the
UK Government and the devolved Administrations at any given
time, I would consider not pressing amendment
111.</div><a name="1001204000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000656"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I try to be accommodating as far as I can,
but I am not likely to propose such an amendment. My suggestion is that
we provide guidance on what we mean by sustainable development. This
might well be the definition that we settle on. There will be an
ability to alter that in regulations, if necessary, although not
necessarily through Jonathon Porritt because, as the hon. Gentleman
says, this is not Jonathon Porritt&#146;s definition. It will be an
accepted definition at that time.</div>
<a name="1001204000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition
might well last for five or 10 years, but my point is that it is not
appropriate to fix one definition in primary legislation. We had the
same debate during 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>consideration of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill. The approach we
took was to put the definition in the underpinning principles rather
than in the Bill, for exactly the same reasons. I do not think that the
hon. Gentleman is certain that this definition is the be all and end
all. On that basis, putting it in the regulations based on guidance
will allow us to stay in tune with any developments in the concept of
sustainable development and enable Ministers to ensure that the
guidance is consistent with other guidance on sustainable development,
such as the statutory guidance provided to the Environment Agency under
section 4 of the Environment Act
1995.</div><a name="1001204000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point made by the hon. Member for Vale of York, we do not have a
firm date, but we anticipate bringing forward the guidance by autumn
this year. In bringing forward any definitions through regulations,
I would wish to consult with the public, academics, wildlife
groups and others to ensure that we fix on the right definition. We
could not do so if we bolted it on to the
Bill.</div><a name="1001204000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000657"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I notice that clause 27(3) lists a number of
authorities. Water and sewerage companies are excluded. Would it not be
a good idea for them to be
included?</div><a name="1001204000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000658"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I can clarify for the hon. Lady that a
similar statutory duty already applies to Ofwat. The principles of
sustainable development are embedded in its formulation and in the
review of policy that controls the way in which water companies work.
She raises an important point to ensure that the provision cuts across
all
agendas.</div><a name="1001204000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the theory of the amendment, but bolting the definition on
to the Bill for ever and a day is not the right method. It is far more
appropriate to have fluidity so that we can improve the definition as
time goes by. I am addressing a conference on biodiversity, post-2010
targets. I would be remarkably wise if I could fix in time now what we
should be doing to improve the environment in that context. The same
applies here. We should have flexibility so that we can take this
forward over time and evolve. Having said that, the definition the hon.
Gentleman has put forward may well be the one that we agree
on.</div><a name="1001204000547"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="1001204000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000659"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That was a kind final comment, but the
Minister&#146;s argument seems to be against trying to define almost
anything. At some time, one has to plump for a definition and put it in
the Bill, in policy guidance or wherever. One cannot avoid the
temptation to define anything on the grounds that it might change in
the
future.</div><a name="1001204000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suggested earlier that, if the Minister brought forward an amendment
that did not put a definition in the Bill, but said that for the
purposes of the Bill, sustainable development meant whatever was the
current definition of the shared framework between the UK Government
and the devolved Administrations&#151;that is the phrase used by the
Sustainable Development Commission and means the current best
definition that the Government have&#151;that would be preferable to
allowing Ministers in one particular Department to come up with their
own definition. That is precisely the process, as the hon. Member for
Vale of York pointed out, although she was not supporting my amendment,
that leads to multiple 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>definitions, some of which, I have to say, are vacuous, unsustainable
waffle. I am afraid that I have sat through Select Committees with
Ministers from various Departments, at various times, giving evidence
on what they thought sustainability meant. Some of them produced the
most ludicrous and meaningless statements, which were just PR fluff. We
have to get serious about sustainability. It has a concrete and serious
meaning, which respects economic sustainability, social sustainability
and&#151;the most important of the three pillars in a long-term
sense&#151;environmental sustainability. Without environmental
sustainability, the other two
fall.</div><a name="1001204000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000660"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> If we proceed along the course that the
hon. Gentleman suggests, well intended as it is, the ability to go
beyond the wisdom of this Committee, or beyond the wisdom of the
proposal that he is putting forward, and to seek views before we agree
on a definition is stymied. That is the way we should do it: to consult
properly on the matter and bring it forward. If we settle on the
definition that he has as the best way forward, so be it, but let us
not cut that out at the moment, because it will not allow any of those
interested parties to contribute to the debate that we are
having.</div>
<a name="1001204000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000661"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister&#146;s willingness to spend public
money on consultations about things that have already been perfectly
and satisfactorily defined is almost
endless.</div><a name="1001204000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000662"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> I am not necessarily endorsing the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment, but clause 3(3) on risk management

of things that might be done in the course of flood or coastal erosion
risk
management&#148;.</div><a name="1001204000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000676"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Briefly, the Minister seeks powers to make
further amendments. Under schedule 2 he is already making quite
extensive amendments to a number of Acts. One that we query in
particular relates to section 23(1)(b) of the Land Drainage Act. There
are concerns that the amendment that the Government seek will impose a
requirement on internal drainage boards and lead local flood
authorities to consult with and, effectively, seek consent from the EA.
A number of concerns have been expressed about the amendments later in
the Bill. What power will the Committee or Parliament have to review
them?</div>
<a name="1001204000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The list of
Acts to which the clause refers does not include the Marine and Coastal
Access Act 2009. I realise that it is a recent Act and the Minister is
probably pleased with its content and its passage, but are there no
circumstances under which he would envisage a need to amend that? I
realise that the Bill has been through a number of drafts and what is
now the Marine and Coastal Access Act was probably a Bill at that
stage. However, it would be helpful to ensure that the list is as
comprehensive as possible. To confirm, does that mean that an
affirmative order will have to be laid in the form of a statutory
instrument before the amendments will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>be made? Are there any other omissions as regards Acts that the Minister
can think of that we may need to return
to?</div><a name="1001204000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000677"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The clause gives the power to amend primary
legislation by order on the personal initiative of the Minister of the
Crown. Even though that may involve an affirmative resolution of the
House, in practice it shifts power from Parliament to the Executive. It
is, I am afraid, rather typical of many pieces of legislation that have
come before the House in recent years and is wholly unacceptable. It
lends extraordinary influence to the personal whim of the Minister and
I would like it not to stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="1001204000240"></a>

1991; and the Environment Act 1995. To address the question from the
hon. Member for Vale of York, the Marine and Coastal Access Act is not
relevant to part 1 of the Bill; that is why it is not set out in
it.</div>
<a name="1001204000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
amendments to those Acts are set out in schedule 2 of the
Bill. However, it is possible that other amendments might be needed to
address inconsistencies between the old framework and the new. It is
not reasonably possible to anticipate all such amendments in advance.
They could include, for example, amendments to the provisions on powers
of entry in the Water Resources Act 1991 so that they are sufficient
for the wider activity of risk management as opposed to flood defence.
Combined with powers under clause 44, which allows for inconsistencies
and errors to be addressed, the clause will enable amendments required
prior to consolidation of the existing floods legislation, as
recommended by Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s
review.</div><a name="1001204000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Lady said, the clause could allow for amendments to primary
legislation, and I confirm that the affirmative procedure requiring a
debate in each House, as well as in the National Assembly for Wales,
will apply before the measures come into force. We believe that to be
the right approach.</div>
<a name="1001204000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000679"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
confirmation on that point. Normally, however, when a Bill is enacted,
it contains a provision which means that the Bill can be amended by
order. I find it a little unusual to have a Bill that states that a
previous Bill can be changed by order.</div>
<a name="1001204000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000680"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> As the hon. Gentleman says, I can safely
say that this is not without precedent. We cannot reasonably anticipate
every eventuality at this moment, but if amendments were necessary we
would want to put them in front of both Houses so that they could be
properly debated. That is the appropriate way to do it.</div>
<a name="1001204000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also inform
the Committee that it is necessary for the Government to table an
amendment to the clause to provide for the fact that some of the
authorities affected  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>by the amendments, such as water companies, operate across borders.
Clarity is needed in the legislation about when they will be subject to
amending regulations.</div>
<a name="1001204000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000681"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. That amendment is not before us
today.</div>
<a name="1001204000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000682"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I apologise. I will return to that
technical issue at a subsequent stage.</div>
<a name="1001204000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000683"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I was minded to let the clause stand part, but
if the Minister plans to come back at a future date with an amendment,
it would perhaps be best to strike the clause from the Bill until we
see the new text. I do not think that it is appropriate. The Minister
has had every opportunity to bring forward amendments by this stage.
Concerns have been expressed to me about the clause, and it might be
appropriate to strike it out until we get the
amendments.</div>
<a name="1001204000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000684"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> It is in the hon. Lady&#146;s gift to
make that decision. As I have said, with your guidance, Mr.
Martlew, we will probably return to the matter at a later stage. The
amendment has not been tabled. If we bring it forward&#151;it is
&#147;if&#148; we do&#151;it will be technical, and we would not
bring it forward now but on Report. I will comply with your strictures,
Mr. Martlew and not go into detail about what it will
be.</div>
<a name="1001204000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000685"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Perhaps this question would have come better
before the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York. I am
concerned about how many times we have done this sort of thing and
allowed ourselves to be bamboozled&#151;not quite bamboozled, but put
in the position of agreeing something that has not been right. I am
concerned about the number of occasions on which we have agreed to put
things into the Bill to allow Ministers to amend the construction of
previous
legislation.</div><a name="1001204000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000686"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The clause is in front of us, and hon.
Members are free to vote for or against it as they see fit. Should we
bring the amendment forward, it would be purely a technical issue on
devolution.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000687"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I beg to move amendment 138, in
clause 29, page 16, line 23, after
&#145;consult&#146;, leave out to end of subsection (4) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(a) the authorities
that would be affected by
it,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) the
public.&#146;.</div><a name="1001204000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment proposes another piece of transparency that we would like to
add to the Bill, which I am sure will be welcome. It would simply
ensure that key decisions that have major implications for local people
are not taken in secret. Under the clause, changes in responsibility
are set down by order, but the shocking truth about orders in this
place&#151;it might shock the hon. Member for Norwich, North, who is
new to these things&#151;is that once in a while we are presented
with orders that have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>already taken effect. We are effectively presented with a fait accompli.
We then face the choice, in a Committee, of rubber-stamping what has
already been done or disrupting procedures that are already taking
place. It is an unsatisfactory process.</div>
<a name="1001204000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is designed to ensure that the Government are never tempted to reassign
responsibilities behind closed doors and present them to Parliament
subsequently, because there might be an obvious temptation to do so.
The reassignment of those responsibilities could be important and could
have implications for local people, and that is not something I would
like to happen behind closed
doors.</div><a name="1001204000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000688"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I do not see the need for amendment 138 or
believe that it would add anything of substance to the Bill. I would
like to make some comments on the Bill&#146;s current drafting. It is
welcome that the Minister may add new bodies and that the Secretary of
State can step in to reassign responsibilities under certain defined
conditions, but I regret that it is not clear how that process will be
instigated or what role the lead local flood authority, the district
councils and the internal drainage boards would have in possibly
instigating such a measure.</div>
<a name="1001204000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would it not
make sense for the Minister to explain the reasons for looking into
restructuring flood provision and state them publicly so that we are
better advised? Perhaps he would be minded to add to the clause
something along the following lines: &#147;Where all lead local flood
authorities in an area request that the Minister consider reassigning
responsibilities within that area, the Minister must respond with
reasons.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister will expand on the authorities that he believes will be
covered. With regard to an order under subsection (2), the reasons
should be stated. It is not entirely clear whether devolution has
automatically been resolved under subsection (6)? Who will make the
order, particularly with regard to trans-border
matters?</div><a name="1001204000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000689"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The clause provides Ministers with powers
to make orders to reassign the flood and coastal erosion risk
management responsibilities of lead local flood authorities, district
councils and internal drainage boards. That will allow the reallocation
of powers between authorities and amendments to the definition of risk
management authorities. It will also allow for additional authorities
to be included as risk management
authorities.</div><a name="1001204000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is probably not as clear as we would like it to be, with regard
to whether additional bodies can be included as risk management
authorities, or whether functions could be transferred to risk
management authorities such as water companies. We intend to clarify
that on Report.</div>
<a name="1001204000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the clause as drafted, the powers provide an additional degree of
flexibility that will allow the framework of responsibilities to evolve
over time, and the powers were recommended by the Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs Committee during pre-legislative scrutiny. Although we do
not have any plans to use them in the short term, the powers will be
important in allowing change in circumstances to be
addressed.</div>
<a name="1001204000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
considering whether subsection (6) accurately reflects the devolution
settlement. If an intended reassignment of responsibility was from or
to a cross-border  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>risk management authority or other body, it is not currently clear where
the ministerial responsibility lies for making such an order. This
provision may, therefore, need to be more precise about when an order
should be made by Welsh Ministers and when it should be made by the
Secretary of State. If further provision is required to clarify that
important technical issue, we will bring forward an amendment on
Report.</div><a name="1001204000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
138 would require public consultation on any changes made by order
under clause 29. In its current form, the clause requires flood risk
authorities to be consulted on any changes. The Government are
committed to the code of practice and consultation, and the Welsh
Assembly Government endorse the same principles and would take the same
approach. Having heard what the hon. Member for Cheltenham said, and
having looked at the provision in the light of his amendment, I will
not waste the Committee&#146;s time further, because the amendment
probably is worth while. Therefore, if the hon. Gentleman will let me
take away the amendment to ensure that the drafting is correct, I am
more than happy to come back with a similar amendment at a subsequent
stage, because it is well intentioned and helps to clarify the purpose
underlying the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000690"></a>Martin

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000691"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Martlew.
When the Bill was brought before the Committee, it was a very small
Bill with fewer than 50 clauses. However, there are 17 paragraphs in
schedule 1 and 54 in schedule 2. I am keen that we have the
opportunity properly to scrutinise the schedules and that there will be
the opportunity to have stand part debates. I seek your guidance,
Mr. Martlew, on whether that should be indicated in advance,
or whether debates will be called as a matter of course if there are no
amendments to the schedules and clauses. Almost half the content of the
Bill is contained in the
schedules.</div><a name="1001204000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000692"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000693"></a>Miss

discuss clause 30. The Minister and the Committee will be aware that
the Select Committee expressed concern about some of the definitions.
The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee concluded that it was
concerned that bodies that will be able to designate things appear
unsure about their scope or scale. The purpose of clause 30 is not in
question, but we want 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>greater clarity about what could be designated, how the designating
authorities will co-ordinate with one another and how differences of
opinion between designating authorities would be resolved. Furthermore,
the provisions providing safeguards and appeals should be included in
the Bill. To a large extent, that issue has been addressed, so I will
confine my
remarks&#151;</div><a name="1001204000272"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000695"></a>Miss

additional legal powers to the Environment Agency to specify further
and to designate the assets or features that may be considered under
the clause, but

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000698"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000704"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The context of this amendment is, of course,
schedule 1 and the powers that it confers. &#147;Designation of
features&#148; sounds administrative and harmless, but buried in the
schedule are some major extensions of regulatory power, and we must
tread cautiously. In that context, it may seem odd that in amendment
139 I seem to be seeking to extend that remit, but I hope that the
Committee will acknowledge that, in later amendments, I propose to
mitigate some of the regulatory powers that the schedule
extends.</div><a name="1001204000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
139 returns to the issue with which I started my Second Reading
speech&#151;will the Bill help Warden Hill? I am trying to place the
provision in the context of precise local circumstances and how it will
work in practice. I remind hon. Members that that part of Cheltenham
has an obvious flood risk in a residential area, which could be
exacerbated or mitigated by how the land immediately uphill at
Leckhampton is used. The fields uphill are a crucial feature of the
local environment. They hold water, and have been marked on a map by
consultants working on the flood alleviation scheme at Warden Hill in
dramatic blocks of blue showing where the water is held in the
landscape. However, it difficult to place them precisely in the context
of the wording of the list in paragraph 4(1)(a) and (b) of schedule
1:</div><a name="1001204000509"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
structure, or...a natural or man-made feature of the
environment.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
139 seeks to put beyond doubt the fact that the list may include not
just an obvious feature such as a dyke or bund, but an area of
landscape that performs a flood management or water management
function. That could extend not just to fields such as those at
Leckhampton, but to an area of woodland or similar. There could be an
argument&#151;some people would have a commercial interest in making
such an argument&#151;for the definition of a man-made or natural
feature of the environment to need just a clearly identifiable physical
thing, such as a watercourse, dyke or bund. The purpose of the
amendment is simply to point out that that kind of natural feature can
mean that a particular area of land performs an important flood risk
management
function.</div><a name="1001204000549"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="1001204000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not refer to amendment 129 because I think my hon. Friend the
Member for Brecon and Radnorshire wants to speak on that, but I shall
briefly speak about amendment 25. It raises a genuine problem, which
has been emphasised, particularly by Network Rail, to members of the
Committee privately. The amendment addresses an important issue, but I
have a slight concern about it. Perhaps when the hon. Member for Vale
of York speaks she might talk about the fact that it could
unintentionally be quite dangerous.</div>
<a name="1001204000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the amendment would mean that infrastructure can be
designated only if it does not compromise the main role of the company,
which is fine with something as crucial as a railway structure.
However, let us say that a wall on a factory&#146;s estate is part of
flood risk management in that it prevents neighbouring houses from
being flooded by containing a river flow. Those who work at the factory
might decide to change the wall because their primary concern is
nothing to do with flood risk management. They are concerned with the
operation of their factory and the wall might for some reason be
inconvenient, so they decide to knock it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>down. I am worried that they might be able to use the clause to justify
that, and that the flood risk management authority would have no
redress, even if the wall was a crucial link in a chain protecting
local people. I hope that the hon. Member for Vale of York can provide
me with an excellent explanation of why that would not be the case. I
look forward to her
remarks.</div><a name="1001204000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000705"></a>Miss

on the
amendment.</div><a name="1001204000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be aware that the National Audit Office&#146;s report
of June 2007 on the construction and maintenance of flood defences in
England found significant regional variations in the proportion of
assets maintained by third parties. The report found that the
proportion of third-party assets in good or very good condition was
lower than for Environment Agency maintained assets. It also found that
the agency had limited powers to force other bodies to improve the
condition of their
assets.</div><a name="1001204000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be aware that the provision previously formed part 2 of
the draft Bill. We need to be mindful of the fact that we should not
downgrade the provisions to the status of a schedule because there are
some very important issues to be discussed here. We are seeking to

answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, each case
will be considered on its merits and according to the facts involved. I
do not wish to be too prescriptive; I just wish to cover the situation
that he has rightly identified. There are certain aspects that are
currently not covered and it is important to include those in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1001204000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see
how amendment 139 adds greatly to the schedule as drafted or to my

regard.</div>

was.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Witnesses
disagreed on exactly what the definition might mean, and what it might
cover. That was one of the specific fears that the Select Committee
included in its report. Is the hon. Lady concerned about
it?</div><a name="1001204000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000709"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The hon. Gentleman refers to the same paragraph
that I read out in the debate on clause 30. I do not accept
that his definition takes the matter any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>further. We need to define objects&#151;physical features such as
woods, dykes or watercourses&#151;not amorphous things. I would like
to designate features that belong to third parties, which the NAO
referred to in that
regard.</div><a name="1001204000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
I am trying to do in amendment 25 is to narrow down the
Minister&#146;s all-encompassing powers. There should be a structure
for trying to identify who owns the features. There will be issues when
we come to discuss sustainable drainage systems that may be more
relevant to what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do in his amendment,
but I just do not accept his definition as
fair.</div><a name="1001204000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are co-signatories to amendment 129, so obviously we support it and may
press it to a vote, depending on what the Minister says. I have some
general remarks on schedule 1, but those are my remarks on the
amendments.</div><a name="1001204000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000710"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I wish to make a couple of brief points
about amendment 139. This time, I have to say to the hon. Member for
Cheltenham that I have some sympathy with what he is saying. Like him,
I am trying to keep several of my communities in mind as the Bill is
going through. One of them in particular is Elvet Waterside. I want to
ensure that it benefits from flood risk management not only because it
is on the floodplain adjacent to the river but because it relies on the
leisure space and bowling green that provide a part of the floodplain.
I would like to hear whether the Minister thinks that such areas will
be protected in paragraph
4(1)(b).</div><a name="1001204000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Minister will forgive me if he did this, but I am not sure
that he sought to reassure me on the points that I raised in the clause
27 stand part debate. Perhaps he could return to them at some
appropriate
time.</div><a name="1001204000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000711"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Perhaps not. Perhaps you could discuss it in
private.</div><a name="1001204000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001204000712"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): I wish to
speak briefly to amendment 139, which has been mentioned by my hon.
Friend the Member for Cheltenham, and also to amendment
129.</div><a name="1001204000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
139 takes forward the definition of what a feature is. Certainly on
this side of the Committee, we are concerned that any natural features
that could in some way limit or mitigate flooding should be protected
and even enhanced. It is sometimes said that the drainage of uplands to
increase agricultural productivity has led to rapidly increased flows
of water, and that the flooding in Tewkesbury originated in the
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit
&#214;pik).</div><a name="1001204000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is work going on in Montgomeryshire whereby upland that has been
drained is now being taken back to its original condition, and drainage
is being obstructed. It has been shown that that can reduce the flow of
water off catchment areas and so mitigate flooding.
Amendment 139 defines what could be a strong method of
reducing flooding, and the Minister should consider it
carefully.</div><a name="1001204000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 129, the designation of features will have implications for
individuals, companies, other organisations and third parties, and
their ownership of property because it will limit what they can do with

<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>their property. It might even put duties on them to maintain or improve
it. We must be careful that things cannot be designated without good
cause. There should be proportionality. Features should be designated
when they materially affect or improve flood prevention
work.</div><a name="1001204000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
129 would take out &#147;affects&#148; and
insert</div><a name="1001204000512"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
likely to have a material effect
on&#148;.</div><a name="1001204000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would raise the bar and ensure that if the owner of property did not
believe that a designation was justified in the public interest, he had
a defence and an objection to the designation. It is important that we
give comfort to those involved in preventing flooding that impositions
will not be put on them unreasonably. Raising the bar in this way is
one way of doing that and of encouraging their co-operation in these
matters.</div><a name="1001204000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000713"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Amendment 139, tabled by the hon. Member
for Cheltenham, would insert an example of the type of feature that may
be designated under schedule 1. That would affect paragraph 4(1), which
provides that</div>
<a name="1001204000513"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a designating
authority may designate for the purposes of this Schedule...a
structure, or...a natural or man-made feature of the
environment.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would add the
words</div><a name="1001204000514"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including
defined geographical areas of
landscape.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well
intentioned as it is, I do not think that the amendment is appropriate
because the definition is intentionally broad so that it includes any
natural feature that acts as or forms part of a flood defence. To be
designated, the feature must have an effect on flood or erosion risks.
The idea of having examples of things that might be designated is good,
but those should be provided in guidance, particularly considering the
variety of things that might be designated. Including them would make
the Bill more
complicated.</div><a name="1001204000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
clarify that the intention is to designate things that have a tangible
effect on flooding, such as boundary walls, embankments and culverts,
which have been referred to. I acknowledge that there might be broader
benefits, as the hon. Gentleman has said about this amendment and
others. Some of those were identified in the evidence sessions. The
representative of the Woodland Trust
stated:</div><a name="1001204000515"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
that feature is also going to have other wider landscape benefits for
habitat, recreation and biodiversity in other ways, then by protecting
that feature for flooding, you are also protecting all those other
public benefits.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Flood and Water Management Public Bill Committee, </i>7 January 2010;
c. 50, Q73.]</div><a name="1001204000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not disagree with that. The critical point is that in protecting a
feature from flooding, the other benefits will be protected. The test
for such designated features is that they contribute to flood risk
management.</div><a name="1001204000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
clarify that designations are intended to control things that are
important to managing risk on the floodplain, rather than to label the
floodplains themselves or afford areas landscape protections that the
legislation designed for such purposes has not given. It seems unlikely
that woodland would have a sufficient effect on flood risk to be
designated, just for the sake of being woodland. It therefore falls
outside the original intention. There may be woodland or parcels of
land that are used as flood storage. There are many of those in our
constituencies. Alternatively, streams of water might be directed
through woodland during a flood and it might be helpful to designate
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div><a name="1001204000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
avoid inappropriate designation. Given that we are designating parcels
of land, if we inappropriately designated something that was not
related to flood risk management, we would be increasing the risk of a
successful
appeal.</div><a name="1001204000550"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="1001204000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will now consider the interesting question of whether something is a
structure or a feature according to the definitions. Structures are
generally interpreted as being man-made or managed assets. Features,
however, may include or encompass natural features such as mounds,
banks or paths over which water flows. The idea is not to enable vast
swathes of land to be included arbitrarily, but it could include those
things, provided they affect flood
risk.</div><a name="1001204000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
129, tabled by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, would change
one of the conditions, set out in schedule 1, that must be satisfied
before a feature can be designated. The condition is that a designating
authority may designate only where it</div>
<a name="1001204000516"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;thinks the
existence or location of the structure or feature affects...a
flood risk, or...a coastal erosion risk.&#148;</div>
<a name="1001204000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would
remove the word &#147;affects&#148; and replace it with the
phrase</div>
<a name="1001204000517"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is likely to
have a material effect
on&#148;.</div><a name="1001204000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not believe that that would have a material effect on the provision,
because that is what the Bill means by the use of the word
&#147;affects&#148;. I will give an interesting example, because we
have teased the matter out in discussions as we have brought the
wording forward. One effect in one area that is beneficial could have a
negative effect down the line. I think that our use of the word
&#147;effect&#148; recognises that one can look at that overall,
rather than look just at one instance that might have a material impact
somewhere, so we should look at it in the round.</div>
<a name="1001204000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that the Government do not expect an authority to attempt to designate
a structure or feature that did not have a material effect on the risk
of flooding or coastal erosion, and the guidance will give effect to
that. The appeals provisions provide a further safeguard to prevent
that happening. With regard to a duty on people who own features that
are designated to maintain them, the Bill does not give that duty to
maintain. It provides only that they should not interfere with it
without consent. The hon. Member for Cheltenham raised the classic
example of something that had not originally been designed as a flood
risk management feature but that subsequently provides a flood
management role, from a committee&#146;s perspective. The intention
is not to ensure that the landowner maintains the feature, but to
ensure that it cannot be interfered with to the detriment of flood risk
management. The authority cannot withhold consent unless a flood risk
is affected.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000714"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I am listening to the Minister carefully, but if
a feature is in the ownership of an individual, a body or a company,
what happens if it deteriorates so that its effect on preventing
flooding is diminished? Does that mean there is not duty or burden on
the owner to improve it or put it
right?</div><a name="1001204000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000715"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No. We considered whether we should bring
forward in the Bill a clear and specific duty on individual owners, but
that really will take a fair bit of thought. It is very complex,
because we could be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>talking not only about companies, but about an individual living on a
smallholding or a house where the wall abuts a stream or river that is
part of the flood risk management strategy. That will require much
thought, so we have not brought such a measure forward. The Bill
enables the Environment Agency, for example, to work with such
landowners to try to recognise and designate the features that are
important and to try to work reasonably and constructively with them
towards its maintenance, but there would not be a duty on the
individual to maintain it. However, if that wall, having been
identified and designated, was crumbling and falling down, the
Environment Agency would be able to work with the landowner to go on to
the land and ensure that it was repaired, if it relates to flood risk
management in the area. In that way, we can achieve the purposes
without trespassing on the rights of individuals too heavily, which I
know the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire would not want us to
do.</div><a name="1001204000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also raised the matter of protection for the owners of
the assets, which I have just touched on. The owners may make
representations on provisional designation, to say that it should or
should not be in&#151;this confers some sort of
responsibility&#151;and also to appeal a designation notice
thereafter. As I have said, authorities will engage with this so that
they are properly informed. And let us not forget that the owner will
also benefit from effective flood risk management and probably from the
feature being there and being kept in good shape.</div>
<a name="1001204000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree that
it is important to consider whether a designation could impede the
primary purpose of a feature in respect of amendment 25. I would like
to reassure the House that under no circumstances do I anticipate that
a designation will compromise the primary purpose of infrastructure.
But a designation will offer a basic standard of protection to a
structure or feature and to those relying on its flood risk management
properties, by requiring flood risks to be taken into account before it
is altered, removed or replaced. It will be possible to replace the
designated structure or feature with another, provided that this flood
risk is taken into account. The authority will not be able to withhold
consent to a change unless flood risk is affected. In many instances,
the owner or operator of a feature designated is also, as I have said,
going to benefit from the flood protection, irrespective of its primary
purpose.</div><a name="1001204000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
a designation will not affect an operator&#146;s ability to operate,
maintain or repair their infrastructure to ensure that it remains in
its current state for its primary purpose. I have to make it clear that
in all cases I expect designating authorities to work with
infrastructure providers in respect flood risk management and consider
carefully whether it is appropriate to issue a designation. The
affected parties will, as I have said, have the formal right to make
representations in respect of a provisional designation and the
authority must take these representations into account. If all else
fails, a right of appeal is provided. There is nothing in the
provisions that will prevent the provider of infrastructure and a
designating authority reaching an agreement in respect of flood risk
management without recourse to a designation should they want to do
so.</div>
<a name="1001204000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
with that clarification I ask the hon. Members for Cheltenham, for
Brecon and Radnorshire, and for Upminster not to press their
amendments, on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>understanding that the definition of what may be designated as a feature
is intentionally sufficiently broad such that a designation could be
made only where it materially affects flood risk, and because the
provisions should not impede the primary purpose of
infrastructure.</div>
<a name="1001204000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000716"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am a little surprised that some of the
Minister&#146;s remarks sounded ambivalent about the value of broader
natural features such as woodland in mitigating flood. Earlier in the
Committee I quoted, extensively I think, from the Woodland Trust and
their statistics about the impact that woodland can have on reducing
flood risk. Before he stands up, I might also quote to him some
research by the university of Manchester which has shown that
increasing the green space covering urban areas by 10 per cent. reduces
surface water run-off by almost 5 per cent., increasing tree cover in
urban areas by 10 per cent. reduces surface water run-off by almost 6
per cent., and adding green roofs to buildings in town centres can
reduce surface water run-off by almost 20 per cent. So there are many
and varied kinds of natural or semi-natural features that utilise the
natural properties of soil, trees and plants to retain
water.</div>
<a name="1001204000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000717"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Far from being ambivalent, we do
recognise&#151;I apologise if I was not clear&#151;that woodland
can contribute to flood risk management. But it is important that a
designation is in respect of flood risk management, not woodland per
se.</div>
<a name="1001204000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000718"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am not entirely sure I have been helped by that
intervention, which seemed almost to contradict itself. Perhaps the
Minister would be absolutely crystal clear on this. Does he think that
this intentionally broad definition could cover a feature such as a
field or woodland if those had been identified as important to flood
risk
management?</div><a name="1001204000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000719"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed, if they were designated as
features that contribute to the flood risk management. There&#146;s
the rub. That is the important aspect of it. It is not appropriate to
designate a woodland or a feature for its own sake. It has to
contribute to flood risk management. So, on that basis,
yes.</div><a name="1001204000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000720"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Good. We may have a result in that case. If so, I
may not press amendment 139 to a
vote.</div><a name="1001204000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
briefly to address amendment 129, we may return at other stages to the
pretty onerous powers conferred by the Bill. If we do not further amend
the Bill in some respect or other, we would allow the Environment
Agency and other flood risk management authorities an alarming and
surprising degree of control over people&#146;s own property. The
Minister keeps using phrases suggesting that he does not anticipate
that compromising primary purposes, but I am not sure whether that
would be enough to satisfy Network Rail and some worried landowners and
farmers. We will have to return to that under the aegis of other
amendments, as I do not think that we will press these two to a
vote.</div><a name="1001204000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
leave the Minister with one thought. Although he seems to be clear
about the definition of &#147;a feature&#148;, the Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs Committee was crystal clear. It said:</div>
<a name="1001204000518"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
concerned that bodies that would be able to designate
&#145;things&#146; appear unsure about their scope or scale. The
purpose of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>the provisions is not in question but there needs to be greater clarity
about what could be designated, how the designating authorities would
coordinate with one another and how differences of opinion
between designating authorities would be
resolved.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are real issues, to which the hon. Member for Vale of York has also
alluded.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000727"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Amendment 140 addresses the area of unintended
consequences. I hope that the unintended consequences that we will be
pointing out will horrify the Minister once we draw his attention to
them.</div><a name="1001204000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
5(1) of schedule 1 is far too broadly drafted. If we look at it
precisely, the wording
says:</div><a name="1001204000519"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person may not alter, remove or replace a designated structure or
feature without the consent of the responsible
authority.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an incredibly broad definition when we are talking about things that
may require maintenance, that may require proper attention in their
normal usage&#151;sometimes that might mean rebuilding, sometimes
growth if we are talking about natural features,
sometimes harvesting, or sometimes ploughing if we are talking about
fields. The Minister very kindly pointed out that the definition in the
schedule is broad enough to include such features, provided
that they have been specifically identified as having a role in flood
risk
management.</div><a name="1001204000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet,
on the face of it, it is not only Network Rail that would have to seek
permission to maintain something, even something that they might think
is essential to the safety of rail passengers&#151;a landowner might
have to seek permission to maintain and carry out proper land
management of a piece of woodland, hedgerow or some other part of the
landscape; a farmer might, in theory, if we take this to absurd
extremes, have to seek 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>the permission of a flood risk management authority before ploughing a
field if that field had been identified as important to flood risk
management and had been designated as a feature. Although it seems
absurd that a lead local authority, an IDB or some other body might
take it to that extreme, the trouble with such legislation is that if
we require such fine judgments about whether something is justified or
not, the legislation places all the cards in one player&#146;s hands.
In this case, the Bill would place all the powers in the hands of the
flood risk management authorities; if they designate a feature, they
have carte blanche to insist that a property owner needs consent. It
then takes the power away from the particular landowner or asset owner,
who would not have a leg to stand on if they disputed the powers being
exercised.</div><a name="1001204000551"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

that needs to be qualified. We have specifically done so in

hope that form of words would take care of the worries of Network Rail
and also the concerns of landowners and farmers.</div>
<a name="1001204000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 141
addresses the same kind of issues, but leaves out the very broad word
&#147;affect&#148; flood risk, and inserts the phrase
&#147;significantly increase.&#148; That is partly on a purely
logical basis. One would think that if somebody was going to change a
flood risk feature, they would want to reduce flood risk, and that
would be the perfect grounds on which to do it.</div>
<a name="1001204000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have an
example in my constituency. There is an area called Keynshambury road
which backs on to Sandford park in the middle of Cheltenham. The River
Chelt, which is one of the EA&#146;s main rivers, passes behind a row
of houses. A wall that was maintained by the Environment Agency looked
as though it protected all those houses. It came to an end&#151;it
simply stopped&#151;and effectively went down to ground level. When
the floods of 2007 happened, the floodwater went around the end of the
wall and flooded all the houses. The wall had no impact whatever,
except to hold some of the water back in the gardens and prevent it
from flowing back into the river. It was the absolute opposite of what
it was intended to do. In fact, the Environment Agency had told local
residents that they were not allowed to touch that wall. They would not
even have been allowed to repair an obvious crack or break, and were
not allowed to add to it in order to make it a complete flood
defence.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000731"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Paragraph 6(5) is about consent to alteration,

that</div><a name="1001204000522"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
responsible authority may refuse to give consent applied for under
subparagraph (3)(a) only on the ground that, in the authority&#146;s

refusal of consent could put the asset owner in an unreasonable
position with respect to the flood risk management authority. Again, it

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000734"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I want to speak about amendment
160. It is a very straightforward amendment. Essentially, it asks the
Minister to provide a right of appeal against conditions that have been
imposed by an authority providing consent for work, and the ability to
appeal against the refusal of consent. The schedule outlines the
circumstances in which an appeal can be made, which do not currently
include appealing against any conditions. That point was raised by the
National Farmers Union in the evidence session. I will not press the
amendment this evening, but will the Minister reconsider the
matter?</div>
<a name="1001204000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000735"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me deal first with
amendment 140, which was tabled by the hon. Member for
Cheltenham. The amendment seeks to set out what maintenance is
acceptable in respect of a feature designated under schedule 1. As the
hon. Gentleman said, the amendment would affect paragraph 5, which
states:</div><a name="1001204000523"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person may not alter, remove or replace a designated structure or
feature without the consent of the responsible
authority.&#148;</div>
<a name="1001204000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would
add</div>
<a name="1001204000524"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;except where
routine maintenance or maintenance for safety purposes is required of a
structure, and where routine maintenance or use or good management is
required of a natural or man-made feature of the
environment.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Authorities
will not seek to prevent the normal management or operation of a
feature that keeps or restores a feature to the condition it was in at
the time of designation. The purpose of designation is not to require
any owner of a designated asset to do anything other than to continue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>its normal use. What will require consent from the authority is a
material change to that designated feature. That is because a change
could increase the risk of flooding and of coastal erosion. An
authority will need to consider whether flood or coastal erosion is
affected. If it is, the consent may be refused. However, consent cannot
be refused if there is no effect on flood risk. Any designation or
refusal of consent would have to be reasonable and be subject to
appeals. I refer hon. Members to paragraph 15 of the
schedule.</div><a name="1001204000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
141, which was also tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, seeks to
amend the wording of paragraph 6. As it stands, the provision
prescribes that an authority may only refuse consent for an alteration,
removal or replacement of a designated feature on the grounds that the
proposed change</div>
<a name="1001204000525"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would affect a
flood risk or a coastal erosion
risk.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to change the provision so that consent may only be
refused if the proposed change to a feature would significantly
increase the risks.</div>
<a name="1001204000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make it
clear that authorities will not seek to use a designation to prevent
maintenance or repairs being carried out that will keep or restore the
asset to its present state at the time of designation, nor will
designation prevent a change from being made, provided that flood risk
is not increased or affected. The only circumstances under which an
authority could refuse a removal, an alteration or replacement are
where the flood risk or coastal erosion risk is affected. I am not
convinced that any further safeguard is
necessary.</div><a name="1001204000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000736"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="1001204000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000737"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b><b class="B"> </b>Let me expand a little, because I
need to explain the nature of the wording proposed by the hon.
Gentleman. As they stand, the provisions seek to prevent any increase
in risk. It may not be its intention, but the amendment runs the risk
of allowing a gradual, iterative and accumulative reduction in flood
risk protection, which, over time, could have significant consequences.
So, the current provision refers to the effect on risk. However, there
would clearly be no grounds to refuse permission for the work proposed
if its effect would be to reduce the risk of
flooding.</div><a name="1001204000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000738"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s point about the
progressive and cumulative potential of small changes, but,
nevertheless, he is therefore arguing that even maintaining a piece of
woodland would need consent. Even if that were not unreasonably
refused, nothing in the Bill would stop a flood risk management
authority designating that piece of woodland as a flood risk management
feature and insisting on consent for
maintenance.</div>
<a name="1001204000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000739"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> To revert to our earlier discussion, that
is exactly where the appropriateness of the designation must be
precise. That woodland, flood meadow or whatever must be appropriately
designated as part of the flood risk management within that area and
become a designated asset for the purpose of what we are discussing. On
that basis, anything that was done to that woodland that did not
materially affect it would cause no concern whatever. The issue relates
to instances in which the capacity of the asset that has been
identified 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>as contributing to flood risk management is diminished&#151;therefore,
someone could maintain, repair, plant, sow or do
whatever.</div><a name="1001204000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cheltenham painted a picture earlier and said&#151;I
cannot remember his exact words&#151;that such a situation would
clearly be ridiculous. He is absolutely right. The idea that the
authority would say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry. You cannot plant
additional trees there,&#148; or &#147;You cannot replant or thin
out or whatever,&#148; is ridiculous. A duty of reasonableness must
be applied. Therefore, the more spectacularly ridiculous situations
simply should not
apply.</div><a name="1001204000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me make it clear that a designation does not restrict maintenance that
simply maintains the asset in its existing state. Indeed, a formal
requirement has not been included to maintain a feature to a given
standard for the purposes of flood risk management. The issue has been
considered and explained in the consultation response. There may be
concern among infrastructure operators that construction and change to
infrastructure may be impeded. I seek to offer clear reassurance on
that point. My officials are already meeting Network Rail to discuss
those issues. A designation does not prevent a change from being made
to the structure or feature; what it does require is the consent of the
designating authority. Such consent cannot be unreasonably
withheld.</div>
<a name="1001204000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">Network Rail
in particular has been concerned that authorities would try to
designate things that are not suitable to flood defence. We have given
it the reassurance that if something is not suited to flood defence, it
would not be designated. Operating authorities would engage with
infrastructure providers in the course of establishing what should be
designated. If all else fails and there is a ridiculous or unreasonable
designation of a particular feature, the right of appeal
remains.</div><a name="1001204000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Network
Rail was also concerned about the duty to maintain and that it would be
required to maintain things to a higher standard. We have assured it
that there is no formal duty to maintain and although an enforcement
notice might require remedial action to restore the feature to its
state at the time of designation, under no circumstances could a higher
standard of defence be demanded. The hon. Member for Cheltenham also
referred to the authority controlling a person by means of designation.
As I have said, the measure does not mean that they cannot make a
change, but it is important that we designate the correct assets. That
is the crucial
point.</div><a name="1001204000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
160, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham, would
strengthen the right of appeal in respect of the designation of
features under schedule 1. The amendment would add a right of appeal
against the conditions that an authority may set in granting consent to
an application for alteration, removal or replacement of a designated
feature. Conditions would normally be specific requirements relating to
the time and nature of
works.</div><a name="1001204000552"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="1001204000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the NFU, and possibly others, is concerned that an individual
would not be able to appeal against the conditions. We have a
comprehensive set of appeals in the Bill and it is only right that
individuals are also able to appeal consent conditions. That would be
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>addition to the right of appeal in respect of outright refusal to
consent to a change, to cancel a designation or in respect of an
enforcement notice. So my hon. Friend makes a valid point that we
should consider granting right of appeal. That was always the policy
intention, but it might be that the provision does not adequately
deliver it, as she has spotted. I am happy to look further at the
matter. In the light of that, perhaps she would be prepared not to
press the amendment, as she
indicated.</div><a name="1001204000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other amendments, I can assure the Committee that the provisions in
the Bill are not designed to prevent routine maintenance or the keeping
in working order of a designated feature. For that reason, I ask the
hon. Member for Cheltenham to withdraw amendment 140 and not to press
amendment
141.</div><a name="1001204000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000740"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Somebody once said that the only freedom that
counts is the freedom to do what somebody else thinks is wrong. If
everybody agrees that something is a reasonable consent, designation or
piece of maintenance, there is absolutely no problem. Clearly, that is
the ideal world in which the Minister would like to live. The problem
is that it is precisely when one person says, &#147;That is
ridiculous. You can&#146;t do that,&#148; or another person says,
&#147;It is ridiculous to refuse consent for this. This is something
that I absolutely have to do,&#148; that the wording of the Bill
matters.</div><a name="1001204000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can imagine a situation where someone&#146;s woodland or even
hillside&#151;I can think of a case near where I live&#151;might be
designated as important to flood risk management because the vegetation
holds water. Good land management dictates that occasionally one has to
cut back the vegetation and reduce its volume. Under the terms of the
Bill, if that meant that the flood risk increased while the vegetation
was regrowing, the land manager would have to go through the time and
effort of seeking consent to do the work. The flood risk management
authority&#151;the lead local authority or whoever&#151;would be
perfectly within its rights to refuse the land manager the right to cut
back the vegetation because, on the face of it, that would increase
flood risk, yet it would be part of good land
management.</div><a name="1001204000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
land manager&#151;in some cases, common land and a voluntary
organisation might be involved&#151;might have to decide whether to
put in all the time, effort and expense and possibly lose an appeal,
or, frankly, to give up and do something more productive with their
life.</div><a name="1001204000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000741"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am worried that we might be arguing
about slightly different things. I have tried to make it clear that a
natural feature such as a woodland or meadow would be designated only
if it can be identified and designated as being pertinent to flood risk
management within the area. That is the only occasion. It is important
that we get that right first of all and do not designate for its own
sake.</div><a name="1001204000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
might want to protect a local woodland and designate it in some way
that will protect it for ever and a day. The Bill does not deal with
that. If we get the designation correct, of a parcel of land for
example, it becomes a feature as designated, and it is right that the
same conditions should apply there as elsewhere. The important thing is
to designate for the right reasons, and to ensure that the designation
is targeted specifically at the feature that satisfies the need to
protect against flood risk.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div><a name="1001204000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000742"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am not sure that I am reassured at all by the
Minister&#146;s comment. By definition, we are talking about things
that have been designated as important to flood risk management. As we
have argued on various occasions and seem to have agreed until now,
that can include natural landscape
features.</div><a name="1001204000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
live in a largely artificial landscape in this country. Even the
countryside is largely artificial. It requires active land management
and attention, and sometimes the cutting back of vegetation or the
maintenance or dredging of channels. All those things require active
intervention on an ongoing basis, yet paragraph 5(1) of the schedule
states that, once the appropriate designation has taken
place:</div><a name="1001204000526"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person may not alter, remove or replace a designated structure or
feature without the consent of the responsible
authority.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;May
not alter&#148; in any way, presumably&#151;there is no
qualification in the schedule. That is an incredibly onerous
restriction on active land management, not to mention Network Rail and
other people whom we have
discussed.</div><a name="1001204000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
if it is completely reasonable and desirable to designate a feature as
a flood risk management feature, the schedule confers an extraordinary
power. We are simply seeking to qualify it and make it more obviously
reasonable.</div><a name="1001204000388"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000743"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> This is my last intervention,
Mr. Martlew. If an embankment is identified and designated
and the farmer decides to ram a hole through it, that is one thing. But
for someone who has a field or meadow that has been rightly designated
as part of the scheme, the place in which we can describe the kind of
relationship that we would expect between the designating authority,
the consenting authority and the landowner will be the guidance, not
the Bill. We can expand on such things and bring forward proper ideas
for how it would work. It is ridiculous to suggest that someone would
say to a farmer, &#147;We have designated that. I am sorry, but that
is the end of your
farming.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000389"></a>

&#145;reasonable&#146;.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">To prevent
this Schedule being a general get-out for any loss or damage caused

incurred loss as a result of a flood risk management authority&#146;s
power of entry. As it reads, compensation would not be due if the loss
or disturbance incurred was as a result of powers conferred by
paragraph 13(1). That paragraph gives all the various powers
by which a responsible authority may at any reasonable time enter land.
That creates a circular position whereby no compensation is payable for
loss in circumstances which are the only circumstances in which powers
of entry may be exercised. The conditions for compensation not being
paid will therefore be satisfied in almost every case, as far as I can
see. My question to the Minister is, when can compensation be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000761"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The amendment relates to compensation
under schedule 1. Paragraph 14 sets out the circumstances in which an
authority must pay compensation to a person. Compensation would be in
respect of damage caused by an authority in exercising its powers of
entry, and those powers of entry are set out in paragraph 13. They
enable authorities to enforce designations, and to put things right if
the owner refuses to do so. The powers include entry to check
compliance with a designation notice or enforcement notice, and enable
an authority to take the steps set out in an enforcement notice when
the owner has failed to do so. There is also provision for the
authority to take action in an emergency to restore a
feature.</div><a name="1001204000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause as drafted requires compensation to be paid if a person has
complied with the law but suffered damage. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point that the conditions for not paying compensation will always be
satisfied&#151;that it is circular&#151;is not valid. It is
necessary for the person to have infringed the designation or an
enforcement notice. If the person had not infringed the designation or
an enforcement notice, compensation will be paid, but it is not payable
if the person had breached a designation notice or had failed to comply
with an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>enforcement notice. It also means that if damage has been done to a
neighbouring property, compensation is
payable.</div><a name="1001204000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would affect paragraph 14(3), which states that compensation
will not be paid to a person who has suffered damage if they have
contravened a designation notice. That would mean that they had made an
alteration, removal or replacement to a designated feature without
consent. The amendment would offer compensation if the authority had
acted unreasonably. I appreciate the idea, because the individual
property owner would have no control over that. Just because a person
has breached a designation or an enforcement notice does not mean that
they should have to suffer unreasonable damage to their property. In
practical terms, the authority&#146;s ability to make good something
that has been damaged or has deteriorated should not enable it to tramp
willy-nilly over property and cause unreasonable damage in so
doing.</div><a name="1001204000555"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.45
pm</div><a name="1001204000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000762"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> So, in a situation in which a designation
notice&#151;for example, for clearing a water channel&#151;has not
been complied with, and therefore the authority believes that the
landowner is in breach, and its officials enter the land to try to
carry out the work, but in the process accidentally damage a piece of
equipment, presumably the damage would not be compensatable because
both the conditions in paragraph 14(3) are
satisfied.</div><a name="1001204000418"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000763"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No. I would expect the enforcing
authority, in exercising its duty to be reasonable in the
circumstances, would have discussions and engage with the landowner to
ensure that when it enters the land to rectify the feature that has
been damaged, or whatever, it does so in a way that minimises damage to
the property. Acting unreasonably might involve not telling the
landowner that it needs to go on to the land to remove a feature that
has fallen into disrepair or to clear a brook. The authority should
say, &#147;Can we talk about which ways we should get on to the land
to minimise damage? Is it by this path or across that field?&#148; If
it did not do so, but simply rode roughshod, taking a path that damaged
the individual&#146;s property unnecessarily, compensation could well
be
payable.</div><a name="1001204000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a way forward on this. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is valid.
If an authority comes on to somebody&#146;s land, which it can
rightly do under the Bill, we do not want to see unnecessary damage
caused as a result. There is not a de facto power for the authority to
do whatever it wants. It has to be reasonable in the way that it uses
the power. I am happy to make the commitment that we will spell out in
guidance exactly what will be expected of an authority: it should seek
to avoid any damage and should work with the landowner to seek access
and so on. An emergency might produce difficult situations, but I think
we can provide clarity on that in guidance. The first approach must be
to try to avoid any damage. If damage must be caused to get to an
inaccessible part of a field, for example, the aim must be to minimise
it. That is the approach that we are looking
at.</div><a name="1001204000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that the amendment is required because, as has been
mentioned, under administrative law, authorities must act reasonably in
exercising their functions. If an authority is not exercising powers in
relation to the right of entry, it is likely to be trespassing and the
owner would have civil remedies.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div><a name="1001204000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000764"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Setting aside the issue of damage, when will
there ever be a circumstance in which a flood risk management authority
does not fulfil Condition 1 or 2 of paragraph 14? Regardless of whether
it causes damage, it will always fulfil one of those
conditions.</div><a name="1001204000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000765"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> If an authority enters the land
justifiably, in relation to the powers in the schedule, it still has a
duty to act reasonably at all times. The power does not give it the
opportunity to tramp willy-nilly across somebody&#146;s land. It
gives it the power to access land in a reasonable way to remedy
something that has happened to the detriment of an
asset.</div><a name="1001204000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether the owner could be the victim of
uncompensatable damages for not clearing a water channel, for example.
No; the owner is under no obligation, as a result of designation, to
clear a water channel or to take any positive action. He has raised a
real issue, however, and I am happy to undertake to set out in guidance
the approach that an authority will have to take when exercising this
power. Broadly, that guidance will be to avoid damage to property and
to minimise damage if it is unavoidable. On that basis, I ask him to
consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="1001204000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000766"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am still not sure that the Minister has
answered my question. I am now entirely familiar with his argument that
any flood risk management authority has to act reasonably under all
circumstances and that the law will support that, but the simple fact
is that the conditions in paragraph 14(3) and (4), Conditions 1 and 2,
are the very conditions needed for entry to the property in the first
place, so it is a circular argument. By definition, they will always be
fulfilled, unless, as in the rather strange example the Minister
suggested, the flood risk management authorities trespass on
people&#146;s land, which seems unlikely, so I think we can disregard
that.</div>
<a name="1001204000425"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000767"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> There is another clear eventuality: that
the flood risk management authorities go on to the land because they
suspect that a feature has been interfered with, but in doing so they
find that it has not. In that case, the power has been used but the
condition that the owner has interfered with the feature has not been
satisfied. That is a clear example of where that could happen. On that
basis, compensation would be payable.</div>
<a name="1001204000426"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000768"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am sorry, but as far as I read it the Minister
is quite wrong. Condition 1 is that</div>
<a name="1001204000527"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the loss or
disturbance is the result of the exercise of powers conferred by
paragraph 13(1)(a) or
(d)&#148;,</div><a name="1001204000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
paragraph 13(1)(a) sets out the power to enter
land</div><a name="1001204000528"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
determine whether a person has contravened paragraph
5(1)&#148;.</div><a name="1001204000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">Exploratory
powers of entry are explicitly allowed and that condition would be
fulfilled, so if damage was caused the landowner would say,
&#147;Hang on a minute. You entered my land to try to discover
whether I was contravening the designation conditions.&#148; And the
Environment Agency will be able to respond, &#147;We are sorry, but
we were fulfilling condition 1 of paragraph 14(3) of
schedule 1, so no compensation is
payable.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot see any way to get around that.</div>
<a name="1001204000430"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000769"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I get the feeling that we are repeating
arguments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div><a name="1001204000431"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000770"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It seems to me that an answer has not been given
and that the clause gives a blanket opportunity for flood risk
management authorities, whether the lead local authority or the
Environment Agency, to refuse to pay compensation, merely on the
grounds that they had a legitimate reason to enter the property in the
first place. That means that, even if they think they are acting
reasonably but accidentally cause damage to valuable property, and
although they have the opportunity to compensate for it, the clause
gives them the perfect
get-out.</div><a name="1001204000432"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000771"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I do not think that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment is necessary, and I have explained why.
However, it would not actually detract from the substance of the
clause, so if it would help to speed up the Committee&#146;s progress
I am happy to concede to the spirit of what he is saying by taking it
away and bringing something back on that. I do not think that it is
necessary, but I am happy to do
that.</div><a name="1001204000433"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000772"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am delighted by the Minister&#146;s words and
beg to ask leave the withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="1001204000504"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I">Amendment,

proposed, </i>That the schedule be the First schedule to the
Bill.</div>
<a name="1001204000435"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000773"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I invite the Minister to respond to the points I
made earlier and wish to draw his attention to some of our other
concerns. He is aware that I sit on the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Committee and that that Committee expressed its concern that
the bodies that will be able to designate appear to be unsure about
their scope or scale. We all agree on the purpose of the provisions,
but we seek greater clarity about what can be designated, how the
designating authorities would co-ordinate with each another and how
differences of opinion between them would be resolved, and that relates
largely to paragraph 1 of schedule
1.</div><a name="1001204000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Select Committee also raised concerns about the appeals procedure. I
repeat that there are 17 paragraphs in the schedule, as the Minister is
aware, and I would be interested to know, now that the manager is not
in the room, what the Government&#146;s thinking was behind that.
Rather than simply pleasing the usual channels and managers of the
House, would the Minister explain what the thinking was behind putting
that in a schedule? Does that weaken its legislative force?</div>
<a name="1001204000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am hesitant
about regulations providing the right of appeal against designations
and refusal of consent, as set out. I am entirely in agreement with the
Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which said
that safeguards and appeals should be included in the Bill, and I would
prefer them to be on the face of the Bill. The Committee goes as far as
to say that lack of such provisions in the Bill is a serious
deficiency, and I find some sympathy with that. The legislation, in its
present form, would confer substantial, far-reaching powers on
designating authorities. The checks and balances should have been
available for this Committee, and the EFRA Committee, to scrutinise,
and for interested parties and partners to comment on as part of the
consultation.</div><a name="1001204000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might also be helpful to obtain the Minister&#146;s comments on the
fact that the EFRA Committee wishes to exclude the Minister from the
list of bodies that can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>consider such appeals. The Local Government Flood Forum appreciates that
the ability to designate features will be useful. I share its concern
that the guidance to the Bill links designations to the register of
assets, implying that lead local flood authorities will develop
comprehensive designating programmes. What funds does the Minister
envisage will be at their disposal? If he says that their existing
resources must be used, in all probability they might feel unable to
develop such a comprehensive approach unless they have the means at
their
disposal.</div><a name="1001204000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofwat
has raised concerns about the schedule. It is worried about local
authorities&#146; far-reaching powers to designate assets that affect
flood or coastal erosion risk management, under schedule 1. Ofwat gives
the example that a local authority could choose to designate all or
part of the public sewer network that a water or sewerage company
operates. The company could not then alter, remove or replace its
network without consent. It is a similar argument to that which we had
before, but Ofwat has raised particular concerns there.</div>
<a name="1001204000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Country
Land and Business Association, the CLA, has raised a number of concerns
about the prescriptiveness. The first condition for designation is
that</div><a name="1001204000529"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
structure or feature
affects&#151;</div><a name="1001204000530"></a><div class="hs_brev">a
flood risk,
or</div><a name="1001204000531"></a><div class="hs_brev">a coastal
erosion
risk.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
in the CLA&#146;s view that is simply far too
broad.</div><a name="1001204000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
paragraph 1, are there no circumstances under which the Minister would
either limit or expand upon &#147;Designating authority&#148;? Does
he believe that that is an exhaustive list? I wonder if he could shed
some light on how &#147;Responsible authority&#148; should be
interpreted? To what extent will the &#147;Owner&#148; of the
infrastructure or land&#151;in fact, all interested parties&#151;be
consulted about the guidance that he has stated will be
issued?</div><a name="1001204000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
4 and 5&#151;particularly paragraph 5&#151;really are very
far-reaching. Paragraph 5(1)
reads:</div><a name="1001204000532"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person may not alter, remove or replace a designated structure or
feature without the consent of the responsible
authority.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the first reading of it, that really is very prescriptive and very
wide-reaching. I wonder if the Minister could define the designation of
a local land charge more
specifically?</div><a name="1001204000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are our main concerns. We believe that the schedule is prescriptive; we
believe the guidance, the consent procedures and, indeed, the appeals
procedures should be made clear on the face of the Bill. We do have
some sympathy with the EFRA Committee and others, who say that schedule
1 is defective in that
regard.</div><a name="1001204000556"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000774"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I rise to express my support and that of my hon.
Friend the Member for Cheltenham for this first schedule to the Bill,
in the sense that we believe it is appropriate to designate certain
features that have an effect on flood management and coastal erosion.
However, we have difficulty with the tenor of the
schedule.</div>
<a name="1001204000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">One issue is
that we have four designating authorities: the Environment Agency, the
lead local flood authority, the district council&#151;whether or not
it is the lead local flood authority&#151;and internal drainage
boards. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div>owner of a particular feature could have four designating authorities
looking at any ownership he has of any feature. We have to consider the
matter from the viewpoint of an individual, a company, a business or
any other body&#151;perhaps even a charitable body&#151;and the
fact that they will have to deal with four designating authorities. The
complexity of the measure is
immense.</div><a name="1001204000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other issue is that of proportionality. I am pleased that my hon.
Friend has been able to tease out of the Minister that the schedule is
not to do with hard defences or just with watercourses, banks and those
types of structures, but that it is also to do with environmental
features such as woodland, moorland and various other quality
biospheres that could play a part in mitigating flood occurrences. We
are pleased that the Minister has accepted that.</div>
<a name="1001204000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key issue
is whether the schedule is proportionate. I think the Minister used the
term &#147;willy-nilly&#148;, so I would like to ask him whether
the schedule gives a designating authority the opportunity to designate
something willy-nilly without balancing the effect and the burdens on
individuals, companies and other bodies with the public good that it
might do. Looking at the schedule, it seems easy to designate. It is
more difficult to object to the designation, and it is virtually
impossible&#151;it is not impossible, but someone would have to go to
great legal lengths&#151;to ever have a designation lifted on a
particular
feature.</div><a name="1001204000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question we ask in the stand part debate is not whether it is a good
thing to be able to designate something&#151;it should be possible to
ensure that features are there to mitigate flood occurrences&#151;but
whether the measure is proportionate. That is the question the Minister
must
answer.</div><a name="1001204000451"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000775"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me go back to the previous points
raised by the hon. Member for Vale of York. We had a discussion some
time ago about things needing to be defined more closely and on the
comments that the EFRA Committee made regarding that. We took on board
EFRA&#146;s constructive suggestions, and the provision has moved on
from the draft on which the EFRA Committee commented, which is why the
guidance is in the schedule. The guidance shows that any structure or
feature that affects the flood or coastal risk that the designated
authority manages is included: walls, embankments, culverts, natural
features and so on, as has been
discussed.</div><a name="1001204000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady also mentioned the issue of uncertainty about what is a
feature. If there is uncertainty, that is simply because we have not
consulted on and issued the guidance yet. The type of features involved
will vary from area to area depending on the risk that each authority
manages, but it is important that the guidance gives some clarity on
that. In response to her query, the type of feature could vary from
area to area to suit the local
circumstances.</div>
<a name="1001204000453"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000776"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Does the Minister not accept that it would be
enormously helpful to the Committee and to those monitoring its work if
the guidance had been published and consulted on at this stage, so we
had greater clarification on those points? I hope he will go on to
explain why the provisions are part of a schedule, rather than part of
the main content of the Bill, and what the legal implications are of
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div><a name="1001204000454"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000777"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I was going to address that issue straight
away. Whenever I have been involved in a Bill, we have always
tried&#151;time and resources permitting&#151;to bring forward
guidance on matters. We have done the same with SUDS in this Bill. We
have done as much as we can within the time available. It would be
ideal if we had that guidance to look at now, but we cannot promise
anything. What I can promise is that when we bring it forward, it will
be properly open for consultation, including for input from the hon.
Lady, members of the Committee and others to ensure that it is right.
Putting such a matter in a schedule does not weaken the provision.
Schedules have equal status to clauses. It is purely a matter of the
arrangement of the Bill.</div>
<a name="1001204000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
rightly raises the issue of funding. The additional funding, on which
we had an earlier discussion, will be a new burden, so we will seek to
keep it under review as part of the debate that we had previously with
the Local Government Association and others to ensure that it is
properly represented throughout the local government settlement as part
of the revenue support
grant.</div><a name="1001204000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady also asked why local land charges were considered
appropriate. It is because they can be transferred when a property is
sold or bought. It is a much more efficient and less burdensome system
than redesignating every time there is a transfer of property just
because the owner changes. It also lets people know what is designated.
I would be able to find that out by searching the title of the
property.</div>
<a name="1001204000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
raised the issue&#151;I am worried about this one, it keeps coming
up&#151;of removing the Minister from various provisions. In this
case, she is talking about removing the Minister from appeals and
provisions. I promise that I am not trying to build some great tyranny
of Ministers and their powers, In practice, as we have made it clear
before, appeals would normally be heard by a court or tribunal, which
would ensure impartiality and independence. In some circumstances, it
may be appropriate that another body takes on the court tribunal role.
If the Minister is so moved, the provision will allow him to make the
designation to another authority. If we take the Minister out of the
equation, legislation would be needed to refer a case to an alternative
body, which is unlikely to be in the interests of the appellant or a
good use of parliamentary time. We had that debate earlier in the
Committee. It is not unreasonable for a Minister&#151;me or someone
else&#151;to have that ability, and there would be no conflict of
interest. As in the situations that we have previously identified, it
is most likely to be a delegation of that particular
function.</div><a name="1001204000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question of why the appeals provision is not in the Bill was also
raised. The Bill provides for the appeals mechanisms to be defined in
secondary legislation, because the arrangements for the appeals process
are essentially administrative and process-oriented. As such, they are
unlikely to be controversial. Regulations will also enable us to
reflect any change in circumstances in future should it become
necessary.</div><a name="1001204000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Vale of York also raised the issue of what would happen
if more than one authority designated a feature. It is relatively
likely that more than one authority would wish to designate the same
feature. Paragraph 4 prevents more than one authority designating the
same feature. Furthermore, to prevent any potential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>confusion, a designating authority&#151;again, it comes down to the
issue of working with each other&#151;must inform other authorities
with an interest, register a designation as a local land charge and
comply with the duty to co-operate under part 1 of the Bill. Therefore,
each authority will manage assets relevant to their own risk functions
as under paragraph 4(3). The Bill requires authorities to inform one
another of the exercise of their powers of designation. There is also a
wider duty to
co-operate.</div>
<a name="1001204000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Brecon and Radnorshire raised the overarching issue of
proportionality of the schedule. I welcome the way in which he
introduced his remarks because he recognised the necessity of having to
designate the features for flood purposes. He rightly said that the
powers need to be exercised in a reasonable way. We have the duties of
reasonableness, which I will not go over again. We have the appeals
process and the ability to make representations. We have the
compensation in the provision. It does not interfere with existing
use&#151;we also had that debate. It is relatively easy to get
consent to alterations; we do not want to stymie that. To clarify the
point made by the hon. Lady about appeals, in practice that will be to
an independent body.</div>
<a name="1001204000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn to
the other points raised by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire,
particularly with regard to parallel powers for authorities creating
something of a mishmash, a free-for-all. We do not believe that will be
the case. There is a clear duty to co-operate, which we debated under
part 1. That should help avoid disagreements between operating
authorities in designated features.</div>
<a name="1001204000462"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000778"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I do not dispute that all the designating
authorities set out in the Bill would have an interest in the process,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000779"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. To clarify, there is a lead local
authority. So it is the duty of that lead local authority to keep a
register of assets in its area and the record-keeping of other
authorities. There is also the duty to co-operate; one authority in one
area exercises its function but also has the duty to keep the other
authorities informed. In practice, this will work very well.</div>

Irranca-Davies:</b> The amendments would ensure that the
Environment Agency has clear oversight of all flood and coastal erosion
risk management works that relate to the sea. Part of our effort is to
clarify the roles and responsibility.</div>
<a name="1001204000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
has the effect of requiring IDBs, district councils, and lead local
flood authorities where there is no district council, to obtain the
consent of the EA in order to carry out flood risk management works
that relate to flood risk from the sea. That is done through the
introduction of condition 4; as a result, consent will be required only
in relation to major works. Those are: new works; improvements or
alteration to works; maintaining or restoring natural processes;
managing water levels, and demolition of works. Day-to-day works such
as maintenance, operation of equipment, monitoring, and investigating
and surveying a location do not require consent. That ensures that the
condition is not unduly burdensome. This is consistent with and
complements the EA&#146;s role under the Coast Protection Act 1949 as
amended by schedule 2(5) to the Bill, which gives the EA powers to
approve coast protection works.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000785"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> In terms of coastal erosion and risk management
from the sea, will the measure cover coast protection in wider forms
than those the Minister stated? It would be helpful if he expanded on
amendment 67: how will condition 4 on page 40 go further than what is
in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000786"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am happy to respond to that. The Bill
seeks to give clear responsibility for managing different sources of
flood risk to particular bodies. The EA is to have overall
responsibility for sea flooding and the amendment has been moved to
ensure that that happens. To avoid unnecessary administrative costs,
not all works will be subject to this requirement; as I have said, only
the more significant works will be. The amendment does not remove the
power of IDBs or district councils&#151;or unitary authorities, where
there is no district council&#151;to do works that manage flooding
from the sea. It does require such bodies to have consent to undertake
certain works in future, as I have already explained. That is to make
sure that the EA can have oversight of the totality of sea flooding
works and ensure that they are joined up. In terms of coastal erosion
risk management and whether this is a wider form of coastal protection:
yes, it is, and it does expand it in that
way.</div><a name="1001204000477"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000792"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I would just like to make a brief comment if I
may. The explanatory notes refer in particular to section 23 of the
Land Drainage Act 1991 as it currently stands. The Government&#146;s
proposed amendment therefore requires any new culvert to have consent.
In my capacity as vice-president of the Association of Drainage
Authorities, I beg the Minister to reconsider the provision. The
Government have expressed it as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>proposed new subsection (1B) of section 23 of the Land Drainage Act
1991. It should either be removed, or a de minimis scale of works
should be set. The Bill
states:</div><a name="1001204000536"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
internal drainage board or lead local flood authority must consult the
Environment Agency before carrying out
work&#148;</div><a name="1001204000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">under
the relevant
subsection</div><a name="1001204000537"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
the board or authority is &#145;the drainage board concerned&#146;
for the purposes of this
section.&#148;</div><a name="1001204000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Government&#146;s view, the measure would extend to internal
drainage boards and lead local flood authorities the requirement to
consult and, therefore, effectively seek consent from the EA. That
relates, in particular, to wherever they wish to erect a dam, mill,
weir or other construction that is likely to affect the flow of water
in a watercourse or otherwise alter any such construction, erect a
culvert in the ordinary watercourse or alter a culvert in a manner that
is likely to affect the flow of an ordinary watercourse. That provision
will apply to internal drainage boards working on ordinary watercourses
within their internal drainage districts where they already have a
general supervisory role, as defined under section 1(2A) of the Land
Drainage
Act.</div><a name="1001204000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government accept that the intention might be to avoid an internal
drainage board&#146;s effectively consenting to conduct works that
may be appropriate on larger-scale works such as the construction of
pumping stations. Will the Minister see fit to set a minimum scale of
works below which that requirement will not apply so as to remove any
considerable administrative burden for both the internal drainage
boards and the Environment Agency on minor works, such as access
culverts?</div><a name="1001204000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are all aware of the importance of keeping culverts dredged and
properly maintained. I applaud the work of the IDBs in that regard. If
the Minister can remove the reference to minor works and make sure that
the provision covers major works, that will be tremendously helpful in
applying the
Bill.</div><a name="1001204000496"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001204000793"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I see where the hon. Lady is heading. It
might be helpful if I just give some clarity. Any culverts or suchlike
considered to have an impact on flood risk management would, indeed, be
included. We would expect the Environment Agency to put in place simple
procedures for
that.</div><a name="1001204000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for local authorities and consultation with the Environment Agency, we
know that local authorities have a particularly wide range of interests
way beyond what we are discussing now, including education, transport,
social services and the whole gamut of commercial development. We are
trying to ensure that flood risk management is given due accord when
decisions driven by other interests are considered, to reduce the
chance of a conflict of interest. There could be issues around, say,
culverting watercourses when playing fields are sold on for
development. The Environment Agency would be consulted and, as an
independent authority, express a view as to whether the principle and
detail of a proposal was suitable bearing in mind local and national
flood risk strategies and
guidance.</div><a name="1001204000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
such matters might be considered as impeding local authorities in some
ways, at present the local authority has to apply to the EA for consent
for the works, so the change will be a reduction in regulation. It will
also reflect planning law and practice when the EA is consulted on
proposals for works that affect watercourses and might indeed object to
proposals on flood risk grounds.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div><a name="1001204000499"></a><div class="hs_Para">To clarify
matters further, in terms of minor works to which the hon. Lady
referred, and de minimis levels of consultation, I repeat that we would
expect the Environment Agency to apply the procedure sensibly and
proportionately. It is not easy to make a distinction between major and
minor in practice when talking about flood risk management. On setting
a minimum scale in consultation, the Environment Agency could consider
doing that and setting it out in guidance on the basis of a programme
of works&#151;for example, covering a year&#146;s activity. That
might be one way to look at it.</div>
<a name="1001204000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I have

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000082"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> These are, in our view, extremely important
clarifying amendments. We wish to make it clear that any surface water
drain or sewer drains into a SUDS system rather than the public
sewerage system. It is important that we understand and are clear about
the definitions at the outset. My understanding is that a lateral drain
or sewer connects the main border of a property with the main sewer.
Can the Minister clarify that my understanding is correct? I have
explained it briefly, but the Minister may want to explain further. As
we said previously, we are concerned that we do not know for sure what
these SUDS are, where they are, who owns them, who gave approval to the
SUDS, who is currently responsible for them and who is maintaining
them. We will go on to discuss what the potential is for various
parties if a SUDS floods, but in this instance we believe it is
important to say specifically that such a structure
is</div><a name="1001206000068"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;designed
to receive rainwater except...a public sewer, or...a natural
watercourse.&#148;</div><a name="1001206000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would go further in explaining amendment 149. In my view, there are two
primary drainage systems. It would be helpful if the Minister could
confirm whether my understanding is correct. The one common SUDS
relates to a highway and takes excess water off a road, so it could be
a ditch or a culvert, but it is probably connected not too far from a
road. Those are probably easier to
identify.</div><a name="1001206000077"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30
pm</div><a name="1001206000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is considerably less clarity about drainage systems relating to housing
developments. For the sake of clarity, I asked the Environment Agency
locally&#151;its headquarters is in the Vale of York&#151;to single
out and identify some of those SUDS, which could be ponds or drains,
and do not normally connect to a public sewer. The definition has
implications for later amendments. The agency helpfully set out a
number of SUDS in my own area. One is Rawcliffe ponds, which I imagine
was dealt with during the construction of a major housing development
in the York area of the Vale of York. The local environment agency
described SUDS, and
stated:</div><a name="1001206000069"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Traditional
drainage is designed to move rainwater as rapidly as possible from the
point at which it has fallen to a discharge point, either to a
watercourse or
soakaway.&#148;.</div><a name="1001206000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
went on to state
that</div><a name="1001206000070"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;run-off
from hard paving and roofing can increase the risk of flooding
downstream, as well as causing sudden rises in water levels and flow
rates&#148;.</div>
<a name="1001206000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be helpful to
understand where the surface water drains off, and whether the Minister
would accept that it falls within the context of the
definition.</div>
<a name="1001206000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 150
would mean that &#147;lateral drain&#148;, &#147;sewer&#148;
and &#147;public sewer&#148; have the meanings that are set out in
the relevant section of the Water Industry Act 1991. For the
sake of clarity, I hope that the Minister will confirm that is
acceptable. Amendment 18 defines a &#147;Sustainable Urban Drainage
System&#148; as a drainage system as currently recognised in Scots
law. I would ask the Minister to give a good reason if he believes that
it would not be appropriate to accept a definition that already exists
in one part of the United Kingdom. I hope he will find that definition
even more encompassing than the one set out in amendment 149.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000083"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I echo the hon. Lady&#146;s last
comment&#151;a desire for clarity in this section is extremely
important. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s remarks,
but amendments 149 and 150 seem to add clarity and definition to some
of the provisions in the Bill, and therefore I suspect that they are
welcome. However, we seem to be running into a little difficulty. As
far as I understand, what are commonly known as SUDS&#151;sustainable
urban drainage systems&#151;are a specific category of site-specific
drainage constructions designed to ameliorate urban flooding and
capture water in a localised area. We seem to be drifting into slight
confusion between that and sustainable drainage in general, which is
what the clause seems to address.</div>
<a name="1001206000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
particular concerns about amendment 18, as it seems to add a very
specific but actually quite inclusive definition of sustainable urban
drainage systems, that in its deletion element would remove any broader
definition of sustainable drainage. In semantic terms, I am not sure
what that means for sustainable drainage that is not urban. In one
sense it seems to be excluded, but the list includes things that might
not be urban, such as constructed wetlands, which we have in an urban
area in Cheltenham as part of a flood relief system at Cox&#146;s
meadow, which used to be a meadow and is now a more spectacular feature
since the Environment Agency got to work on
it.</div><a name="1001206000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
echo the closing words of the hon. Member for Vale of York: we need
some clarity. Are we talking about broader definitions of sustainable
drainage or the specific mechanisms and constructions that are more
commonly known as
SUDS?</div><a name="1001206000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
163 would simply insert the word &#147;natural&#148; into the
phrase</div><a name="1001206000073"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;protecting
and improving the
environment&#148;</div><a name="1001206000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
the definition of sustainable drainage. Of course, that would be
removed if amendment 18 were accepted. This point harks back to our
discussion on the meaning of sustainability. When I read the schedule,
I detected a possible loophole because it could allow the management of
rainwater in a way that a developer argues improves the environment,
meaning the built environment. That means that whatever the developer
proposed could be sustainable drainage under the terms of the
Bill.</div><a name="1001206000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am keen to reinforce the Bill&#146;s environmental credentials by
ensuring that a developer&#146;s plan that would damage biodiversity,
or compromise flood or water management on a more natural and
environmentally friendly basis would not be allowed under the
definition of sustainable drainage. At the moment, we have the slightly
loose terminology
of</div><a name="1001206000074"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;protecting
and improving the
environment&#148;,</div><a name="1001206000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">without
any specific reference to the natural environment. I tabled the
amendment because it is important to recognise the natural
environment.</div>

Irranca-Davies:</b> I shall begin by dealing with the
trickiest question, which is what a lateral drain is. I will do my
best. My understanding is that a sewer serves more than one property, a
drain serves one property and a lateral is the part of a drain that
extends beyond or outside the boundary of a property&#151;I wish I
had a flip chart. When there is a house and a boundary fence, the drain
that goes beyond the boundary fence is the lateral that feeds into the
sewer. Does that
help?</div><a name="1001206000025"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000086"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am not sure we can use visual aids in a Public
Bill Committee. The hon. Lady will have to explain
it.</div><a name="1001206000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000087"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> My understanding is that there is a building or
property and that there is a sewer that connects the sewage and waste
water from that building to the main sewer. My understanding is that
the lateral drain runs from the boundary of the property to the sewer.
It is quite important that we get that on the record so it is clear
that we know what we are talking about for these
provisions.</div><a name="1001206000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000088"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed. I confirm that the hon.
Lady&#146;s description was very good. Even without the diagram, it
worked very
effectively.</div><a name="1001206000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us move on to the trickier question of what count as SUDS under our
definition in the Bill, as opposed to the Scottish interpretation,
which I will come to in a moment. The EA&#146;s description is not a
bad one. In its view, SUDS are what slow down the flow and reduce the
volume of flow to sewers, and they improve water quality and amenity.
SUDS, of course, protect and improve the natural environment, but they
can also improve the developed one. There are a variety of SUDS. They
are not limited simply to hard engineering. The Scottish example and
highly urbanised examples include highly engineered solutions, as well
as more naturally landscaped
solutions.</div><a name="1001206000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000089"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="1001206000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000090"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will just expand on this a
little.</div><a name="1001206000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">SUDS
could be quite attractive features that enhance the built environment
through public amenity. They can provide functional spaces such as
roads, car parks and parks that add to the drainage
system.</div><a name="1001206000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill provides for regulations to define SUDS further and that is the
important point. There is a myriad of designs for sustainable drainage
systems&#151;I have seen many of them&#151;for all sorts of
geographical and topographical areas. These designs are constantly
evolving in real time with the advancement of technology and with
experience. This week, I wrote to Committee members with additional
information on SUDS; I do not know whether they have received that.
Regulations, accompanied by national standards for SUDS, will enable us
to retain flexibility in defining what a SUDS is. That will ensure that
we have drainage systems designed to help reduce localised flash floods
flooding downstream and to slow down the rate at which areas begin to
flood, as well as improving water quality and potentially enhancing the
environment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000091"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I would like to challenge the Minister on one
point. He talked about SUDS being applicable to a variety of
environments, and yet the &#147;U&#148; stands for
&#147;urban.&#148;</div>
<a name="1001206000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000092"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> No.</div>
<a name="1001206000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000093"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Well, okay. Does the &#147;U&#148; stand for
urban?</div>
<a name="1001206000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000094"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Minister, can you put that on the
record?</div><a name="1001206000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000095"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes, indeed. It is good to get clarity on
this. Our interpretation is that these are not sustainable
&#147;urban&#148; drainage systems. They are sustainable drainage
systems and will have applications in urban areas, rural areas and
everything in between. We are not going down the road of saying that
this is either a hard technological solution or only to be used in
inner cities; it has a much wider application. That is why it is
difficult to find one definition that says, &#147;This is what
it is.&#148;</div>
<a name="1001206000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">A SUDS system
is not exactly a sustainable &#147;urban&#148; drainage
system&#151;I am sorry, maybe our terminology is confusing. Our SUDS
is the &#147;SU&#148; from &#147;sustainable&#148; with
&#147;DS.&#148; It is a sustainable drainage
system.</div>
<a name="1001206000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000096"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> This reverts to what the hon. Gentleman said
earlier; I wanted him to complete his sentence. If I can be clear in my
own mind, I think there are two different sets of systems and two sets
of consequences that flow from them. The importance of understanding
this correctly relates to ending automatic connection, which we come on
to consider later.</div>
<a name="1001206000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all
right, but we are all wrong to a certain extent. There are sustainable
urban drainage systems that have a particular function in connection to
taking water in urban areas where there are major housing developments.
Earlier, the Minister said very specifically that he only wants to stop
the automatic right to connect from these to the waste water
infrastructure of the water companies. I am clear in my own
mind&#151;and I hope I can carry the Committee with me&#151;that
SUDS maintains a very specific legal meaning within the context of the
Bill. There are other drainage
systems&#151;</div><a name="1001206000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000097"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Martlew, I
think it might be extremely helpful if we stopped talking about
&#147;suds&#148; and started talking about either SDSs, or
SUDSs.</div>
<a name="1001206000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000098"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is a point of clarification, not a point of
order.</div>
<a name="1001206000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000099"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I think a SUD has a &#147;u&#148; in it and
an SDS does not have the &#147;u.&#148; I do not know how clear I
can make it. The point is that in rural areas, there are&#151;and the
hon. Member for Cheltenham referred to it
himself&#151;</div><a name="1001206000045"></a>

amendment.</div>
<a name="1001206000078"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
pm</div><a name="1001206000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001206000103"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> SUDS or sustainable urban drainage systems
are by their definition&#151;and within the Scottish Bill&#151;more
restricted in what they apply to. We do not want that restriction. I
will come to the Scottish issue in a moment. For clarity, when I refer
to SUDS I shall do as we have always done in respect of the Bill.
Perhaps we should have called them SDSs, or come up with another name.
When I refer to SUDS I mean our sustainable drainage systems. If I
refer to the Scottish model, I will clarify matters by saying that I am
referring to the sustainable urban drainage system.</div>
<a name="1001206000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 149
would extend the meaning of the term &#147;drainage system&#148; as
outlined in paragraph (1)(a) to the schedule to include</div>
<a name="1001206000075"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any lateral
drain or sewer communicating with a drainage
system.&#148;</div><a name="1001206000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand where the hon. Member for Vale of York is coming from, but
amendments 149 and 150 are not necessary. Among other things, paragraph
16(5) to schedule 3 already provides for the Minister to
determine what the SUDs approving body should approve and adopt, by
defining in regulations the term &#147;sustainable drainage
system&#148;. The regulations will therefore define whether and when
it is appropriate for a lateral drain or a sewer to be adopted by the
SUDS approving body. A change to primary legislation is therefore not
required.</div>
<a name="1001206000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, the
development of the regulations will include public consultation. I know
that I am being criticised for my love of consultation, but there is
not as much as it sounds because some consultations are tied together.
The consultation will ensure that the regulations are well considered
and appropriate. If we accepted amendment 149, the opportunity for
consultation would be missed.</div>
<a name="1001206000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the question of whether lateral drains and sewers should be included in
the definition of sustainable drainage systems. Paragraph 16(5) to
schedule 3 gives the Minister the power to define them by regulation,
and they will be considered if and when a lateral drain or sewer is
subject to approval by the SUDS approving body.</div>
<a name="1001206000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
paragraph 7(4) of schedule 3, which relates to the amendments. It
provides for the Minister to set out by order what requires approval,
and for exemptions to the need for approval when appropriate. The
question of whether water courses or engineered channels require
approval will therefore be considered under those regulations. It is
unlikely that they would, but we would expect IDBs to work with the
lead local authorities and the SAB, or the SUDS approving body.
Furthermore, approval is required for a SUDS&#151;I refer to our
SUDS; otherwise I shall refer to the sustainable urban drainage
system&#151;built to take water from a new development or other
construction work.</div>
<a name="1001206000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
approval for the SUDS, developers cannot build a development, so IDBs
are not developers in that sense. They are not building drainage
systems in order to get consent for a specific development. Hence, it
will not be necessary for them to seek consent. As I said, the
regulations will be subject to a full consultation.</div>
<a name="1001206000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 18
and new clause 12 both seek to insert additional definitions of
sustainable urban drainage systems. Amendment 18 aims to replicate the
definitions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>in the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003. Many
good things come out of Scotland&#151;not least whisky, which is
almost as good as the Penderyn whisky from my part of the
world.</div>
<a name="1001206000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Arrangements
in Scotland are different, not least because Scottish Water is publicly
owned, unlike in England, where the companies are privately owned and
therefore have a commercial interest. In Scotland, a sustainable urban
drainage system must meet build standards similar to what we propose in
our national standards, before it is adopted by Scottish Water.
Interestingly, however, that is by agreement. Approval of SUDS and the
adoption arrangements are often held up because the developer and
Scottish Water simply cannot agree.</div>
<a name="1001206000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any case,
Scottish Water is not responsible for adopting all SUDS. Those in roads
are adopted by local authorities. SUDS in trunk roads are adopted by
the Scottish Government. We believe that it is important, and in line
with Pitt, to have clear and consistent arrangements. We developed our
SUDS policies after two public consultations, as well as learning from
experience in Scotland and looking at the wide impact of the 2007
floods in rural and urban areas. The Scottish Act also deals with the
sewerage system as a whole. It deals with SUDS as well public sewers
and public sewage treatment works, so there are some
differences.</div>
<a name="1001206000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
amendments are not necessary, as the term &#147;sustainable
drainage&#148; is already defined in the Bill under schedule 3
paragraph 2. It does not include the term &#147;urban&#148;
because, as we saw in the 2007 floods, surface water flooding is both
an urban and a rural issue,<i class="I"> </i>and SUDS can be used in both rural
and urban settings.</div>
<a name="1001206000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Scottish
Act was passed in 2003. Since then, we have had the benefit of
experience in understanding the complexities of surface water
management and the downstream impacts of building developments in both
rural and urban areas. Scotland has seen SUDS used in both
rural and urban developments and so it feels right that our new
definition&#151;now widely used by practitioners&#151;reflects what
actually happens on the ground and will be delivered going
forward.</div><a name="1001206000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
paragraph 17 also defines single property SUDS as those that provide
drainage only for a single property, giving a wider definition of SUDS
than what is proposed in amendment 18&#151;the Scottish definition.
The amendments are therefore more limiting than what is already
contained in the Bill. I commend the intention, but it is not necessary
to make the change to the definition in this case.</div>
<a name="1001206000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also
makes provision for SUDS&#151;our SUDS&#151;to be defined further
in regulations in schedule 3, paragraph 16(5). I wrote to
members of the Committee this week and I hope that they have seen the
letter; if not, it will be in the mailbox. I have a copy here if
anybody wants to see it later on. SUDS national standards, referred to
in schedule 3, paragraph 5, which will be published after
consultation&#151;although we have some thoughts on it
already&#151;will also set out different types of SUDS techniques and
their use. Defining sustainable drainage systems in regulations and
then setting out the specific detail of different types of SUDS
features in the national standards, rather than on primary legislation,
also allows for flexibility to add new SUDS designs&#151;and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>they are constantly coming forward&#151;and new SUDS approaches as
they are
developed.</div><a name="1001206000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and Radnorshire tabled
amendment 163,<b class="B"> </b>inserting the word &#147;natural&#148; to
paragraph 2(c) of schedule 3. As a result, the paragraph would state
that one of the intentions of managing rainwater through sustainable
drainage was</div>
<a name="1001206000076"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;protecting and
improving the natural
environment.&#148;</div><a name="1001206000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the spirit in which that is put, but curiously the amendment
could actually prove extremely limiting. In fact, it does not reflect
the wider environmental benefits delivered by SUDS in both the natural
and the developed environment. By inserting reference to the
&#147;natural&#148; environment, the amendment suggests that SUDS
would offer protection only<i class="I"> </i>to natural environments that have
not been interfered with through development. We do not want that to
happen.</div>
<a name="1001206000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, SUDS
are extremely effective, as we have seen from examples that are already
there, in protecting and improving the man-made environment. That is
particularly true in urban areas, where the clever use of SUDS delivers
drainage systems more attractive and effective than conventional
drainage, as well as the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div>additional benefits of improving water quality and reducing flooding
risk. They can include natural SUDS solutions, such as ponds or reed
beds, as well as hard landscaping such as artificial channels, which
all improve the visual and physical<i class="I"> </i>quality of the urban
environment. I was looking at some amazing pictures today of SUDS
development techniques. They are multifaceted, varied and many of them
are very attractive. They can be dual-functional as well. SUDS can be
in roads, car parks and playing fields that add value to the urban
environment and benefit the
communities.</div><a name="1001206000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of the amendment may have been to emphasise the considerable
benefits of using SUDS techniques that mimic natural features. However,
given the ability of SUDS to protect and improve the man-made
environment, as well as the natural environment, an amendment that
suggested that SUDS should only protect and improve the natural
environment may be limiting. I therefore ask the hon. Members to
withdraw their
amendments.</div><a name="1001206000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered</i>,
