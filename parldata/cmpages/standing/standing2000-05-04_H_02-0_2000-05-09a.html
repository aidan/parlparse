</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is my fervent hope that we do not become too heated this morning, so I have no hesitation in allowing those members of the Committee who wish to do so to divest themselves of their outer upper garment.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of duty on cider</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Thank you, and good morning, Mr. Cook.
<P>
Clause 2 deals with the rates of duty on cider. We debated beer duty on the Floor of the House and drew attention to the severe problem of smuggling. We also alluded to the strange fact that the indexation rate used by the Government for all such duties was more than 3.4 per cent. We want to concentrate on that figure this morning and find out the purpose behind it. The Chancellor said in his Budget speech that all such duties—not only cider duty but hydrocarbon duty—would increase by the rate of inflation. However, the Government have not claimed that inflation is generally running at a rate of 3.41 per cent., the percentage used to uprate the duties. A stealth tax is in operation, which caused The Daily Telegraph to run the headline ``Brown's `big fiddle' costs £750 million.''
<P>
It had calculated immediately after the Budget that the difference between the assumed inflation rate and that used by the Chancellor would net the Treasury an extra £750 million in the coming year. Large sums of money are involved and the matter certainly needs explaining.
<P>
I shall explain some of the history of excise duty on alcohol. The previous Government faced the problem of the smuggling of alcoholic products and, although we were running a budget deficit at the time and were short of money, we responded to that problem by freezing the duty on alcohol products in our last two Budgets and cutting it on spirits. When the Labour Government came to power, they ignored the warning signs. Although they talked a lot about harmonisation of taxes in the European Union and although they indisputably have discretion over excise duties, they increased the alcohol duties and had an extra Budget. The Conservative Government had autumn Budgets, but this Government slipped in an extra one, as a result of which alcohol duties have been increased again. The duty differential has continued to increase, which has made the smuggling situation worse. We shall be debating that problem in future sittings, but I shall concentrate now on how the Government have calculated the uprating figure.
<P>
The conventional inflation rate is not 3.4 per cent. Page 138 of the Red Book shows that personal allowances have been uprated not by the expected figure of 3.4 per cent., but by only 1.1 per cent. The Treasury uses a much lower actual inflation rate when that suits it. The working families tax credit has gone up by only 1.6 per cent.; I am not clear why it has gone up by slightly more than the personal allowance. Increases of 1.6 per cent. for that credit, the basic credit, the single persons credit and the lone parents credit look meagre aside the much bigger figure that the Treasury chooses when it suits it for uprating its own taxes. The treatment is clearly different, in accordance with the evolving formula whereby the Government pick an inflation rate simply to suit their revenue requirements.
<P>
The mystery deepens when we consider that inflation and its calculation are extensively dealt with in the Red Book. There are two pages of detail and forecast on the inflation rate, and three pages starting with page 173 are about performance inflation, its prospects and the link between inflation and the economic cycle. That section includes some independent forecasts as well. There is further information about inflation on page 186. Page 195 shows that the National Audit Office has audited many of the assumptions in the Budget, but the page does not include inflation. It is odd that the Government discuss inflation in great detail, but draw back from including it as an independently audited figure. Our suspicions are well and truly aroused.
<P>
It is odder still that the figure of 3.4 per cent does not appear once, despite the pages of analysis. Given the importance of the uprating figure, which includes hydrocarbons, alcohol duties and tobacoo—tobacco has gone up by more than inflation, but the Government have used the figure of 3.4 per cent. as their base indexation again— and given the significant revenue netted as a result, one might expect the figure of 3.4 per cent to appear in the inflation discussion.
<P>
There is clearly something to hide, and the Government now have the opportunity to explain fully how they reached that figure and why they changed their method of calculation. The previous Government used the actual inflation figure—a historic, precise figure. When the Labour Government came to power, not only did they have the extra Budget that I mentioned, which netted them extra revenue, but they changed the basis of calculation to a projected figure. That is why they expect a substantially higher inflation figure for the year ahead. An explanation is needed for that, given that the Government have put so much emphasis on achieving and sustaining low inflation.
<P>
In this important stand part debate, we want a full and open explanation of why the Government changed the basis of calculation, why they are so secretive about the figure used, and how it is constituted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Like the right hon. Gentleman, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook. I support the thrust of his questions to the Financial Secretary. In previous debates on Finance Bills, Opposition Members have spent some time discussing the issue of cider, and in particular the duties relating to low-strength sparkling cider. We thought that it would be annoying for those who served on the Committee in the past two years to go through that debate again. Therefore, Mr. Cook, you and the Committee are to be spared that process, although we remain concerned about the issue.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) is right to mention the index by which duties on different types of cider and other excise duties are uprated. That is the key political issue in relation to the taxes that we are discussing. The Government have a duty to Parliament and to the country to be transparent in the way in which they change taxes and spend money. Transparency is one of the core principles in the code for fiscal stability. However, as the right hon. Gentleman said, they are uprating various duties this year in a most untransparent manner.
<P>
There are many ways to measure inflation. There are the different measures of the retail prices index, the standard RPI and the underlying RPI, which is often referred to, when the inflation figures are released, as RPIX. There is the GDP deflator. There are many other measures of price changes because there are many prices in which to measure trends. The Government receive a lot of advice from various groups on which index they should use as a measure but for annual changes such as these, they should have a convention that they stick to. They should not chop and change, because that makes it difficult to understand what is happening.
<P>
My understanding is that the Government have changed the convention. Which index has been used in every previous year over the past 20 years? By which index were excise duties uprated in 1978–79, the previous Labour Government's last year of office? Was it the RPI, a GDP deflator, or some other kind of index? To be able to say that there has been a straight indexation of the duties, and not an over- or under-indexation, there must be some consistency in the measures used. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman—as I agree with most of his arguments on the clause—that Ministers have not been clear with the Committee on that subject.
<P>
In other areas, such as international treaties and in legislation passed by this Parliament, the Government have been clear about which index of inflation they wish to use. In the Bank of England Act 1998, they set out the measure for the Bank in precise terms. In the Maastricht treaty, which the right hon. Gentleman did not mention, the inflation index is specified clearly. There ought to be—probably in legislation—a main index that we all agree to use. The various indices will diverge at particular points, so there should be an appropriate index to which we can refer each year for each uprating.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Wells said, one set of taxes is uprated and indexed by one measure of inflation and another is uprated by an entirely different index. That cannot be right. It has made me think about the way in which the Government deal with inflation and control the measures of inflation. We have debated elsewhere the changes that the Government are making to the collation and publication of statistics. They are setting up the statistics commission, but one major statistic that Ministers will not give up and which will remain in the Chancellor's control is the measure of inflation.
<P>
When the Government appear to be acting like control freaks, our suspicions are aroused and our suspicions were rightly aroused about this clause. The Government are trying to keep hold of this measure because they want to play with it for their own purposes. That cannot be right. It is certainly not transparent and I hope that the Minister can answer our questions. We will no doubt be supporting the Conservatives against the clause.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I want to be helpful to the Financial Secretary, as he so often is to the Opposition. It may also be helpful to the Committee—I promise not to spend 45 minutes on the subject—if I rather painfully go through what we take to be the explanation and implication of the 3.4 per cent. rate. May I correct an inadvertent error made by the hon. Gentleman in responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) in the Committee of the whole House? There is a history to the index and to its use. In the November 1996 Budget, the previous Government used the actual inflation rate measured on the RPI all-„prices index to September 1996 as the basis for operating these and similar duties—looking backwards. That happened to be 2.1 per cent. The new Government came to office and, in the July 1997 Budget, switched from a backward-looking measure of the RPI all-prices index to a forward-looking forecast. That has created an oddity, which is that, unlike under the Rooker-Wise amendments, under which forecasts needed to be corrected, there is no statutory obligation on the Government to correct, ex post, the effects of an uprating based on the forecast in relation to excise duties on cider. A systemic bias one way or the other could be introduced by switching from a backward-looking use of the index to a forward-looking use. It is not for me to suggest that any Government would engage in such an activity, but the Chancellor could systematically year after year consciously overestimate inflation for the year ahead, as measured by the RPI all-prices index, and never catch up with himself and so introduce a hidden form of taxation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> As the hon. Gentleman was talking about inflation forecasting, does he think that it would be a good idea if the Chancellor were to refer to the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee for his forecast of inflation and take the central assumption? Will he tell the Committee what effect that might have?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman's question is apposite, but the answer is much more devastating than he imagines. If he will forgive me, we will come to that later in the discovery process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): My hon. Friend refers to the possibility of an in-built systemic bias in favour of overestimating inflation and therefore raising the tax burden. Would it not be in the hands of Ministers to remove that systemic bias simply by giving the undertaking that the previous Government gave that, if the forward-looking adjustment turned out to be over-generous in the Government's interests, they would retrospectively correct the situation? My hon. Friend's danger of a systemic bias would be removed by the words of Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is right to remind me that we used a measure—a rule—that removed systemic bias and, indeed, was asymmetrically against the interests of the Exchequer. In the uprating of pensions and other benefits, we always gave the benefit of a mismatch while using forward-looking indicators to pensioners, but never deprived them of the disbenefit of the mismatch if it turned out ex post that we had under-inflated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> While the hon. Gentleman is on pensions, will he accept that many pensioners would have liked their pensions to be increased by 3.4 per cent. rather than the 1.1 per cent.—which constituted a miserly 75p a week—given by the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right, but he tempts me on to terrain that I am sure you would not wish me to enter, Mr. Cook, while we are debating the duty on cider.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify a point made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood? I agree with the hon. Gentleman's argument that the previous Government used backward-looking figures for RPI; his right hon. Friend said that there were instances of forward-looking figures being used. Could the hon. Gentleman remind us of those instances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Forward-looking figures were used for a period and then there was a switch to backward-looking figures. When the forward-looking figure was used, for example for pensions uprating, a correction was built in ex post—but asymmetrically, so that recipients benefited only when there had been an insufficient uprating.
<P>
In the July 1997 Budget, the Government uprated cider tariffs by 3 per cent., which was then the forecast RPI all-prices index for September 1997. Then came the March 1998 budget—which is where I need to correct what I think was an inadvertent error by the Financial Secretary in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs on the floor of the House, because that Budget gave a further increase, which was also a forecast inflation rate to September 1998 based on the RPI all-prices index, of 3.25 per cent. The effect of the November 1996 Budget, the July 1997 Budget and the March 1998 Budget taken together was that over a 15-month period there was roughly a 8.35 per cent. increase—the Financial Secretary, as a mathematician, will allow me to add percentages of small numbers, rather than multiplying—whereas the RPI all-prices index forecast over the same period was only 5.7 per cent. I am talking not about the difference between forward-looking and backward-looking figures but simply about the forecast.
<P>
By having two Budgets in a compressed period, the Government managed to introduce a very intricate form of stealth taxation, whereby they raised not only the rate but the base by more than the cumulative inflation rate over the relevant period, which affects all subsequent years. The fiscal effect of the measures was therefore significant. That may have been entirely happenstance, or someone very clever in the Treasury may have worked out that that was a jolly good way of increasing revenues at a time, unlike the present, when the Chancellor needed cash. Be that as it may, we now face the position that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells described. We are being asked to approve a rate of increase in the Bill that is based on the Government's present forecast—this is the first part of the answer to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton—of the RPI all-prices index of September 2000, which is 3.4 per cent. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, that is odd because the figure does not appear anywhere else—I think that we have combed every relevant phrase of the ``Budget 2000'' Red Book.
<P>
The comparable figure did appear, interestingly, in the 1999 Red Book on page 150. It did not get star billing, but table B4 on that page gave a September 2000 forecast for the RPI all-prices index of 3 per cent; I shall return in a moment to the question of the gap between 3 and 3.4 per cent., which is highly material. That forecast of 3 per cent. proves that the Treasury at that time was transparent at least to the extent of telling the public its forecast of the index used to uprate, among other things, cider duties. The disappearance of that figure from the analogous table in the current Red Book, table B2 on page 176, is therefore notable. There must have been a reason why a forecast that was given in the previous Red Book, and indeed a string of Red Books before it—RPI all-prices indices were the standard form of index before RPIX was used, and persisted through the journey of tax and prices indices and many other measures that my right hon. Friends the Members for Charnwood and for Fylde (Mr. Jack) will remember having introduced and discussed—this year, for the first time, disappears.
<P>
Why does the Treasury not want to discuss the forecast of 3.4 per cent. for the RPI all-prices index for the year to September? The answer is slightly more devastating than the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton realises. To understand the answer, we need to ask how, from an RPIX central forecast that to, within a smidgen, tallies with the Monetary Policy Committee's forecast of 2.25 per cent. for the same period, it is possible to arrive at an RPI all-prices index forecast of 3.4 per cent.
<P>
Having investigated the matter, I am surprised that we did not do so earlier and that commentators have not done so in more detail. It reflects what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said—when the Red Book reaches a certain level of opacity, the experts give up looking for measures that will affect people by only about £1 billion a year. They look for hundreds of billions, and perhaps even tens of billions, but the odd billion disappears from view. That seems to have happened in this case. However, there is an explanation. That is the good news. The bad news is what that explanation is.
<P>
The first part of the explanation is that the RPI all-prices index, unlike RPIX, measures the net effect of interest costs, principally for homeowners, or people with mortgages. I use the term ``net effect'' because it registers, for reasons that are obscure to me, the post-tax effect. It is a unique example of a direct tax being taken into account by an index other than the TPI.
<P>
As many millions of homeowners are aware, the Government have abolished mortgage interest relief at source. In doing so, they have increased their own estimate of the RPI all-prices index, because MIRAS provided a shield for homeowners against the effects of interest rate rises. People experience the disappearance of MIRAS as an increase in their net interest payments to banks and building societies. In estimating the RPI all-prices index for the period to September, the Government have, rightly, allowed for the abolition of MIRAS. We may complain about the abolition of MIRAS, but we cannot complain about the principle that that should be included if that is how the RPI all-prices index is calculated, as it is.
<P>
The second development, although big news for many people, is no longer new news. In the past few months, a significant rise in mortgages has taken place compared with the relevant period in the previous year. That, too, is registered in the Government's estimate of the RPI all-prices index.
<P>
So far, so good. We have accounted for about 0.75 percentage points of the change from the 2.25 per cent. RPIX forecast to the roughly 3 per cent. RPI all-prices index forecast. However, the difference between 3 per cent.—the figure estimated, perhaps by chance, on page 150 of the 1999 Red Book, as the RPI all-prices index rise for the relevant period under discussion—and the 3.4 per cent. now being used is a mystery. However, the mystery dissolves in the face of an important fact that we hope to bring home to the public today and which it would be good if the Treasury would admit, because it must be understood.
<P>
The Chancellor has implicitly estimated that mortgage interest rates will increase sharply in the near future. To arrive at 3.4 per cent. from 3 per cent., he needs to have estimated that mortgage interest costs will rise by about 0.7 percentage points, and will need to do so pretty smartly. To be included in the index and have a sufficient effect by September, it must happen soon.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Chancellor may have made a mistake. He may not have done what I described, which would be a rational explanation of how he reached a figure of 3.4 per cent. He may have made an erroneous forecast, which is inconsistent with his RPIX forecast. If so, he may be trying to introduce a stealth tax. That relates to my earlier point that he does not have to correct the mistake later. However, I prefer to believe that the Chancellor's calculation of the forecast increase is completely straightforward, and that he has done what he would do rationally if he believed that mortgage interest costs were to rise by more than 0.5 per cent., which would have a much bigger effect on the British public than the direct effect of other indexations. If so, the Chancellor should say that he expects the MPC's actions to result shortly in a 0.7 per cent. rise in the cost of housing through mortgage interest rates. What will be the effect of that on sterling, and the relationship between sterling and the euro?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, at an early stage, focus his comments more directly on alcoholic liquor and duties thereon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Absolutely, Mr. Cook. Cider drinkers will face a 3.4 per cent. rise in duty because the Chancellor thinks that there will be a rise in mortgage interest rates. One might not think that sterling going up, the euro going down and interest rates rising has anything to do with cider—in fact, the Chancellor will raise the one because he thinks that the other will rise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a great deal of the figure of 3.4 per cent., and I am looking forward to responding. However, I should point out that the figure of 3.41 per cent. appears eight times on page 148 of the Red Book. The Government have been completely transparent in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary, but that is the list of changes in duty—we always knew that that figure was 3.41 per cent. However, it says nothing about which index it is, or why it has been calculated that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> May I then refer the hon. Gentleman to page 153, where the methodology is spelt out clearly. It is true that the figure of 3.4 per cent. does not appear on page 153, but that is because it appears eight times on page 148.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I bow to no one in my admiration of the Financial Secretary's ingenuity. Page 153, which is entitled—enticingly—``Explaining the costings'', provides no clarity for the ordinary reader, or even an expert in such matters, on the question of which index is used, how it has been compiled, and what assumptions lie behind it. If it benefits the Committee, I am happy to read out page 153 and give a small prize to anyone who can determine the one from the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman by referring him to page 153. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The indexed base has been calculated on the assumption that each year fuel, tobacco, and alcohol duties and allowances and thresholds, other than VAT, gaming duties and tax credits, rise in line with the projected increase in the RPI over 12 months to the September following the Budget.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman has difficulty in understanding that, I shall be happy to assist him further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I have no difficulty in understanding that. However, it does not say what is the projected increase in RPI, how it has been derived or whether it has been audited. That is not stated anywhere in the Red Book. That is because, if an exposition of how it was arrived at were provided, the answer would be the one that I have given. If the Financial Secretary can assure us that there is another basis on which the Treasury estimated a 3.4 per cent. rise in the RPI all-„prices index for the relevant period, it would be most interesting to hear it, although it is extremely difficult to discern one. It would be helpful if such explanations were given. Alternatively, if I am mistaken, and it was not the intention to make an implicit judgment about mortgage interest costs—in which case, consistent with the RPIX forecast, a figure of 3.4 per cent. is wrong—the Treasury should revise its figures. One cannot have it all ways. If the RPIX forecast is the right basis, it flows, as night from day, that the RPI change can only be a different figure to the extent that there is a mortgage interest cost difference or MIRAS difference, and a few volume and stock adjustments, which are minuscule. Alternatively, the RPIX figure is wrong. There is no escape from that; it is remorseless logic. It would therefore be helpful if an explanation were given. I defy the Financial Secretary, even with his great brain power, to explain how the figure of 3.4 per cent. has been derived. The 2.25 per cent. RPIX figure, about which there is a great deal of discussion, is one of the few matters that is made clear at the back end of the Red Book, but there is nothing about the RPI all-„prices index. I suspect that the answer is the one that I have given, although it will be interesting to hear whether the Financial Secretary has a different tale to tell.
<P>
There are four options. First, the Financial Secretary could return fairly promptly with an uprating that is based on an RPI all-prices index, which is consistent with the RPIX, and does not implicitly include an estimate of the rise in mortgage interest rates of the kind that I described. If he were to do that, he would uprate by about 3 per cent. instead of 3.4 per cent.
<P>
The second option is complementary to the first—the Financial Secretary could introduce amendments or other statutory provisions stipulating that, in future, after the fact, corrections can and, indeed, must be made when the uprating has exceeded the inflation rate. That would avoid the systemic bias and stealth tax that we discussed. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood indicated, that was implemented previously, and should be put on a statutory basis, as in the case of social security payments.
<P>
The third possibility is that the Financial Secretary will prove my figures wrong—no one would be more delighted than me if he did—and will illustrate how, from an RPIX of 2.12 per cent., one arrives at an RPI all-prices index of 3.4 per cent. without the implicit rise in mortgage interest costs.
<P>
The fourth possibility, which we hope will not occur, is that the Financial Secretary will simply bluster, and claim—again, wrongly—that there was no stealth increase as a result of the double Budget, and that the Government have not, by switching to a forward-looking uncorrected index, created the possibility of systemic bias, and have not implicitly assumed a major rise in mortgage interest costs. That would be a sad outcome. Having not been transparent up to this stage, the Government owe the Committee a completely transparent explanation now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Whatever happened to the fifth option? Why did the hon. Gentleman not table a suitable amendment? Was it just an oversight?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to ask that question. It is due to unpleasant experiences in Standing Committees during this Parliament. When we have an absolutely watertight argument, as we had in relation to the Government Resources and Accounts Bill, and the representatives of Her Majesty's Treasury do not have a shred of explanation, we find that, if we table amendments, the massed ranks of Labour Members—who are otherwise happily occupied with their letters—vote them down, whereas, if they reconsider the matter, we sometimes make progress. Cider drinkers and many others deserve better than a debating point. We are giving the Government the opportunity to put this serious matter right or to admit that they expect a major mortgage interest rate rise. Such a rise would be important.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that amendments that he tables to other clauses will purely be intended as debating points?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a most amusing debating point. If we were to table amendments on a core item such as this at a later point, he is right that it would simply be intended to bring the matter to discussion. Like me, he is probably unaware of an Opposition amendment being wholly accepted and put into legislation by the Government.
<P>
There is much room for debate. In this case, the matter is less of debate and more of error or of an assumption which, if true, will damage the British economy. I a open to correction by the Financial Secretary about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I support the line that has been taken by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin). Their points go to the heart of a weakness of the Budget as our constituents perceive it. The Budget appears to argue that a series of allowances and tax rates are linked to inflation, and then introduces two different measures of inflation, and that is one of its key dishonesties. As my right hon. Friend said, there are three measures, because the working families tax credit for some reason has another rate of inflation. Our constituents simply do not understand why there are different rates.
<P>
The question before the Committee is simple. Should we agree to the Chancellor's proposition that the duty on cider should go up by 3.41 per cent? The Chancellor may argue that duties on cider and other drinks should go up by 3.41 per cent. because they are linked to inflation, as are all the other allowances in the system. Those of us who have taken an interest in the subject have been familiar with that argument since the days of the Rooker-Wise amendment. We know that there is a series of inflation-linked hurdles and rates in the tax and benefit system. The cider drinkers of Somerset, Leicestershire and other counties can be told that their duty rate will go up at an inflation-linked rate that has echoes throughout the tax and benefit system. That argument is familiar and can be presented as fair.
<P>
It is unfair, however, that a pensioner who drinks cider should pay 3.4 per cent. extra when his pension goes up by only 1.1 per cent. After the drubbing that the Labour party received last week in the local elections, we heard in the weekend newspapers that pensioners in the Labour clubs of Britain are unhappy because their pensions have gone up by only 75p or 1.1 per cent. It is not surprising that they are unhappy if they have also been told that their cider charges will go up by 3.4 per cent. That breaks a linkage that has been long established in the tax and benefit system.
<P>
The Financial Secretary's task now is to explain how he can reconcile the alleged fairness of the Chancellor's position about pensions and personal allowances in the tax system with cider duty going up by rates linked to inflation, when the rate for cider duty happens to be three times greater than the rate for the pensions and tax allowances. He has to explain that to the Committee, but also to pensioners who drink cider in Labour clubs around Britain. We look forward to hearing the sophisticated line of argument that he will develop.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the asymmetry to which he has referred could be replicated the following year by reversing the tactic? Nothing is being put forward that would prevent the Treasury from moving to a backward-looking index having discovered, in a subsequent year, that that would produce the same effect again by another means. A wide gap could exist for ever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend is right to say that nothing in the Red Book would prevent the asymmetry from being reversed next year. I am willing to bet him that the Government would not reverse it next year. They are, after all, the Government of stealth taxes and my hon. Friend will know that, if the asymmetry were reversed, it would result in higher spending and lower taxes. As that would mean reducing tax yields, I am not certain that the Chancellor would favour such a policy.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree with my right hon. Friend that the Government could reverse the rules to maintain the asymmetry in their favour permanently. By reversing the rules as they go forward, the gap could be maintained for ever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend is precisely right. Exactly that opportunity exists. The first task that the Financial Secretary faces is to explain the asymmetry. His second task, even if he maintains that it is fair to increase cider duty by three times the amount by which pensions have been increased, is to justify to the Committee where the 3.41 per cent. came from. It is not exactly a round number. Presumably, it was not just plucked out of the air, but was based on a calculation. The Financial Secretary referred to the Red Book, in which there is much information, but nowhere is there a calculation that feeds in a series of variables and produces the answer of 3.41 per cent. Having established the principle that an asymmetry must have been introduced into the system, he must then show us the formula, the answer to which is 3.41 per cent.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset is to be congratulated on producing the answer. A series of complex equations are pursued somewhere in my hon. Friend's head, or what for the rest of us would count as a computer. My hon. Friend can do such calculations in his head, but the rest of us cannot. What formula produces the answer of 3.41 per cent? My hon. Friend has produced such a formula. It requires the feeding in of a 0.7 per cent. increase in interest rates, assuming that that increase would have come through at the last meeting of the MPC. There was a collective sigh of relief, not just among the mortgage payers of Great Britain but in manufacturing industry, when the MPC recently decided—against expectations—not to increase interest rates, with the effect on the level of sterling that that would probably have had.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Will my right hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> In a moment.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset says that the only way in which the Chancellor can justify the figure of 3.41 per cent. is by recognising that his arithmetic expected the MPC to impose an interest rate increase of 0.7 per cent. Presumably the closer we get to September, the larger the increase has to be, to make my hon. Friend's quadratic equations work. If my hon. Friend was wrong to say that the Chancellor expects the MPC to increase the interest rate by 0.75 per cent., what formula should convince the Committee—having first been convinced that it should go up by three times the rate of the pension—that 3.41 per cent. is the right answer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> My right hon. Friend has gone some way to making the point to which I was about to allude. There is one other possibility. We may be working off the formula that my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset has suggested, which is based on an increase in interest rates. There may be some other formula to which the Government will allude. The third possibility is that there is no formula, the figure is just arbitrary and 3.41 per cent. was chosen to give an air of spurious accuracy, when it was nothing more than a stealth tax. Does my right hon. Friend agree that evidence of that is provided in paragraph 5 on page 153, which makes clear that the Government want the maximum capacity for all the rises to remain with a different uprating formula for every conceivable area of uprating?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend is right to suggest that that is the third explanation. I can only pause to reflect on the mind of someone who, when asked to make a judgment about how much RPI is likely to increase in September, lights upon the figure of 3.41 per cent. Such a figure would not volunteer itself to everyone. I am inclined to believe that a calculation lies behind it and my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset has defined what that is. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) is right. It is possible that, to obscure the fact that the figure was plucked out of the air to produce some revenue as a stealth tax, an unlikely and obscure number has been selected—3.41 per cent. Whichever is the right answer, the Financial Secretary owes the Committee an explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> rose—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has been commended by his right hon. Friend for advancing some correct arguments. I hope that he will perform as accurately in Committee and address his remarks to the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise, Mr. Cook. In the heat of battle, I was staring at my right hon. Friend.
<P>
My right hon. Friend's remarks brought to light an oddity on page 153. It seems that the projected increase in RPI is after
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>assuming implementation dates of March for fuel and tobacco and April for alcohol.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that, if the Government were to increase duties enormously on cider, for example, or were prospectively to do so, they would be justified in so doing by the fact that they had done so. There is something odd about the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend points out an interesting circulatory in the way in which the case is presented, although I suspect that that is inherent in how the RPI system works. The more the duty is increased, the more it has to be increased. Perhaps that was how the figure of 3.41 per cent. was reached. It could have been the circulatory effect of feeding back on itself. That is a fifth possible explanation of the unlikely figure of 3.41 per cent. The cider-drinking pensioner is still stuck on 1.1 per cent., so why are the two figures different and why does the cider-drinking pensioner expect duty on his cider to increase by three times the amount that his pension is increased?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset for shining so much light on such an interesting matter. When listening to him, I felt like the young constable coming from my morning briefing during which Inspector Clouseau had shone the light on some dastardly piece of overnight thought and had illuminated the fact that lies at the heart of the crime in a way that I had hitherto not recognised.
<P>
I am intrigued by the language used in the notes on clauses, which accompany the Bill. On clause 2, they state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These increases, in line with inflation, do not represent an increase in real terms and are necessary to maintain revenue.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no explanation of the magic words ``necessary to maintain revenue''. Let us concentrate on ``necessary''. Was it necessary to increase the tax on this product this year? The farming and fruit industry continues to have a difficult time. The strength of sterling versus the euro means that other alcoholic beverages from the continent are priced at a very attractive rate. There would have been a good case for leaving cider alone, but the Treasury has interpreted the word ``necessary'' to mean ``we must do it''. There appears to be no arbitration on the meaning of that word. I hardly think that the finances of the United Kingdom rest entirely on changes in the revenue from cider, but the Treasury clearly does because it has used the words ``to maintain the revenue''. That may be targeted at more than the revenue from the taxation on cider, but we shall see.
<P>
On page 194 of the Red Book, we are allowed to tiptoe close to understanding the basis of the magic 3.41 per cent. I share the deep scepticism of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood about that number because when I was a Treasury Minister I was always worried when people came up with such precise calculations while giving forecast margins of plus or minus 5 or 10 per cent., depending on the figure. Therefore, I find that precision remarkable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend has proved me wrong. There is a figure in table C3—he has found it. I congratulate him on that; he has also helped the Financial Secretary, who did not know where it was. It is interesting to note that the figure for the relevant year is given as 3.5, rather than 3.41. The rounded-up figure is right before our eyes, but I had missed it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Absolutely. I do not want to undermine my hon. Friend's line of argument. Table C3 refers to the economic assumptions for public finance projections, which has nothing to do with safeguarding the input of moneys, but relates to assumptions that underlie the spending side of the economy. I am surprised, given that the aim is to maintain real values of a particular stream of tax, that the magic number of 3.41 has emerged from the ether and that the Government think of it as the chosen one and the saviour that will maintain the revenues from cider taxation.
<P>
There are other measures of inflation that would insulate and safeguard the cider revenues from the ravages of inflation, but the Government have chosen a measure that relates to their own level of public finance projections, which are matters under their control. I refer to the RPI, which is about safeguarding people's expenditure—that is why it forms part of the consideration of some social security benefits, which are a type of spending. However, the question is one of revenue, and the protection of its real value, and not one of spending. I contend that there is no logical connection between those two things, but that Ministers have gone along with an accepted wisdom. They did not do their jobs properly, in that they did not question that point of detail and did not ask how that number arose.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend because he has taught me a tremendous amount. No doubt his attention has been drawn to box C1, in which it becomes clear that the RPI is ``consistent with RPIX''—the projection of price indices. Does he conclude, as I do, that the logic that I described is there, and that it leads from the RPIX forecast into the RPI forecast via mortgage interest rates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My hon. Friend has made the point to which I was coming next, in a more succinct way than I would have done. He uses more precise language than I could, so I shall not repeat the point.
<P>
We have uncovered the Treasury's use of smoke and mirrors. It will be interesting to see how the Financial Secretary will clear the mists so that we may see, with a bright light, the true explanation for what appears to have been a nice little earner which, until my hon. Friend did his homework, the Treasury thought that it could get away with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am pleased that you will chair our proceedings, Mr. Cook. This morning's sitting is likely to be slightly longer than last Thursday's, which you also chaired. We are also pleased that you are in charge of ensuring that the Committee runs well.
<P>
I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Fylde, who in a short intervention demolished the case put by the hon. Member for West Dorset that the proposals for excise duties in the Budget lack clarity. The position is absolutely clear and is spelt out repeatedly in the Red Book, which also explains the basis on which calculations have been made.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> If the position is so clear in the Red Book, why did the Minister fail to make it clear in two interventions on the hon. Member for West Dorset?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As I pointed out to the hon. Member for West Dorset, the figure of 3.41 per cent., which he said did not appear in the Red Book, in fact appears on page 148. I am sure that he did not intend to mislead the Committee, but inadvertently did so. The methodology that led to the use of that figure is spelt out on page 153, and, if any lack of clarity remained, as the right hon. Member for Fylde pointed out, the figure of 3.5 per cent. appears in table C3. Box C1 helpfully draws to the Committee's attention the fact that the National Audit Office has audited the consistency of that projection with the RPIX figures.
<P>
The case that Opposition Members have made this morning has no substance, although it has whiled away an hour of the Committee's time. My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) made a telling point. Opposition Members have not done their homework. They have not tabled the amendments that they might have been expected to table, and instead we have had an hour of bluster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): Will the Financial Secretary be kind enough to advise the Committee of the Government's assumed increase in mortgage interest rates that caused the difference between 2.5 per cent. and 3.41 per cent. as between RPIX and RPI?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall be glad to, and I shall explain the basis for the changes in the Budget. Following the Government's election, we presented a Budget in July, when we decided to increase excise duties on the basis of an inflation projection for the following September. It is specified in statute that income tax allowance increases should be made on the basis of the previous September's outturn figure, as the hon. Member for West Dorset said. That is the basis on which changes have been made since the election. Changes have been made that way every time, and hon. Members must wonder why such excitement was not generated in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Just before the Financial Secretary develops that point, having returned to the origins of the matter, can he explain why that particular measure of inflation, among the myriad of other measures, was selected for the July Budget?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The RPI for September is the measure used under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for income tax personal allowances. Therefore the same measure is used for excise duties. The September inflation projection was used in the July Budget, just after the election, as the best estimate available for the ensuing year, to cover the increases in excise duties in July and March. The matter is completely straightforward.
<P>
The question that I am sure was in the minds of my hon. Friends as they listened to Opposition Members was why that excitement did not occur last year. The answer to that is also straightforward. The methodology that I described, which is set out in the Red Book and has been used every year since the election, led to an increase in excise duties of 1.3 per cent.—significantly less than RPIX at the time and than the sum used for income tax allowances and in other changes in the Budget. I do not recall headlines in The Daily Telegraph or elsewhere last year about stealth handouts—to use the expression of Opposition Members; nobody paid any attention to the matter. It is purely a question of swings and roundabouts. Last year, there was such a substantial stealth handout and this year there has been the correction that one would expect, given that we are, thanks to the Government's macro-economic policies, in an era of stable inflation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Financial Secretary make two admissions? First, will he admit that last year's forecast was 1.3 per cent., measured against an actual outturn in the RPI all-prices index of 1.1, and that it was therefore an excessive forecast that has not been corrected? Secondly, will he admit that the RPIX, as shown on page 195 of the Red Book, has been used as the base for forecasting RPI and therefore that the mortgage interest rate rise is the only explanation of the difference?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> What I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that excise duties since the election have risen rather less than the actual rate of RPI. Given that we are in an era of stable inflation, thanks to the Government's macro-economic policies, that does not matter. There is not a vast amount of money at stake. As a result of the changes that we have made, excise duties are less than they would have been if they had increased by the actual rate of inflation in each year since the election. There is a link between RPIX and RPI, but the difference reflects market expectations of interest rates. The Chancellor is not making a projection; it is a technical matter, using market expectations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Sunshine is breaking out everywhere now that we have discovered that the difference is based on a market expectation calculation. However, I want to take the Financial Secretary back to his earlier remark that not a great deal of money is at stake. Does he think that that is how the pensioners perceive a 1.1 per cent. increase?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My point is that this is a case of swings and roundabouts and that since the election excise duties have risen less, overall, than RPI.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Committee should be clear that the Government's answer to the pensioner representatives is that 75p is not a great deal of money, but it is just swings and roundabouts
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is wrong. The Government have substantially increased spending on pensioners—substantially more than the policy of the Opposition, which is simply to increase state pensions in line with prices. We also introduced the winter fuel allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bill Rammell </B>(Harlow): Did my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary hear the shadow Chancellor on the ``Today'' programme this morning? When asked specifically whether a Conservative Government would have increased pensions by more than 75p this year, he said no. The Opposition are manufacturing hot air.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right.
<P>
I was grateful to the right hon. Member for Fylde because, unlike any other Opposition Member, he mentioned issues related to cider. As that is what the clause is about, I shall say a little on the subject. The cider industry is more than holding its own. Clearances from April 1999 to January 2000 seem healthy and are up 8.4 per cent. on the same period the previous year. I am pleased to say that there are reports of some of our major cider makers successfully diversifying abroad as well as establishing a sound base in the United Kingdom.
<P>
A successful cider industry is extremely good news for apple growers. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned fruit growers. Member firms of the National Association of Cider Makers have planted 5,000 additional acres of cider apples in the UK between 1996 and 2000. Cider now accounts for 100,000 tonnes of apples, which is 45 per cent. Of apples grown in the UK. Member firms have planted more than 1 million new cider apple trees since 1995, so there are now more than 2 million cider apple trees in the UK. There is every possibility that, when the figures for the whole of last year are published, we shall see that the industry had a record year, benefiting like so many others from the prosperity and stability in the economy brought about by the Government's policies. The proposition in the clause is right, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Under pressure, the Financial Secretary has finally conceded that the 3.41 per cent. assumption was influenced by interest rates. That is a crucial revelation. I want to draw the Committee's attention—I shall not reiterate any of the points made so far—to the difficulty that we have had in uncovering that fact, which has occurred because the Red Book is incomprehensible even to people who have studied Red Books for many years.
<P>
The Financial Secretary took us on a tour of various tables in the Red Book, most of which bore little relation to the question that he had been asked. We moved quietly from one to another, but no one, him least of all, had a clue why. I have no doubt that he was being passed notes to suggest that the tables might act as smokescreens. Finally, he said, ``Don't worry, the National Audit Office has had a look at it and says that it's all right''. That is always the bottom line for misunderstandings in Red Books. The NAO has not considered the 3.41 per cent. assumption, and it was highly misleading of the Financial Secretary to say that it had done. It is clear from the footnote to box C1 that the assumption has not been audited for almost three years. The accompanying notes on page 194 state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked the NAO to undertake a review . . . on a three-year rolling basis.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that not the clearest possible evidence of the need to end the charade of pretending that the NAO is underwriting any of the figures? Will a fiscal policy committee be set up that could give independent authority to such numbers now?

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend has made an invaluable discovery. Footnote 2 stated that the NAO audited the assumptions for the pre-Budget report on 25 November 1997.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That, indeed, is nearly three years ago. I was exaggerating slightly. I should have said that it happened two and a half years ago. On cider, as on all other upratings and on the incredibly difficult to understand explanation of how the upratings have been arrived at, the intervention of the NAO is of no help at the moment. That is not the NAO's fault, but the fault of the Government, who are deliberately pretending that there is clarity, when there is not. One of the biggest oxymorons in the Red Book is its explanation of how the Exchequer effects of the Budget measures are calculated, which explains no such thing. It is impossible to work out how the effects are calculated, and it is only under pressure that we have been able to drag out of the Treasury the fact that an interest rate assumption was used in the case of cider. That is no way to run a railway—or the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> This has been a most interesting debate—if I can call it that. I admit that I was wrong. The Red Book does contain an explanation, and I was just looking in the wrong place. I share that disadvantage with the Financial Secretary, but we are mere mortals and failed to spot the appropriate explanations. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells have both pointed out further ways in which I was wrong. When I first read it, I thought that box C1 said that the NAO had ordered consistency with the RPIX. It now turns out that that is wrong, although it was so two or three years ago.
<P>
I was also wrong to suggest that the Financial Secretary would respond to the matters to which I referred. He did not. He did not defend my proposition, or fully explain it, or withdraw it or propose any changes to it. Instead, he half admitted that there is a 0.7 per cent. interest rate rise assumption, although he did not state a figure. He did not say that it was the Chancellor's forecast. In fact, I think that he said that it was not the Chancellor's forecast, but a market expectation, an explanation which I wish to explore because it will be of interest when it comes out in the popular press in the next day or two. Which market expectation was it? Whose expectation? Differential bond rates do not show such a difference.
<P>
Forecasters do not seem to be forecasting a 0.75 per cent. rise in mortgage interest rates. Many people forecast that there could be a 0.25 per cent. rise now, while others forecast that there might be a 0.25 per cent. rise later. That would not be sufficient to generate the RPIX to the retail prices index change that the Chancellor forecast. It therefore behoves him, in response, perhaps, to written question, to say which market expectations were used and from where were they founded. I accept that we were wrong and that we did not find appropriate explanations in the Red Book, but the relevant market reports may not have come our way. After all, the Chancellor has sources of information that many of us do not. I am perplexed.
<P>
I may be wrong, but at the inspiration of the Financial Secretary, I think that a large figure was chosen some while back on the expectation that the Monetary Policy Committee would behave differently from the way it currently behaves. That may have reflected the desire of the Chancellor for a higher interest rate. He has made no secret of the fact that he desired from the MPC a higher interest rate. That is understandable. Forecasting errors are made, but there should be a system by which to correct matters. What happens if a forecasting base goes wrong systemically, as has happened? As the Financial Secretary said, the first mistake was in the March 1999 Budget, when 1.3 per cent. was forecast, against 1.1 per cent. in reality. If the Chancellor's expectation of a rise of 0.7 per cent. in mortgage interest rates more or less immediately went unfulfilled, there could be a considerable difference between the forecast RPI or prices index rise to September, and the actual rate. It could even be of the order of half of one percentage point, It would be interesting to know why some ex post correction system is not being introduced. It is indefensible to use a forecasting system without a correction system.
<P>
If the forecast error has been made, unless the Chancellor maintains that he wants and expects an immediate rise, notwithstanding the markets, that should be corrected, now that it has come to light. We are facing neither of those things. We cannot conscientiously support an uprating based on an increase that has not been fully explained. However, it seems that the explanation that has more or less come to light from the debate cannot be defended and hence it has not been defended. That is a pretty rum basis on which to legislate on our taxes. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will join me in voting against the proposals.

Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of duty on wine and made-wine</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Before we leave alcohol taxation, I want to ask the Government some questions about the link between the duty increase proposed on wine and the smuggling problem, which we have discussed before but chiefly in connection with tobacco duties. In the interesting debate on cider duty, we heard that the Government are now increasing taxes in line with market expectation, which is a truly remarkable and rather novel way of deciding tax levels. That is alarming, because it means that the Government are ceasing concertedly to determine duty in accordance with other considerations, such as smuggling. They are delivering themselves to the concept of future market expectations about interest rates. Conservative Members believe that the widening duty differential between ourselves and the continent should at least be a consideration. It is most unwise of the Government to abrogate that concept in favour of a future estimate of interest rates, which may not be fulfilled and which is set, almost by definition, to completely different criteria than the smuggling issue.
<P>
The Red Book includes detailed discussion of measures to be taken against tobacco smuggling, to which page 102 is devoted. It refers to the document, ``Tackling Tobacco Smuggling'', which was published the day after the Budget and arose from the report by Martin Taylor which, sadly, is secret although it was paid for out of public funds. That is an issue for another debate. The Government are dealing with tobacco smuggling, but they should tackle the cause of the crime as well as the crime itself
<P>
I can find no comparable discussion of measures to be taken against smuggling of alcohol products. What is the reason for that? As I understand it, the problem is getting worse. I have no up-to-date figures, but all the trade associations claim that the smuggling of wine and beer became worse in 1999. It is therefore an escalating problem. Many of the issues that affect tobacco are also relevant to alcohol, as smuggling undermines the legitimate trade. I expect that other hon. Members will be familiar with those 18th century prints that show the effect of uncontrolled drinking. One that I saw carried the legend, ``Drunk for a penny; Dead drunk for twopence''. The print was of a place called Gin alley, which is somewhere in London, not far from the House of Commons. Everyone would agree that what those prints portrayed was intolerable and the licensed trade's achievement, which is to allow controlled drinking in congenial circumstances, should not be thrown away lightly.
<P>
I support the British pub, which provides amenities and circumstances in which people can drink in moderation and in controlled circumstances, and which does its best to exclude underage drinking. All of that is at risk from a flood of illegal imported products, which are often resold in entirely uncontrolled circumstances—in clubs, factory car parks and so on. That sends out entirely the wrong signal about alcoholl and how and where it should be consumed. It also sends out the wrong signal about law and order generally and it benefits the French Treasury—Tesco and Sainsbury have large stores in Calais, where drink is purchased and then brought back to this country. That trade is tolerable only in small quantities and if it is growing the Government must deal with it. I am puzzled by the absence of discussion of the matter or of additional measures to be taken in the Red Book.
<P>

<P>
In 1998, the Government considered the matter. Page 73 of the pre-Budget report, which was published in November 1998, refers to the outcome of an alcohol and tobacco fraud review and announced additional staff and tougher penalties, among other measures. However, we know that those measures have not worked, because the Government asked Mr. Taylor to conduct a study on tobacco, implicitly accepting that the problem was out of control.
<P>
Mr. Taylor's report on tobacco refers to a growing and serious problem and discusses graphically the law and order issues involved and the haemorrhaging of revenue. Much the same is true for alcohol. I do not have up-to-date figures—I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would supply them—on the latest estimates of the loss of value added tax and excise duty as a result of cross-border shopping and the smuggling of alcohol products. Such figures exist—Customs and Excise has carried out the research. If I had tabled a written question in time, I would have them available. However, the Financial Secretary will have them. I should like the hon. Gentleman to give us those figures and to compare them with previous year, so that the Committee has some idea of the trend and whether the problem is getting worse. If it is, trade associations and the trade itself as well as the anecdotal evidence suggest, why do the Government seem to be concentrating on alcohol?
<P>
The matter relates to clause 3 and why the Government are making a bad situation worse by increasing duty by 3.1 per cent., according to this bizarre new formula, when we know—indeed, it is common sense—that a direct connection exists between the differential in the duty rate and the attractiveness of smuggling. I should be most grateful if the Financial Secretary would supply that information, which might further the debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall add a few further inquiries to my right hon. Friend's lucid points. I should declare an interest that is recorded in the register, because it may relate to alcohol. I work not for a wine company, but for a merchant bank associated with a wine company. I am interested in the effect not on wine companies but on public morals and the causes of crime.
<P>
When we debated the matter and related it to issues in a larger sphere on the Floor of the House there were various exchanges, which I can roughly summarise by saying that the Government's refutation of the argument of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and others—a point made, to some extent, by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, on the Liberal Benches—was along the lines that the own-price and cross elasticities involved were such that we had not reached the cross-over point of diminishing returns. Therefore, there was no reason not to increase wine duties and collect more net revenue, even after taking account of the effect of diminishing consumers' appetite for such substances and persuading them to buy from illicit sources.
<P>
It is probably true that the elasticities involved are such that the provision will be a net revenue-raising measure. I assume that it is true because I cannot imagine that the Treasury would increase duty on wine by the amount proposed if it were not under the honest impression that to do so would raise revenue. If the Treasury model suggested to Treasury Ministers that they would diminish net revenue by raising duty, they would undoubtedly desist from doing so. Although the Treasury model is approaching that point for tobacco, it is nowhere near it for wine.
<P>
Another elasticity that requires investigation and was not referred to in the exchanges is that to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells alludes. We should be precise in asking for we want and what we ought to have. The differential in duty for the average bottle of wine between France and the United Kingdom is broadly the difference between 2p on a bottle in France and £1.16 this side of the channel. That is, by any measure, a wide duty differential, and it means that the cost of a bottle of wine bought in Calais will often be smaller than the total difference of duty and VAT on the duty. That is a colossal difference, similar to the 18th century difference for brandy to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells referred, which gave rise to many charming episodes of smuggling in my constituency.
<P>
I shall not repeat the Financial Secretary's charming disquisition on lovely cider-growing trees, of which there are some in my constituency; it was wholly irrelevant. The serious issue that we should discuss is the effect on public behaviour, to which we shall return when we discuss the enforcement of duties. The logic of the Government's thinking on the rise in duty on wine goes like this: ``We can raise more revenue by increasing the duty, notwithstanding the colossal difference between duties in France and the United Kingdom. We do not care about the fact that that probably induces a lot of bootlegging and, for one reason or another, we do not want to publish what we know about that. Instead, we want to tighten up the enforcement so that we gradually turn Customs and Excise into a type of Gestapo to counteract the effects of our measures.'' That is an unsatisfactory public policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): Bit over the top, that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We shall see whether it is over the top when we get to the enforcement of duties part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We must ask the hon. Gentleman to clarify what he has just said. I understand that his right hon. Friend the Member for Wells supported the Government's extra investment of £209 million into Customs and Excise to tackle smuggling. Does the hon. Gentleman also support those steps?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said that, given the circumstances that the Government are generating, we have no option but to accept that more money will have to be spent on detection. He also said explicitly—and he was right—that the previous measures did not work and that we are not confident that the new ones will.
<P>
I was referring not to those measures but to the enforcement of duties. When we discuss that part of the Bill, we shall see that the statutory basis on which Customs and Excise operates will be much more draconian after the Bill is enacted. By saying that that body is being turned into a kind of Gestapo, I do not mean to malign the individuals involved; the Customs and Excise officers do their duty to the best of their ability.
<P>
The Government are undermining the basis of public morality by allowing there to be a colossal incentive for people to bootleg wine, or to import it legitimately for their own use, as my right hon. Friend suggested. I admit that the Government are exaggerating a tendency that existed under previous regimes. However, I am concerned about the bootlegging. The Government allow that incentive and then, logically, try to counter it by giving vast new powers to Customs and Excise.
<P>
If we are to support that policy, we need to understand a different elasticity, which has not been explored and which the Government do not reveal. By how much do the Government estimate that bootlegging will increase for each percentage point increase in the duty differential? That is the statistical version of my right hon. Friend's question, and that is the figure that we do not have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the Conservatives would make it a spending priority to cut excise duties on alcohol to tackle cross-border shopping and bootlegging? Would they be prepared to reduce revenues to the Treasury to tackle—in his words—their concern for public morality?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I may come to an agreement on the matter We ought not to be founding a public policy that has a significant impact on the way in which our citizens behave, without being in possession of the facts. We do not know—because the Treasury has not told us, or does not have the information—what effect the widening of duty differentials has or is estimated to have on public behaviour. We do not have the basis for such a public policy discussion. That is a sad state of affairs. The Conservative party—and I suspect that the hon. Gentleman and most Labour Members agree—wants to assert that it is disadvantageous if our tax system, in this case in relation to duties on wine, is constructed so that it gives people a large incentive to engage in criminal behaviour.
<P>
How severe is that incentive? How much damage is it doing? We do not know, because all the elasticity studies have effectively been about the extent to which revenue is diminished or otherwise, rather than about the extent to which smuggling and bootlegging increase. We deserve to know about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be asking the impossible if he wants elasticity on bootlegging in relation to tax rates. I would be interested to know whether he would like to propose the methodology of finding out that elasticity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I was about to propose the methodology, so I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I believe that the Government have good survey evidence on the level of smuggling and bootlegging. If they did not, they would not know that there had been a vast increase and so would not have produced all sorts of documents about how to tackle the increase. We are not asking them to reveal the security sources that have given rise to such evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is going to propose a methodology, he must do it so that the evidence is acquired over several years and is therefore statistically reliable. The sorts of data required are not available for the relevant number of years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman makes that argument. On the Floor of the House on a similar subject, when he argued that the study carried out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies based on the family expenditure survey was a good basis for early elasticity and cross-price elasticities, I mentioned to him in a whisper that there was not a good historical series. He is right; one needs a decent historical series. Interestingly, I think that we shall hear from the Financial Secretary that the Treasury has a reasonably good historical series of smuggling surveys. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has repeatedly said, that comes out in document after document published not only by the current regime but by previous Governments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am not sure about the hon. Gentleman's last point, but I think that he will agree that we have a valid historical series for the relevant data on demand effects of duty changes. Those changes happened over several years and successive Governments. However, we do not have in the needed detail the relevant data about smuggling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am not sure that that is true. Even if it were, and if the hon. Gentleman's point about the IFS and the family expenditure survey were correct, that would provide a means of assessment, because we ought to have a pretty accurate record of the amount of bootlegging from the gap between the consumption estimates that had arrived from the family expenditure survey series and the figures that presumably can be derived from sales returns from legitimate outlets. If so, it ought also to be possible to try, experimentally, to find out what kind of smuggling elasticity there is by making a shock change. That would be unusual, but could be done. The hon. Gentleman will know, as will all hon. Members who study such matters, that shocks best illustrate elasticity effects. There is a much better measure of the elasticity effect on smuggling or any such activity if a shock to one item is suddenly administered. That brings us back to the point that the hon. Gentleman made.
<P>
Increasing or reducing the duty rates on wine is not the single greatest priority of the Government or any prospective Government. By the same token, it is not a large revenue raiser. If the Treasury were to so construe it, wine would seem an ideal case for an experiment to find out how significant a reduction or increase in rates would be.
<P>
By taking a well based measurement using either of the methods that we have discussed—for triangulation purposes, both should be used—and based on the one-off shock treatment of a change in duty, one might be able to find out how far smuggling and bootlegging are being induced by the measures.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> To support my hon. Friend's request, I should say that Customs and Excise has done such studies. I have in front of me figures from 1995 on the extent of cross-border shopping and the duty loss from VAT and excise duty for alcohol and tobacco. From 1996, I have figures for cross-channel smuggling. All that we are asking is that the Minister brings the series up to date and studies how duty changes correlate with the increase in smuggling and cross-border shopping. The methodology already exists; we are simply asking the Government to bring the figures together into a concerted study.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Absolutely. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. We are asking that public policy have a serious and responsible base in an area where it is common ground that a huge amount of malfeasance is taking place. The critical point is that it is not only the traditional mafiosi who are involved. I do not discount their importance, but we live with criminals, and there will be criminals in our society for a long time to come—even the Government Whip will admit that. The right way to deal with criminals is to search them out and put them in prison. The worry in this case is that many perfectly ordinary and upstanding citizens, who are not otherwise criminals, are being given an incentive to act improperly, immorally and illegally— and, in some cases, alas, they are acting on it. It is common ground between us that that is bad for society. We need to understand how far that effect extends so that we can find a means of preventing or diminishing such activities without our Customs and Excise officials having to spot them throughout the kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's enunciation of the new Conservative policy on crime. I wonder whether he would apply the logic that differentials promote crime to differentials in wealth. Will he urge the Government to make investigations into the way in which differentials in wealth between different members of the community can induce people to engage in criminal activities such as burglary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sure, Mr. Cook, that you would not want me to go into detail, but sociologists have studied that link extensively. All parties believe in a welfare state because they do not want to put people in a position where they have no alternative but to engage in criminal activity. It is also common ground between the parties that they do not want to encourage smuggling. The question that arises in each case is how much one has to do to prevent the malaise in question and what the economic and social consequences will be.
<P>
The question before us is much simpler than that of wealth and its effect on crime. We are talking about a specific crime that appears to be tied in a specific way to a specific differential. We have the opportunity to find out—or at least to make a good estimate of—how far one affects the other. However, the Government are resisting doing so, and I hope that we can persuade the Financial Secretary to change his mind. That should be a matter not of party politics, but of agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he supported the welfare state and that he did not want there to be no alternative to crime. I am sure that he agrees that there is never no alternative to criminal activity, and that we should examine ways of preventing criminal activity, rather than simply of providing alternatives to it.
<P>
I take issue with the hon. Gentleman's comment about—I am sorry, Mr. Cook, it has slipped my mind. I shall return to it if the opportunity arises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman makes that argument, because I genuinely thought that the present Government believed that tackling the causes of crime was important. I believe that they were right to say that. We are discussing a specific crime. I do not by any means say that the only cause is the duty differential, because it clearly is not. That would be an insult to many honest citizens. As has been said, people can of their free will resist that incentive, but it is having an effect All that we are modestly asking is that that effect be properly measured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggests that the Government conduct an experiment with structural changes later by significantly reducing the duties on alcohol. Will he tell us the size of the change that he suggests and its likely impact on Government revenues? I suggest that it would have a significant effect on revenues, and I am not convinced that the benefits of that experiment would provide the Government with the necessary information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The short answer is no, because I have learned that it is pretty stupid for amateurs and the Opposition to start suggesting the exact parameters for such an investigation. We are talking specifically about one duty—wine duty—which is not a colossal revenue raiser, unlike some other duties. There is an opportunity to use the historical series to try to extrapolate decent elasticities for smuggling and bootlegging. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has pointed out, there may be a statistical base for doing so. If not, I suspect that a modest experiment on this item would help us to know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I remind my hon. Friend that we do not even need to experiment domestically. There are extensive studies of what happened in Canada and in the Nordic countries, which faced precisely the same problems. They took action, and the results are apparent. All that is needed is for the Treasury to extend the scope of its inquiries to encapsulate other tax jurisdictions to get at the heart of the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is right that we can draw on international examples and thereby gain a great deal of benefit. We can try to triangulate that with the UK evidence. All that we are asking, by one means or another, is that the facts be put before us in a way that illustrates the elasticity effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the effect in Canada of reducing duties was to cut the revenue to the Canadian Government? Will he also confirm that an experiment conducted by the Government with respect only to duties on wine would not produce any relevant evidence, because among different alcohol products, some may be complements? The IFS study showed that cross-price elasticity was important for estimating the overall effect. Therefore, it would be impossible to conduct a valid experiment by reducing the duties on just one alcohol product.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I certainly do not want to enter into a surreal detailed debate about the exact design of such a study; it is for the Government and their statisticians to work that out. However, the hon. Gentleman has leapt back immediately into the right answer to the wrong question. We are not discussing whether such measures will have an effect on revenue. We have admitted that the IFS study and others show that we have not reached the crossover point and that reductions in duty would probably reduce revenue. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and I are trying to make the point that the duty differential appears to be having—this seems to be common ground—another effect, which is not a revenue effect, but a social effect. That is what must be studied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I was trying to make the point that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting an expensive experiment to prove what the Government already know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is right, and the Government already know or have a good and reliable estimate of the increase in smuggling that will be caused by their present duty rate on wine—
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Publish it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester says from a sedentary position, let the Government publish that study. I do not think that in this case—unlike that of tobacco smuggling—it has been proved that the Government have the full details. If they have, let them publish them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for West Dorset found it necessary to clarify what most of us thought was a clear statement about the Opposition's support for the measures that the Government are taking to provide extra staff and extra resources for Customs and Excise to tackle its work. The statement seemed a great deal clearer when the right hon. Member for Wells made it than it did after the hon. Member for West Dorset had clarified it.
<P>
I hope that we will not hear Opposition Members using the term ``Gestapo'' about the work of Customs and Excise. I have not heard language of that kind being used by any other Members and I hope that the hon. Member for West Dorset is on his own in that. The hon. Gentleman's language was inappropriate and I hope that he agrees. He has muddied the public perception of the Opposition's policy.
<P>
Our position is clear: smuggling is crime and it is necessary to take steps to tackle it. That is the aim of the extra investment in Customs and Excise. We have had a serious problem with smuggling in the UK for a long time. The right hon. Member for Wells spoke about Tesco and Sainsbury's; they were, of course, operating in France as they are now before the election—it is nothing new.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me to bring up to date some of the data about revenue evaded and revenue lost through cross-channel smuggling. I am glad to do so, particularly as there is some good news, thanks to the steps taken by the Government following the alcohol and tobacco fraud review under the leadership of my hon. Friend, the Paymaster General. The most recent figures are that in 1997, the total revenue lost through cross-channel smuggling of beer, wine and spirits was £180 million. In 1998 it rose to £230 million, but in 1999 it fell to £215 million, so we have started to turn the tide on alcohol smuggling. Much more needs to be done, but the measures that have been taken are effective.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I have been listening with care to what the Minister has said. Will he help me to understand a little more about the methodology used to calculate the losses in revenue? What is the model? How are these numbers dreamed up, or are they in the same category as the 3.41 per cent. that we heard about earlier?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is a better methodology than the one that was used when the right hon. Gentleman was a Treasury Minister, I am pleased to say. We have become more systematic in our use of survey evidence. There is an assumption that about 80 per cent. of alcohol purchased abroad substitutes for similar purchases in the UK, and that is used in calculating the revenue lost figure. But the distinction between revenue evaded and revenue lost has been in the series for some time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give the Government's methodology for drawing a distinction between evasion and avoidance? In other words, how much revenue is lost through evasion and how much through avoidance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If I have understood the hon. Gentleman's point correctly, the figure for revenue evaded is our assessment of how much revenue has not been paid that should have been when alcoholic drinks have been smuggled. The smaller figure of revenue lost assumes that some of those would not have been purchased in the UK anyway. That is the reason for the two different figures. For consistency, I have used the revenue lost figures in the numbers that I have given.
<P>
The clause deals with wine, so I shall give the figures for wine: revenue lost in 1997 was £45 million, in 1998, £50 million and in 1999, £35 million. Therefore, there was quite a significant fall in revenue lost on wine in the last year for which data are available.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will make some progress and then gladly give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
We have announced that we shall invest up to £209 million over the next three years to increase our anti-„smuggling activity. As the figures that I have given show, we are making headway with the measures taken as a result of the alcohol and tobacco fraud review. The sums at stake with tobacco are considerably larger, which is why Martin Taylor's review focused on that and why the measures in response to his recommendations are targeted principally at tobacco smuggling. However, they will also have an important beneficial impact on alcohol smuggling. The increase in customs staff at the south coast ports dealing with cross-channel smuggling will have a significant impact on alcohol as well as tobacco smuggling. Our tough new vehicle seizure policy will also apply to alcohol as well as tobacco.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sorry to intervene again, but I should like some clarification. Did the Financial Secretary say that revenue lost was a definition of revenue lost through avoidance—that is, people going abroad, buying wine and so on and bringing it back—or that the notion of revenue lost incorporated an element of evasion? May we also have the Government's estimate for evasion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can certainly give those figures because I have them in front of me. I think that the hon. Gentleman understands what I mean by revenue evaded; I think that we are using that term in the same way. My point is that we also calculate a revenue lost figure, on the basis that not everything that is smuggled into the UK would have been purchased in the UK if it had not been smuggled. That is why our calculation of the amount of revenue lost is rather less than the figure for revenue evaded. However, the hon. Gentleman has asked me to read the figures for revenue evaded and I shall gladly do so. For beer, wine and spirits in total, the figure for 1997 was £240 million; for 1998, £305 million; and for 1999, £285 million. As one would expect, the figure has fallen, as the figure for revenue lost has done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> For the sake of clarity, am I correct that those figures do not include revenue forgone by those who have legitimately bought wine overseas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am always interested to know where numbers come from. Could the Financial Secretary enlighten us on how the figure of £295 million was calculated? If he cannot give chapter and verse on that now, will he make available a document setting out how that figure was calculated? I do not know the size of the universe to which it refers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I quoted a figure not of £295 million, but of £285 million. It is based on some thorough survey work, but I am happy to write to the right hon. Gentleman, with a copy to all members of the Committee, setting out in greater detail how those figures are reached.
<P>
The measures that we have taken to implement Martin Taylor's recommendations will have an impact on alcohol smuggling as well as on tobacco smuggling. Our major investment in a national network of X-ray scanners will also help to detect alcohol smuggling by freight. Measures are being put in place to tackle such problems. The figures concerning cross-channel smuggling in alcohol are already falling. Our aim is to stop the increase in smuggling within three years and to reduce it within five years.
<P>
I listened with interest to the debate between the hon. Members for West Dorset and for Kingston and Surbiton. It was clear who had the better of that debate, and I readily acknowledge the expertise of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, which was probably gathered in the course of the work of the Treasury Committee of which he is a member. During consideration of such matters, the Committee stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>although debate on this matter continues, academic evidence does not lend weight to the argument that reducing duty rates would discourage cross-Channel trade, legitimate or otherwise, to such an extent that government revenue would increase,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which was the point so ably made by the hon. Gentleman. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Financial Secretary began his remarks by trying to co-opt me into supporting the Government's measures against smuggling. For the avoidance of doubt, my point was that the Government are changing emphasis. They are concentrating entirely on the problem of tobacco smuggling and I was asking why there was not an equivalent section on alcohol smuggling in the Red Book. All the anti-smuggling measures in the world will not do the business required if, at the same time, the Government are undermining those efforts by increasing the gap between domestic and continental duty rates. It is counterproductive and unfair to expect the civil service and Customs and Excise, in particular, to halt such an escalating social problem when the Government's policy is working in the opposite direction. It is important that they start to practise joined-up government and, if they are to make a serious effort against smuggling, they must bring their fiscal policies into line with that, too.
<P>
I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for giving some figures for duty lost from smuggling, and we shall take him up on his offer to write to us with the comprehensive series and the figures appertaining to all products. For example, I did not hear the hon. Gentleman give figures in relation to beer, possibly because in its letter to me the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association said that Customs and Excise figures
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>show an increase of 7.5 per cent. in beer smuggling in 1999.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the incidence of wine smuggling may have dropped, I am not sure that it has for beer. We need the full series, product by product, if we are to be convinced by the Financial Secretary's argument.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton made a serious mistake in trying to distort our argument and implying that a tax—and, thus, a tax increase—is all right, provided that it nets additional revenue. Does he not see the difference in good and bad taxation? Long before we reach the point of diminishing returns and a duty rate increase produces less revenue, such a problem will cause severe collateral social damage. We have reached that point now with some duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman talks about good and bad taxes. Is he aware that many people believe that alcohol taxation serves a social and health benefit? Has he read ``Joined Up Action on Alcohol: Summary of Proposals for a National Strategy for England'', published by Alcohol Concern in May 1999, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At current levels of consumption it is appropriate to maintain the recent practice of increasing taxation on alcoholic products in line with inflation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is he against using alcohol taxation to promote social and health benefits for our community?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman quotes a report that states that alcohol duty should not be increased in line with inflation. We exploded that myth in the earlier debate. Duty has not increased in line with inflation, but in line with market expectations. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Is it not the case that the statistics for coronary disease in several countries of southern Europe are markedly better because people have the odd tipple of red wine? Is not the duty on red wine markedly lower?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have always found that a glass of wine does me a lot of good and I recommend it to other members of the Committee. Furthermore, the Government may put the rates of duty up, but the average price of the product on sale may fall. We may have reached that point with tobacco duty; piling extra duties on to what is sold legitimately causes a swing to purchasing from illegal sources, so the average price may well be dropping. That in itself undermines any possible health justification. Will the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton take on board the point that it is not a decisive argument to say that a duty cut would not cost the Treasury any money? We are looking at a much wider social problem.
<P>
Indeed, it was stated in the Labour party's manifesto that taxes could be used to deliver, and certainly to signal, desirable social aims. Taxes are not simply a way in which to raise money for the Treasury; they also encourage and discourage certain social behaviour. We are sending out the wrong signal by assuming that every tax on alcohol and tobacco is justified if it brings in extra revenue. It is not our intention to press the clause to a Division. We did that when we debated the matter in Committee of the whole House. If the Minister does not have the figures now, I look forward to receiving a full update of all the smuggling and cross-border figures on all products in due course, so that we can return to such matters later.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I understood the Minister to say that the Government had conducted a thorough survey, data from which underlies the evasion figures to which he has referred. Can that survey be made available to the Committee after he has made the information available to my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde?
<P>
The Chancellor has made much of fairness being a key principle of his taxation measures. In our somewhat esoteric debate, I am surprised that no mention was made of the country's big objection to the present arrangements, which is the unfairness of them. I am referring to the objections of wine merchants in the southern part of the country who face unfair competition. To put it bluntly, it is considered unfair that the better off can easily take a day trip to France and stock up with wine at low cost, while those who live in the northern part of the country, or who are less well off, forced either to pay the full duties or to benefit from smuggling. In addition to encouraging behaviour that is anti-social, our present arrangements are inherently unfair. That is unsatisfactory and the unfairness increases each time the gap widens between the duty in this country and the duty in France.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have said that I will write to the right hon. Member for Fylde explaining the way in which the figures have been arrived at. The right hon. Member for Wells has asked me to provide the figures. I am happy to do that as well. In the debates and the Red Book, we have been completely open and transparent about all matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs made a plea on behalf of wine merchants. Let me reassure him that the wine market in the United Kingdom continues to thrive. Table wine clearances were up by more than 6 per cent. between April 1999 and January 2000, and sparkling wine clearances were up by 50 per cent. The proposals are rightly balanced.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of duty and rebate on hydrocarbon oil</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Committee is aware, clause 4 is the key clause among several about hydrocarbon duties. I shall briefly refer to the territory that we have exhaustively covered, because the still unknown 3.41 per cent. figure mainly relates to hydrocarbon duties.
<P>
On 6 April, the Paymaster General's reply to a question of mine was wrong. She stated that the previous Conservative Government had used the same methodology. On 2 May, I interrupted the Financial Secretary to point out that inflation indexation for allowances and pensions and for duty had diverged due to the four increases in three years. Self-evidently, there was no need to change the inflation adjuster to allowances from historic to forward, as there was no additional increase in such allowances in July 1997. As has been made clear, the Budget of the Conservative Government in November 1996 used the same inflation index to increase allowances and duties.
<P>
The forecast figure in March 1998 for the year to September 1998 was 3.25 per cent., but the actual figure was 3.2 per cent. Last year, the forecast figure was 1.25 per cent. and the actual figure turned out to be only 1.1 per cent. For two years running, Government forecasts of inflation have proven higher than the actual figures. The Financial Secretary has not explained to me precisely how the Government arrived at their forecast figure of 3.41 per cent. Regrettably, it is clear that the Government assume either an increase in interest rates such that mortgage interest rates will be more than 8 per cent. by September, or that the figure will be substantially greater than the actual rate of inflation during the period.
<P>
The increase in hydrocarbon oil duties in the Bill brings the total monetary increase since the Government came to power to 32.5 per cent. The Government will say that at least some of that allowed for inflation and the real increase was somewhat less. Many people in this country, including millions still forced to buy annuities when they retire, do not receive monetary increases in their income. Many people's incomes do not rise by the rate of inflation. It is glib to assume that increases in taxes that are in line with inflation do not matter because they merely keep the revenue at the same real level. That is not how many citizens perceive them. The Financial Secretary was wrong to say that the increase in duty last year was only 1.25 per cent. The increase in duty on fuel was 7.3 per cent. on average.
<P>
As the Committee will be aware, some £36 billion a year is levied from fuel duty, even before the proposed increases. Although duty represents 80 per cent. of the price of fuel, only about 18.75 per cent. of revenue raised from fuel is spent on roads and transport. Last November, the Chancellor promised that any future increases in duty would be ring-fenced for transport expenditure. However, either another statistical freak is involved or that fact has conveniently been forgotten. Although the duty increases proposed in clause 4 should net some £715 million in the coming year, the extra expenditure proposed for roads and transport is only some £280 million.
<P>
The proposed increases and cumulative increases, especially those resulting from increases in the accelerator, will fall hardest on pensioners and rural communities, two groups for which the Government have made clear that they have little sympathy, perhaps because of the Government's research on such groups' voting patterns. Most seriously, despite high taxation on fuel, there is a serious lack of spending on transport and a serious failure to meet commitments. There is a backlog of some £5 billion on road maintenance, 500 bypasses are outstanding, and 3,200 miles of major roads need urgent repair.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I must respond to the hon. Gentleman's despicable remarks about the Government's intentions in relation to how people vote. Pensioners have received £6.5 billion of additional support as a result of policy changes and the extra money that has been made available to them during this Parliament. In addition, we are focusing much of our work on issues such as poverty alleviation. It is well known that some members of such groups seldom go out and vote, let alone go out and vote Labour. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his remark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Economic Secretary will be aware, one of the Government's first measures was to tax pension funds by an extra £5 billion a year, the cumulative effects of which on pensioners have been enormously greater than any of the Government's other measures. I suggest that she consult the pension industry's views not on the Government's proposals for stakeholders but on many of the Government's policies towards pensioners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> No, I will not.
<P>
A general point about the further increase in hydrocarbon duties is that UK citizens have the worst road congestion in western Europe. They pay the most fuel tax and the most for their cars. They are the most likely to have their cars stolen and not to be able to find satisfactory public transport alternatives. A key criticism of the Government's actions in relation to hydrocarbon oil duties both under clause 4 and previously is that they have not been matched by an effective policy for adequate road building and maintenance or on public transport.
<P>
What lies behind the Government's policies in relation to the increases in diesel duties? Broadly, the proposed duty on diesel—48.82p—will, as I understand it, be the same as the duty on unleaded petrol. Does that make the point, implicitly, that the Government see little plus or minus between unleaded and diesel in terms of environmental impact? Does that mean that the Government regard the lower carbon emission of diesel as of no significance? There seems to be a difference in policy between the United Kingdom and other European Union members on the merits of encouraging or discouraging diesel. Certainly, there has been success in switching over to the new low-sulphur diesel. However, the current rates of duty are neutral.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that a future Conservative Government will reduce the rate on diesel, or will they increase the rate on carbon fuel?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I asked the Minister what the Government's policy was. The hon. Gentleman's party is in power at the moment, and I asked a genuine and straightforward question about the environmental policy that lies behind the equal amounts of duty on the two fuels.
<P>
As Committee members will be aware, the main problem in connection with current levels of duty in this country is their impact on the haulage industry, in which many jobs have been lost. That industry represents 422,000 goods vehicles and 112,000 operating licensees. As the Minister will be aware, the industry commissioned the Centre for Economics and Business Research Ltd. to model the economic impact of levels of duty—in terms of the effect on revenues—prior to the increases. Broadly, that modelling found that two thirds of the revenue received from current levels of duty was offset by revenue lost. The main items were £1.2 billion lost in cabotage by foreign hauliers, £800 million as a result of job losses, and £130 million as a result of UK hauliers losing business. I am not arguing that there are already diminishing returns from current levels of diesel duty as, even on that modelling, there is a positive tax take of £1.14 billion. What is the Government's view of that study, and of the extent to which revenue is lost from other sources as a result of the extremely uncompetitive diesel rates that the industry must pay in this country? In 1990, the differential in terms of average EU diesel prices was 4.1p. As the Committee will be aware, that has increased to 31.6p.
<P>
The key objection to the increases relates to our earlier debate. If the argument is that the Government have stopped the escalator, increases will simply be confined to the rate of inflation. The estimate of the rate of inflation is likely to be significantly higher than the outturn unless, given the horrific figures that are implied for mortgage interest rates, there are no refunds if the outturn is lower than the forecast. Given the 30-odd per cent. increase in money terms, the difficulties of the haulage industry and the costs that have to be borne, especially by older members of society and those who live in rural communities, there is a case for a more modest increase in fuel duties this year. Our key criticism, however, is the unknown and somewhat bogus inflation figure on which the increases are based.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is as well for me to advise the Committee that, in line with the usual practice, the Room will be locked between now and this afternoon's sitting, so papers may be left as they currently lie. I should also advise the Committee that it would be proper for right hon. and hon. Members to obtain the consent of my co-Chairman, Dr. Clark, who will be in charge of proceedings this afternoon, before divesting themselves of their outer and upper garments.
