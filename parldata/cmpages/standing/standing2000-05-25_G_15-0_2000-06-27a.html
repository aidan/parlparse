<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call Dr. Brand, I should point out that all Committee members have now been issued with a copy of section 87 of the Children Act 1989, as amended. The matter was raised during this morning's sitting, and I presume that everything is now in order.
<H4><center>Clause 68</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendment of Children Act 1989</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 286, in page 35, line 45, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) give any other information which the registration authority reasonably requires the applicant to give.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I think that I was in mid-sentence, comparing the Office for Standards in Education to the Spanish Inquisition, or something similar.
<P>
I am still uneasy about the amendment. The regulations should be transparent, consistent and, above all, national. I can foresee no circumstance in which the Minister could not define what is reasonable when setting out regulations—
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of state for Education and Employment (Ms Margaret Hodge):</B> It might help the hon. Gentleman if I give an example. I reiterate that we will have national regulations, and they will be consistent and transparent. There may be circumstances where Ofsted will require further information, simply to ensure the safety and well-being of the child in question. For example, there could be a little box at the end of the form, in which an applicant could provide any other relevant information. The applicant could write, ``I have a pond in my garden'', and the registration officer might then want to ask, ``How deep is it?'' It is such circumstances that we are considering, where a national regulatory framework might not necessarily extract detail that is potentially relevant to a child's safety and well-being. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that the inclusion of reasonableness will ensure that there is not too much intervention in people's personal lives.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's intervention. I am amazed; there should surely be a section on the hazards that children might encounter while being looked after. Issues such as a garden pond, which is a major cause of child death, should not be left to applicants to declare.
<P>
I am not happy. I know that the Minister has tried hard to find a circumstance that should not be included under other declarations that one might care to make, but the provision is far too wide to include in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I can report from personal experience that a health visitor measures not only the depth of the pond but the width of the squares of the steel grill that is placed over it. The test is conducted according to an adult's ability to walk across the grill, so in practical terms, there are health visitor safeguards.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I rise so that the Minister can respond to that point.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> To respond to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), that is a typical issue about which individual inspectors might wish to satisfy themselves, and which will not be prescribed in any regulatory form.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Individual interviews should not determine what is and is not safe, and what steps are being taken to ensure that we do not fall into our garden ponds. Such matters should be covered in broad terms in the regulations. The Minister has not persuaded me, but we shall see what else she has to say.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> In the interests of progress, I shall not repeat the arguments which I thought I made persuasively this morning.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 287, in page 36, line 3, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where the registration authority has sent the applicant notice under section 79L(1) of its intention to refuse an application under this section, the application may not be withdrawn without the consent of the authority.
<P>
( ) A person who, in an application under this section, knowingly makes a statement which is false or misleading in a material particular shall be guilty of an offence and liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment inserts two new subsections into proposed new section 79E, which deals with applications for registration of child care providers. The first subsection deals with people who, were they able to withdraw an application unilaterally, might try to disguise the fact that they were considered unsuitable to be registered providers. The provision is linked to paragraph 4 of new schedule 9A to the Children Act 1989, which is being inserted by schedule 2 of the Bill. Paragraph 4 of the new schedule provides the power to make regulations automatically to disqualify certain people from being registered as child care providers.
<P>
Included in the list of people whom the regulations may cover are those who have never been refused registration under part X or, in future, part XA of the Children Act. It will be important for the registration authority's records to show the true reason why an application was not granted should the person ever reapply for registration. When the refusal is for a reason that will have no bearing on a future application, the registration authority may agree to the applicant withdrawing the application.
<P>
I should make it clear that refusal of an application will not necessarily mean that the person concerned is automatically barred for all time from being a registered provider. The precise reason for the refusal will be the key factor in determining any future application. That will need to be shown clearly on the registration authority's records. For example, an applicant who is refused registration because her premises are unsuitable for child care, could become registered if a further application was made in respect of other or improved premises.
<P>
The effect of the second subsection of the amendment is clear, as are our reasons for proposing it. Child care is an important and sensitive issue and deliberate attempts to undermine the protection that a regulatory system provides for children should not go unpunished. Therefore, in line with other provisions in this part of the Bill, the offence would attract a fine of up to £5,000.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I have no wish to detain the Committee unduly on this amendment, which closes an important loophole. The Minister gave an important example and I am pleased that someone who is ruled out because premises are unsuitable should have the opportunity to be ruled in if that changes. However, is she aware that, at the moment, if child minders want to become registered and the suitability of their premises causes delay, that delay may be as long as eight months, during which the child minder might have moved to different and more suitable premises. I am sure that the Minister agrees that eight months is a long time for a child minder to do without an income stream from her chosen profession.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I completely concur with the hon. Lady's point. There are problems with the registration of child minders and long delays in some local authorities. I hope that the introduction of a national standard and a national regulation and registration service will improve that. We cannot afford to lose those services and child minders cannot afford to lose their income.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> We welcome the amendments, but will there be a mechanism for informal discussion with the registration authority so that people do not reach the point of making formal applications only for them to be turned down, but instead have a clear idea of what is required of them?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I hope that that point will be covered in a later amendment in which we specifically give Ofsted the power to engage in the training of people before they become providers. That will form part of the pre-registration training
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 401, in page 36, line 7, leave out `, and will continue to be,'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 403, in page 36, line 16, leave out `, and will continue to be,'.
<P>
No. 404, in page 36, line 45, leave out `or will cease'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> There is no need to detain the Committee unduly with these amendments, which are designed to draw attention to a situation that could, in our view, become absurd.
<P>
There is so much subjectivity in the refusal of registration on the basis of someone's judgment of whether the applicant will continue to be qualified for registration.The clause is too arbitrary and would be improved by the removal of the phrases specified in the amendments. We have had a debate on how well anyone can judge whether someone should continue to be registered, and I do not wish to rehash it. The clause is not workable: it is too arbitrary.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We cannot support the amendment. I shall give the hon. Lady an example of the kind of extreme situation that could arise if the amendment were accepted, in the hope that she will withdraw it.
<P>
In my extreme example, a child minder or day care provider might know that her husband was about to be released from prison, having served a sentence for child molesting, and would be returning to live with her. Her application could not be refused immediately; the only action that could be taken would be the cancellation of the registration when he came out of prison. Elsewhere in the Bill, there is a statutory obligation to give 14 days' notice. In this case, if the husband were due to return home in less than 14 days, the provider would be registered for a period, even though she was not qualified, and the children would be at risk. I accept that that is an extreme example and that there is the question of someone's right to act while they are qualified, but it would be a waste of time and resources to register someone, knowing that they would not be qualified in the near future and that children would be at risk.
<P>
Similarly, in the case of the cancellation of registration, if we had to wait until such times as someone had ceased to be qualified, there would be a gap before she could be notified. During that gap the provider would be practising after she should have ceased to do so. It is because of such extreme instances that we feel that the clause should not be amended.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The extreme example rather presents the matter in black and white. I am sure that members of the Committee do not want to see children put at risk from child molesters.
<P>
In life, however, people's circumstances can change at incredibly short notice and they can say, hand on heart, that they had no idea in advance. A child minder who had been separated from her husband for some time could find that the gentleman had come out of prison and presented himself on the doorstep. She might have had no forewarning. I accept that there might be extreme cases in which children need additional protection, but situations will arise in which the child minder has, in good faith, no inkling that her life is about to be turned upside down. However, in the interests of child protection, albeit in an extreme situation, I can see that we would be well advised, politically, to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 405, in page 37, line 23, leave out `may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 406, in page 37, line 23, leave out `for'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The Bill attempts to legislate for a wide category of professionals and registered, qualified people working with children and vulnerable adults. Previous clauses have incorporated statutory rights of appeal for such registered and qualified people. There is no reason why child minders—another category of professionals working with vulnerable children—should be denied that right of appeal.
<P>
I know that Parliament debates endlessly the importance of ``mays'' versus ``shalls'', but we feel strongly that the Bill should be consistent. We have argued for consistency again and again. Unfortunately, as the Committee's proceedings have progressed, we have uncovered more and more examples of a lack of consistency, the most glaring of which is the willingness to regulate for private, but not public, health care establishments. Leaving that inconsistency aside, this right of appeal is important. That is why we are seeking to change the wording of the Bill so that there has to be a right of appeal for those against whom a decision has fallen.
<P>
Interestingly, amendment No. 406 would appear, as it stands, to be a dilution. The regulations make provision for conferring the right of appeal. There seems to be an inconsistency in the Bill. It is most important to establish the right of appeal for child minders, and I shall be interested to hear why that should remain optional, as the Bill proposes.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I hope that the hon. Lady will be pleased to hear that we accept her point in principle. I understand that the wording in the amendment would not be consistent with other provisions in the Bill, but I hope that she will accept our intent to give that right. We shall return with the appropriate wording on Report, and I ask her to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> That is a piece of good news, and we look forward to seeing the wording that the Government will introduce on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 291, in page 37, line 28, leave out `Chief Inspector' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`registration authority'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This minor amendment will allow parallel powers to those in use in England to be extended to the National Assembly. Proposed new section 79J(1) already provides for the requirement that a registered child minder or day care provider must give written notice of their resignation of registration to the chief inspector in England. The amendment will provide for a similar arrangement to apply in Wales, where the Assembly is the registration authority. It is appropriate that this requirement should apply equally in Wales and England, and I hope that hon. Members will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We are a little concerned about the role of the chief inspector of Ofsted in this matter. I have written a note to myself, saying that this is taking the necessity to give notice right up to the level of the big white chief. Surely it would be possible to do this at a local level, as we are dealing with a diaspora of child minders. Could not the matter be successfully devolved, as the hon. Member is an expert on devolution?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The amendment simply ensures that comparative powers exist in England and Wales. It will give the powers to the chief inspector in England and to the registration authority in Wales. Obviously, such decisions will be taken at a local level. The current draft refers only to England. The amendment will ensure that the registration authority, which in England is the chief inspector and in Wales is the Assembly, will deal with that matter at a local level.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 407, in page 38, line 9, leave out `An' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`A copy of an'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 408, in page 38, line 9, leave out `may be made without notice' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`together with any written statement of the authority's reasons for making application for the order, shall be served by the authority on the person registered as soon as it is practicable for the authority to do so'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I apologise to Committee members for not having been here earlier this afternoon.
<P>
The amendment states that when the registration authority proposes to make an application for action against a registered person, that person should be given such notice as is practicable. Proposed new section 79K(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An application may be made . . . without notice<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand the thinking that lies behind that proposal. The Government, or the draftsmen, were seeking to avoid delaying an application by the need to give notice.
<P>
Amendment No. 408 would require the authority to serve notice
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>together with any written statement of the authority's reasons for making the application . . . as soon as it is practicable to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The requirement should not halt or impede the process, and a registered person should not be able to use it to undermine the process. It would ensure that a notice was served on the relevant registered individual at the earliest practicable moment.
<P>
So far during our consideration of the Bill, I have not been able to use the word ``Kafkaesque''—it is a favourite word of mine, especially in relation to the drafting of legislation. However, it is slightly Kafkaesque to suggest that someone will be subjected to a process that involves a legal element without knowing that that process is under way. People are entitled to know that such a process is under way. The proposal would considerably improve rather than undermine the purpose of this part of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on it.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am afraid that I cannot be as helpful in relation to these amendments as I was with the previous group. The situation may seem Kafkaesque to the hon. Gentleman, but the protection and safety of children are paramount. If that requires strong intervention on occasion by the state when there is a risk of abuse, that is perfectly justified.
<P>
To allay some of the hon. Gentleman's fears, the Bill states that when an order is served on the registered person, it should be accompanied by a copy of a written statement that describes the reasons for making the application for an order. The amendment would affect the timing of the process—its intent appears to be that a copy of the application, not of the order, should be served on the provider who is being taken to court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand that a proper judicial process involves a big gap between being told after the decision of the court has been made that it has made that decision and being informed before the court has considered the application. That is the essential point in trying to avoid the Kafka trap.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> In such instances, the order will have an immediate impact on the provider's ability to care for a child, and therefore little time will be lost between making and serving it. I can see my advisers nodding sagely. Having said that, I agree with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that the courts often take some time to implement decisions that they have made.
<P>
As I understand it, the amendment concerns the application. In our view, it is important to retain the power in section 75 of the Children Act to make an application to the court in an emergency without giving notice. In the case of an emergency application made without notice, the order would be made before a copy of the application could be served.
<P>
I am afraid that it is therefore inappropriate to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not necessarily disagree with anything that the Minister has said, but I do not think that her argument is incompatible with the amendment. If an application was made in an emergency and the order was made immediately afterwards, the effect of the amendment might be very small, because the earliest time at which it was practicable for the authority to serve notice of the application on the registered person could be the same time at which it served notice of the order having been made on the registered person.
<P>
In the emergency, extreme situation that the Minister used as an example, the amendment might not have much practical effect. However, it is a matter of principle that where an application to a court is made in respect of a person, and that person's livelihood, they have a right to know about it if at all possible. I would not disagree with what the Minister said about the need for reserve powers to deal with the risk of immediate abuse. However, I deliberately used the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as soon as it is practicable for the authority to do so<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to avoid falling into the trap that would have allowed the Minister legitimately to demolish my amendment.
<P>
We are talking about a process that may lead to a person losing their livelihood. In this era of the Human Rights Act 1998 and similar legislation, it should be argued on the basis of natural justice that someone who is to be the subject of consideration under a legal process must, if possible, be made aware of that process. The amendment would not require that to happen as a pre-condition for the occurrence of the legal process, but would simply require it to happen at the earliest practicable opportunity.
<P>
I am extremely disappointed that the Minister has been unable to accept the amendment—or at least its underlying principle—because it was carefully framed to address legitimate concerns. I hope that she will think about whether we really want to live in a country where people find, after the event, that they have been the subject of a court process of which they were unaware, the end result of which is to deprive them of their livelihood. Is she confident that that fits with the spirit—perhaps even the letter—of the human rights legislation that we now have in this country?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Without wishing to delay the Committee, I reiterate that we are talking about the human rights of children, and their safety and protection. The provisions are specifically designed to deal with emergencies, and it is therefore inappropriate to suggest such a delay. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is looking puzzled. However, I have re-read the advice, and it is clear that the clause is specifically intended to cover emergency provisions, which presumably would be required in a case of abuse. I believe, reluctantly, that it would be inappropriate to accept the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister used the term ``delay.'' I understand that she would not want any delay to be introduced into the process, but my amendment would not do so. It would not require service of the application on the individual before the court process took place.
<P>
It is obvious that the Minister is not minded to give any favourable response to the amendment. I may have to consider the way in which it is worded, but I take a little comfort from the fact that she does not appear to rule out the principle. I am glad that we have not moved so far as to rule out the principle that people should be aware that they are the subject of a legal process.
<P>
In a reversal of the usual roles, I might write to the Minister and try to set out my case more lucidly. I may persuade her to look more benignly on my argument if I take the time and trouble to express myself more clearly and precisely and address the concerns that she has raised. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 409, in page 38, line 14, after `person', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and on the local authority in whose area the person acted as a child minder or provided day care'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to make subsection (5) of proposed new section 79K reflect the structure of earlier parts of the Bill. Following the making of an order, the registration authority would have to inform not only the person concerned, but the relevant local authority—the authority in whose area the person was situated. There are sound and obvious reasons for making the local authority aware that someone has been removed from the register and ordered to cease his practice as a child minder. The amendment is innocuous and helpful. It draws its inspiration from the Government's wording in earlier parts of the Bill, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The amendment is interesting. Does not the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge accept that it might be as appropriate to inform the National Care Standards Commission, or its local representative, as the local authority?
<P>
What relationship does the Minister envisage between the Ofsted set-up and the National Care Standards Commission in any one locality? I am sure that, like me, she would not want people who are unsuitable for one activity with children or young people to be debarred under one register, but slip in on another. Will there be joint working between Ofsted and the commission?
<P>
Will it be made explicit when people apply to go on a register or are taken off one that information gained may be shared with other relevant authorities?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> To answer the last point, the Government envisage Ofsted developing its functions with a strong national, regional and local network. The system will work only if Ofsted operates in that way. We are in discussions with Ofsted, and it is considering how best to develop a local presence. A key issue will be the relationship with other authorities, other interested parties, relevant public authorities and so on, so I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman comfort on that point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Can the Minister also assure me that it will be made explicit to people who apply to go on a register that their information will be shared with other organisations? Information might be personal, and Ofsted may ask any other questions that it wants to ask, so will she produce regulations to make it clear how far the information can be disseminated?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I believe that it would be inappropriate to share information about applicants. Although the Criminal Records Bureau is establishing a common register, which will be available to all interested authorities, it seems inappropriate for information to be shared from the point of application.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> There is no question over someone being on the national register for having a criminal conviction. The courts and Parliament have decided that that register shall exist, and there is no question of opting in or out.
<P>
I suggest that people who apply to go on an Ofsted register or the National Care Standards Commission register should be informed before applying about the extent to which information that becomes available as a result of that registration will be shared. I hope that the Minister will give that some thought and perhaps tell the Committee later, or tell the House on Third Reading, what the Government intend to do.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I can certainly assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall give the issue some thought. I can see some dangers in allowing application information to be shared and, given that proviso, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I am happy to accept in principle the objective behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment and allow us to return on Report with more consistent and appropriate wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the principle behind the amendment and I look forward to seeing her draft in due course. I thought that I had lifted the wording as nearly as possible from the Bill, which is always the safest way of trying to avoid being shot down on technical grounds, but I accept that further refinement may be needed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 292, in page 38, line 44, leave out `in person or by' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`orally or in writing, by the recipient of the notice or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 293.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Both amendments relate to proposed new section 79L and make administrative improvements to the regulatory process. Section 79L obliges the registration authority to give a registered provider or applicant for registration advance notice of its intention to take certain steps, such as varying the conditions of registration or refusing an application. Subsection (3) gives the person receiving such a notification the right to object to the proposed step, and subsection (4) says that the objection may be made in person or by a representative. Both those subsections were taken from part X of the Children Act.
<P>
Requiring an aggrieved provider or applicant to appear in person at the registration authority's offices to object is an unnecessary restriction. In addition, it is likely to put an unnecessary burden on the registration authority. Amendment No. 292 will therefore allow objections to be made in writing. That gives the provider or the applicant an alternative means of pursuing the case. In many instances, that will be the most practical way for the regulatory authority and the provider or applicant to handle an objection.
<P>
Amendment No. 293 relates to proposed new section 79L(6), which prevents the regulatory authority from taking certain steps until the time limit for appealing against the taking of a step has expired, or, if the provider has appealed, until the outcome has been determined. That provision was also taken from part X of the Children Act.
<P>
The amendment simplifies the process by allowing the regulatory authority to proceed more swiftly if the provider indicates in writing that she will not exercise her right of appeal against the decision to take the proposed action.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> For us, on the long marathon of this Bill, the amendments are another example of inconsistency. At a previous stage of the Bill when we were talking about a registered care home being informed that it was likely not to be registered, we argued for representations to be made in writing or in person, but that was rejected. Yet it seems to be acceptable for child minders to make representations orally or in writing. We understand that that might be extremely helpful for a child minder.
<P>
The Minister referred to the exceptional circumstance where a child minder's partner or ex-partner leaving prison with a record for child molestation. There would be legitimate reasons for deregistration if the person in question came to live with her and had regular contact with children, thus placing them at risk. The child minder could be very embarrassed about having to make representations in person and it might be easier, in those delicate domestic circumstances, for her to make representations in writing. We should strive for consistency and it is difficult to understand why a child minder should have such a choice when it is denied to other agencies.
<P>
I want to ask the Minister a simple question. The Bill is complicated and this is a particularly long and extended clause with many amendments; I have also combed through the explanatory notes. How long does someone have to make an appeal? I could not see where that was defined and it is an important practical point.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am looking for advice on that. My feeling is that it is three weeks, but I will come back to the hon. Lady on that. It appears that the Opposition—and therefore, I hope, the Committee as a whole—accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Clause 17 proposes only a right to make written representations. For consistency, should it also include the right to make written or oral representations, as in clause 68?

<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> As I said to the hon. Gentleman, clause 17 deals with social care for vulnerable people who are often ill or have learning difficulties and other impairments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> May I finish? This clause deals with day care, and as the two groups are different a judgment has to be made about appropriate regulatory requirements for those providing care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> With the greatest respect, it has nothing to do with the groups who are being cared for. It deals with those who are registered and have to make representations in their defence. Under clause 17 they have to make them in writing; they are denied any right of audience in person. Under clause 68, the Minister argues that, for various reasons, they should have the option of making representations in writing or orally. That is not consistent, and the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) on clause 17 was that there is a right of oral representation in the appeal process to the tribunal. As that is also the case in the sector under consideration, I cannot see how consistency has been applied throughout the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Having heard that, I have refreshed my memory by looking at clause 17, with which I am so familiar, and I see that consistency is provided by the facility for applicants to submit in writing further evidence in relation to child care. To that extent, there is consistency. The inconsistency comes from the tradition in the child care world, where previously representations were made only in person. For ease, that has been carried forward.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden asked about time limits for appeals, which will be specified in regulations. That is why I could not recall them and she could not find them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made, No. 293, in page 39, line 6, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Subsection (6) does not prevent a step from taking effect before the expiry of the time within which an appeal may be brought under section 79M if the person concerned notifies the registration authority in writing that he does not intend to appeal.'.—[Ms Hodge.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 410, in page 39, line 16, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) where the Tribunal considers the decision to have been wrong and the person concerned to have suffered loss as a result, order the authority to pay a specified sum of compensation to the person concerned'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would introduce to the list of remedies available to the tribunal, compensation for the registered person where the action of the registration authority had been wrongful and where that person had suffered loss as a result.
<P>
To repeat a familiar refrain, I am not a lawyer, but I imagine that there is a general remedy in law for a person where a tribunal finds that they have had a decision wrongfully made against them and they have suffered loss. But that would involve them in a considerable new excursion through the courts in seeking to be compensated. I want to add to the Bill a power for the tribunal to order the payment of compensation where a person has suffered loss after it has found that the authority acted wrongly. It would apply only where the person concerned could demonstrate that they had suffered loss. That would be reasonable and it accords with my intuitive sense of the way in which justice should work.
<P>
To be told by a tribunal, ``The authority was wrong. We will overturn its decision and cancel the cancellation of registration. Thank you, very much and goodbye,'' fails to reflect the serious damage that might have been inflicted on a business and livelihood, not simply through direct loss of earnings, but also through damage to its reputation, which inevitably will have an impact on its ability to resume business after the tribunal hearing. Will the Minister consider that reasonable additional remedy in the hands of the tribunal?
<P>
It might also be convenient for the Minister to answer another question about the tribunal while we are dealing with proposed new section 79M. There is a reference to ``the tribunal''. That term is defined in clause 100 as the tribunal established under the Health Act 1999. However, clause 68 inserts a series of additional sections into the Children Act 1989. I have it in mind that the tribunal to which the Minister refers in this drafting is that established under the latter Act, rather than the Health Act. Before I go any further, will the Minister tell the Committee exactly which tribunal she has in mind?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The tribunal will be the one established under the Protection of Children Act 1999. I am not a lawyer either, but I am well advised by those who are. The hon. Gentleman proposes that someone who suffers loss as the result of a wrongful decision should have access to compensation. Detailed powers, such as the ability to award costs, are normally covered in secondary legislation. Section 9 of the Protection of Children Act 1999 enables regulations to be made to include provision for the award of costs and expenses. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman watches those regulations with care. I hope that he accepts that we intend to meet his concerns in that way and will therefore withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am still slightly confused about the tribunals, but I understand now that it is that established under the Protection of Children Act 1999 which is referred to here. I am trying to cross-reference that to earlier references to ``the tribunal'' in the Bill, but I will do so in a quiet moment and see if I can make it work in my own mind.
<P>
As far as the question of compensation is concerned, I understand what the Minister says. I may not have been listening attentively enough, but I did not hear her give the commitment that the regulations would specifically make provision for the tribunal to be able to order compensation to be paid to an individual where the registration authority had got it wrong. Is she able to give the Committee an assurance that regulations will include such a provision?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The assurance I can give—since this will be a matter for other Ministers and other Departments—is that I will place it before those responsible for establishing the regulations. In principle, I can see no objection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful, but slightly mystified. I assumed that this was an opportunity to address the Minister with the appropriate departmental responsibility for this part of the Bill. That may be too simple.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for offering to pass on the concerns that have been expressed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 411, in page 39, line 29, leave out from `State' to second `on' in line 30.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 413, in page 39, line 31, after `provision', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in general'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> These two amendments are of a probing nature. We are seeking to establish how the Government see the role of the chief inspector in subsection (3) of proposed new section 79N as adviser to the Secretary of State. The chief inspector ought to be able to advise the Secretary of State in general on the provision of child minding, but not on specific cases. That would be both inappropriate and unnecessary and I am not sure what the Secretary of State would do with advice on specific cases. What is needed is an overview and executive summary of what is going on out there in the real world. The clause rightly identifies the chief inspector as being the person who will be in the best position to provide that.
<P>
The amendments seek to make it clear that the advice of the chief inspector should be based on a strategic overview function. The advice should relate in general to child minding, reviewing the supply and quality of provision in aggregate and advising the Secretary of State accordingly and not confusing that role with anything that might be suggested by the words the amendment would delete from subsection (3), namely
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>advice . . . either generally or in relation to provision by particular persons or on particular premises<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That function would be inappropriate for the strategic role I envisage for the chief inspector.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I hope that once the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has heard my explanation of why we wish to see this maintained within the Bill, he will withdraw the amendment. We expect the chief inspector to provide state-of-the-nation, general reports on child care matters and we shall be discussing that in later Government amendments. However, we do not want to rule out the ability of the chief inspector to provide advice on particular cases. I will give the Committee two examples of where that might be appropriate.
<P>
The Secretary of State may want to consider a new initiative or pursue a particular issue. It is often appropriate in those circumstances to use specific examples to illustrate an area of concern and we would not want to rule out the facility to do so. Secondly, there may be controversy relating to a particular provider where the Secretary of State has specific powers and an interest. In those circumstances he may need to seek the advice of the chief inspector on an individual provider or setting. Again, we would not wish to see that capacity ruled out in the Bill.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members will accept that it is not unreasonable to give the chief inspector the ability to provide advice in circumstances such as those I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Indeed, and the amendment would not prevent that. The Minister gave the example of the Secretary of State seeking the advice of the chief inspector. Subsection (2) of proposed new section 79N clearly gives the Secretary of State the ability to ask the chief inspector for advice or information on any matters, including specific ones. That is the reason why we did not attack the ability in that paragraph to deal with particular issues. Only in relation to subsection (3) have we sought to make it absolutely clear that unsolicited advice from the chief inspector should be of a general and strategic nature.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve McCabe (Birmingham, Hall Green):</B> It occurs to me that there may be instances where a practice may develop in an area—perhaps associated with a group of child minder—when that information would not necessarily be automatically available to the Secretary of State. It may be of such significance that the inspector feels that it is worthwhile drawing it to the attention of the Secretary of State.
<P>
As an example—although in a different setting—some years ago, when the pin-down policy in Staffordshire was first developed, a similar sort of practice was used in child minding in a particular area. The chief inspector may have good reasons to draw such practices to the attention of the Secretary of State. Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that, in those circumstances, the clause would be of value?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman is getting at a situation where an issue ceases to be particular and becomes of general concern. I am anxious to establish that the role of the chief inspector as a giver of unsolicited advice to the Secretary of State involves taking a strategic overview. In the example that the hon. Gentleman cites, it would be entirely appropriate for the chief inspector to draw the Secretary of State's attention to a particular practice that, in his opinion, required intervention by the Secretary of State, the Government or legislation. However, in doing so it would not be particularly helpful for him to identify the persons or premises where such things were going on. What is important is that he identifies the problem and suggests ways in which it could be remedied.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was seeking to establish that the chief inspector will not report to the Secretary of State on individual incidents, and I am satisfied from the Minister's response that he will not. Such incidents are properly dealt with at the level of the registration authority and should not be referred to the Secretary of State. Ambiguity in subsection (3) about the chief inspector's role detracts from his proper, strategic function as the Secretary of State's eyes and ears, sensing whether something is going wrong that needs to be dealt with through legislation or regulation. The Minister has made it clear that the chief inspector's role is indeed strategic, and I am grateful to her for that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the chief inspector might also be able to identify pockets of poor provision within his sphere of influence? That could have a dramatic effect on, say, people who want to go out to work. There is a lady in my constituency who cannot find child care facilities for her combination of children—it is simply not available. One set of regulations is forcing her to work, but no responsible authority will pick up on that issue. Does the hon. Gentleman think that Ofsted and the chief inspector should approach the Minister in charge of education, who would then speak to the Minister in charge of benefits, who in turn would talk to the local authority; or should we encourage more direct routes locally?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> To my mind, that example would fall clearly on the strategic side of the equation. A geographically defined problem would be worthy of note and, because it would need to be addressed at a strategic level, relevant information should be passed to the Secretary of State. That is not the same as reporting to the Secretary of State on provision by particular persons or on particular premises. I have visions of the Secretary of State's desk groaning under mountains of reports, containing statements such as, ``Mrs. Bloggs of 49, Acacia avenue has a rusty slide that she allows the children to play on.'' Clearly, that is not the sort of information that we want the chief inspector to send to the Secretary of State.
<P>
The Minister has made it clear that her understanding of the way in which the provision will work is exactly the same as mine, so I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 414, in page 39, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The Chief Inspector shall report within one year of the coming into force of this Part on the impact of this Part on supply of child minding and day care services in England'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 415, in page 39, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3B) A copy of any advice, information or report given or provided by the Chief Inspector under subsections (2), (3) and (3A) above shall be placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> These amendments follow closely the previous ones, which dealt with the reporting process, but they approach the matter from a slightly different angle. They would require reports to assess this part of the Bill's impact on the supply of child minding and day care services. That is an important issue, and the Minister is well aware of the problems that prevail in the provision of child minding. I spent a substantial part of last Saturday at the regional annual general meeting of the National Childminding Association Those experienced child minders impressed on me the problems that affect the supply of that service. For those Committee members who are not familiar with the current problem, there is an alarming rate of attrition among established child minders, who have been in practice for a long time. Astonishingly, the average service in years among the child minders whom I met on Saturday was in double figures. They and their colleagues felt deterred by what they regard as poaching by day nursery facilities, and by the way in which parents—certainly, first-time parents—have the false impression that unless they take up a day nursery place, especially when it is attached to a state primary school, they might jeopardise their child's place in reception. Until the blossoming of the state nursery sector, child minders had successfully and informally filled that early child care gap.
<P>
In the interests of the overall provision of places and to help with the supply of child minding and day care places, I cannot emphasise how important it is for the chief inspector to examine closely the Bill's application shortly after its enactment. I am worried about the number of experienced child minders who are being lost. They feel deterred and disadvantaged by the fact that significant assistance is given to new child minders. I am sure that the Government do not support a reduction in the number of child minding and day care places.
<P>
The requirement on the chief inspector to report within one year is associated with the requirement in amendment No. 415 that a copy of such information should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Opposition Members are keen for such a report to be produced—we have spent many hours trying to help the Government to get right their legislation.
<P>
The big strategic questions about child care provision can be unwittingly affected by developments outside child minding, such as the state provision of nurseries. Such factors should be taken into account when the overall supply of child minding places is examined, which will be within a year of the Bill's enactment
<P>
The present situation in child minding is difficult—we are not legislating for an area of which it might be said that all is rosy in the garden. I am sure that the Minister has been lobbied by the National Childminding Association about child minders' difficulties. We referred in earlier debates to some of those difficulties, including delays in registration and the fact that although grants are available for setting up a service, the cost of registration may consume all of the grants. Several deterrents affect the overall supply of child minding facilities. That should an important part of the report that the chief inspector will produce—supply should be closely examined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw (Chatham and Aylesford):</B> One function that Parliament will want to scrutinise if the inspector produces a report, which may be on child care or a wider subject, will be the liaison between the staff who currently work for Ofsted and those who work for other agencies. Liaison with other professionals—social workers, health visitors and teachers—is very important. One of the lessons that we have learned from numerous reports is that agencies need to work closely together.
<P>
A system that has been established as good practice in many social services departments over the years involves the use of multi-disciplinary teams. Teams containing different disciplines can gain a broad knowledge of what is happening in particular localities. Similarly, we should not diminish the importance of the informal networks that are set up. When I was a social worker, the under-eights team was just along the corridor from me. That team inspected and registered child minders. It was useful to have a relationship with that team. If one was working with a particular family, one could ask the under-eights officer who would be a good resource to help to get that family through a particular period.
<P>
Furthermore, when allegations of child abuse were made, the under-eights workers often had a good knowledge of what was happening on the ground in a particular community. If they did not know, they might say that a health visitor had been visiting the family in question. We should not ignore the benefits of those informal working relationships.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> May I deduce from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that he does not support the transfer of this function from local authorities to Ofsted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I understand the Government's desire to link education and day care. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. However, I am seeking assurances from my hon. Friend the Minister on the points that I am making, so perhaps I shall no longer have those concerns after she has responded.
<P>
Will the Minister tell me whether staff will be working at home in isolation? If so, that would be detrimental. We do not want crucial staff working from home. Will they have short-term contracts? Can she give an assurance that TUPE will apply to such staff? They build up a level of expertise, and often stay in their posts far longer than other professionals working in the field. We must safeguard that expertise and those working relationships. We must not isolate those individuals in such a way that the children for whom we are trying to promote better services could lose out.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman is developing an interesting line of questioning that had not occurred to me. I wonder whether he would like to ask the Minister whether she envisages Ofsted using the same approach that it uses in inspecting schools, when it sub-contracts work to independent inspectors? Alternatively, will it employ the inspectors directly? It would be informative for the Committee to find out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to clarify whether people will be on short-term contracts or whether they will be transferred from the local authority. As I have said, it is important that we do not lose those vital contacts.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a valuable contribution, and I want him to continue to do so. However, does he agree that the envisaged role for Ofsted in this area is quite different from its role in inspecting schools? The inspection of a school is a one-off event, whereas the work that it is being suggested here for Ofsted should take the form of an on-going relationship with a series of providers in a locality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I agree with that point. Clearly, there is an interface between education and care and that is why Ofsted should be brought in.
<P>
I await my hon. Friend's reply.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I shall deal first with the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw). We wish to ensure that current good practice in regulation, registration and inspection of child care providers is carried over into the work of the new, distinct arm of Ofsted. Much of our work is designed to ensure that the best features are incorporated, as we integrate the inspection and regulation of care with the inspection and regulation of education.
<P>
Liaison at local level with other agencies is part of that good practice. I have already discussed with Ofsted the arrangements that it should put in place to ensure that it is involved in local child protection services and in early years development and child care partnerships. Ofsted is anxious to establish such relationships at local level.
<P>
The advice, support and training functions will remain with local authorities, although the inspectorate will also have a role. The local presence of Ofsted is crucial to the operation of this part of the Bill. Ofsted is considering how that presence can be arranged, and will produce various proposals that we will examine. I imagine that, given modern technology, some inspectors will want to work from home. I would not want to see that option excluded from the arrangements that Ofsted is putting in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): The Minister said this morning—and again this afternoon—that the intention is for Ofsted to have a local presence. Can she be more specific? We heard from the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) that there will be at least 80 offices for the National Care Standards Commission, to allow it to have a local presence. What number is intended for Ofsted? Will there be more or fewer?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Ofsted has yet to take that decision. Ofsted's remit is to ensure that it has the capacity to uphold standards on a national level. There should be a regional and a local presence. Ofsted is currently sorting out what that will mean in practice and is discussing it with 150 child care partnerships. Clearly, different types of local presence will be sensible for different localities.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> May I ask the same question in a slightly different way? Is it intended that the local arm of Ofsted will work closely with the local arm of the registration authority—the National Care Standards Commission? Will the locations be coterminous, to facilitate such joint working?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Where appropriate, there will be joint working and they will co-locate. However, that is the kind of executive matter that Ofsted is currently considering. It has not yet made a decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> Does the Minister envisage taking any steps or giving advice to ensure that an inspector cannot also be a local competitor? In certain circumstances, a day care owner or child minder may find themselves able to inspect other child minders or day care owners in the area. That would represent a clear conflict of interest, and may not be in the interests of the best standards of inspection. What steps will be taken to ensure that it cannot occur?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Clearly, a conflict of interest would be involved if someone provided care in a locality and inspected other providers, with whom they would be competing. I accept my hon. Friend's point in that respect.
<P>
However, in relation to the inspection of nurseries under the nursery education powers, providers in one area become qualified inspectors and then inspect provision in another area. That has good results, because much of the experience of running early years education settings is helpful in ensuring a high quality of inspection. Although I entirely take the point about its being unfair within a locality, I would not wish to rule it out elsewhere.
<P>
On the points that were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford, TUPE will apply in respect of people who will be transferred to the new inspectorate, and Ofsted will directly employ those inspectors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> My hon. Friend said that people would not be denied the opportunity to use technology and work from their own homes. By the same token, will people not be forced to work from their own homes?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I do not think that anyone will be forced to transfer to the new inspectorate, but I do not want to lay down hard and fast rules before Ofsted has considered the matter and devised a solution that properly meets the needs of the service that we are trying to establish. During my early discussions with Ofsted—before it had begun the process of speaking to the 150 partnerships in which it is now engaged—it was suggested that many people who work in local authorities might welcome the opportunity to take advantage of mobile phones and other new technology in order to base themselves at home. They would obviously have access to a regional office so that they could keep in touch and maintain their professional expertise, but would work from home in conducting inspections of settings in their locality.
<P>
I do not want to rule anything in or out at this stage. It is for Ofsted to determine what is most appropriate to ensure an efficient and effective service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister said in her reply to the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford that Ofsted would employ the inspectors directly. Can she confirm that she is ruling out the possibility that Ofsted will contract out part of that work? Proposed new section 79U(5) seems to allow the chief inspector to contract it out to other people who are not registered inspectors if he deems it expedient to do so, yet the assurance that she gave the hon. Gentleman ruled out that possibility.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am certainly not ruling out the possibility that Ofsted will contract out some of the inspection of services, but it intends directly to employ those who are currently working in local authorities. In future, it may become appropriate for it to engage in some contracting out, and we have not ruled that out.
<P>
I turn to the issues that were raised by the hon. Member for Meriden. I agree that we must maintain, and indeed increase, the child minding force in this country. The figures have fallen over the past year. That is partly because we tidied up the registers to provide a more effective information service so that people who had been on registers for years but had never provided child minding were taken off. There are undoubtedly other reasons why people are coming out of child minding. That is serious, but some of the reasons are good—for example, people are finding other careers after child minding and engaging in new training and educational opportunities. Others see child minding as a long-term career and we value and want to enhance that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the Minister acknowledge that one of those reasons could be anticipation of greater regulation and more bureaucratic control?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I certainly acknowledge that there is fear of change and that is always the case. We are doing all we can to assure those who are currently child minders or who are considering becoming child minders that they need not be fearful. We are making a radical shift in the way in which we regulate and register child minding and any shift is bound to create some fear. I hope that the Opposition will support us in our intent to allay people's fear as we develop the regulatory regime with clear reassurance for child minders and those who wish to become child minders.
<P>
Another of our initiatives is our encouragement of child minder networks. The hon. Member for Meriden said that three and four-year-old children go into alternative settings. The development of child minder networks will ensure that child minders can access the nursery education grant and be registered. One of the advantages of the new regulatory regime is that it brings together the two separate regimes. That makes it easier, particularly for child minders, to enter a network and take advantage of the £1,160 that is available under the nursery education grant for each child.
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, I announced the introduction of start-up grants to help child minders with the inevitable expenses of starting up in child minding. At the end of this month, we are launching a recruitment campaign to encourage more people to come into child care.
<P>
I turn to the specific details of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Meriden. The Bill already provides for an account of the chief inspector's exercise of his functions under the new part XA to be included in his annual report to the Secretary of State under section 2(7)(a) of the School Inspections Act 1996. The report is widely circulated and copies are placed in the Libraries of both Houses and sent to a broad range of interested parties.
<P>
The annual report will cover all the chief inspector's functions under part XA of the Children Act 1989. The supply of child minding and day care services is not a function of the chief inspector unless the Secretary of State specifically requests that he report on the matter. It is a concern for the Department and for ourselves and it is with that in mind that we are introducing new measures to encourage more people to come into child minding as a rewarding career. However, we can make a request to the chief inspector to report on such issues and, in such cases, it would be appropriate for him to include a reference to it in his annual report. Copies of all Ofsted's published reports are sent to the Libraries of both Houses and are published on Ofsted's website.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister and I am pleased that she recognises that there are problems with the supply of child minding places. It is worth putting some hard facts on the record because we have not discussed figures.
<P>
In its publication ``Closer to home'' the National Childminding Association quantified the drift and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the last three years the number of registered childminders has dropped by more than 20 per cent. In some areas, childminders are leaving in droves<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because they cannot
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>sustain their childminding business in the face of uncoordinated expansion.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the point that I was trying to make earlier. The association continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>They are fed up with the low income they often attract, and put off by what they see as increasing bureaucracy by the local authorities that regulate childminding.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That comes from the association that specifically represents child minders and expresses their fear about the regulation that they will face.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> In my discussions with the National Childminding Association, I have found that the problem is more the inconsistency of the current 150 separate regulatory regimes, which we will be able to put right with the introduction of national regulation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Does the Minister accept that although the introduction of national standards should deal with many of the current anomalies, it is important that we strengthen the situation in which the chief inspector only is requested to look into matters. I cannot tell the Committee how strongly I urge the Minister to put a three-line Whip under that. We are always being told what powers Ministers have to make things happen through regulations and guidance, so I urge the Minister to do whatever it takes to ensure that that matter is addressed.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I seek clarification on a couple of matters. In the Minister's reply to hon. Members who expressed the sorts of anxieties that I have heard from child minders about the switch to inspection by Ofsted rather than by the social services inspectorate, I did not hear the philosophical logic for that change. Working in a Department other than the one that my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I cover, the Minister will be aware that Ofsted does not enjoy uniform delight among the establishments that it currently inspects. I have a report about an inspection of Moor Lane junior school in Chessington, Kingston upon Thames, where the head teacher, deputy, and 10 teachers resigned in protest over the school's Ofsted inspection. One can understand that when child minders read such a headline and other anecdotal evidence of what happens when Ofsted arrives in schools, there is anxiety about the switch to inspection by Ofsted. The Minister said that the line of accountability went ultimately to the Secretary of State. I presume that she meant the Secretary of State for Education and Employment or did she mean the Secretary of State for Health? Will she clarify that, as well as explaining the philosophical reason behind the big switch?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> May I briefly respond to that now because it will save me from dealing with it during the stand part debate?
<P>
The philosophical reason is that we wish to provide a seamless service for young children—an objective that I believe is shared by the hon. Member for Meriden. Children do not differentiate between being cared for and being educated, and, as the lives of parents are changing, with eight out of 10 mothers now participating in the work force, the setting in which their children are cared for or educated becomes one. We want to see more provision that offers a seamless experience for young children. The philosophical reason for bringing the two together is to provide the best start for young children.
<P>
There were three or four reasons why we chose Ofsted from the various options available. First, it has a good track record on delivering and raising quality, and as the hon. Lady knows, there is a quality agenda in relation to early years education and child care. Secondly, Ofsted commands the confidence of parents. I am sure that, like me, the hon. Lady often visits nurseries or talks to parents whose children go to day nurseries that provide both education and care under the current regime, and finds that parents will proudly show the Ofsted report, but will not necessarily have access to the social services report on care standards in those settings.
<P>
Those are two powerful reasons for choosing Ofsted. We are confident that Ofsted can deliver a complicated system in a huge range of settings across a wide age range. The range of settings that will come under the purview of the new and distinct arm of Ofsted will include child minding, day care and crèches. I reassure the Committee that we are bringing together the best of child care with the best of early years education and will create a distinct and appropriate arm of Ofsted to oversee and regulate the regime.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is this an intervention?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am stopping.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I think that I got the answer to my other question, which was short and straightforward, as the Minister returned to a sedentary position. The answer was that the provision refers to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.
<P>
Our worry is that the Bill deals with care standards and is not primarily an education Bill. It is trying to consider standards of care across a huge range of establishments. Child minders are concerned that early years care standards are being too heavily manipulated in the direction of education alone. They rightly note that what they have to offer in terms of a standard of care is in a domestic setting and that children learn much through play, which is usually supervised by an experienced child minder. I can identify with their concerns. Moving the provision under Ofsted's wing so that it is ultimately the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment will move child minders from what they uniquely offer to children in their early years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am confused. My hon. Friend might have grasped something that I have missed completely; if not, she might take the opportunity to question the Minister further. If the Secretary of State for Education and Employment is the Secretary of State referred to in the clause, I do not understand why the Minister told us that she would not make regulations and that that would fall to another Minister. I understood that reference to suggest that another Secretary of State would have the responsibility for regulation making.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We are at a point at which we might want to invite another intervention, which could throw light on the matter.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The regulations that I said we had to make were in relation to the tribunal established under the Children Act 1989.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We are getting things back on track, as I am sure that you would like us to, Mr. Illsley. We are back to the point of the amendment. We have raised many philosophical points, which were important because of the supply of child minding and day-care services. The Minister said that there was already provision for the report to be laid before the House under another clause but the exact purpose of the amendment was to encourage the Government to consider specifically the impact on the supply of child minding of the early application of this part of the Bill. I accept the Minister's point that that would be a request to the chief inspector but I would feel happy if there was a way in which she could make that request too important to refuse.
<P>
We will study with great interest the report that will be laid before the House in any event and I for one will be searching for an honest assessment of exactly how to remedy the imbalance by which child minders feel deterred from entering or continuing in the profession because of the rapid and uncoordinated development of other types of early years provision and the emphasis being placed on more institutional early years provision, which they feel is cutting them out. I underline that point to the Minister and warn her that we will look for that dimension to be addressed in the report. We accept that there will be a report and that it will be available to Members of this House and to our colleagues in the other place.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 412, in page 39, leave out lines 33 to 35.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following: Government amendments Nos. 294 and 302 and amendment No. 376, in page 41, leave out lines 20 to 22.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale—sorry, I mean Mr. Illsley. It is a brave person who laughs at anyone else for voting on the wrong thing in the confusion and chaos of this ridiculous, 15-page clause, in which we are invited to deal with 100 amendments. It will make for an interesting stand part debate.
<P>
I would like to speak to my two amendments and then address the Government amendments, which deal with a related area. Amendment No. 412 would remove subsection (4) from proposed new section 79N. The subsection sits uncomfortably with the Bill's intentions. It provides that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Chief Inspector may secure the provision of training for persons who provide or assist in providing child minding or day care.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may not have heard me make the argument that we rehearsed earlier in the Committee's consideration. Those who inspect and regulate should have that function alone; it should be distinct from any other functions such as the securing of training and encouraging the development of the work force. To put it simply, can someone who has a duty to secure provision of training and thus, by extension, has an involvement in the quality delivered, really inspect the results of that work? People will be trained through the provision that the chief inspector has secured. Can he inspect people and consider their quality with an arm's length, objective approach?
<P>
There is an important point of principle at issue. The chief inspector should inspect; he should come in as an outside body, at arm's length from the delivery of the care, examine what is being delivered, report on it and take any necessary steps. He will compromise his integrity and independence if he becomes involved in managing the improvement of the service or securing the provision of training.
<P>
There is an implicit conflict between the provisions in proposed new section 79N(4) and those in 79V(b), which place on a local authority the duty to secure provision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of training for persons who provide or assist in providing child minding or day care.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I urge the Government to consider whether it is proper for the person charged with inspection to get involved in securing provision of training. Amendment No. 376 does the same thing as amendment No. 412, but in respect of Wales.
<P>
If the Government are determined to resist the amendment and insist on keeping the chief inspector involved in those duties, their two amendments make sense and will provide greater internal consistency. However, I urge the Minister to consider whether the chief inspector has a proper role.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I would have supported the amendment if the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge had used a phrase suggesting that the chief inspector would have a role in training and the raising of standards within the establishments for which he is responsible. When I asked the Minister about the relationship between the chief of Ofsted locally and the local providers, I did not feel that her answer, which related purely to the training role, was adequate. Those people inspected do best if there is a relationship between the inspector and themselves—that drives up standards. It has been demonstrated in the work of Ofsted. At times, it can be a negative experience for the schools that are investigated, which can stop further progress. However, experience in the health service is that although the work of inspection registration units is patchy, a good unit can do a tremendous amount to drive up standards operatively. At the end of the day, Ofsted has the ultimate sanction of shutting schools down; it is co-operation with levers, but it is not a coercive process.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am worried that if we restrict ourselves to the Minister's involvement in training, we shall not see the sort of supportive relationship that we want. I look forward to the Minister being explicit about that, because in an earlier statement she said that it was not Ofsted's role to provide advice and support but that of the local authority. That makes Ofsted's work a purely policing activity.
<P>
The large number of sometimes slightly vulnerable individuals involved in child minding will not cope any better than the small village schools in my part of the world that have experienced a not particularly supportive Ofsted inspection. Many inspections go well; they are supportive and everyone gains from them. However, the general perception of inspections is not of people being proud of what they do best but of them being afraid of where they might be failing, especially if there is uncertainty in the rules that are applied.
<P>
Will the Minister say how she sees the new function developing? It is being given to, essentially, a new body; it is not the usual Ofsted activity and a new structure will have to be created.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Two proposed new subsections refer to training. The hon. Gentleman drew our attention to the role of local authorities in training; the other is Ofsted's training role. The word ``shall'' is used about local authorities, so they have a clear role in providing training. However, Ofsted ``may'' get involved in training. It is to meet the sort of concerns that he has raised that we made provision in the Bill.
<P>
One reason for establishing the new regulatory regime is to enhance and improve the quality of child care. Ofsted will require some positive levers to enable it to do that. It would obviously be completely inappropriate if a conflict emerged between its inspectoral and training roles, but we must realise the existence of its power to engage in training when it is deemed appropriate and if it has sufficient resources, for which it will depend on the Government or other bodies. It is a good power to include in the Bill.
<P>
I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's other arguments. It is not a question of Ofsted monopolising training; we are giving it power. It has considerable experience in planning training; it has trained 12,000 inspectors. We are creating a national body to ensure consistency, rather than allowing 150 separate local authority bodies to have different training priorities. It is good to have that capacity in a national body, because, where appropriate, it ensures a consistent approach to training, perhaps on particular issues that emerge over time. It will help us create a level playing field.
<P>
There are equally strong reasons for the National Assembly for Wales to have a training function. The Bill's provisions for Wales have been described by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. In support of the conclusions on training and consultation last summer, the National Assembly for Wales' all-party Health and Social Services Committee strongly recommended that a single all-Wales regulatory body be set up as part of the Assembly rather than as an independent body. Clause 8(2) provides powers for the Assembly to provide training in relation to part 2 services and attaining standards published under clause 22. As the single regulator in Wales, the Assembly will also want powers to provide training in relation to part V services. It would be difficult to understand why the Assembly should not be allowed to provide training across the full scope of its regulatory duties. It would be both inequitable and detrimental if the Assembly were forced to exclude child minders and day care providers from its training programmes, which cover such a wide range of providers.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 294 and 302 have a similar aim. They enable the provisions affected to apply to potential child care providers—those who have applied to become registered providers and those who are considering embarking on the process—as well as to those who are already registered. We have had a lengthy discussion on child minders; we are thinking particularly of them. More specifically, the amendments relate to proposed new section 79N(4) in England and the similar proposed new section 79S in Wales. As they stand, the provisions deal with the regulatory authorities' ability to secure training for registered providers only. If the new systems are to be a success, the regulatory authorities will also need to interact in this area with people who have not yet become registered providers. For example, the pre-registration training of applicants is intimately linked with a successful registration process and ensures that potential providers know what to expect and are able to comply with the standards in all respects by the time of registration. Training may be provided by the regulators, or endorsed by the regulators and secured by other organisations such as the early years development and child care partnerships in each local authority area. Endorsement by the national regulator will ensure consistency across the country for training provided in different localities. I urge the Committee to accept the Government amendments, which enhance the scope of training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister's intentions are clearly good but the problem persists. One can imagine an Ofsted inspector going to the residence of a child minder or to the place where day care is provided and saying, ``You've got a problem here; what you need is a quick stint on one of our training courses, for which I happen to have the application form—a fee is of course payable.'' There is an inherent conflict in an organisation both providing and charging for a service and regulating it and inspecting whether the people who come out at the other end provide a sufficient quality of service. It is a bit like BSM asking people whom they have just charged £600 for a course of driving lessons to just nip round the block as a test of whether they are fit to have a driving licence,
<P>
So while I am sure that the Minister's intentions are good, I do not feel comfortable about the idea of Ofsted providing the training and then inspecting the people who have received it to see whether they are any good. That has to be a problem. I will not press the amendment but I hope that the Minister has taken on board our concerns and will think about it in her private moments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I would like a little more explanation. If the further functions were extended to those who provided child minding but were not necessarily registered, that would catch quite a big group. The Minister might give us some practical examples of how that would work. An awful lot of people provide informal child minding without wanting or needing to be registered. How wide will the extension go?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The purpose is to ensure that Ofsted can respond to potential applicants. We are specifically thinking of child minders who will want support before going through the formal processes.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 297.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I must ask the Minister to explain the amendment, even if only briefly. There were so many amendments to read last night, and this was one that I could not understand. It is probably simple.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I was trying to enable the Committee to move on by proposing the amendment formally, but I have been defeated. Amendment No. 296 will put the original wording into a proper form, We need not dwell on it longer. Amendment No. 297 is a useful provision, as it will enable greater information on the early years child care sector to be made available. Proposed new section 79N(6) of the Children Act 1989 requires the chief inspector to give an account of his functions under proposed new part XA in his annual report to the Secretary of State. That will be a useful mechanism for providing information and data on the regulated child care sector.
<P>
Having a single national regulatory body, however, means that comprehensive information on child care will be collected and analysed centrally. Some aspects of the information will not have been collected in that way before and will undoubtedly provide a greater insight into the workings of the sector at different levels. So that the chief inspector can make that information more widely available, the amendment would allow him to produce reports on child care in addition to those contained in his annual report. They will include thematic reports, ones on specific regions and state-of-the-nation reports, and will contribute to a greater understanding of the sector.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 298, in page 40, line 32, at beginning insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Chief Inspector may at any time require any registered person to provide him with any information connected with the person's activities as a child minder, or provision of day care, which the Chief Inspector considers it necessary to have for the purposes of his functions under this Part.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 304.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> At present, the powers in the Bill allow the chief inspector to acquire information from a provider only on application or when an inspector enters the premises. The amendment will allow him to require a registered person to provide him with information at other times.
<P>
It is clearly not of benefit to Ofsted or the provider that the restriction applies in all instances. Ofsted will use the right only when it is clearly more sensible and practical to use means other than a visit to the person's premises to gather and record information. For example, it might be more practical to request information from a registered person by telephone or in writing before an inspection is carried out.
<P>
As a statutory body, Ofsted can do only what is prescribed in statute. Without the amendment, its ability to collect information would be limited. The amendment will assist the chief inspector to monitor the progress of a provider at times other than during an annual inspection and assist inspectors investigating complaints about providers. It will ensure also that any conditions imposed on registration are adhered to and that information held about a provider is accurate and up to date. Amendment No. 304 affords the same powers to the Assembly.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> On the face of it, this is a sensible amendment. However, I am not sure how frequently the inspector can require information—``request'' might have been a better word. The chief inspector already has the power to investigate complaints or to consider concerns that have been expressed to him, which is quite proper when dealing with the protection of children. In his other capacities, however, he may want reports on availability, trends in numbers or plans. It would help if child minders made that sort of information available, but I am not sure whether the inspector should have the statutory right to require it without restraint. If we as Members of Parliament responded to every organisation that wanted to know our opinion, we would spend our days filling in forms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I already do!
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Well I do not—unless I am paid for it. The serious point is that the amendment gives the chief inspector extraordinary powers to require people to do extra work. Why does the amendment not include the word ``reasonable''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I should like to ask a brief question about amendment No. 304. I want to know how the Assembly will discharge its responsibility, and how that power might connect to the powers given elsewhere in the Bill for the Assembly to establish a children's commissioner. Will it be possible for the power given by the amendment to be exercised by a children's commissioner in Wales?
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I am informed that the answer is no. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight asked whether constraints will be placed on the inspector's use of that power. We need to ensure that the inspector is able to use the power as often as necessary to ensure that the provider is suitable to be registered. I can think of no one who wants to collect unnecessary information. The power given in the amendment is similar to the power given in clause 29(1).
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Does the Minister accept that a chief inspector may have two quite different roles? He will have a strategic and advisory function to Ministers and local authorities; his other role will be to protect the welfare of children. In the latter role, it is vital that he has the statutory power to compel people to give him information. I am not sure that it is reasonable to give him the statutory power to compel people to give information that may be of national strategic importance but has nothing to do with the welfare of the child or the business of that particular child minder.
<P>
We are straying into issues of commercial confidentiality and onerous form-filling for individuals who might not be good at filling in forms. I cannot see why the chief inspector should have these statutory powers, and I hope that the Minister will consider whether this catch-all phrase is appropriate. I am a sub-contractor to the national health service, but the Secretary of State for Health cannot require me to provide the specific strategic outlooks that are set out in the amendment. If I am not accountable to that extent, I see no reason why the child minder down the road who looked after my children when they were young should be in a less privileged position than me.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I simply reiterate to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight that we want to ensure that the chief inspector has the necessary power to carry out his regulatory functions. The amendment states that the required information must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>connected with the person's activities as a child minder,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and I hope that that constraint satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am sorry to press the point, but does the phrase ``regulatory functions'' appear in the amendment? We have established that the chief inspector has at least two roles: one in regulation and the other in giving strategic advice. If the statutory powers relate purely to his regulatory functions—which, in essence, concern child protection—I would be reassured.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I urge the hon. Gentleman to read the amendment, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Chief Inspector may at any time require any registered person to provide him with any information connected with—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I emphasise the phrase ``connected with''—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the person's activities as a child minder.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would seem to apply to the chief inspector's regulatory functions, rather than his state-of-the-nation, strategic functions. In the light of that reassurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight is happy to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have listened patiently to the Minister's exchanges with my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight, although I am not certain that they have helped to clarify matters. However, I want to return to the Minister's ``no'' to my original question. Earlier clauses that deal with the Assembly's function as a registration authority for, say, domiciliary care, make it clear that powers of regulation will be granted to the Assembly. This part of the Bill will do exactly the same. Surely the Assembly can, therefore, choose to empower the children's commissioner under this part of the Bill. If not, what provision will preclude the Assembly from doing so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> May I answer that point as it relates to amendment No. 304? We shall shortly table, and discuss in Committee, an amendment dealing with the children's commissioner in Wales. At that stage, I hope that we will examine the relationship between the children's commissioner and the Assembly as a corporate body that deals with regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary has not sat down, because I want to ask a further question. The intention is that we shall finish our deliberations on 4 July, so the opportunities for tabling further amendments in Committee are virtually non-existent. Does the Under-Secretary intend to table the amendment on Report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> We intend to table it in Committee. In fact, it is a new clause, which could even be being tabled as we speak.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 416, in page 40, line 48, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The Chief Inspector may arrange for an inspection conducted by a registered inspector under this section to be monitored by another registered inspector.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment provides the chief inspector with an option for monitoring the quality and standards of inspection under this part of the Bill. It allows for him to arrange for registered inspectors deemed appropriate for the purpose to check the quality of the inspection practice.
<P>
It is likely that the power will be used sparingly, as it is envisaged that inspections will be conducted by Ofsted employees. However, if it were to become necessary for the chief inspector to contract with others to arrange inspections for him under proposed new section 79Q(3), this power would be a valuable quality assurance measure. It will enable the chief inspector to arrange for a registered inspector's performance to be monitored formally in circumstances in which concerns have been raised.
<P>
The ability for those deemed appropriate by the chief inspector to monitor the performance of other registered inspectors will help the chief inspector to maintain and develop the quality of the inspection system, by identifying poor practice and areas for improvement both individually and generally. It will also provide valuable evidence if it proves necessary to take action in respect of the registration of a registered inspector.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 299, in page 41, line 3, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The period mentioned in subsection (1) may, if the Chief Inspector considers it necessary, be extended by up to three months.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill states that a person carrying out an inspection under proposed new section 79Q shall report in writing on the matters inspected to the chief inspector within the prescribed period. That period is to be determined in regulations. It is expected that, in the majority of inspections, the inspection report will be produced within the prescribed time scale, and that is, obviously, what we want. However, there may be times when that is not possible—for example, if an inspection had become more complex than originally envisaged, or if additional time were required to examine the evidence obtained during an inspection.
<P>
The amendment will give Ofsted, when necessary, the power to extend the time allowed for preparing such a report by up to three months. It is similar to the powers already given to the chief inspector in respect of producing school inspection reports and nursery education reports. The amendment will allow the chief inspector a greater degree of flexibility in the time allowed to produce the final inspection report in such circumstances, and will assist in ensuring that reports are produced to a consistently high standard.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: Government amendment No. 301.
<P>
Amendment No. 374 in page 41, line 11, leave out from first `it' to end of line 13 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`available to any person on application and upon payment of such fee as he shall reasonably require'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The publication of inspection reports is governed by proposed new section 79R, which provides for inspectors to send reports of inspections in writing to the chief inspector within a prescribed period. As drafted, the Bill requires the chief inspector to send a copy of an inspection report to the Secretary of State in all cases. That is neither practicable nor desirable. However, there may be instances in which the chief inspector will consider it necessary to send reports to the Secretary of State—for example, to support a thematic report which makes general claims in the provision of day care. The amendment provides for such an occasion.
<P>
The amendment also ensures that, when the Secretary of State asks for a report, it will be sent without delay. Such circumstances could arise, for example, if there had been an adverse incident involving an individual provider. This will cut down on bureaucracy and avoid unnecessary burdening of both the chief inspector and the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendment No. 301 relates to the chief inspector's powers to make copies of inspection reports available. The Bill currently makes provision for the chief inspector to make copies available to prescribed authorities and persons. The amendment will allow the registered authority the discretion to make copies more widely available. That accords with the Government's intention to provide parents with more information, and will enhance the chief inspectors powers of open reporting. I can assure the Committee that the power will be exercised with due regard to the sensitivities surrounding open reporting of child minders. The chief inspector will be mindful of the fact that child minding is a service provided at home, and, in cases in which it is necessary to withhold information, including names and addresses, the chief inspector will have the option to publish only parts of the report.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Government amendment No. 301 makes a slight improvement to the Bill. The inspector will decide the manner of publication; that decision will not be made for him by regulations.
<P>
We tabled amendment No. 374, because we feel that the reports must be made available on payment of an appropriate fee. That is an issue of principle. Part of the reason for creating the regime is to reinforce the certainty and comfort that parents can gain when they place their children with child minders or in other child care arrangements. If the reports are not available or critical parts are kept secret, that will have the opposite effect by undermining parental confidence. I am sure that that is not the Minister's intention.
<P>
In tabling this probing amendment, all I seek is an assurance that the Government intend the reports—excluding information that touches directly on matters of individual confidentiality such as a name or details of an individual child—to be routinely published and made widely available. That will allow parents to have access to the reports, and they can form part of the confidence-building process.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I will make two points. I hope that we have made it clear in amendment No. 301 that we intend to make the reports available. Of course we must have regard to the sensitivities of individual child minders, so the power to make reports available is held by the chief inspector. That will cover cases in which there may be issues of confidentiality in relation to child minders.
<P>
I suggest to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that his amendment, which refers to charging for reports, would not create the openness that we want to promote. In our amendments, we are suggesting no charging for the reports.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 303, in page 41, line 22, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In relation to child minding and day care provided in Wales, the Assembly shall have any additional function specified in regulations made by the Assembly; but the regulations may only specify a function corresponding to a function which, by virtue of section 79N(5), is exercisable by the Chief Inspector in relation to child minding and day care provided in England.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This territory is similar to that which we covered previously. The amendment is designed to allow the National Assembly for Wales to extend by regulation its functions in relation to part V services, but only where that corresponds to a function exercisable by Ofsted in England by virtue of regulations that will have been made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State under proposed new section 79N(5).
<P>
The amendment and those that follow all make minor and technical changes, which will provide for the National Assembly for Wales to have parallel powers to those that the Bill provides for England. Most of the provision needed for Wales is already included in clause 68, but those further modifications are essential to provide the appropriate and necessary powers.
<P>
As we have discussed, the amendments reflect the important principle of devolution. The National Assembly should be able to determine its own management and structures within the framework of primary legislation passed by this House. The Assembly will make regulations to give effect to the provisions in the Bill. They will be undertaken following what I hope will be full and rigorous debate in the Assembly. That has been established by standing orders that this House agreed under the Government of Wales Act 1998.
<P>
I hope that all hon. Members accept the fundamental principle that the devolution policy allows such operational flexibility to be exercised and determined by the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>
I must emphasise that the principles behind the amendments and the regulatory framework are similar to those in England and Wales. I know that that has been of concern to hon. Members. It will be a simple matter for regulations to be determined by the Assembly in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the Minister said, the territory is similar to some that we have trespassed on before. It is not right for him to say that the National Assembly for Wales will have similar powers to those available in England. He talked about devolution, as though this were an empowering amendment for the National Assembly for Wales. In fact, it specifically restricts the power of the Welsh Assembly so that it can make relevant regulations only on matters covered by regulations made by the Secretary of State in England. Before a Welsh Assembly man in Cardiff could decide whether the Assembly was empowered to make a regulation, he would have to ask whether the Secretary of State had made a similar regulation in England.
<P>
There may be all sorts of sensible reasons for that, but I cannot see why I should take lectures about the principles of devolution from someone who proposes that the authority of the devolved Assembly should be limited to mimicking what the Secretary of State does in England. That seems to be the opposite of devolution. The Minister talks about the important principles of devolution but seeks to restrict the power of the Assembly. He seeks to force it to look to London for its lead, and to limit its field of action to matters on which the Secretary of State has already acted in England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I represent a constituency in Wales and am the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. All parties in the Assembly have supported the option, and all providers in the Assembly have supported the consensus. With respect to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, I think that those forces are more in tune with devolution than his proposals. We want to make compatible regimes while allowing the Assembly the flexibility to determine its way of managing regulations and the services that it provides.
<P>
There is compatibility between the regulatory powers that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and the National Assembly will have. That is about partnership and about recognising that England and Wales are similar, but have specific needs, interests, management responsibilities and functions to exercise. The amendment is entirely compatible with the principles of devolution, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support it.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I know that we are anxious to make progress—
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The problem with Government Whips is that they have difficulty understanding that their comments, gestures and noises can have the opposite of the intended effect.
<P>
This is an important group of amendments, because it concerns the provisions that regulate powers of entry to domestic dwellings—people's homes. We must all be sensitive about that. I have considerable misgivings about the powers of entry in general, but I have restricted myself in the amendments to limiting—maybe imperfectly, in the drafting—the power of entry to times at which the regulated activity is taking place.
<P>
Amendment No. 377 would allow the inspector to enter premises at any reasonable time while child minding or day care was being provided. The rationale is that when a person provides such services in a domestic dwelling, the dwelling is transposed from being one that is purely domestic into one in which a service is provided. It seems unreasonable that because a service is provided from a dwelling between half-past 8 and 11 o'clock in the morning, the dwelling should be subject to inspection in the middle of the night when no children are present. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the inspectors would call at the premises—for practical reasons, if nothing else—when it was being used for child minding.
<P>
Amendment No. 378 would alter proposed new section 79U(2), which allows an inspector to enter premises on which he believes a child is being looked after in contravention of the provisions. I want to confirm that that power could be exercised only if the inspector reasonably believed that the child was on the premises at the time of entry. That may be implicit, but I seek the Minister's assurance. Many questions would arise if inspectors had the power of entry at times when they did not believe that a child was present.
<P>
Amendment No. 379 has a slightly different intention. It would limit or at least qualify the power of the chief inspector to authorise others to enter premises in exercise of the powers that Parliament will vest in the chief inspector. There may be an interface between subsection (5) and the Minister's longer-term intentions on subcontracting some of the chief inspector's responsibilities. If it were the Government's intention for Ofsted to subcontract so that people who were not registered inspectors could carry out inspections, that would cause additional complications. However, I can envisage situations in which it might be legitimate for an inspector to bring with him or call in an expert, such as a building surveyor, where he had doubts about the safety or suitability of premises. It is entirely reasonable that that possibility should exist where necessary. It is equally reasonable that that person should have the protection of being accompanied at all times by a registered inspector, which is what amendment No. 379 would provide.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I urge the Committee not to accept the amendments. Visits will of course normally take place only at reasonable, not unsocial, times, but we would not wish to constrain the powers of the chief inspector to visit premises occasionally if he considered it appropriate—for example, to investigate concerns raised with the registration authority that the provision of child minding was outside the terms of the registration—when child minding or day care is not taking place. Where there are reasons to believe that unregistered persons are providing day care or child minding services, it may be difficult to assess whether that is the case without a right of entry to the premises. It would, for example, be difficult to establish whether children were being looked after for reward or, indeed, whether children were there at all. If the power did not exist, I can envisage registered inspectors sitting outside people's houses waiting to see whether people are going in or out, which would clearly be inappropriate.
<P>
On people other than inspectors wishing to have a role, we have in mind the fact that it may on occasion be necessary for such people as quantity surveyors to visit on behalf of the chief inspector—for example, to deal with a fire risk. In other circumstances, the registered person may wish a note-taker and administrator to accompany him or her to an interview with a particular person. Those would be appropriate examples of someone other than an inspector having access to a home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has reassured me considerably on amendment No. 379. I suspect that she meant a building surveyor, not a quantity surveyor; I cannot think of circumstances in which a quantity surveyor would have a legitimate role in that context.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> To count the children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Counting the children is suggested. I can envisage circumstances in which a building surveyor would have an appropriate role.
<P>
I sought from the Minister some idea of what a reasonable time would be and what reasonable cause an inspector would need. I understand that it may be necessary to enter premises when children are not there to establish the fact, but one must have reasonable cause for thinking that they may be present to effect entry. I seek to exclude situations in which the inspector thought that something might be going on at premises that was not right but could not reasonably believe that it was going on at the time he made the entry. In interpreting ``reasonable'', what the Minister said today may be relevant and useful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In paragraph (c) of subsection (3) ``inspect'' does not include any medical or physical inspection of any child unless—
<P>
(a) the inspector is a registered nurse or a medical practitioner; and
<P>
(b) the inspector has obtained the consent in writing of the parent or guardian of the child to make such an inspection'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Amendment No. 309 provides the inspector with extra powers to seize and remove materials and request co-operation from any person, take measurements and photographs or make recordings.
<P>
Amendment No. 310 gives a clear message that the welfare of the children is the most important consideration when it is necessary to make inspections. Amendment No. 311 is important for protection of children, as those working on premises may come into contact with children and must be suitable. Others may be useful witnesses.
<P>
Amendment No. 380, tabled by the Opposition, is probably intended as a probing amendment. There is no intention for inspectors to undertake examinations. For that reason we changed ``examine'' to ``inspect'' in another place. Following helpful representations from providers and regulators and from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children we removed the word ``examine'' and replaced it with the word ``inspect'', since ``examine'' in this context carried a connotation of physical and medical examination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In relation to Government amendment No. 309, I note that the original power in the Bill was to copy documents. Giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt, I have assumed that the reason an amendment has been tabled allowing for the draconian-sounding power of seizing documents is that many child minders will not have a photocopier on their premises. Therefore, the documents may need to be taken away. I hope that the Government's intention is nothing more sinister than that. I hope that, wherever it is possible to copy, that will be done and that where documents are seized, they will be promptly copied and returned.
<P>
The Minister has correctly understood my concerns on amendment No. 380, which again mirrors the debate we had earlier in Committee. It must be clear that the power of non-medically qualified or nursing qualified inspectors does not extend to any physical examination of the children. I am not sure that simply moving from the word ``examine'' to ``inspect'' on its own makes that clear. To use a nasty little example, children are readily inspected in schools to see if they have head lice.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): Not any more they are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I cannot speak for procedures in Don Valley, but I know that it goes on in some places. The procedures that are used for that would clearly be seen as quasi-medical and I would like the Minister's assurance that it is intended that these inspectors will be inspecting in the Ofsted mode—sitting, watching, noting—not touching the children. I do not want to sound too melodramatic, but the Minister is probably able to give me that assurance from what she has said so far.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I certainly accept amendment No. 309, especially since it is phrased in such a way as to be specific that the inspection of records relates to the child minding activity. Will the Minister give me that same assurance about page 42, subsection (3)(b)(i) where it says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any records kept by the person providing the child minding or day care?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase ``any record'' is a little wide and I hope that the Government will reconsider it.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I understand the point that the hon. Lady is making. For disabled children, it is after the age of 17.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> If the hon. Lady—
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> The age is 15, not 16, because at the age of 16 someone could have left school and be in work.
<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We have drawn a distinction between disabled children and others, which is appropriate in terms of the regulations. Opposition Members will no doubt want me to delve out the research that shows that 14 is the appropriate age. We believe that, for most children, that is so, because it would be difficult to ensure that children over the age of 14 continued to stick to properly regulated environments. For children with disabilities, we have extended the limit to 16. Thus, the two limits are up to the 15th birthday and up to the 17th birthday.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> That is a helpful explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
