Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 58, in page 3, line 3, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A) Prior to the establishment of the community legal service and the criminal defence service the Lord Chancellor will lay before both Houses of Parliament for their approval by the affirmative resolution procedure a statement setting out the budget which the commission may deploy for each service which details what sums may be spent on legal services, administration costs and staff. 
<P>
(3B) The budgets for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service shall be assessed and accounted for separately. 
<P>
(3C) Any order under this section shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament for their approval by the Affirmative Resolution Procedure".

Question again proposed, That the amendment be made. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 62, in clause 6, page 4, line 39, leave out "determines" and insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"has determined in the statement referred to in section 3 (3A) above".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 66, in clause 6, page 4, line 44, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) In determining the amount appropriate for the funding of services as part of the Community Legal Service, the Lord Chancellor shall not take into account the level of expenditure expected for the Criminal Defence Service.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): May I welcome you, Mr. O'Brien, to the Chair of the Committee--although you were welcomed in absentia by the Minister, the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) and by I at our first sitting. 
<P>
I was caught a little short just before lunch--that would be the kindest way of putting it--and helped by a number of Committee members. The aim of amendment No. 65--we are not debating it now, but it is germane to the amendments presently before the Committee--was to require the Government to establish separate funds for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service in place of the existing discretionary provision. In other words, it would make clear the amounts that the Government expect to be spent each year on each service and thus to enable Parliament and the public to gauge the extent to which any increase in expenditure on the Criminal Defence Service would adversely affect or impact upon the funds available to the Community Legal Service. 
<P>
I apologise if amendment No. 65 on its own falls short of that aim. However, amendments Nos. 58 and 62 tabled by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough and his hon. Friends, and amendment No. 66, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. ípik) will effectively achieve separate funding for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service. 
<P>
As I said earlier, the Lord Chancellor made it clear in Committee in another place that the funds available for civil cases will be what is left after the prior claims of criminal cases have been met. He went on to suggest that he would have to look at the whole of his departmental budget to see whether there were sufficient funds to cover any overspend. He would then have to consider seeking additional funds from the Treasury. 
<P>
This morning, I quoted what the Lord Chancellor said in the other place on 21 January. He was specific. I shall read that statement again. He said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I must repeat a simple truth that no noble Lord would or could gainsay in our discussions; namely, that what is available for civil legal aid is what is left over from the budget after the prior claims of criminal legal aid have been met."
<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Official Report, House of Lords, 21 January 1999; Vol. 596 c. 738.]
<P>

<P>
The Lord Chancellor has no option but to exempt criminal cases from cash limiting because the Government are rightly obliged to comply with the European convention on human rights. 
<P>
The amendments would ensure that expenditure on the Community Legal Service is determined on its own merits and in the context of public expenditure generally, rather than being at the fag end, having what is left over from the Criminal Defence Service. Amendment No. 66 would restrict the Lord Chancellor, not allowing him to take into account the level of expenditure expected for the Criminal Defence Service when determining the appropriate funding for the Community Legal Service. It would make transparent the funds available for each of the two services and require them to be run and funded separately from the outset. 
<P>
We have referred frequently to the White Paper, entitled "Modernising Justice". At paragraph 6.10, the Government say: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there may be advantages in the longer term in establishing two completely separate and clearly-focused bodies to administer the two schemes."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I suspect that it is a matter of timing rather than principle. The Minister may suggest that ring fencing only certain items of Government expenditure is not appropriate. However, it would be a rare example of Government accounting if an overspend on a discretionary budget were funded out of a non-discretionary cut budget. 
<P>
The Lord Chancellor may not relish having to explain an overspend to the Treasury, but that must be more appropriate than reducing the funds available to the Community Legal Service. In fact, most of the funds in a financial year will have been committed by one of the contracts; the likely consequence of an overspend on criminal legal aid one year would thus be that the funds for the Community Legal Service in the following year were reduced. The Lord Chancellor's indication that he would not bear down on the cost of criminal cases, particularly high-cost cases, may not be sufficient to protect the Community Legal Service. 
<P>
I hope that this group of amendments will be accepted by the Government. They will ensure transparency by making the budgets of each service separate and distinct. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier (Harborough):</B> I join with my temporary colleague, the hon. member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), in welcoming you to the Committee Mr. O'Brien. It may not have escaped your attention, that the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) has asked if he can become the Committee's little joker. He has had the chance, as have other Committee members, to read the Law Society's briefing on this group of amendments. My only regret is that, although he was mimicking the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon in refering to it, he demeaned himself and those whom he sought to criticise. 
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B>  I think that I am right in saying that it is not wholly in order and not good practice for hon. Members to read out briefs that are supplied to them. If my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test drew that to the attention of the Committee in a subtle manner, it was to the benefit of all members of the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The Minister's definition of subtlety escapes me. I am deeply concerned that a Government Back Bencher should allow himself to be led into that sort of error. I know that the Government are committed to getting their legislation through. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> No. I am making a point; I shall return to the hon. Gentleman in a moment. 
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) said this morning, if the level of debate is to be reduced to personal abuse and other childish behaviour, it is as well that the public should realise how seriously Government Back Benchers take the Bill. Does the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) want to say something about QCs? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> It is not about QCs; we may return to that subject later. Was not the hon. Gentleman's last comment the pot calling the kettle black? Throughout most of his interventions in Tuesday's debate, the hon. and learned Gentleman was making personal comments about Labour Members. If he does not wish it to happen to him, he should respect Government Back Benchers. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>  Order. We should return to the business before the Committee. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B>  I shall make one or two brief remarks in support of amendments Nos. 58 and 62, drawing the attention of the Committee--especially of Labour Back Benchers who may want to respond--to why the clause causes problems. 
<P>

<P>
Interested groups--not only lawyers but consumer groups--have expressed some long-term anxieties about how the funding arrangements for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service, as set out in clause 3 and later clauses, are being elided. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) pointed out at the beginning of the debate, amendment No. 58 would transparently separate the funding of the two organisations. 
<P>
I shall not repeat what has been said, but it has been said on several occasions that the Lord Chancellor's words uttered on 21 January in the other place have led to huge dismay. Many people have been reported as believing that the Government have misled them in their intentions in respect of the funding of those organisations. Not only the Law Society, about which Labour Members are so anxious, but the Legal Action Group has claimed that the Bill implies that criminal and civil legal aid funds will be separated. However, that implication was confounded by the Lord Chancellor's words on 21 January, and nothing that has been said since has done anything to repair the sense of anxiety that those perfectly well intentioned groups feel. 
<P>
The policy director of the Legal Action Group, Vicki Chapman, said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"People have been under a false impression. Criminal aid will be demand-led, and the thought that it could eat into the civil budget is of grave concern."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Law Society's head of legal aid policy, Karen Mckay, has commented that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The worry is that civil legal aid will become the poor relation."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She is reported to have said that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"civil legal aid will become dependent on factors such as the prosecution policy and policing methods, or on whether more people are going through the criminal courts."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Her view, which Conservative Members and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon would support, is that it is "wholly unreasonable" and "unprecedented" that a demand-led budget should impact on a cash-limited budget. 
<P>
I understand that the Lord Chancellor's Department says that there is a limited budget for legal aid overall, as we all know. The "inescapable demands" of criminal legal aid will have to be catered for, as will "essential areas of expenditure" such as domestic violence, with what is left being spent on other items. 
<P>
 We need to know at the beginning of each financial year how much will be left. At the moment, we are left to guess. I defy any sensible and reasonable reader of clause 3 and the other clauses that deal with funding to divine how much money will be available for the Community Legal Service. We do not even know how much the Criminal Defence Service will spend in any given year, because the Government have so far failed to publish any estimates, even in draft form, of how much they are likely to have to spend on those two services. That creates a lacuna that needs to be filled. 
<P>
We all know that criminal legal aid will take a huge chunk of the legal aid budget, and that the Government say that they will introduce 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"all sorts of measures which are designed to ensure that the money available goes as far as it can".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are warm words, but such intentions expressed by the Minister or his spokesman do not provide us with the detail. Indeed, the clause illustrates one of the dangers of the fact that the Bill constitutes simply a series of enabling clauses. 
<P>
The Government have been shy in presenting the detail of spending and of the funding available. When the Government respond to the amendment, I trust that they will give not only lawyers--this is not merely a lawyer's bleat--but the public, who want to know how their taxes will be spent on state-assisted legal services, some detail, or at least some signposts to the detail.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Was not the detail that the hon. and learned Gentleman requests given in the House on 23 February? My hon. Friend the Minister said that, in 1999-2000, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Government expect to spend approximately £850 million on criminal cases and £780 million on civil and family legal aid.--[Official Report , 23 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 176.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Are not those the figures that the hon. Gentleman requests? 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Those are the sort of figures that one would expect to find in projections for subsequent years. The Bill will presumably become an Act during the summer, but we do not yet know when it will come into force, nor when the budgets that it will involve will bite. I cannot imagine that the Legal Services Commission, the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service will be up and running much before 1 April 2000, and possibly even later, depending on when the Bill comes into force. 
<P>
In any event, it should not be necessary for legislators to have to look in the Hansard for 11 February--or whatever date the hon. Gentleman referred to--to find out what the Government intend to do about funding. There is no guarantee, even given the oral answer that the hon. Gentleman quotes, that each of the services that will form the subsidiary bodies under the commission will have separate budgets. 
<P>
I hope that my response to the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) goes some way to express the concerns not only of my hon. Friends in Committee and myself but of others outside the Committee about the Government's approach to financing those aspects of the commission's work. I make those points in a genuine spirit of inquiry and of wanting to do the best for the provision of state-funded legal services and I hope that the Solicitor-General will respond to them. We all appreciate the fact that any Government is under financial constraints, but we need to know why the Government will not make provision in the Bill to have separate budgets for the two services. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): I genuinely seek information. The Government are saying that they will not cut the amount available for legal aid. I assume from that that they will cap it and I understand the reasons for doing so. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made the spending commitments clear for the next three years. Does that mean that the legal aid budget will be capped for the next three years? Is it like local government spending, which has been committed for the next three years? What will the mechanics be when the two organisations are set up? Will they make a bid to the Treasury, or will the Lord Chancellor's Department make the bid in the public spending round for funding year on year? It would be helpful to know the process that will be adopted. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): I have a number of questions about amendment No. 66. I fully understand the general principle behind the Bill: it represents a process of coming to terms with controlled budgets. It is clear from my little experience of the legal world that eminent QCs need the smelling salts as soon as they hear words such as "planning", or phrases such as "budgetary control" or "targets for reducing delay". The phrase that really hurts is "fixed-price contracts", but we shall come to that later. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I am following what the hon. Gentleman says, but he might be interested to know that I was one of those who welcomed fixed fees in the solicitors' profession. I believe that the really efficient practitioner does well out of fixed fees; it is the blatherskite, who cannot get the case finished, who suffers from fixed fees. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments. I am sure that he supports the thrust of the Bill, which is to introduce that sort of reality into the world of the law. It is clearly new to some people in the legal profession, but it is obvious to everyone else that resources are finite. All Government Departments have got used to that. The Government clearly have to fund some demand-led budgets--health, social security and the prison service, for example, have to be provided for within fixed budgets. 
<P>
Ways can always be found to control budgets. The White Paper foresaw the possibility of civil and criminal legal aid having separate and focused budgets. The Lord Chancellor said in the other place that he could immediately announce to Parliament any transfer between the two budgets. That sounds like giving information after the horse has bolted, but I would not be representing the interests of my local law centre if I did not mention what could happen to the lawyers involved in social welfare work if the criminal legal aid budget seriously overran. 
<P>
The two budgets together make up about 60 per cent. of the Lord Chancellor's budget; the rest is the cost of courts and other expenditure, which would be difficult to change at short notice. The danger is that, at least in the short-term, the Community Legal Service budget could suffer from the criminal legal aid budget overruning. 
<P>
My hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General may know more about this than I do, but some jurisdictions in Australia have suspended eligibility for civil legal aid at times of budgetary crisis. A similar situation has arisen in Ontario, which has seen an 80 per cent. decrease in civil certificates. That is probably analogous to what might happen under the Bill; the system of contracting would hold most of the budget in place until the end of the contract. I have not heard anyone deny that such a difficulty could arise. 
<P>
An important part of getting the legal profession--and the criminal justice system--used to living within fixed budgets is that they must accept all the implications. However, that is little consolation for the many devoted lawyers working in the social welfare field, who fear that the Community Legal Services budget could dry up, perhaps not under the present Government but in years to come, and force them to turn down deserving cases because there is no money. 
<P>
I am looking for an assurance that not only under the present Government but in future, we would not allow that funding structure to lead to the many deserving cases with which law centres deal having to be put on ice. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General (Mr. Ross Cranston):</B> I associate myself with the remarks of previous speakers in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. 
<P>
I can easily dispose of new subsection (3C), proposed in amendment No. 58. It would introduce an affirmative resolution procedure, but that is already provided for in clause 25(9). The substantive provision of the amendment is proposed new subsection (3B). It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The budgets for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service shall be assessed and accounted for separately."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I said something about that when winding up on Second Reading. 
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor has also given assurances about the matter, but let me explain yet again. As he made clear in the other place, there will be separate sub-heads on his departmental vote, which means that there will be separate accounting in the annual appropriation accounts for the two services. Those accounts will also explain any transfer during the year between the two sub-heads. The Government have also undertaken to announce immediately to Parliament any transfer beyond a small sum, which meets the parliamentary scrutiny point that was raised, I think, by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. 
<P>
Amendment No. 66, tabled in the hon. Gentleman's name, does much the same as proposed new subsection (3B) in requiring the determining of the Community Legal Service budget to take no account of the expenditure of the Criminal Defence Service. Governments have to plan spending in the round and take account of a range of competing pressures and priorities. No Government could ever agree to a statutory provision exempting a certain spending programme from that process, as it would be wrong in principle and not workable in practice. Therefore, the Community Legal Service budget has to be set with the Criminal Defence Service budget and planned spending on health, education, the courts and everything that the Government have to spend money on. All those budgets have to be planned in the context of specific priorities and pressures. The hon. member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) raised article 6, which might become a pressure in the context of the Criminal Defence Service budget. However, it is necessary to set budgets. I will talk about the importance of planning in a moment. 
<P>
As has been stressed by the Minister and the Lord Chancellor, we are determined to ensure that the Community Legal Service is properly funded, but it will make it more difficult to convince the public and others that the budget for legal aid is under control and can be maintained or increased if it is perceived to be out of control. I think that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield mentioned the bottomless pit of litigation expense. Even my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) acknowledged that planning of budgets is essential: it allows prediction as to what will occur in the future. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> How does that touch on proposed new subsection (3B) in amendment No. 58, which states 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The budgets for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service shall be assessed and accounted for separately"?
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 There is no lack of a need for discipline and accountability. We are dealing the question of separate budgets. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I was anticipating the clause stand part debate in the sense that other hon. Members had traversed a wide area. I have already given the answer to the point raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman. 
<P>
The predictability of the criminal legal aid budget was raised. The budget has exceeded estimates in the past, although forecasts have been reasonably accurate in recent years, which gives rise to a greater confidence on our part that we shall be able to predict it, subject of course to pressures such as those that may arise as a result of article 6. Contracting, which we shall discuss later, will make spending on the Criminal Defence Service easier to predict, as well as stimulating better value for money. 
<P>
As I said in my winding-up speech, the scope to cut the Community Legal Service budget in any one year will be limited, because during the year contracts will have been let and money will have been spent. It is difficult to understand how Community Legal Service moneys can be practically limited because the money will already have been committed to contracts let in earlier years and the current year. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) mentioned capping spending. The comprehensive spending review and the 1998 settlement that the Lord Chancellor secured show that in the next three years we shall spend £248 million more than would have been spent if the plans of the previous Government had been implemented. 
<P>
Spending on legal aid in general and on the two aspects must be set in the context of priorities. As now, the Lord Chancellor will have to agree spending plans with his Cabinet colleagues. We were elected to give high priority to education and health. In that context, it is difficult to argue that somehow this budget should have unlimited funds and should not be subject to the same sort of planning and priorities that operate in those other areas.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I should like to ask a question, based on genuine curiosity. As I have given the Solicitor-General no notice of it and it is rather specific, I am content for him to take notice of it and answer it when it is convenient for him to do so, or to do so in a letter, a copy of which he could perhaps send to all hon. Members as a courtesy to the Committee. I have been looking ahead to the commencement clause, which does not really help. For how many financial years does the Minister think that legal aid as we know it will continue before it is replaced by the Bill? I realise that various portions of the Bill, once enacted, can be brought into effect at different times. The Lord Chancellor has that power. How far down the track will the Bill come fully into effect? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B>  I think that it would be better to come back to the hon. Gentleman. I have taken instructions from my hon. Friend the Minister. Obviously, some cases run on for several years and they will continue under the existing arrangements. In addition, different parts of the Bill, once enacted, will be brought into force on different dates. I shall give a fuller answer to the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee at a later stage. 
<P>
Proposed new subsection (3A) states that prior to the establishment of the two services the Lord Chancellor should obtain parliamentary approval for a statement of a budget. In a sense, the Opposition want to fix the spending for all time. There is no justification for the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> We are talking about budgets and, by definition, budgets are annual. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I am not sure that that is clear from the drafting. However, if that were the case, the amendment would operate only for one year, so it would not achieve the Opposition's intended purpose. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): The Solicitor-General rightly said that clause 25(9) includes provision for an order to be laid before Parliament before the provisions of clause 3 can be brought into effect. Does he not agree that the Lord Chancellor will not be required to provide any detail in laying the order before the House? Amendment No. 58 would require that the budget be set out for at least the first year. Have not the regulations already been changed? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I think that I answered that point when I said that the Lord Chancellor will set out the two sub-heads in the annual appropriation accounts--that would be subject to discussion in the House if need be. 
<P>
In proposing subsection (3A) in amendment No. 58, the Opposition overlook the fact that separate provision is already made for the commission's administrative budget under paragraph 11 of schedule 1. On the point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, Parliament will vote on the three budgets--the Community Legal Service budget, the Criminal Defence Service budget and the annual administrative budget. The amendment would provide a second procedure, which goes against convention--it would involve a second look at those budgets. 
<P>
I am not sure whether your intention is to have a separate stand part debate, Mr. O'Brien, given that the debate has ranged widely. However, I would like to make a general point on clause 3, which provides for two separate bodies--one responsible for the Community Legal Services, the other for the Criminal Defence Service. It provides that a change in that arrangement would be subject to parliamentary approval under the affirmative resolution procedure. On one hand, there may be long-term advantages in keeping one commission and, on the other, there may be advantages in administrating the criminal and civil schemes separately. It may be that criminal defence services will be different and will become even more so with time. 
<P>
One of our intentions in the Bill is to introduce the voluntary sector much more into the provision of legal services, whereas criminal defence services will continue to be provided very much by lawyers. Of course, criminal services are much more court-based than the civil side. It might be more practicable to separate the administration of the two sides. That is provided for in the Bill. Alternatively, it may be possible after a period of, for example, five years, following an assessment, to continue with one commission covering the two different aspects. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for clarifying certain aspects of clause 3, and the way in which it will operate. I have taken careful note of his comments about the budget proposals being put before the House of Commons for affirmative resolution. The difference between what the previous Government did and what he proposes is that he has given us an assurance to which we can subsequently refer, whereas we put the provision into a statutory framework. 
<P>
There remains a serious area of disagreement between the thrust of amendment No. 58 and the Government's position. We remain convinced that the budgets for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service should be assessed and accounted for separately, for reasons which we have already discussed. I therefore propose to press amendment No. 58 to a vote. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The amendments do not seek to exempt spending from the process of scrutiny, or from the need to provide value for money, nor would they succeed in so doing. The civil legal aid budget is finite, and budgets have to be planned. The group of amendments, especially amendment No. 58, would ensure that the Government established separate funds for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service. Amendment No. 58 would allow the funding for the Community Legal Service to be clear, transparent, and determined on its own merits, and would ensure that had the opportunity of gauging those merits.

Powers of Commission 
<P>
</FONT><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 3, line 11, leave out from "grants" to end of line 12 and insert "(with or without conditions),". 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 39, in page 3, line 20, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(h) to pay fees and disbursements on account by way of loans to solicitors and barristers.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> Amendment No. 2 is a straightforward, minor drafting amendment. It removes the explicit mention of repayment as a condition. Repayment could be a condition in any event, so it removes redundant words. A loan payable under the following subsection could involve an obligation to repay, but that repayment obligation could come under either subsection. I commend the amendment to the Committee. 
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B>  I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for explaining the amendment. I expect that Opposition Members will have few quarrels with it. I shall discuss amendment No. 39 and, if I may, Mr. O'Brien, amendment No. 44. 
<P>
I preface my remarks, however, by drawing the Committee's attention to the comments that the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, made in the other place. They relate to amendment No. 59. On Second Reading, he said that he had three concerns about the Bill. Of one of those concerns, he said, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there are throughout the Bill occasions too numerous to attempt to list where the conferment of powers and the right to make decisions and to give directions are entrusted to the Lord Chancellor alone."--[Official Report, House of Lords, 14 December 1998; Vol. 595, c. 1126.]
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for redrawing my attention to clause 25(9), which will, if I am right, render amendment No. 59 unnecessary. Unless any Committee member wants to, we therefore need not spend much time considering that amendment, which I shall withdraw at the appropriate time. 
<P>
I want briefly to discuss amendments Nos. 39 and 44. The clause provides that the commission will have the power to enter into contracts with providers, who need not necessarily be legal professionals, to make grants and loans, and to employ staff to provide services directly. The Legal Aid Board was given similar powers under section 4 of the Legal Aid Act 1988, but they are more restrictive than those that are proposed for the commission. 
<P>
The Bill does not state the proportion of cases that should be funded in a particular way, but the Lord Chancellor will be able to issue guidance on that matter, as he can do under the terms of the 1988 Act. Suggestions that advocates' fees and other disbursements should be ring-fenced under any block contracted scheme were rejected by the Government in the other place. The Government prefer barristers to contract directly with the Legal Aid Board and the Legal Services Commission. The Government's general proposals in relation to contracting were explained by the Lord Chancellor and his team in the other place. 
<P>
Amendment No. 39 would deal with the concerns that were expressed in the other place and which I am sure are held by some Committee members. The Government propose to remove many areas of legal work from the scope of legal aid--one need only examine schedule 2 to appreciate that. In particular--I discussed this at length on Tuesday--all personal injury work, except for clinical negligence, will be removed from the scope of legal aid. 
<P>
The principle that lies behind the conditional fee arrangement is that the cases that are won pay for those that are lost, through an additional "success fee" in winning cases. Provided that the lawyers' risk assessment and the calculation of success fees is accurate, the lawyer should eventually earn exactly the same in CFA cases as in those that are brought under legal aid. 
<P>
However, legal aid also makes interim payments to a lawyer on account of both costs and disbursements as a case progresses. Clients who would previously have been entitled to legal aid will not financially be able to pay costs on account during the course of a case. Lawyers will continue to receive some money from their current legal aid cases. However, that will diminish more quickly than the rate at which final payments are received for the new cases that are taken on under the conditional fee arrangement. There is likely to be a funding gap that will probably emerge between one and four years after the withdrawal of legal aid, when legal interim costs are converted to unbilled work in progress. That unbilled work in progress will lead to a substantial increase in the working capital that is required to be invested in law firms. 
<P>
In the case of disbursements, many clients who currently bring cases under the conditional fee arrangement pay disbursements as the case progresses. They will recover the money from the losing party or their own after-the-event insurer at the end. Clients who were previously financially eligible for legal aid are 89 90 unlikely to be able to afford to pay for disbursements while the case progresses, as the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon pointed out this morning. Lawyers are unlikely to have the resources to subsidise the payment of disbursements as well as suffering the loss of interim payments of costs. Some large firms of lawyers will be able to draw on lines of credit from their banks, but many smaller firms with one or two partners, especially those in provincial towns and inner city areas, will not have sufficient money--or be able to borrow sufficient money--to bankroll their clients as the Government would like. 
<P>
The study by the university of Sheffield, which was commissioned by the Law Society in 1998, showed that many firms--especially local firms with five to 10 partners that specialise in personal injury work--are likely to need substantial additional working capital to cope. The Sheffield study suggested that some firms may need as much as £400,000. Legal aid firms would be unlikely to be able to raise such additional cash from their own resources or third-party lenders. 
<P>
Amendment No. 39 would clarify that the Community Legal Service may make loans to alleviate financial hardship. That would be in the interest of clients who may otherwise be deprived of expert local legal advice if small firms were to cut back their work load to meet the cost of conditional fee arrangements, or if firms were to fail financially as a result of the Government's changes.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy to let the hon. and learned Gentleman discuss amendment No. 44 with this group. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. Much of what I would like to say in relation to amendment No. 44 will also touch on amendments Nos. 45 and 46, which we shall debate later. Rather than having two bites at the cherry, I wonder whether, as the subject is broadly similar, you would allow me to encapsulate my arguments in relation to those amendments in this debate. I shall not return to those arguments when we discuss clause 5. I would like to wrap up my arguments in relation to amendments Nos. 44 to 46 to make the most economic use of time. 
<P>
Local authorities fund most advice bureaux and a substantial number of law centres, which may be of interest to the hon. Member for Battersea, who spoke about the Law Society in his constituency. Amendments Nos. 44 to 46 would ensure that the present arrangements continue within the limitation imposed by the long title of the Bill. Local authority involvement allows legal services to be used at their best and widest, as local authorities can prioritise the areas of law to be available. Law centres have a proud record of providing educational and proactive work, which empowers their client communities. All such centres are located in areas of acute deprivation. Opposition Members raised related concerns when we discussed the purposes of clause 1. 
<P>
Local needs may vary and may not show up in the inquiries undertaken by the regional legal services committees, which currently advise the Legal Aid Board. Those committees are expected to be taken over by the Community Legal Service, although they cover a substantial area--there are 13 committees throughout the country. Local needs may also be temporary, such as a structural problem on an estate or a health or planning problem affecting one hospital or locality. If I may introduce a degree of topicality, a number of Kosovar refugees are currently moving into the midlands. Leicestershire and Derbyshire have recently received a group of Kosovar refugees, and certain discrete legal problems may affect them, their rights to benefits and other matters. The amendment may assist them and other discrete groups of the population to gain access to the law and to justice through law centres. 
<P>
Once the Community Legal Service is operative, a strong temptation will exist for local authorities to cease funding the advice and representation services that they currently maintain. That would deprive the new service both of flexibility and of experimental projects, but it would also deprive the service of funds that are currently available supplementary to those from the Legal Aid Board. The proposed amendments are set out in numerical order, but I suggest that they should best be read from the middle onwards. 
<P>
First, Amendment No. 45 provides that, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the term 'authority' shall include every local authority."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secondly, clause 5(5) requires the commission to consult, and the clause also ensures that local authorities co-operate with the commission or, in the worst-case scenario, can be compelled to co-operate in the planning exercise. Thirdly, the commission is given power to enter into partnership funding arrangements, as long as the terms of the service provision are more advantageous than the standards set out in clause 8. No citizens advice bureau uses means tests, nor, in general, do law centres. 
<P>
The reference to "public authority" in the proposed amendments anticipates the possible establishment of regional authorities. That is not something that I wish to see, but I fear that it might be part of the Government's overall strategy for this or the next Parliament. 
<P>
To perpetuate current independent advice and representation funding, law centres hope to encourage an amendment to the Local Government Bill as soon as possible. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. Is it appropriate for the hon. and learned Gentleman to read verbatim from a brief provided by the Law Centres Federation without at least identifying that he is doing so? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman can read whatever he wishes, but I am sure that he has taken note of the hon. Gentleman's comment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am most grateful, Mr. O'Brien. 
<P>
Before the hon. Member for Hendon--the springy Member for Hendon--rose to his feet, I was concluding my remarks in support of the amendments. The amendments were tabled by my hon. Friends and I on the advice and assistance of the Law Centres Federation. The fact that we are supporting amendments that have been drafted by outside bodies does not undermine the merit of the proposals. I am sorry that a Labour Member should wish to speak against the amendments because it seems to us that their thrust is entirely worthy and promotes access to justice. 
<P>
It is a pity that, in Brent, the largest law centre in the country is now under considerable financial strain as a direct consequence of the Government's financial policies on local government funding. Brent council has had to reduce funding to the law centre but Brent contains many people who are in need of the very services that I should have thought Labour Members would wish to be provided to the public. Indeed, the situation might he the same in Hendon. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> We do not have a law centre. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It will not he able to if the Government persist with their local government spending policies. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> There are plans to introduce a law centre in Hendon and the local authority has earmarked money for it, but I hope that, when the Community legal Service is introduced and resources are freed up as a result of the revisions to legal aid, the Government might be able to make a contribution to enable us to take that project forward. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I sincerely hope that the hon. Gentleman's hopes are borne out. At the moment, I am not sure that they will be. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> First, I shall speak to amendment No. 39. In a sense, the amendment overlooks the thrust of the Bill because it seeks to include a provision that would accord a certain status or beneficial treatment to practitioners. One important motivation behind the Bill is to widen the avenues through which legal advice and assistance is provided. In various places, the Bill will provide that legal advice will be available not only through practitioners but through advice agencies, law centres and, in some instances, paralegals. 
<P>
Amendment No. 39 also seems to overlook the flexible power contained in clauses 7, 14 and 15 to procure services conferred on the commission. There are further powers, contained in clauses 15 and 25, which will empower the Lord Chancellor to make remuneration orders, which we shall discuss in due course. It may well be that, in particular cases, provision can be made for the making of payments to assist suppliers' cash flows. 
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Hon. Members will have read the funding code and noted in paragraph 7.13 that, in relation to high cost cases, the commission will assist lawyers with disbursements. Therefore, I do not believe that that provision needs to be specified in the Bill. 
<P>
Similarly, amendment No. 44 would, in a sense, provide the commission with a power that clause 7, which we shall discuss in due course, will already provide. Clause 7 will provide for the Community Legal Service to enter into a wide variety of arrangements. In preparing the Bill, we contemplated that the Community Legal Service might secure partnership arrangements with other organisations. To some extent, that can also be seen in clause 5(5). My hon. Friend the Minister of State mentioned that this morning in reference to pioneer partnerships that have already been launched. 
<P>
We anticipate that the Community Legal Service will be about securing partnerships with local authorities and other bodies, so that the pattern of legal advice and available help within a locality can be complementary and comprehensive. This morning, I mentioned the importance that the Bill places on assessing and responding to local needs. The terms on which that help might be available from particular providers will be considered in the light of local need, demand and spending priorities. In our view, it is not right for the assessment of unmet legal need in particular to be pre-empted by an express provision in the Bill. For that reason, I shall urge my hon. Friends to resist the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> This morning, I explained to the Minister of State in an intervention that solicitors, especially small and medium sized firms, do not have the money to pay what are substantial disbursements. My understanding is that, last year, the premiums for after-the-event insurance in near-certain personal injury cases doubled. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I shall take my cue from the Solicitor-General's most recent speech, in which he rightly reminded the Committee that there are a wider range of service providers than the two professions of solicitor and barrister. He anticipated services being provided by law centres, citizens advice bureaux, and possibly by agencies with which we are not yet familiar that may emerge out of a fertile interpretation of the Bill. 
<P>
I was going to ask the Solicitor-General--I now have the opportunity--whether, if a citizens advice bureau was running a heavy piece of litigation, it would be in exactly the same position. I am sure that it would be competent to do so. But how would it meet the really serious disbursements of expert witnesses and so on? They will not wait to be paid; they have a contract with the supplier and they are entitled to be paid. It is anyone's disbursement, not only lawyers'. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Again, I absolutely agree with the cogent point made by the hon. Member for Solihull. My understanding is that amendment No. 44 exactly addresses that point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will say when, in his experience, a CAB has run such a case. It is my experience that CABs do not get involved in litigation of that nature. 
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> It depends what is meant by substantial. Staking £200, £500 or £1,000 is a lot of money in the not-for-profit sector. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Did not that previous intervention rather miss the point? Are we not living in an age when we want to see more providers of legal services? Do we not want to see CAB and the like getting such contracts? Instead of operating at what might be considered the cheap end of the spectrum with minor claims, we should encourage more people into the server market. It is entirely possible that a CAB-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May we please have short interventions? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I was carried away, Mr. O'Brien. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Member for Solihull is facing the future. He is being proactive and anticipatory. He is correct. We want to see greater provision made for the not-for-profit sector. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): Before the hon. Gentleman leaves that point, is it not the reality that average disbursements are about £300? Does he not remember from his former practice that experts will frequently wait until the end of the case before being paid? It is not unreasonable to impose that condition upon them as well. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. The problem is that solicitors are already feeling the pinch. That is true also in the not-for-profit sector. If, for instance, clients in simple conveyancing transactions are required to pay search fees of £100 in advance, how can they be expected to fund thousands of pounds? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> This is a point that I was prompted to make by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull. Is the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon aware that the cost of issuing a writ--it is now called something else--was as much as £500? I dare say that it is no cheaper now. That is the sort of up-front cost that concerns us. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Of course, the hon. and learned Gentleman is right. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that those on benefit are exempt from such writ fees. Those who are legally aided would not have to pay those disbursements in any event. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> My understanding is that very poor people seeking legal aid will have the chance to do so only with a conditional fee agreement. Before they can start, however, they will have to fund a premium to cover the defendant's after-the-event costs. I believe that those premiums doubled last year and are now no less than £160, and possibly more. Of one thing the entire Commmittee can be sure: the cost of the premiums will rise inexorably. 
<P>
I am anxious to get back to the point of the individuals who work in the not-for-profit sector and legal aid practices. I am sure that the Committee will join me in paying tribute to them. They are able and unselfish and work in private practice and in the not-for-profit sector. They are not fat cats. They are often the last hope for many of the most disadvantaged. Legal aid lawyers are invariably the very individuals and firms who do not have the spare cash to stake or to lend to their clients. Amendments Nos. 39 and 44 will do nothing but help legal aid firms and not-for-profit groups to bring justice to such people. They are beneficial amendments and should be supported. 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General: I shall reply briefly to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. First, as I explained, clause 7 provides wide powers whereby such disbursements may be paid. I have already identified the provision in the funding code where it is explicitly mentioned. </B><P>
<P>
Secondly, my hon. Friend the Minister mentioned this morning that in about 80 per cent. of legal cases the average disbursement is no more than about £300. We anticipate that arrangements can be made to cover those disbursements. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) pointed out, in some cases those providing the services will not claim their fees until the end of the process, or at least well into the proceedings. 
<P>
Thirdly, Opposition Members have not explained what cases will have to go if we put money into disbursements instead of other cases. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Stinchcombe </B>(Wellingborough): I have a small but lurking fear that, as it stands, the clause is incomplete. My hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General will be aware that ethnic minorities are a disproportionate part of the lower income groups. They also find themselves in disproportionate need of legal services because they are often the victim of racial harassment. 
<P>
I wonder whether clause 4 could be used as a tool with which to monitor equality. A simple amendment could be made that would allow relevant information to be collected on services, and for whom they are provided, that could be analysed. I wonder whether the Solicitor-General and the Minister of State will consider such a change? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I will certainly consider that suggestion. I shall ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to consider it. As I said this morning, the issue of equal opportunities is taken seriously by the Lord Chancellor's Department, and my hon. Friends suggestion is worth considering. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> When does the Solicitor-General intend to look at it, and when will he report back to us to tell us what he has seen? 
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I anticipate that we can do so quickly. The Law Society raised this concern in the round. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I can deal briefly with the amendment because I advanced the relevant arguments in relation to amendments Nos. 45 and 46, and they were recognised by the hon. Member for Hendon. He will be able to follow my remarks when I discuss amendment No. 48. 
<P>
I am not sure whether the Solicitor-General or the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department will reply to our debate on the amendment, but I hope that one of them will quickly resolve my concerns. The amendment would add a further category of service to those that will be provided by the Community Legal Service. Clause 5(1) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Commission shall establish, maintain and develop a service known as the Community Legal Service for the purpose of promoting the availability to individuals of services of the descriptions specified in subsection (2)".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government may intend paragraphs (c) and (d) in subsection (2) to encompass proposed new paragraph (f), which the amendment would add to the Bill. If so, the Solicitor-General or the Minister of State will be able to resolve my concerns. However, if that is not their intention, I hope that I will be told why the amendment is not acceptable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I do not want to sound like an old soldier--I have never been a soldier--but the natural preface to my remarks involves the handle-turning that I experienced when I was at the Lord Chancellor's Department. Alternative dispute resolution came firmly on to the agenda, and I strongly welcomed that. In fact, I have never met anyone who has a serious argument against that procedure. In this country we have tended to resolve disputes--often inappropriately--by adversarial techniques. Those techniques are wholly inappropriate in cases involving matrimonial breakdown. In such cases, two people are already damaged, hurt and suffering, and they face very stressful decisions about children, parting and the need to provide for the future. To turn that into a cock fight has always seemed to me to be almost a form human cruelty. 
<P>
It was with some pleasure that I watched the growth of alternative dispute resolution, which involves mediation in matrimonial cases and conciliation in industrial relations. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service has done excellent work in that context. One might say, "Keep it out of the court or the tribunal if you can, and find a friendly way of proceeding if you can." 
<P>
Not very far from this Committee Room, several important bodies are headquartered in the City of London. Many of them found that it is better to go to arbitration than to court, and some of them have set up their own internal dispute-resolving procedures. 
<P>
I experienced a disappointing holiday, and discovered that the Association of British Travel Agents--often known by the acronym ABTA--had its own dispute-resolving procedure for people dissatisfied with their holiday. It was an infinitely superior experience to going to the county court--not that I have anything against the county court--because that tribunal was set up specifically to deal with a particular kind of dispute. It was well equipped, it knew its own contracts inside out, it knew the terms and conditions relating to air tickets, the expectations for hotels--everything that makes up a holiday.

<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> You won! 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> No, I did not win. I got what I thought was an honourable settlement, but I would certainly not describe it as a win. However, I shall not be drawn by the hon. and learned Gentleman into a discussion on the definition of a win, however interesting that may be, because that would take us straight back to conditional fees. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am provoked by the discussion between my hon. Friend and the Solicitor-General. Does my hon. Friend remember the remark made by his former boss, our noble and learned Friend, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, that what people want from the courts is not justice but injustice? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> My hon. and learned Friend has left me spinning with that remark. I do not know what people would go to court for. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> When I first started in the legal profession, I recall going to court with my then senior partner. He told a story about his father, who had founded the firm, replying to a client who had asked him, "So, Mr. Thompson, is this where we come to find justice?", "No, this is where we come to find the money." 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> My arguments were running along a higher plane, but I do not mind engaging with the hon. Gentleman. I suspect that someone is trying to engage with me from outside the Room at the moment, if my waistcoat pocket is anything to go by. [Laughter.] However, I am not here as a resident entertainer. I am trying to make a serious contribution to the debate. 
<P>
I have reviewed the merits of alternative dispute resolution, and some instances where it works well. Although the Bill sets out a short litany of the sort of legal service that can be expected, will the Ministers consider, between now and Report, putting an explicit reference to alternative dispute resolution into or near this part of the Bill? I suspect that the Government would like to encourage alternative dispute resolution as much as I would. People emerge from the process much less damaged, and generally with their wallets more intact. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Will this not be all the more relevant as a consequence of the Woolf reforms? With judges increasingly driving civil procedure, they will increasingly adjourn cases to see whether the parties can resolve them by mediation. There will, therefore, be much more dispute resolution outside the courts, for which provision must be made. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I sincerely hope so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I am a little confused. I know that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough moved amendments Nos. 45 an together with his last amendment. However, am in I order in discussing points arising from those amendments under clause 5? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. I should like to make a couple of points. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are now discussing amendment No. 47, but we referred to amendments Nos. 45 and 46 earlier. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> If it is of assistance to you, Mr. O'Brien, and to the hon. Member for Battersea, I have just moved amendment No. 47, but as my arguments in support of amendments Nos. 45 and 46 were identical to my arguments in relation to a group of amendments under clause 4, I do not intend to speak to amendments Nos. 45 and 46 again, unless I am sorely provoked. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can confirm that with this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 45, in page 4, line 22, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) without limiting the generality hereof the term 'authority' shall include every local authority".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 46, in page 4, line 24, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6) The Commission shall notify the Lord Chancellor of the refusal or failure of any local or public authority to co-operate with it in the performance of its functions under subsection (5) hereof and the Lord Chancellor may by order direct the authority to co-operate in accordance with the order.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Amendment No. 46 states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Commission shall notify the Lord Chancellor of the refusal or failure of any local or public authority to co-operate with it in the performance of its functions". <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They are to fund, through the community, legal services, advice centres and law centres. I am a strong supporter of law centres and want to draw attention to the important role that the Bill will play in their funding. 
<P>
A law centre in the borough that I represent--it is now known as the Wandsworth and Merton law centre--has gone through various phases and celebrated its 25th anniversary last week. It has the distinction of being the only law centre in the country that does not receive any money from its from its local authority. Its grant has been cut off on no fewer than two occasions over the past 25 years by the London borough of Wandsworth. Incidentally, the hon. and learned Member for Harborough was once--and may still be--a resident of that borough; he was once a Conservative candidate there. If his quest as a candidate had been successful, perhaps he would have persuaded his Conservative colleagues not to cut off funding to that law centre. He is now trying to persuade the Government to include in the Bill a duty to notify the Lord Chancellor of the failure of local authorities. The London borough of Wandsworth is the only local authority that would currently be notified to the Lord Chancellor. I therefore hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General will explain the extent to which the Legal Services Commission will be able to impose a duty to fund on local authorities. Law centres should be funded through legal aid and through their local authorities. Surely local authorities should play a key role in providing and tailoring local legal services for the communities that they serve. Although the amendment may not be necessary, I would dearly like an assurance from the Government that they regard it as important that funding should not only be provided directly through the Community Legal Service but through local authorities. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I confess that I find it difficult to grasp exactly what the Government want to set up through clause 5. I hope that the Minister will provide clarification, which is one of the purposes of amendment No. 47. 
<P>
If one reads the description of services, one wonders whether one is dealing with a citizens advice bureau in a nationalised setting, a law centre or both. Alternatively, are we dealing with a total package of legal help that falls short of courtroom representation? I infer from the relevant clauses that courtroom representation does not feature. It would be helpful to have clarification on that. It gives rise to a number of interesting points. 
<P>
Amendment No. 47 states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where appropriate, the provision of representation as may be necessary to resolve disputes".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull picked up the point about dispute resolution. The historical tendency in our legal system is that people do not settle their disputes, but meander on to court. Speaking personally as a barrister, I soon realised that there was a mediation service at the Bar, but it took place during the half hour before the case was due to be heard. That was convenient for members of my profession and a cynic might say that it was a mediation service that took place when the luncheon table had been booked and the brief fee had been collected. However, in fairness to members of my profession, the truth was often that instructions and the involvement of counsel arrived at a late stage, when positions had become entrenched. The first opportunity for counsel to discuss the case with each other properly was at the door of the court. I have never booked the luncheon table in advance. 
<P>

<P>
Therefore, there is great mileage in providing for people to be represented in the negotiating process. Experience suggests that that is when heads get knocked together. Amendment No. 47 focuses on that and would allow the Community Legal Service to engage people for that purpose. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views, because the drafting of clause 5-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am sure that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has made himself familiar with the new rules of court, which came into force at the beginning of this week and which place great emphasis on trying to settle cases before they get to the stage that he described. What will his amendment add to what the rules of court provide? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct and that is one of the Woolf reforms that I welcome. Let us forget for a moment about the Community Legal Service and consider the existing legal aid provisions. People are hesitant to front-load litigation--that applies outside legal aid also--and do not want to spend money at an early stage. Woolf requires them to front-load their litigation, which, hitherto, people have not wanted to do. Instead, there has been dancing round the maypole with lots of agreements to defer putting in pleadings and to delay the litigation so that it spins on without coming to the crunch. 
<P>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but it is precisely because there is a requirement to try to settle cases before they come to court that the question arises of what role the Community Legal Service will play in fulfilling that requirement? 
<P>
I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. The clauses are interesting but nebulous on the scope of the disbursements that can be made by the Community Legal Service to achieve the result that we probably all want. Negotiating settlements is critical and often requires professional intervention at an early stage and not, as has happened for so long, half an hour before the crunch comes and the third party--the judge--decides the issue. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> This is my first opportunity to welcome you to our proceedings, Mr. O'Brien. I must express some concern for your health and welfare, as you appear to have fallen into a gaggle of lawyers. You have seen some of the techniques that they deploy, not least that of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, who seems to be trying to confuse our proceedings by talking to amendments outside the group before us. I presume that I have your permission to deal with amendments Nos. 47, 45 and 46, Mr. O'Brien. 
<P>
The Government believe that amendment No. 47 is unnecessary and undesirable. It is unnecessary because clause 5 already encompasses legal representation. The Government have put that beyond doubt on the record in another place. If the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is confused about the operation of clause 5, I recommend that he thoroughly reads the Goverment's White Paper, "Modernising Justice", which will put into context this and other clauses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but I hope that he will acknowledge that the White Paper is not the statute on the basis of which decisions will subsequently be made or challenged. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. He and I have read a good deal of legislation in our time, and I doubt that it ever gives a full or precise picture of what it attempts to do. It changes the law. I assure the hon. Gentleman that reading a Finance Bill--I am sure that he has read a few Finance Bills--will not give any sort of picture of what any Government are trying to achieve. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> May I intervene on that point? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Not if it relates to Finance Bills. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> It does. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> In that case, no. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am seeking an answer from the Minister, which might enable him to cut short his remarks and save him reciting what has been prepared for him. It is a simple point about the provision of representation that might be necessary to resolve disputes. Does that encompass the points made by my hon. Friends and me, or is it encompassed by the preceding subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)? If the answer is yes, we can move on. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> If the hon. and learned Gentleman will allow me, I shall explain the provisions of the clause. 
<P>
The difficulty with his point about representation is that it contains an assumption that help under the proposed scheme will be available only through lawyers. The Bill deliberately uses the word "help" in order to move away from the terminology of the existing legal aid system, which is almost entirely lawyer-centred. I hope that the word "help" is wide enough to cover representation by the hon. member for Solihull and certainly wide enough to include referral to ADR schemes and other non-lawyer based schemes. Indeed, I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Solihull to Government amendment No. 5, which specifically refers to achieving 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the swift and fair resolution of disputes without unnecessary or unduly protracted proceedings in court."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I recognise that many problems with which the Community Legal Service will assist will require a lawyer, but that will not always be the case. I do not want anything in the drafting of the Bill to lead to the assumption that a lawyer will always, or even usually, be the most appropriate person to turn to for help. 
<P>
We have tried to avoid excessive use of the word "representation" precisely in order to avoid importing into the Bill the technical distinctions in the current legal aid Act between "representation", "assistance" and "advice". "Help" as defined in clause 5 has a much wider meaning than "representation", and can include representation in its widest sense. A lawyer instructed to help prevent or settle a dispute will represent his or her client; a lawyer instructed to help enforce a decision will represent his or her client; and a lawyer instructed in relation to legal proceedings that are not disputes will also provide representation. Schedule 2 sets out the proceedings in which such representation may also take the form of advocacy. 
<P>
The proposed amendment adds nothing to the help already provided for under clause 5 and, as I have said, gives entirely the wrong impression that lawyer-based help must always be available. In view of that, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks, which go some way towards satisfying me. However, will he not make one concession to improve the proposals and concede that some lawyers make very good mediators and conciliators? He is right to say that not all the issues that we anticipate need to be lawyer based, but would he not also agree that, from time to time, lawyers make very good arbitrators, mediators and conciliators? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. Some lawyers make very good mediators. Indeed, there are lawyers who specialise in family work, for example, who have mediators working alongside them, and very successful they are too. Given their flexibility, these powers are designed to allow the Government, for the first time, to encourage the development of such services. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): Many who have practised in common law but not family work are aware that not enough is perhaps being done to mediate family and child care disputes. Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that we need to redouble our efforts to remove family cases from the adversarial context? There is a feeling in the profession that the Bill does not deal with that issue. Far too many family and child care cases are ending up in court. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am tempted a little way down that route. All that I shall say is that Government amendment No. 5 will encourage mediation. I shall not deal with the generality of the argument, but--short of taking a case to court, with the attendant difficulties that sometimes arise in matrimonial cases--the Government are sympathetic to greater involvement on the part of those who can offer a service. 
<P>
With your leave, Mr. O'Brien, I shall turn to amendments Nos. 45 and 46. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order. Not for the first time, I am confused. On the selection list--the marshalled list of amendments--there is no reference to Government amendment No. 5 under clause 5. Unless I have gone completely mad-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand that it was discussed under clause 1. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It may have been discussed under clause 1, but I am not sure that it is listed under clause 1 on the selection list. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is included under clause 1 in the phrase, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Government 4 to Government 6."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien, you are quite right. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I thought that all hon. Members were here to assist you, Mr. O'Brien--some more than others. 
<P>
Amendment No. 45 would amend clause 5 by inserting a new paragraph specifying that, where the Legal Services Commission is to co-operate with such authorities as it considers appropriate, the meaning of the word, "authority" is for that purpose to include local authorities. I regret that I am in some doubt as to what precisely the amendment would achieve. 
<P>
The wording of the amendment is open entirely to interpretation. As it stands, the clause will require the commission to co-operate with such authorities as it considers appropriate. The inclusion of local authorities in the meaning of the word, "authorities" would mean that the commission would be required to co-operate with such local and other authorities as it considered appropriate. I cannot see that that would add anything to the Bill: it is stating the obvious to say that local authorities are authorities. 
<P>
However, I might be persuaded that the amendment could be interpreted differently. Indeed, having listened to the argument of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, I suspect that the amendment has a wider purpose, which is to ensure that the Legal Services Commission co-operates with every local authority when planning how to meet the need for services. That was the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea interpreted the amendment. In other words, the commission would lose the discretion to choose the local authorities it considers appropriate for the purpose. 
<P>
The amendment would not achieve that aim, but perhaps I should deal with the principle. The Government made it clear in the White Paper, "Modernising Justice", and in various announcements on proposals for the Community Legal Service, that the Community Legal Service will form partnerships with appropriate local authorities and other key funders and providers to plan legal and advice services in a spirit of co-operation. Furthermore, there are some bodies that are local authorities for legal purposes that may not need--initially, at least--to enter into partnerships. They include police, fire and national parks authorities. 
<P>
Amendment No. 46 would add a new subsection to the clause that would allow the Lord Chancellor to compel any local or public authority to co-operate with the Legal Services Commission. Given that we are setting up the Community Legal Service through encouragement and leading by example, we do not believe that the concept of compulsion sits well with that of partnership and co-operation. Community Legal Service partnerships are being pioneered in six local authority areas, and a further 40 local authorities have agreed to act as associate pioneers. 
<P>
The role of pioneers and associate pioneers will be to identify and test a best practice blueprint for Community Legal Service partnerships that can be adopted by all local authorities. The blueprint will include best-practice guidance on needs assessment and mapping existing provision. Additionally, involvement in Community Legal Service partnerships is one of the local authority services in which beacon council status can be awarded. Given that approach to the Community Legal Service, we do not believe that it would be right, certainly at this stage, to take powers that enable the Lord Chancellor to compel local or public authorities to co-operate with the commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Brien, for helping me with the whereabouts of amendment No. 5 in the amendment paper. I have listened carefully to the Minister. I sometimes find that what he says is wonderful to listen to but when his remarks are unravelled and we read them in the Official Report a day or so later, it is apparent that they contain no detail on which we can get a grip. 
<P>
This is an enabling Bill, which contains many pegs on which the Lord Chancellor will hang other things in due course, like a Christmas tree. We seek clarity with these amendments. Although I am sure that the Minister is doing his best with what he has got, I am not convinced that we have been assisted much by his remarks. None the less, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 4, line 32, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7A) In this section: 
<P>
(a) the term 'individual' shall encompass a group of individuals linked by common membership of an organisation whether or not incorporated, seeking held on a common dispute whether or not each particular person would quality for advice or help therewith so long as a majority of them do so qualify 
<P>
(b) the term 'help' shall encompass all such advice, assistance and representation as in the circumstances a paying private client would expect to receive from a solicitor in private practice.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment contains a misprint--it should read, "seeking help", not "seeking held". I am sure that no hon. Member would be confused by that. 
<P>
Under the amendment, we want to define the words "individual" and "help". Clause 5(1) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Commission shall establish, maintain and develop a service known as the Community Legal Service for the purpose of promoting the availability to individuals of services of the descriptions specified."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word "help" is in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of subsection (2). 
<P>
Our intention is to make it possible for groups of people to receive advice with the commission's assistance. I am thinking of groups of tenants, parents, disabled people, members of ethnic minority communities and employees who might not have the assistance of a trade union. It would be more economical, in terms of time and money, if they could be grouped together when seeking advice or, if necessary, progressing an action against a landlord, a company, a hospital, or public or other body that they believe has done them wrong. No doubt, other members of the Committee can think of other categories. 
<P>
The amendment would benefit not only the members of those groups, because it would enable their joint concerns to be dealt with as one, but the defendant in a dispute, because it would allow him to deal with a multitude of complaints through one action. If the matter were resolved through alternative dispute resolution or some other means, that defendant would have one overarching compromise that would bind the parties complaining. The amendment would therefore mean economy of both time and money. 
<P>
The amendment's other advantage is that in, for example, the case of a set of tenants, it would enable even someone outside the rules to join less advantaged people who come within them. For example, someone who has a great deal of money and lives in a top flat who joins a group of tenants who live in the lower flats or neighbouring buildings and have less money could be brought within the compass of the group action. 
<P>
The amendment seems sensible and will, I trust, commend itself to the Government. If it does not, although I candidly tell the Government and their supporters that we shall not press the amendment to a vote, it nevertheless provides the Government with another opportunity to fill in some of the detail that seems to be missing from a Bill that is without detail throughout. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendment No. 48 would do two things. First, it would make provision for help in multi-party actions in which not all those involved would qualify for assistance. I should like to make two points about that. First, it is not necessary to define "individual" to include more than one person. Unless specifically stated otherwise, that is standard in statutory interpretation. Secondly-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Perhaps the Minister will take instruction on or reconsider that point. I always understood that it was the word "person" that had such an all-embracing meaning, rather than the word "individual". That is certainly the case in the Taxes Acts. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Legal minds greater than mine assure me that the singular always includes the plural. 
<P>
Secondly, to the extent that it is already possible, through either regulations or the funding code, to make provision for funding group actions in which not all the individuals involved would otherwise qualify, the amendment is also unnecessary. However, it is also undesirable. 
<P>
Although in some cases a group of people with a common cause, not all of whom qualify for help, should receive funding, it is not clear that that will always be so. The presumption must be that, in general, public funding exists to help those who do not have the means to pay for 105 106 help by themselves. The mere fact that an individual has a common claim with someone of lesser means should not automatically allow him or her to qualify. It is important to remember that if priority is given to such people, help will be denied to others who financially qualify. 
<P>
Equally, the amendment could in some circumstances be too restrictive. In a case of very high public interest, it is possible that only a minority of claimants would qualify for help. However, the case could be of such general public importance that it should be supported. The amendment would allow all claimants to be helped only if a majority of them qualified for help. 
<P>
The second limb of the amendment is very similar to amendment No. 47. The amendment defines help as encompassing all such advice, assistance and representation as a paying private client would expect to receive from a solicitor. Like amendment No. 47, the amendment assumes that all help should come from a solicitor. The types of help specified in clause 5 would allow a solicitor to provide any service that might be provided to a paying client if a solicitor were the most suitable provider of help. However, if help were restricted to the types of help that can be provided only by solicitors, providers of other services would be at a severe disadvantage. As I suggested, one of the aims of the Bill is to provide the help for legal disputes that is most appropriate. That will often but not always involve instructing a solicitor. 
<P>
Clause 5 gives maximum flexibility to offer almost any kind of help for legal problems, including but not limited to advice, assistance and representation. In doing so, it does not fetter who may provide that help, which the amendment would. On that basis, I ask the hon. and learned Member for Harborough to withdraw it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I may withdraw it on that basis, but those giving and seeking advice in future will have not only to look at the Act that the Bill will become, but to trawl through Hansard to find out what it is supposed to be about. The detail that we are looking for in the Bill is being put in by governmental speech rather than by wording in the statute. The Bill will get fatter and fatter as more pages of the Official Report are fitted into it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> That would be in accordance with Pepper v. Hart. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Indeed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> As the hon. and learned Member for Harborough knows well, the Government have introduced the practice of providing explanatory notes, which give a thorough commentary on the clause that we are debating. It is unfair and wrong of him to suggest that the effects that the Bill will have are not clear. There is a good deal of explanation and no need for him to make unnecessary asides. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I was not making an aside, but addressing the Committee full on and I shall continue to do so until I am stopped, Mr. O'Brien. I expect I shall be stopped fairly shortly. 
<P>
We have made the point several times--it may not have got into the Minister's cranium yet--that this is a Christmas tree or a coat hanger of a Bill. We need to tease out of the Government the detail that we seek by debate or by forcing the Minister to address the Committee. We seek that detail not simply for the enjoyment of hearing the Minister's voice, although that is a most enjoyable experience, but because huge numbers of our citizens are bewildered by what the Government intend to do as a consequence of the Bill's passing into law. 
<P>
I will leave my remarks there as other hon. Members may wish to speak about the progress of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I think that one of my hon. Friends also wishes to speak in the clause stand part debate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Off-message. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I do not think so. 
<P>
As this is the first time that I have spoken other than in interventions, I should declare an interest as a solicitor and a partner in my law firm, although I am not taking any fee-earning work at the moment. I am a member of the Law Society, the Law Society's personal injury panel and the executive committee of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, which is a non-remunerative interest. 
<P>
I want to flesh out a point that I made in an intervention on the hon. and learned Member for Harborough about community legal centres and the desire in my area to establish one. We have identified locally a great need for one, and have shown that local existing service providers simply cannot meet the demand in relation to employment, housing, immigration and welfare benefits as well as education, mental health, consumer issues and the like. 
<P>
As in many areas in London, there is a great disparity between the poorest and wealthiest residents of our borough. In wards in my constituency such as Burnt Oak, Colindale and West Hendon, the need is great indeed. We have the highest level of low-paid workers of any London borough, which demonstrates a need for the legal service that we should try to provide in my London borough. The need for social welfare legal services far outstrips the need for the services that are offered by local solicitors and voluntary advice agencies. Much work has gone into the project, and the way in which the service should develop has been thought through carefully. It should complement and work in close co-operation with existing service providers. It should also adhere to the highest standards that are set out in the franchising arrangements for the Legal Aid Board. 
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
As with all law centres, organising funding for the project is difficult. my local authority earmarked £80,000 for its development this year, but that leaves a shortfall of £100,000, which will have to be raised from other sources. When resources are freed through the Community Legal Service by the proposed changes to the legal aid scheme, I hope that the resources that are generated will help to bridge that gap and the gaps in other areas, such as those that were described by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea.

<P>

<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> This is the first time that I have spoken in the Committee other than in an intervention, and I too should declare an interest. I am a solicitor and a member of the Law Society and, like the hon. Member for Solihull, I work in a high street solicitor's practice. 
<P>
I want some information from the Minister of State about clause 5(2)(a). The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux is setting up a new innovative legal advice service, which will be known as the citizen's advice line for London. Until the Community Legal Service is up and running, that service will receive funding from several sources. The core budget for the initial three-year period during which it will operate is £956,000. The NACAB has briefed me on this matter. The National Lotteries Charities Board awarded £483,000, and NACAB has given a grant of £100,000, which leaves roughly £372,000 to be found from elsewhere. An application is with the London borough grant scheme. 
<P>
Is that the sort of service that the Community Legal Service will provide? The innovative service that I described will take the weight off many local citizens advice bureaux. I am told that more than 80 per cent. of people who contact CABs by telephone cannot get through in the first instance. That is a common complaint about CABs. The advice line will be London-wide and it will take the weight off local CABs. It will provide a much-needed advice service over the telephone and it will use modern developments in telephone technology. It will provide additional legal advice and services. That is one of the benefits of refocusing legal advice through the Community Legal Service. 
<P>
I welcome that service, which will benefit all Londoners. If it is successful, it will doubtless be rolled out nationwide. It is one of the benefits that will come from changing the way in which legal services are provided and I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend the Minister's response. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I thank my hon. Friends for their comments. In particular, I want to respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill). The citizen's advice line for London, which he described, is a good example of the flexibility that we want the Community Legal Service to develop. 
<P>
Most of us who grew up arguing about access to justice based our arguments on the needs in a certain geographical area. The use of modern technology, the telephone and, in particular, greater use of the internet in future, will allow access to justice to take place independently of a particular geographical area. That is one of the challenges that the Community Legal Service will have to face. Clause 5 requires the Legal Services Commission to establish, maintain and develop the Community Legal Service. It defines the purpose of that service and the broad range of services that may be provided. It places a duty on the commission to assess the need for such services and to plan, in co-operation with other funders, how to best meet that need. It gives the commission power to establish schemes for accrediting or kite-marking service providers. In common with several other clauses in the same part of the Bill, it gives the Lord Chancellor a reserve power to make orders, subject to Parliamentary approval, requiring the commission to carry out its functions under the section--assessing need, planning provision and accrediting providers--in a particular way. 
<P>
Clause 5 is the purpose clause for the CLS. It is structured to reflect the fact that the Legal Services Commission will play two distinct roles in developing the Community Legal Service. First, it will take the lead in developing the wider CLS by co-ordinating the efforts of various bodies that fund services. That will involve establishing common systems with other funders to define and assess needs and priorities, and to co-ordinate plans for the allocation of resources. 
<P>
The second part of subsection (1), from the words "in particular", focuses on the commission's second role in funding services directly. The words chosen are intended to encapsulate the essence of the new scheme--to use a specified amount of money to the best effect. Few people seriously question the obvious fact that resources available for this purpose are limited--except, perhaps, the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, who keeps spending the Liberal penny over and over again. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Having mentioned the hon. Gentleman's name, I should give way. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, as I have been in the vanguard of those who understand that value for money has to be obtained and that the public purse is not infinite. Some measures in the Bill will save money and allow it to be more usefully channelled into other areas. I have been happy to support savings on merits and means. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am glad that I disturbed the hon. Gentleman and provoked him into making that helpful observation. 
<P>
The scheme must be capable of identifying and targeting priorities and pursuing value for money to achieve the best possible balance of access, quality and price. 
<P>
Subsection (2) describes a range of services that will be available under the Community Legal Service. Those are broadly defined in terms of different kinds of help, which will include but go beyond the traditional categories of advice, assistance and representation provided by lawyers. 
<P>
The commission's role with respect to the wider CLS is set out in subsections (5) to (7). The commission must inform itself about the need for the services described. It will do so by building on the work already being carried out by the Legal Aid Board's regional legal services committees, and by the pioneer community legal service partnerships, which have been established to test different approaches to assessing needs and planning provision. 109 110 
<P>
The Legal Services Commission will also be able to set standards for the provision of services and to monitor them. It will have the power to establish accreditation schemes for service providers and may authorise other bodies to administer those schemes. That is a key feature of our drive for better quality services for the community. We have invited the other major organisations concerned with quality of advice to join us in identifying and agreeing the core criteria with which service providers should be expected to comply and which could form the basis of a Community Legal Service kite mark. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
