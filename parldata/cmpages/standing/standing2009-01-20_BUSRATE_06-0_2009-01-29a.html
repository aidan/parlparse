Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab):At the end
of our sitting on Tuesday, I was near the end of my speech outlining
the case for new clause 1 and amendment 45. I have a few additional
points, which I will cover briefly now to complete the
case.</div><a name="09012994000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
advantage of the proposal for a landowner levy to be an option in areas
where there is a BID and where there might be an adverse impact from
the introduction of the BRS, is that it would be permissive. There
would be no obligation on local authorities to produce a register of
landowners, which could be an onerous and expensive operation and could
involve abortive expenditure. It would apply only in those cases where
BIDs were up and running, where there would probably be a greater
understanding of the ownership structure in the area. There would be an
incentive to ensure that the BID, if it was working successfully, had
the prospect of continued viability should it be threatened, as we
heard from witnesses who gave evidence last week, by the arrival of the
BRS. I therefore believe that there would be considerable
advantages.</div>
<a name="09012994000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept,
however, that more work might be needed if this particular option is to
be progressed. There would almost certainly be a need for further
guidance on the processes involved in compiling a register. If I can
persuade my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government
consider the proposition, I would be happy to offer any further
thoughts outside the Committee on how that process might be
undertaken.</div>
<a name="09012994000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be
important to conduct some further research. A research study was
commissioned precisely because of the anxieties about the
non-contribution of landowners towards BIDs. I believe that that study,
commissioned by the Department and undertaken by the university of
York, has completed two stages. Stage 3 has been postponed because of
the expected arrival of the BRS; that is an entirely proper approach by
the Department, as it avoids anticipating conclusions to a research
study that could be influenced by the impact of the
BRS.</div><a name="09012994000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be sensible to have a specific element in the research study
looking at the experience of introducing, on a voluntary or a
permissive basis, a landowner levy in one or more BIDs districts, where
the imposition of a BRS can be anticipated and where there might be an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>impact. One might suggest the possibility of a control study, using one
or two BIDs districts without the landowner levy and one or two with
the landowner levy, to compare and contrast the experience of those
two.</div><a name="09012994000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are very strong grounds for considering the option. The issue has been
with us right from the origin of BIDs. We heard evidence that the
success of BIDs might be undermined following the introduction of the
BRS if progress is not made on the funding package to keep BIDs viable,
and we know that the contribution of landowners could be
critical.</div><a name="09012994000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have said enough to persuade my right. hon. Friend that the
idea is worthy of further consideration. I accept entirely that my new
clause and amendment are unlikely to be accepted today. I shall be
happy not to press them if my right hon. Friend indicates that he is
not happy to accept them, but I hope that he will be willing to give
further thought to the
concept.</div><a name="09012994000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012994000235"></a><b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): Welcome to the Chair,
Mrs. Dean.</div>
<a name="09012994000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will speak
briefly to the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst, but also to amendment 17, which stands in my name and that
of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull. First, on amendment 30 and
the consequent amendments, an automatic offset&#151;which I believe
is the underlying principle&#151;is problematic. In many areas BIDs
and business rate supplements will be doing entirely different things.
With reference to our previous debate, had there been a ballot in both
cases, it would have been easier to reconcile the two, because that
would have demonstrated that the business community had opted for both.
However, an automatic offset is potentially problematic.</div>
<a name="09012994000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause, to which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
spoke, is attractive and absolutely right. During evidence sessions, he
consistently drew attention to the lack of a mechanism to enable a more
formal role for property owners, as opposed to tenants, to participate
in BIDs and a BRS. I am therefore attracted to his proposals. As he
said, this is an exploratory process and he does not intend to press
them to a vote. We are all the better for his having done that and I
congratulate him on raising those points.</div>
<a name="09012994000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 17
takes a different approach to that proposed by the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst in his amendment, in that it seeks to give
flexibility to local authorities. Our colleagues at the Local
Government Association may not be happy with some of my remarks about
ballots, but perhaps they will be slightly happier with these ones.
Under amendment 17, a local authority that wished to put in place a BRS
across its entire area, where there might be one or two BIDs, could
take a different approach to BIDs within that area, depending on local
circumstances&#151;for example, how advanced the BID was or how close
it was to concluding. Of course, that would be done in consultation
with the business community in the area, because there might be
specific reasons why an offset would be preferable in that area. In
conclusion, amendment 17 would give flexibility to a local authority,
in consultation with its local business community, to achieve a local
solution.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000236"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mrs.
Dean. I hope that the Committee will make as much progress as it did on
Tuesday.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div><a name="09012994000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
full debate on this group of amendments, which is right because of the
number of concerns voiced in last week&#146;s evidence sessions. The
concern to protect the future success of BIDs was clearly part of our
thinking when framing the legislation. Interesting and important points
have been raised about the interaction between BIDs and a business rate
supplement, and our debate has been well informed by and drawn from the
evidence that we took last week. That underlines the value of the new
Public Bills system, which allows evidence taking before the start of
the scrutiny sittings. To help the Committee to consider the proposals
in two stages, I shall deal first with the amendments that suggest an
automatic offset for a business improvement district levy from the
business rate supplement; and, secondly, with the new clause tabled by
my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich.</div><a name="09012994000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
other members of the Committee, I listened carefully to the evidence
last week and to this debate. I am conscious of the arguments and
recognise the concerns about BIDs within any new system. It is
encouraging that there is&#151;unlike in 2003&#151;a very clear
view on all sides of the House about the importance of the success and
future value of BIDs. We want them to continue to thrive alongside a
business rate supplement. The fact that we are so conscious of
BIDs&#146; value is a real tribute to the work that my right hon.
Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich put in as the Minister
responsible for that policy and legislation five years
ago.</div><a name="09012994000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me explain why in many ways the amendments cut across the ethos that we
have tried to enshrine in the Bill. We aimed to establish the principle
that local authorities will work together with businesses in their area
to develop proposals for major investment and projects that will
strengthen the long-term economic development and success of their
area. In other words, the responsibility and decision making will be
devolved to the local level. The Bill, therefore, essentially gives a
decentralised but circumscribed power to local authorities to play that
future role in the economic development of their area.</div>
<a name="09012994000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In keeping
with the desire to decentralise such decisions so that they can be made
appropriate to the areas to which they apply, authorities will also
have flexibility&#151;again, within certain limits&#151;to design
the levy, as well as to determine whether to introduce a BRS and decide
to which projects they should contribute funding. Local authorities can
therefore decide whether to offer more generous safeguards to business;
to set the threshold for the liability to pay the BRS above the
&#163;50,000 that we propose; and even to decide to exclude empty
properties from liability. With that general approach, it is only right
that we should leave to the local level the decision on whether there
should be an offset for those paying BID levies. The Bill offers local
authorities the power and scope to make that decision. If Members pause
to think about this, they will see that it is self-evident that
circumstances will vary considerably in different local areas with
different BIDs. The Government have therefore framed the legislation to
make provision for the arrangements of BIDs to
vary.</div><a name="09012994000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to amendment 17, which stands in the name of the hon. Member
for North Cornwall. Clause 16 in general requires the levying
authorities to set rules on the extent to which BID levies can be
offset against a BRS liability. However, the clause also requires those

<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>authorities to apply the same rules to all BID levies throughout their
area. I am not sure whether it is what the hon. Gentleman intends, but
treating BID areas differently could allow levying authorities to draw
up different rules for different BID areas. That could contravene some
of the state aids legislation and competition rules and therefore
favour certain types of undertaking in certain areas. The hon.
Gentleman quite rightly described the proposition in amendment 30 as
problematic, but the proposition in amendment 17 is equally
so.</div><a name="09012994000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
30 would require an offset for BIDs in all circumstances except, of
course, Crossrail and London. The evidence that we heard from the chief
executive of British BIDs, Dr. Julie Grail, was particularly impressive
and informed, as well as extremely helpful to the Committee. I took on
board and understood her concerns about BIDs, particularly in areas
where there may be a BRS and there is a desire to introduce new BIDs or
perhaps to refresh the mandate to continue a BID. I will give further
thought to her views, because they were echoed by my right hon. Friend
the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, who said that he had a genuine
concern that reflected Dr. Grail&#146;s.</div>
<a name="09012994000209"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09012994000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond
the concern about the risk and therefore about the protection of BIDs
within a BRS system, it is important that this morning we subject the
case in principle on whether there should be an automatic exemption to
careful scrutiny. Doing so will lead to a judgment, which has to be
made, on whether that is the right approach. BIDs and the BRS are
different policy measures designed to deal with different types of
project and activity. In deciding whether to have an offset, levying
authorities will need to consider the benefits from a BID to those
paying for it and the benefits from a BRS-funded project to those
paying the supplement.</div>
<a name="09012994000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
followed the approach to BIDs to a great extent in framing the
legislation for the BRS, the two are different. That is one reason why
the power to levy for a BID lies with lower-tier local councils, while
the power to levy a BRS is restricted to the upper-tier or unitary
authorities in an area.</div>
<a name="09012994000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
several other differences between the two. First, they are different in
purpose: a BID is essentially short term, and the levy generally funds
immediate activity, such as community wardens, street cleaning,
pedestrianisation projects and CCTV cameras; a BRS, in contrast, is
longer term and more suited to large-scale investments and capital
projects. BIDs also tend to reflect directly and immediately on the
bottom line for individual businesses. A BRS, on the other hand, brings
longer-term, much wider and perhaps less specific and less easily
quantifiable benefits for an area, including the businesses in it. BIDs
typically run for a term of three to five years&#151;their mandate
must be re-established every five years. In contrast, the BRS is for
longer-term investments&#151;there is no fixed time limit. For
instance, for Crossrail, the Mayor proposes to use a BRS for a 24-year
term.</div><a name="09012994000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
uses of the funds are also different. Generally, funds raised from BIDs
support revenue spending, and they often raise the lion&#146;s share
of the funding for a particular project in an area. On the other hand,
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>BRS&#151;certainly for Crossrail&#151;supports the capital required
for a long-term project. The geography, too, is generally different.
BIDs are specifically designed and set up in a highly localised
area&#151;often, but not exclusively, a town centre&#151;so they
are small in scale. The BRS, in contrast, is designed to benefit a much
wider area, and the liability is therefore applied in a wider area. It
may often apply to more than one local authority area, as in the case
of London, and perhaps others in the
future.</div><a name="09012994000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
in many cases, the businesses that are liable and paying for a BID will
be different from the businesses that will be paying a BRS,
particularly given the threshold that we propose to set. In other
words, the majority of businesses paying for a BID are unlikely to fall
into the category that will be liable to pay a
BRS.</div><a name="09012994000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
heard from the Confederation of British Industry, British BIDs, the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Mayor in his written
evidence, and it is quite telling that their view is that BIDs are
different from the BRS. The argument that the hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst advances in his amendment&#151;that there should be
an automatic offset&#151;does not, therefore, have a strong,
principled basis, and I hope that he will not press it to a
vote.</div>
<a name="09012994000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, the
hon. Gentleman did, in many ways, help me make my arguments. In our
earlier sittings, he accepted that there are clear differences between
BIDs and the BRS. He acknowledged that there may be some overlap, but
that is precisely why the Bill gives the levying authority the power to
consider whether there should be an offset when a case can be made that
there is an overlap in a local project. That is why there is
flexibility in the
Bill.</div><a name="09012994000060"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000237"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Although I entirely take the Minister&#146;s
point that amendment 17 might be leading us into the dangerous
territory of competition, my intention was to reflect the point he has
just made on specific local circumstances. It would increase
flexibility for local authorities because those circumstances might
apply to one BID area and not to others in a large rural
area.</div><a name="09012994000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000238"></a>John
Healey:</b> I understood why the hon. Gentleman felt that this
proposal should be looked at, but I have already explained the problems
with it and why I cannot accept it. I hope that he will treat this
discussion as a useful airing of the issues and not press amendment 17
to a
vote.</div><a name="09012994000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested that another way of
offering an offset might be to have a reduction in the business rate
multiplier. He mentioned in passing the point he made on Second Reading
that the Government have not provided in the Bill the option for a
levying authority to reduce the business rates and give a reduction
rather than a supplement. We raised that question in the White Paper in
October 2007, but decided not to pursue the idea in the Bill because
detailed discussions with business, local government and other
interested parties revealed no real appetite for it and, in fact, a
number of problems were
foreseen.</div><a name="09012994000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012994000239"></a><b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): Will the Minister
give way&#151;at a convenient point, of
course?</div><a name="09012994000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000240"></a>John
Healey:</b> If I continue for a minute before giving way, I
may answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div><a name="09012994000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the end,
the principal problem was that people found it hard to see how the
proposal could work in practice without having an impact on mainstream
local authority services, as it would take funding from them. It could
also have an impact on council tax payers, who would have to meet any
shortfall caused by a reduction in the business rate. For those
reasons, we did not pursue that proposal in the
Bill.</div><a name="09012994000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000241"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation
and for his earlier explanation of the Government&#146;s thinking on
the automatic offset. He will not be surprised to hear that I am not
entirely convinced. The issues of local flexibility, resolving
potential conflicts with mainstream revenue and the impact on council
tax payers could have been addressed had the Government provided for an
automatic ballot in all cases. Had they done so, those issues would
then be part of the local debate and it would be for local people to
decide whether to go ahead with the
BRS.</div><a name="09012994000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000242"></a>John
Healey:</b> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point. Does he mean a ballot of council tax payers, as they would pick
up the tab, or is he returning to his argument for a ballot of
business? The logic of his proposal for a ballot was that all
businesses that would have to pay more through business rate
supplements should be balloted. With a reduced business rate, the extra
burden would fall on the council tax payers. Logic demands that he is
now proposing a ballot of council tax payers rather than
businesses.</div><a name="09012994000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000243"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> That is a good try by the Minister. He knows that
our point is that a ballot of those who pay under the BRS scheme would
inevitably be informed by the views of the council and the council tax
payers who are the customers of the businesses. Such a ballot would
naturally generate a public debate in the area. A ballot of council tax
payers is not required, as they will get their own vote in the council
elections. At that point, they can judge the wisdom of the local
authority in embarking on such a
scheme.</div><a name="09012994000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand and accept the Minister&#146;s point about the difference
between the BRS and BIDs, particularly from the point of view of
Government and local authorities. Does he concede that from the point
of view of the businesses that will have to pay, the BRS and BID levies
will come out of the same pot? From their point of view, both affect
their bottom line and their cash flow. That is why the automatic ballot
might have resolved the questions we are
discussing.</div><a name="09012994000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000244"></a>John
Healey:</b> I do not want to re-rerun the arguments on the
compulsory ballot that the hon. Gentleman has lost for now. He is right
that a business may have to find a BID levy and a business rate
supplement. However, to return to my general argument, if in an area
there is a case for both, the benefits likely to be derived and the
purposes for which the two charges might be introduced are different,
so one cannot automatically and fully offset the other.</div>
<a name="09012994000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now
move on to the new clause proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member
for Greenwich and Woolwich. I am grateful, as are other members of the
Committee, for the opportunity to debate the issues 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>that arise from his proposal. On Tuesday, he was right to hope that I
would be sympathetic to the new clause but also to suspect that I would
be unlikely to accept it. I want to give further careful consideration
to what he described as a fundamental problem with BIDs, which is that
the levy cannot be applied to the owners of business properties. I know
that he has regarded this as unfinished business since the Local
Government Act
2003.</div><a name="09012994000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend mentioned the research that we undertook. He
correctly stated that we did two stages of research on property owners
and BIDs. Both sets of research were inconclusive&#151;in other
words, they demonstrated that BIDs could go ahead successfully without
contributions from property owners and that some went ahead
successfully with voluntary contributions from business owners. He is
also right to say that we pulled or perhaps postponed the third phase
of the scheduled work, not least because the prospect of the BRS
suggested that that was sensible, which is the stage we are at
now.</div>
<a name="09012994000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, my right hon. Friend&#146;s proposal is that where a
BID is in place in an area that is likely to be subject to a BRS, the
BID body would be able to decide whether the owners of the properties
in the BID should be liable for the BID levy. A register of the BID
owners in that area would therefore have to be prepared. By enabling
property owners to pay towards the BID, extra revenue would be
available to offer occupiers a reduction on their BID payment. I think
that that is the logic behind what he has in mind and how it would
operate. In effect, it would be an offset for the occupiers, or a
cushion against a BRS, where local judgment suggested that it would
otherwise place a BID in jeopardy.</div>
<a name="09012994000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
my right hon. Friend that his proposal is elegant&#151;in many ways,
it is. If he wants to intervene, I will be interested to know the
extent to which he has discussed his proposition and approach with some
of the obvious interested organisations, such as British BIDs. I am
interested in that because clearly the proposal would break new
ground.</div>
<a name="09012994000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000245"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for
inviting me to intervene. I shall try to answer his question as quickly
as I can because interventions should be brief. I have held discussions
with the British Property Federation about the concept of a power being
available to allow a levy to be raised following a ballot of property
owners&#151;that ballot would be essential. The proposal is the
result of those discussions. I have consulted interested people, but I
have not specifically discussed it with Dr. Grail, although I would be
more than happy to do so.</div>
<a name="09012994000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000246"></a>John
Healey:</b> That is helpful. It indicates both the serious
intent and the how early the stage of examining and developing the idea
is. I shall respond to my right hon. Friend on that
basis.</div>
<a name="09012994000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012994000247"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000248"></a>John

to help.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div><a name="09012994000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000249"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I am always helpful. I am sure that the Minister
has seen the note prepared by the British Property Federation in
connection with the new clause. It claims that the new clause has the
&#147;explicit support&#148; of not only the British Property
Federation, with which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
held discussions, but the British Retail Consortium, British BIDs and
London First. If the Minister has not received a copy of that note, I
will be happy to provide him with one after the
Committee.</div>
<a name="09012994000210"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000250"></a>John
Healey:</b> As the hon. Gentleman promised, that was a helpful
and useful contribution to the Committee&#146;s debate on this
approach.</div>
<a name="09012994000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich has acknowledged,
should we be able to make a response to the concerns raised by Dr.
Julie Grail, one of the things we will need to deal with is the
principal problem of 2003: bringing property owners into the BIDs
framework. The problem at the time was that BIDs were based on the
ratings system, in which liability for rates falls on the occupier
rather than the owner in most cases. The view at that time was that
including them would have amounted to a new tax on property owners.
That is why at that stage, the provision was made elegantly for
property owners to make a voluntary contribution towards the BIDs. That
is the approach that we have followed with the Bill. I referred to that
last week in my evidence to the
Committee.</div><a name="09012994000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other principal argument for taking that approach in 2003 and in the
current Bill is provided by Cambridge Econometrics, which has looked at
evidence for the feed through of business rate rises from property
owners to occupiers. It found that the majority of the change in
business rates is passed on through reduced rents. While the formal
burden of taxation for business rates falls on occupiers, the economic
incidence&#151;the actual costs&#151;passes on to the landlords in
large part, if not in whole, in the medium term. That raises a question
about the extent to which property owners should be required to
contribute, particularly for a medium or long-term project facing
levies such as the business rate
supplement.</div><a name="09012994000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other questions about the proposition in the clause that come to
mind. There are practical questions about the suitability of a
double-lot ballot and the prospect of property owners voting to reject
a levy, and the question of not guaranteeing that any additional
contribution by property owners to the BID would be passed on to the
occupiers. Finally, there is the question of the administrative burden
on billing authorities to set up a
register.</div><a name="09012994000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say to my right hon. Friend that I will consider this further and
consider the scope for property owners to be bought more fully into the
BIDs system. I would be very pleased to meet him to discuss that
further, if he wants me to, when he is ready. I hope that, on that
basis, he will not press the new clause to a vote&#151;I think he has
indicated as much to the
Committee.</div><a name="09012994000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I return to the question of the automatic offset, which has been raised
by a number of outside organisations and is on the agenda as amendment
30. There are voices calling for that, but others are arguing the
opposite case. Let me finish, therefore, with a couple of quotes from
important and informed sources. The first is from the South Bank
Employers Group&#151;an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>association of major organisations on the south bank in the Waterloo and
Blackfriars areas&#151;which helps to deliver a BID-type benefit for
their local area through an alternative but voluntary BID levy. Members
of the group, comprising a high proportion of the largest business rate
payers in the area, decided not to propose a BID. Their view was that
the present voluntary arrangements worked extremely well in their area
and that a BID would not bring greater benefits. They have also looked
at an automatic offset and their view is that having an offset for BID
payers would be unfair. The group
said:</div><a name="09012994000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
fact that business have chosen to contribute to this fund of local
additionality...should not in any way relieve them of the
obligation to contribute to a major pan-London project like Crossrail.
This would be seriously unfair on major businesses which are not in BID
areas, whether because they have voted against the BID proposals or
because a BID proposal has not come forward, or because the area is not
seen as suitable for a
BID.&#148;</div><a name="09012994000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
Opposition Members are going to press the case for an automatic offset
to the business rate supplement for BIDs levy payers, they have to deal
with the argument of the association that represents the BIDs
themselves, which we heard in evidence last week from Dr. Julie
Grail:</div><a name="09012994000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
full offset in London would be a ridiculous and dangerous move and
would give an open door to every business community in London to go and
get itself a cheaper business rate
supplement&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Business
Rate Supplements Public Bill Committee, </i>20 January 2009; c.47,
Q200.]</div><a name="09012994000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000251"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I hear what the Minister says. Sometimes when there
is conflicting evidence, people come to different conclusions, and I
think that that is where we are at. The South Bank Employers
Group&#146;s argument would have been met in the event of a
ballot&#151;I am not going to repeat the point again after
this&#151;because that would have involved an informed choice. On the
second piece of evidence, the exemption for Crossrail would have dealt
with that issue.</div>
<a name="09012994000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, grateful
though I am to the Minister for his detailed and helpful response, and
alive as I am to the very valid points raised by the right hon. Member
for Greenwich and Woolwich, I hope that I do not damage the chances of
his proposal going forward if I commend it to the Minister for further
consideration, as well. None the less, my hon. Friends and I will seek
to press our amendment 30 to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000265"></a>John
Healey:</b> This is a fairly straightforward clause. It
enables us as a Government to set some practical arrangements on how
levying authorities should deal with a business rate supplement in
relation to properties jointly owned or occupied. It also allows them
to make arrangements in cases where the person who is liable for the
business rate supplement has died. The provisions will be technical in
nature; they will mirror powers that already exist in relation to
non-domestic rates; they are designed to ensure that it is clear where
the liability for BRS falls in very specific circumstances. I think it
therefore appropriate to deal with this in secondary legislation. The
clause gives us the power to make those regulations, and I can reassure
the Committee that no provisions made under them will affect the level
of the liability due in respect of a
property.</div><a name="09012994000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000266"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I beg to move amendment 18, in
clause 18, page 12, line 41, leave
out &#145;March&#146; and insert
&#145;January&#146;.</div><a name="09012994000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to examine the question of when the billing authority
gets formal notice of the intention to charge a levy. My understanding
of the Bill is that the levying authority has until the end of February
in the calendar year in which the BRS will come into force, which is in
the April. That is a concern because when people are given late
deadlines, things can creep towards it; my thought is to bring that
deadline back to the start of the calendar year so that the billing
authorities have more notice. I say that because, for example, where a
ballot is to be held, and it is not clear whether the BRS will go
ahead, it may take the billing authority a considerable amount of work
to put things in place in order to enact it. It is a straightforward
amendment that allows the billing authorities a little more leeway in
getting prepared for things to run smoothly when the BRS comes in at
the beginning of the financial year.</div>
<a name="09012994000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000267"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> I apologise for not having welcomed you to the
Chair earlier, Mrs. Dean, on behalf of myself and my hon.
Friends. We are delighted to see you, as are all the other members of
the
Committee.</div><a name="09012994000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have much sympathy with the amendment. It may be that March is used
because it is a standard date in local government legislation. I served
on a London borough council, which is a billing authority, for a number
of years and talked to many others who are on billing authorities. I
remember, therefore, the frustrations one often had when there was a
precepting authority that went right up to the deadline in fixing its
precept. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>That caused difficulty for the second-tier authorities in working out
their budgets. The circumstance here is similar; putting back the
deadline would make it easier for people to plan and get things in
order.</div><a name="09012994000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000268"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Sadiq Khan):</b> I, too, welcome
you to the Chair, Mrs. Dean. It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship.</div>
<a name="09012994000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
hon. Member for North Cornwall for explaining the reasons for tabling
the amendment, and I acknowledge the points made by the hon. Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst.</div>
<a name="09012994000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 18
would mean that levying authorities in two-tier authorities, and the
Greater London authority, would have to serve notice on the billing
authorities in their area, regarding the arrangements that are to apply
for their BRS for the forthcoming financial year, before 1 January. In
practice, we would expect levying authorities to give notice earlier
than this to ensure that a BRS goes out with the rates bill.</div>
<a name="09012994000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">A date of
before 1 January would be three months earlier than the date in the
Bill of 1 March. That March deadline was chosen for consistency with
the timetable for upper-tier authorities in the GLA to issue council
tax precepts for the forthcoming year, and with the budget setting
process. We are trying, therefore, to ensure that the arrangements for
BRS dovetail as far as possible with the existing administrative
arrangements, hence minimising the burden on both the levying and
billing
authorities.</div><a name="09012994000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
agreed to, the amendment would cause inconsistency because the BRS and
budget-setting/precept processes would be running to different
timetables. Also, levying authorities&#151;including the
GLA&#151;that intend to levy a BRS from 1 April 2010 could face
difficulties in the short to medium term in meeting the timetable
proposed by the amendment. The timetable is particularly tight
considering that, before the levying authority can notify the billing
authority, it will need to have prepared a prospectus, completed the
mandatory consultation and revised the proposals in response to the
consultation. I therefore respectfully ask the hon. Member for North
Cornwall to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09012994000211"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000269"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I was interested to hear what the
Under-Secretary said about what would be expected of levying
authorities. However, the concern is that what is expected and what is
delivered may be two different things. The real reason lies in what he
said about Crossrail in his closing remarks. Once again we have hit on
an issue where the Bill has been drafted to meet the Crossrail
timetable but will have effects elsewhere across the country, which is
a grave concern.</div>
<a name="09012994000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred to issues with precepting
authorities. In my constituency there is a five-member parish council
where there was a dispute between two members and the other three. The
three resigned, making the parish council inquorate and no other people
could be found to serve with the two who remained. There was a problem
in setting a precept for that year, and this was quite a controversial
time in the parish. In the end, we managed by public meeting to find
some people willing to stand and resolved the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>situation. I make that as an aside about the frustrations that billing
authorities can experience when dealing with other
authorities.</div><a name="09012994000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not heard a persuasive argument from the Under-Secretary as to why
we could not push the deadline back a bit further; we are talking about
potential applications of this Bill much wider than Crossrail. I am
concerned that, for example, where a ballot is to be held, if the
deadline for having all the regulations in place is the beginning of
March, that could allow extra leeway for the ballot to take place
later. If a deadline is pushed later there is sometimes less
impetus&#151;less momentum to get things tied up and dealt with
earlier.</div>
<a name="09012994000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
going to press this amendment to the vote because I think we have made
the point, but I hope that the Government will clearly signal their
intention in any reflections and advice they offer to local authorities
as to how a prospectus should be put together. Every effort must be
made to give as early an indication as possible to the billing
authority as to what is proposed and what is likely to occur, so that
we do not get the situation where a billing authority has to struggle
to deliver things on time for the BRS to be imposed in the financial
year.</div><a name="09012994000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000270"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> As we have discussed, in two-tier areas the
lower-tier authorities will act as the billing authority for the
purposes of BRS. Clause 18 sets out the requirements on levying
authorities in terms of notifying the lower-tier authorities in their
area of their intention to levy a BRS, so that billing arrangements can
be made in good time&#151;and I hear the points made by the hon.
Member for North Cornwall.</div>
<a name="09012994000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
provisions in this clause are: subsection (1) requires levying
authorities intending to impose a supplement to give written notice to
each billing authority in their area; subsection (2) sets out the
information that must be contained in the notice; subsection (3)
specifies when the notice must be given and subsection (4)
explains the scope and content of notices where the levying authority
intends to impose more than one supplement in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000271"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> Clause 19 sets out the arrangements that apply where
a supplement is not to be levied and collected as part of the annual
non-domestic rating cycle and where a supplement is varied in
accordance with clause 10, with the result that new bills have to be
issued during the financial year. The clause requires levying
authorities to give notice to each billing authority 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>in their area of their BRS arrangements or the variation to their
arrangements. This notice must be in writing and, if it is the first
notice for the year, must contain the same information as a notice
under clause 18, which we have discussed, would. If the notice is being
issued as a result of a variation in an existing BRS, the levying
authority must also set out the variation and the day on which the
variation is to take
effect.</div><a name="09012994000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key distinction between notices under clause 18 and clause 19 is that
notices under clause 19 will result in billing authorities incurring
extra costs because of billing outside the usual cycle. Accordingly,
clause 22, which we will come to, provides that levying authorities
must meet costs incurred by billing authorities in dealing with notices
under clause
19.</div><a name="09012994000133"></a>

for calculating the amount to be paid by each person liable to pay the
supplement. Subsection (1) requires billing authorities that
are also levying authorities to calculate the chargeable amount.
Subsection (2) applies the section to lower-tier billing
authorities that have been given notice by a levying authority under
clause 18 or 19. Subsection (3) requires lower-tier billing authorities
to calculate the chargeable amount payable by each liable person where
they have been given notice by a levying authority under clause 18 or
19. Subsection (4) disapplies the requirement under
subsection (3) on billing authorities to calculate the chargeable
amount in the case of a variation of a supplement, unless the variation
requires new calculations to be made. Subsection (5)

My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government has set out how
the Government intend to make use of these provisions in the statement
of intent. Subsection (1) enables regulations to be made for the
collection and enforcement of supplements. Subsection (2) provides for
the preparation of stand-alone regulations relating specifically to the
collection and enforcement of supplements, and also for the existing
regulations governing the collection and enforcement of non-domestic
rates to be amended so that they apply to supplements. Subsection (4)
confers a power to make regulations to address the collection and
enforcement of supplements where projects are abandoned. Subsection (3)
is not a regulation-making power; it gives the billing authorities a
power to collect and enforce payment of supplements once they have come
to an end. That is required to ensure that billing authorities can
collect the supplement from those ratepayers who have outstanding
liability.</div><a name="09012994000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000276"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> I would like take this opportunity to explain the
clause. It allows the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers to make
regulations that make provision for billing authorities to retain a
proportion of the BRS revenue they collect to meet the expenses they
incur in collection or recovery&#151;referred to in the Bill as
&#147;administrative expenses&#148;.</div>
<a name="09012994000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where BRS is
collected as part of the annual billing round, the costs will be met
from the BRS revenue. Where billing authorities decide to levy the
supplement outside the normal non-domestic collection round, the costs
of collection will not come from the BRS revenue and will instead be
met by the levying authority. Options for how administrative expenses
should be calculated will be set out in the consultation paper that we
propose to issue shortly on our proposals for secondary
legislation.</div><a name="09012994000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09012994000277"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs Dean. I have some concerns about
the clause. I preface my remarks by saying that I am very worried about
giving opportunity to any Government body to grab more money than they
need to have for a given project. I have already mentioned that parking
charges are now being used to supplement local government revenue
incomes, rather than to provide a service to local communities. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>am concerned that the same sort of thinking, in the less scrupulous of
our councils, might take place in this respect, too.</div>
<a name="09012994000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
concerns on which I seek clarification, the first of which is about the
difference in billing. Subsection (1) makes it clear that
the billing authority has the ability to recover moneys for
administrative costs from the moneys collected through the BRS project.
However, the clause then states that the authority can do that only if
the information is given prior to the beginning of the financial year,
and it seems from the impact assessment that when billing is undertaken
as a separate exercise, the cost of collection will be met from the
upper-tier authority&#146;s own resources. So, if there is good
notice for collection to be made as part of the normal collection of
rates, it is the billing authority&#146;s right to take those costs
out before it hands the money back to the levying authority. If,
however, the levying authority does not ask for a rate until after the
beginning of the financial year, it seems that that cost falls on the
upper-tier authority&#146;s own revenue budget. Therein lie the sort
of caveats that concern me&#151;such as the ability to raise money
that is not properly controlled and not transparently projected, but
which adds to local authorities&#146; income streams.</div>
<a name="09012994000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, will
the Minister clear up the issue of those two ways of charging for the
collection process? Secondly, how will we be assured, bearing it in
mind that money might be coming from the general revenue budget of a
given levying authority, that that money will be properly and
transparently accounted for, so that people can have faith that money
is not being leaked out into  other budget areas for purposes
not directly ascribed by the
Bill?</div><a name="09012994000152"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000278"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his well-articulated
concerns. I agree that we need to keep costs to a minimum. We do not
want wastage, and we need to ensure that there is a disincentive in
respect of it. One reason for trying to synchronise the collection,
with the BRS collected as part of the annual billing round, is to
minimise cost duplication. On his point about reassurance, in the
consultation for the secondary legislation we will set out the details
of the administrative costs incurred in collection or recovery. That
consultation is important. He may be reassured because he will be able
to respond to the consultation and see the other responses. He is right
that we cannot have a situation in which the upper-tier
authority&#146;s general revenue account is incurring an additional
cost because of the failure to synchronise the collections. I hope that
he will become involved in the consultation and that we can assure him
that there is no additional
wastage.</div><a name="09012994000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000279"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Perhaps the Minister can help us with an issue
regarding paragraph 3(2), and in particular 3(2)(a), on refunds and
credits. I understand the concept 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>behind the regulations, but this measure gives a permissive power for
the regulations to provide, in effect, for a refund to the billing
authorities. I do not have a problem with that, but I notice that the
refund is referred to as
being</div><a name="09012994000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
equal proportions to each billing
authority&#148;.</div><a name="09012994000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take it that that means exactly what it says, but is that always the
fairest means of carrying out the
refund?</div><a name="09012994000212"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09012994000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Might
it not be appropriate to consider a refund that does not involve equal
shares across the board, but which is in proportion to the contribution
that has been made by each billing authority? Let us say that there are
five billing authorities in a BRS scheme. Depending on how the BID is
constructed, some of the billing authorities may have put more into the
pot than others. However, as I read the regulations, the refund would
be split to give them each a fifth of any refund. However, one of those
five authorities might have contributed 30 per cent. and another 40 per
cent. of the revenue from businesses in their area, with the others
contributing rather less. Should not provision for that be reflected in
the regulations? Perhaps the same consideration ought to be given where
a BRS covers more than one top-tier authority area. The aim is to have
the extra flexibility needed to provide the just result in such
cases.</div><a name="09012994000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000280"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I can
think of a number of counties where district or borough authorities are
different sizes and have different concentrations of businesses
communities that might be affected. I look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09012994000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000281"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> I seek your guidance, Mrs. Dean, on
whether now is the appropriate point to raise an issue, because I could
not find what seemed an appropriate moment anywhere else in the Bill.
Please guide me properly if I stray out of
order.</div><a name="09012994000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is quite proper that the potentially large sums being raised for
substantial projects over a prolonged period should be accounted
for. The schedule sets the rules under which the accounting
would work, but I see nothing in the Bill that identifies where the
accounting information goes or the extent to which that is made public
to either the levy payers or the citizens in the area who are subject
to the scheme. In particular, there is nothing to show the progress
relating to the expenditure of these sums or whether the project is on
budget, according to the estimate made at the
outset.</div><a name="09012994000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
lot of clauses refer to the preparatory phase and to setting up a levy,
but there is little about monitoring the levy during the period of its
operation until such time as a refund may apply&#151;at the end of
it. There seems to be a lacuna in the middle. Will the Minister say how
that will be dealt
with?</div><a name="09012994000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000282"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I seek your guidance, too, Mrs. Dean,
because the schedule deals with refunds and credits and I am concerned
about the total lack of any comment about refunds to the taxpayer,
should the estimate for a given project be over-generous and there is a
surplus at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>the end of it. I see that refunds may be returned, but the schedule does
not specify to whom they should be returned, other than mentioning the
billing authority. Is this the correct time to mention that or should I
mention it in the debate on clause 24, which also deals partly with
this
matter?</div><a name="09012994000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000283"></a>The

this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000284"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Thank you, Mrs Dean.</div>
<a name="09012994000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
calculation of the cost of a given project sets the rate thereafter,
irrespective of how long the project lasts. The whole thing will be
framed, in terms of collection, and laid out in the initial prospectus.
I understand that. However, I am concerned that Government projections
are sometimes not as accurate as we would like them to be. I have heard
that concern echoed even more loudly at local government level over the
12 years that I have been a county councillor. Will the Minister help
us by explaining how we will have some control, other than by the
measures set out in the schedules, over the efficacy of the accounting
processes for the initial prospectus; and if the prospectus is totally
wrong, how that money might be returned to the taxpayer, bearing in
mind that some of the projects will carry on for some
time?</div>
<a name="09012994000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000285"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> I thank all hon. Members who have spoken and will
deal with each of their comments in turn by contextualising schedule
2.</div><a name="09012994000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
White Paper emphasised the importance of security and accountability to
the business community to maximise the benefits of BRS. It will
therefore be essential to have in place a robust set of accounting
arrangements, and the Bill places certain requirements on the levying
and billing authorities. As I said earlier, we will soon publish a
consultation paper setting out our proposals for secondary legislation,
including those for the accounting arrangements, and those will
complement the Bill&#146;s main provisions.</div>
<a name="09012994000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made a good point, as he often
does&#151;it pains me to say that&#151;and clearly the example he
gave applies not only to proportions in cities that we know about, such
as London, but to different proportions outside London, which the hon.
Member for North Cornwall also mentioned. That is one of the options
that should and will be looked at during the consultation. The anal
answer I can give him is that paragraph 3(1) gives us the general power
and paragraph 3(2) is just a list of examples, but he makes a good
point that we need to come back to along with other
matters.</div><a name="09012994000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Levying
authorities that impose a BRS must keep a BRS account for each one they
operate. That will be similar to the BID revenue accounts that
authorities are required to have for BIDs that are established in their
areas. When the Greater London authority enters into an arrangement
with one of its functional bodies, as set out in paragraph 3, that body
will similarly be required to keep a BRS revenue account. If two or
more levying authorities act jointly, each authority must have its own
BRS revenue account to ensure appropriate transparency and
accountability.</div>
<a name="09012994000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Ludlow made an important point about transparency during the
process and how people will be made aware of what is happening, and as
I mentioned, we will shortly set out our proposals in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>consultation paper. Local authority accounts, as he is aware, are open
to the public. Although the prospectus sets out what to do in case of
variations, I take his point about the need to see the work in progress
and how things are going. That is one of the things that we hope to
clarify during the consultation and receive comments about the best way
of doing so. He is right to say that that is particularly relevant to
BRS schemes, which by definition are long. As we know from long-term
projects, there could be a rollercoaster ride and we need to ensure
that key stakeholders are kept on side. One way of doing so is through
transparency.</div><a name="09012994000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000286"></a>Mr.
Dunne:</b> The Under-Secretary will recall from his time on
the Public Accounts Committee, on which we have both served, that the
primary scrutiny body for Parliament took the view that it would be
appropriate, as with major projects, to review the performance of the
Olympic Delivery Authority annually during construction for the
Olympics. Perhaps an annual review should also be considered for
projects such as Crossrail or other substantial projects subject to
BRS.</div><a name="09012994000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000287"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> The hon. Gentleman knows, as I do, that the current
Mayor is keen to have transparency, with all his laundry out in the
open, so I have no doubt that the GLA, the Mayor, London MPs, the
Government and businesses, whether corporations or those in Canary
Wharf, will want to ensure transparency throughout the process. The
example he gave from the PAC is a really good analogy, and he will be
aware that the National Audit Office is identifying lessons to be
learnt during the process, rather than just at the end. As we lead up
to the Olympics, the NAO is looking at how money has been spent and
whether it represents value for money. We would expect that sort of
rigour to be applied to such a project because it involves money not
only from BRS, but from general taxation, including money from
Transport for London and voluntary contributions. His point is well
made and needs to be addressed during consultation on the secondary
legislation.</div>
<a name="09012994000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also
provides for billing authorities, in the first instance, to pay BRS
revenues into their collection fund, in the same way as they do council
tax and non-domestic rate revenues. However, an important difference
between NDR and BRS is that BRS revenue will not be paid into the
central Government NDR pool, but will instead be retained locally and
transferred to the levying authority. I know that the hon. Member for
Northampton, South is concerned that central Government will somehow
gobble up this locally raised money. That is unfair because the clause
confirms that the money is retained locally, to be spent
locally.</div>
<a name="09012994000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000288"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Under-Secretary of State misunderstands me. I
have no concerns about central Government leeching some of this money
away&#151;he might be pleased to know that&#151; and I am sure that
is not the intention under the Bill. I am concerned first about
accountability, particularly with long-term projects. Secondly, I am
worried that money may be leeched away either at the billing level or
at the levying authority level, used for other purposes and rather
cleverly accounted for as part of the administrative cost. The final
point was about refunds&#151;to the taxpayer, not the billing
authority&#151;where an overestimation had been made in the initial
prospectus.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000289"></a>Mr.
Khan:</b> For the record, it was the hon. Gentleman who first
used &#147;leeching&#148;, not me, but I will use
&#147;leeching&#148; as a response to his introduction of the word.
God forbid that central Government ever leeches from local councils or
taxpayers.</div>
<a name="09012994000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns. The proposed secondary
legislation governs accounting arrangements. It needs to cover, and
will cover the following key areas: refunds to ratepayers of, for
example, unspent BRS revenue; credits and debits to the BRS revenue
account; handling of voluntary contributions; transfer of BRS revenue
from the collection fund to the BRS revenue account; and surpluses and
deficits of BRS. I take his point that we cannot have imaginative
accounting processes, whereby items other than those that the Bill
defines as administrative expenses are brought under that
cover.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000292"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Much earlier today, reference was rightly made
to the elegance of the solution proposed by the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich. I am sure the amendments that stand in my name
are not as elegant and perhaps do not do exactly what I intend them to.
However, I am grateful for the opportunity to have this debate and I am
sure the Minister will clarify what the intention is. I am very much
building on what the hon. Member for Northampton, South said about
reassuring people that if a project does not go ahead, the money will
be refunded.</div>
<a name="09012994000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
looking at my own amendment, wondering whether it is actually about
money going back to the bill payers; it is certainly about money going
back to the billing authority and that is the intention. Earlier, a
circumstance was described relating to an underspend on a project.
Previously, it was suggested that overspends are far more likely, but
there is the possibility of an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>underspend, which everybody would welcome. In that event, there is an
opportunity for that money to be passed back to its source and for it
to be refunded to the bill payers. Similarly, my amendment refers to a
situation where the Secretary of State or the relevant authority in
Wales needs, for some reason, to intervene to cancel the imposition of
a BRS, the scheme does not go ahead, and the money has to be
refunded.</div>

am</div><a name="09012994000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a provision in the Bill to allow that at present, but my amendment
would strengthen it to ensure that the money does go back. I am not
quite sure what would happen to the money if it was not returned. I
assume that there are restrictions on its being used for any other
purpose, so I suppose it would sit in an account. Whether interest on
that account could be used for other reasons is another question, but
the amendment aims to clarify and strengthen the principle that if, for
whatever reason, the scheme needs to be cancelled and the money is not
used for the purpose for which it was originally intended, it will find
its way back to those who paid it in the first
place.</div><a name="09012994000187"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000293"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> Again, I have much sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument. I hope that the circumstances where the
provision needs to be used will not arise. It is needed as a long-stop,
but I am sure that local authorities will seek to act in a way which
does not give rise to the need to use it.</div>
<a name="09012994000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have
a problem with the concept, although I note that the Local Government
Association expressed reservations about the clause. I apologise to
you, Mrs. Dean, for breaking my word&#151;I said that I
was not going to mention ballots again&#151;but in the absence of a
ballot, it seems that there is a need for that sort of long-stop for
that eventuality. The LGA makes a fair point. I hope that the
association is right. It has repeatedly stated that it cannot envisage
a BRS-funded project going through without the full agreement of the
business community. There is, dare I say it, one simple way to ensure
that. As such a provision is not there, the clause is necessary;
equally, however, it is important to have that reassurance that in the
event of its being terminated, there will be a guaranteed refund to
those who have
contributed.</div><a name="09012994000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000294"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I shall seek a little leeway here and simply ask
whether my hon. Friend feels that this is a particularly good reason
for at least allowing the ratepayers in areas affected by such projects
to be involved every year to do some of the scrutiny that we are
talking
about.</div><a name="09012994000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000295"></a>Robert
Neill:</b> My hon. Friend makes a characteristically well
judged and helpful point. He is right. We discussed the need for
ongoing involvement in the rolling out of the project and its
implementation in an earlier sitting, and Ministers were sympathetic to
our argument. I am sure that they will take it on board. My hon. Friend
reinforces the point that he made forcefully in our earlier debate. For
all those reasons, I believe the amendment has merit. I agree with the
hon. Member for North Cornwall that there may be different approaches
to the wording, but the most important point is that Ministers should
take away the idea and give us a
commitment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000296"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I understand the reason for having the
safeguard in the Bill, but I am a little concerned about the risk of
its being used by a dissident group who, let us say, lost a ballot on a
BRS and wanted to scupper the whole venture by maliciously appealing to
central Government to stop it. The terms of subsection
(2) &#151;which deal with cases in which there might have
been a breach of undertakings, or, at least, the levying authority is
alleged to have acted inconsistently with the information
provided&#151;include more than the prospectus, which is mentioned in
paragraph (a) and which one would expect to be entirely accurate, and
formal variations to the prospectus, mentioned in paragraph (b).
Subsection (c) refers to information
provided</div><a name="09012994000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
the course of consultation on the
proposal&#148;.</div><a name="09012994000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been to many consultations undertaken by local authorities on
various matters, and one hears things said by council officers or by
councillors in the heat of debate which might not be an entirely
accurate description of what the process will deliver. I am nervous
that someone who maliciously wanted to scupper a BRS could use an
inconsistency between something said</div>
<a name="09012994000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the course
of
consultation&#148;</div><a name="09012994000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">by
a relevant council officer and the implementation of the BRS
proposition in an attempt to invoke the power to cancel. That, of
course, would mean that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local
Government would have to deal with people pestering him to use the
power to stop the whole thing going ahead. I can see a potential
risk.</div>
<a name="09012994000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000297"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am not entirely clear whether the right hon.
Gentleman is addressing his remarks to the amendment or to the wider
provisions of the clause. He may recall a previous debate about the
power to cancel being given to the Secretary of State or, in Wales, the
relevant authority. An amendment in my name sought to ensure that a
person would have to demonstrate, rather than merely have to think,
that there are significant problems, because there may be a change in
Government or different local issues, and if there were any coincidence
between the views of those who had opposed the ballot or imposition
locally and the views of the new Government, the Secretary of State
might on occasion use the power unfairly or precipitously. My earlier
amendment sought to strengthen the provision in that earlier clause
but, sadly, it was not accepted.</div>
<a name="09012994000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000298"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:</b> I understand the purpose of the amendments. We
debated &#147;can demonstrate&#148; and &#147;thinks&#148; on
an earlier occasion, but I note that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments would not remove not subsection (2)(c) from the clause, but
a series of paragraphs from subsection (3). It seems to me,
however, that subsection (2)(c) is the nub of the problem,
because it provides people who seek maliciously to frustrate a BRS with
considerable scope to use it to demonstrate that there is an
inconsistency between how the BRS is being implemented and its
prospectus or presentation.</div>
<a name="09012994000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
entirely convinced by the amendments, but there is a problem, and I
hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government will
give some thought to it, because I should hate him and his colleagues
to spend a disproportionate amount of time having to fend off malicious
grumbles from disaffected parties who are on the losing side of a BRS
ballot.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div><a name="09012994000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000299"></a>John
Healey:</b> I have to say to the hon. Member for North
Cornwall that we are not legislating with any change of Government in
mind, and, frankly, looking across the Committee Room, I must say that
it remains quite hard to envisage the prospect. With the clause, we are
trying to establish a principle and a significant power ultimately to
cancel a BRS, without being too rigid by prescribing in legislation how
we require&#151;rather than empower&#151;the Secretary of State to
respond in particular circumstances. Judgments will in the end require
tests of fact and tests of degree if they are to be made appropriately
in the circumstances.</div>
<a name="09012994000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do follow
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s general line of argument. He wants to
provide additional protection for business tax payers, but my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, from a different
point of view, which demonstrates the value of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>debate, is concerned about creating too great a scope for certain groups
of taxpayers to use the provisions either to put pressure on the
Secretary of State or to frustrate the progress and the implementation
of a business rate supplement.</div>
<a name="09012994000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09012994000300"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The point that the right hon. Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich makes is easily met by the Government simply saying that
the provision places on the creators and proposers of a project a
greater need for rigour, which is no bad thing in these circumstances.
