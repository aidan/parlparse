it is more directly for The Children’s Mutual. David White, the

one regard, it is not surprising that that would be the case, if you
tell parents, “Here’s some free money for you

did the fund result in additional saving or just a transfer from other
sources?<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000020">&#160;</a>

                           </div>the contribution from the Government to ISAs and
pensions, compared with the child trust fund. If you look at the
take-up rates on ISAs and pensions, they are well behind the 72 or 74%
on child trust funds. One thing that is interesting when you think
about the child trust fund is that people assume that because
£250 is passed over as a voucher, real money is being passed
into the account. We give tax relief on pensions, and that is real
money that is being passed into pensions—it is just done in a
different way. We give tax-free growth on ISAs, and that is money
that—<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000021">&#160;</a>

people, “Here’s a cheque for £250 to put in your
ISA,” a lot of people would accept it. The question is whether
the child trust fund encouraged additional saving or just transferred
saving from other sources. There has been disagreement between
witnesses about this, and we have not as yet had any clear evidence
that there has been additional saving. Have you got any clear evidence
to that effect?<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000022">&#160;</a>

                           </em> We are a children’s savings
specialist. Our view when the child trust fund was launched was that we
should be part of it. It seemed strange to be a children’s
savings specialist and not to be part of it. Our view was that to make
it profitable for our business, we needed to do it on a large scale.
These are relatively small accounts in terms of value. We came to the
conclusion that the operation needed to be large scale to achieve
economies of scale. We also recognised that for the economics to work
for our business, it was crucial to get more money into the accounts
beyond the Government money. We built a model that involved working
with a range of distribution partners, getting as many of the accounts
on board as possible and working creatively to encourage further
contributions into the accounts. We were pretty successful in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000030">&#160;</a>

had 200,000 new accounts, a large proportion of which had money paid in
on top of the Government money. That was not just from people at the
higher end of the income spectrum, but from across the spectrum. The
model facilitated people from across the spectrum to get our accounts.
For example, we had distribution partnerships with Asda, Boots and a
range of building societies and banks. That allowed people to access
the accounts in a way that is not possible with some other
products.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000031">&#160;</a>

got a nudge from the voucher, which encouraged them to do something. It
was relatively simple for them to find out what to do. To give a
comparison, it was a lot easier to set up a child trust fund than a
deposit account. That simplicity helped a lot of people. The other
thing that worked was the concept of the stakeholder account. In a
world where you regulate either the distribution channel or the
product, the regulation around the product gave people a sense of
comfort that it was an okay
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000033">&#160;</a>

have been paying £25 a month. Clearly, with different income
groups, you have different amounts being paid. For the lower-end income
group, the average amount is nearer £18 or £19 a month,
but that will still leave you with a substantial pot at age
18.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One thing that
is quite interesting, if you look at where we are to date, is that if
you take one of our higher-income groups, roughly half of them were
paying £26 a month. Compare that £26 a month with
£19 from the lower income group. If you take it, roughly, to
today and allow for the additional Government contributions that would
have been paid to that lower-income amount, the pots are almost exactly
the same. It would be about £2,500 today. I guess that one of
the things that we saw with child trust funds is that those sorts of
sum will provide children with opportunity at age 18 that they would
not have had without the pot.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000048">&#160;</a>

child trust fund is to develop the savings habit and engage with
financial institutions. I am interested to know what practical steps
you are taking to engage with the young people for whom the funds are

different at 18 from how they would have been if you had not engaged

done. For the children, we have sent out various games that encourage
them to think about what money is and how they might use it. We have
done some work with skills, in terms of providing booklets for schools.
In terms of what difference it will make when they are 18, I am not
sure at the moment—it is still a long way away—but I
think that we have seen, through the period that the child trust fund
has been around, a growth in quite a number of those things. The
charity PFEG, which some of you might have come across, has moved
forward quite significantly over that period of time.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000050">&#160;</a>

out to support it which, again, was about games, and the accounts that

                           </em> It may be worth my saying a few words
generally about credit unions and their role with child trust funds. I
have kept quiet up until now, largely because we don’t have
anything like the scale of child trust funds that Children’s
Mutual has. We have 900,000 savers. There are no concrete figures in
the sector, but the number of child trust funds is between 15,000 and
20,000, so it is comparatively
small.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
experience with schools is slightly different, in that we find that
what is most effective is encouraging children to save rather than
teaching them about it. Some of you will have heard me say many times
that all our experience tells us that you cannot tell people to save.
People only value savings when they have them. The trick becomes how we
can get people not just to have savings but to be saving, rather than
just encouraging them to do it. Our experience with schools is that the
more immediate, tangible thing that gets children saving is bringing in
a few pennies and starting to put something aside, starting to save for
something in particular. It is building a habit of saving per se. I
would not take from that a general statement that therefore child trust
funds don’t do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000058">&#160;</a>

of our 900,000 members, we have 100,000 junior savers. We have an awful
lot more people who are saving for small things in schools than we have
whose parents are contributing to a child trust fund. I don’t
think you can generalise, but our experience is that the more tangible
the savings are, the better, in terms of the children’s approach
and their building lifelong saving habits.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000059">&#160;</a>

reasonably supportive of is the ResPublica idea. That is based on
effectively maintaining the CTF infrastructure, but you create funds
that can then be used to support looked-after children, maybe disabled
children and maybe those at the lower end of the scale. That fund is
effectively provided by various interested parties in the market. There
is something in that. In the absence of any Government money, that idea
is worth looking

would like to see the child trust fund mechanism running up until the
launch date of that account. That allows those children and parents to
do something in the period from 3 January through to whenever the
launch date is. At the moment, they are in a place where they will just
be confused, and, as a provider, I am not sure that I can actually
provide anything to them, because I have this new account coming down

should have pointed out that there are an additional 400,000 people

higher percentage of the population

were very supportive of the saving gateway all along, and one of the
challenges for our sector, with both any future junior ISA or future

members, which are bigger than the smallest building societies, are
still small businesses. It will be a challenge persuading them to put
energy into designing and bringing forward new products and services
when such accounts have been pulled away at the last minute. There will

would have a massive impact on the sector, and that we would produce a
disproportionate amount of that, considering the present scale of the
sector. So, it was just very disappointing. Moving forward, whether we
are talking about junior ISAs or any other ways in which the Government
might encourage people to save, there will be a problem in getting
people to put the time in

thinking on it. We did consistently tell the Treasury that we thought
some things about it were slightly counter-intuitive. One was the
two-year cycle—in our experience, there is not much that happens
in anyone’s life on a two-year cycle. We always said that that
just does not seem

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the biggest single things to get people to start a savings habit is
to do something better for Christmas. People on low incomes spend a
significantly higher proportion of their income on Christmas than
people on higher incomes. An easier way to get people to start saving
is by their saving for something—for a tangible thing—and
to not get to January being hugely in debt with Christmas. We
consistently said to the Treasury, “We know that in our sector
people will save for a year, withdraw the money in November, have
Christmas and do the same the following year.” That would have
fitted within the saving gateway, but the two-year feature seemed
counter-intuitive.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000107">&#160;</a>

entirely supported the matched savings, was that matching money is not
the only way, in our experience, to incentivise savings. The ease of
channels—if you want to use the technical term for the
industry—is equally important. If you can make saving like
falling off a log, people are much more likely to do it than simply
with match funding.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000108">&#160;</a>

slightly sceptical that 50p was possibly—as we said in the

on slightly less, but having said that, it was a minor point in the

were very confident about it, because it seemed to have all-party

“Look, the £25 maximum would probably be quite a large
amount of money per month for people on the lowest incomes.” We
have a lot of people in our sector who are saving £1 or
£2 a week. That only produces £50 or £100 a year,
but it can have quite a massive impact for people. Some of you will
have heard me say many times that it is not just the economic value of
£100 or £150; it is, for want of a better word, the
psychological value of it. It is what it does to people’s
confidence that they have, probably for the first time, a few hundred
pounds built up over a year or two. It gives them some sense that they
are more in control. They will have credit commitments at the same
time, but it is really important to feel that there is something of a
buffer. Whether through the savings gateway or some other initiative,
we think that the Government can encourage—and needs to
encourage—more people to get that better balance between what
savings they have, however small, and their
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000111">&#160;</a>

society that “savings” is not a defined word.
“Bank” is a defined word—you cannot call yourself
a bank if you are not a bank, with all that that means
regulatory-wise—but “savings” is not well defined.
We saw that with the Farepak collapse. A lot of people thought that the
money that they were giving to the company was safe and protected. For
an individual, it is a fine line. How many people understand what a
protected deposit is? Well, I think many more of us do now that five
banks have failed, but before that, not many people understood it. A
pre-payment for a good feels like your money should be safe, but it is
not. I think that one of the areas that we should look at collectively
at some point is being much clearer about what savings is, as opposed
to pre-payment for a good that might be at risk if the firm goes
bust.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000113">&#160;</a>

you start saving. You cannot really have a Committee meeting like this
without mentioning “Nudge” and all those things, but it
is one of those things that does not quite fit with how we behave. We
have always encouraged our members—they have really understood

is that credit unions have now made 300,000 loans to people who would

opportunity to say to somebody, “Why don’t you save

getting a new job that is slightly higher paid. That is the right time

have cash— but actually you can deduct from either your payroll

earlier that convenience is key, that is a fantastic incentive to save.
It is like falling off a log. It’s that old maxim: what you
haven’t had, you don’t miss. If it’s come out of
your payroll or even your benefit—it could be just a pound or

Lyonette:</strong>
                           </em> We recently did some work and found that
credit unions are active in more than 500 schools. That is
quite impressive for organisations as small as us. It is not our main
business to provide financial education. Again, our approach was very
much to work with the practical. We found that it encourages children
to put a few pence aside to buy something in particular—not the
economics idea that you need to put away three months of your outgoings
and all those things. It has to be practical and make sense for that
child. We have found that that also has an impact on the parents. The
parents are much more likely to use the credit union if they’ve
seen their children being involved in something. When I say,
“involved”, it also means running it in school.
It’s a very practical thing. You learn other skills as well, not
just the habit of saving. You are learning how to run a business of
collecting money and all the maths and business skills that go with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000124">&#160;</a>

industry for dealing with these incredibly difficult decisions and
helping to recapitalise some of the most disadvantaged people. It
sounds to me as though you read “Nudge” before the Prime
Minister did, in terms of making it incredibly easy for people to save.
A couple of things occur to me: one is the point you made about
channels. Is it your view that, even with the saving gateway, there
were still insufficient channels available for some of Britain’s
poorest families to make a savings decision?<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, it
concerns me that in many of the savings examples that you have
described, people were not saving for the long-term future, such as
retirement or pensions, but for Christmases and
holidays, which are

                           </div>worthy, but not the long-term aim of the saving gateway. Can anything be
done to encourage people—particularly women—to save for
an uncertain financial
future?<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000126">&#160;</a>

Lyonette:</strong>
                           </em> There are two elements to that, so pick me
up if I do not cover them both. The issue of channels was not so much
about creating more channels within what we already had. The challenge
for our sector, which is something we have engaged with the coalition
on, is how we can make a step change in the scale of the sector. Just
doing more of what the Government have supported us to do over the past
four years, which is incredibly valuable and is seen as a good value
for money Government project, will not in itself make for a sustainable
sector to serve this
marketplace.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
thing that we have been pushing is not so much the channels per se, but
the partnership between our sector and the Post Office, which I think
is really exciting—you might expect me to say that. Can you
imagine if you could walk into any one of the 11,500 post offices and
transact with your credit union? That is good for the Post Office
because it brings it revenue and it is good for the credit unions
because it is much cheaper than building their own bricks and mortar.
It gives us universal coverage across the country, which is another
reason why the Minister said he was concerned about the saving gateway
the other day. It also helps the coalition because of the bill payment
side that we were proposing to introduce. That would fulfil their
commitment to getting cheaper utility bills for people using
Post Office card accounts. It is a huge benefit to people
if they can save a couple of hundred pounds a year on
cheaper utilities and gain access to cheaper goods by buying online.
Those are both significant things that the Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions is keen to
encourage.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
us, the channels issue is about how we make that step change. Compared
with the scale of Government support in the past four years, it is a
much easier and better value thing to do than to keep doing the same or
to salami slice what is already
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Your
second point was about the relationship between short-term and
long-term savings. I accept that the credit union product range does
not encourage people to put money aside for a pension. I often ask at
pensions events how on earth we can encourage the population to take
responsibility for their retirement and build such a habit in the short
term when people do not take savings seriously. To me, it is patently
obvious that the people who are most likely to look after themselves
for their retirement have already started to look after themselves with
a savings habit in the shorter term. With all the other concerns about
the value of pensions in the future, it seems to me that you will not
get a significant number of people to take that seriously unless we are
also getting them to do the short and medium-term things. We have to
start somewhere—savings habits are savings habits and products
follow.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
must challenge some of the myths about how people on low incomes cannot
save. That is not true. It is about giving people the right incentives
to do so. As your colleague said, people will see how they feel as a
result of saving £100 or £200. The benefit that comes
from that is so much more than the economic
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000131">&#160;</a>

this innovative way of allowing people to save from their payroll and
their benefit

into short-term and long-term savings, perhaps by going down the
superannuation route? Again, that would nudge people into saving for
the long term when it is not something that they would think about on a
daily

it, ABCUL is the Association of British Credit Unions so we represent
members in England, Scotland and Wales. The vast majority of credit
unions in Northern Ireland, and certainly those that serve the majority
of the 450,000 people in the north, are represented by the Irish League
of Credit Unions in
Dublin.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000135">&#160;</a>

a long time, Northern Ireland has been a part of the credit union world
in the UK that is not often mentioned in this building. But because
there are now proposals from the Treasury for credit unions in the
north of Ireland to be regulated through the Financial Services
Authority or its successor, I think that we will hear a lot more about
how successful credit unions in the north have already
been.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000136">&#160;</a>

those of you who are not aware, nearly 50% of the population use credit
unions in the north of Ireland. That is quite a figure. If you look
around the world, credit unions in most major developed countries
represent between 20% and 25% of the population—in the States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and now many parts of south America and
Asia. Credit unions are much bigger generally there than they are here
in England, Scotland and Wales. The north of Ireland is more in keeping
with that trend than the market share we have here in England, Scotland

seems to me that the saving gateway idea would be a considerable boost
to credit unions. The same person would not necessarily always be the
saver or the borrower at the same time, but that is the whole basis on
which banks and building societies have depended. There is a bit of
community coming together there, and we are all aware and perhaps agree
that the importance of credit unions is that they are able to offer a
form of credit to people—in the kind of situation that Yvonne
mentioned, for example—rather that actually deepening their
poverty instead of helping it. So, this would have induced a lot of
business for credit
unions.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000139">&#160;</a>

Lyonette:</strong>
                           </em> I think you are right, in the sense that
credit unions are what you might call the very old-fashioned,
traditional form of deposit takers, taking in savings from some people
and lending that out to someone else. We do not have wholesale funding
at all. Now that of course begs the question. The real challenge for
credit unions is actually to attract those savings, not to make the
loans.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000140">&#160;</a>

suggest that the people who are saving in a saving gateway would
probably not be saving enough money to provide the cash pot that the
credit union can make

			Column number: 54<a class="bkMark" name="Column54">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the loans from. Those people will contribute to the
pot, but the credit unions that are most successful span a range of
incomes and of ages—people typically tend to be a little more
likely to be net savers as they get older. Really the challenge for
credit unions—hence the partnership with the Post Office, and
being able to have universal web access—is those people on
slightly higher incomes, so that people can use credit unions because
they are good value for a whole range of incomes and not simply because
we are asking people to save out of a charitable act. That will happen
for a few people, but not by enough to make it work. Our challenge is,
you are right, to get those savings in. I think that the sort of
savings that our successful credit unions bring in are at a higher
level than those that would come from saving gateway, although they
would clearly contribute to the
pot.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
example, some of our strongest community credit unions now have a very
nice mix of people whose main source of income is benefit—they
are very small savers and, in their terms, significant borrowers, but
that is of loans for a few hundred pounds here and there. However, to
fund that, the credit unions have people saving into cash ISAs. They
are getting really attractive market rates for those cash ISAs, and
that brings in enough savings from middle-income people so that you can
then make those loans to the people who need them, at much better rates
than they would get in the commercial sector. There is a real balance.
I would not rely just on the saving gateway as the source of the
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000142">&#160;</a>

response to Claire, I noted that you said that there was a perception
that people on lower incomes could not or should not be saving. This
morning we heard evidence from the IFS. Its representative said very
clearly that one of the criticisms of the saving gateway and child
trust fund was that it was not really in the interests of the customers
to save by using Government money, because if people were on a low
income they would be better off spending the money at the time. He
questioned whether it was advisable to encourage people to save. Am I
interpreting you correctly in saying that that is

whole idea of whether we behave as rational economic beings all the
time. As I said, conventional wisdom says I should pay off all my debt
before I save. Actually, we have 900,000 people who will tell you that
that is not the most powerful way to readjust your balance of savings
and credit. You need to be putting something aside while you are still
repaying your debt, especially in our case where our members are now
repaying much of their debt from the growth fund loans we have made in
the last four years, and they are making savings by paying an awful lot
less in their debt—perhaps £200 or £220 credit
costs on a loan of a few hundred pounds. If you are making that kind of
saving from paying less on your credit, it is much easier to put some
of that aside in

Committee at the time, and it appeared to us that there was cross-party
support for the saving gateway and its development. We did not have any
reason to think otherwise. We certainly were not thinking during the
election that something that had developed so far would be pulled. We
understand the financial situation, but pulling it for financial
reasons would be the only reason. We did not foresee there being
another reason to pull the

do not think our members are necessarily looking for that, either. We
are a smaller entity, so we do not have the IT systems development
costs of the building societies or banks. However, our focus was on
getting ready to bring this forward. In a small business where you have
a couple of staff, that meant taking your eye off all the other things
that you could have been doing to help yourself grow and serve more
people. The challenge for us is not so much a question of compensation
or anything like that. The challenge is that we will have a job
persuading some of our members—whoever is in government,
whatever the new scheme is—to put the effort in to get to what
felt like the 11th hour and have it pulled. The Minister spoke at our
all-party group reception in the summer and he did explain and said
that that must have been very frustrating for people. The issue is
simply about moving forward. How does the sector convince itself to do

                           </em> Thank you for inviting us. It is a
pleasure to have an opportunity to talk more about the submission. The
starting point to my comments, is that at a time of clear economic
uncertainty, one of the things we feel, and families tell us, is that
what would help them with their finances is support to enable them to
get their finances in order, not only now but to enable them to plan
for their children’s future. We have just undertaken a major
survey of around 10,000 families’ views around the country, and
a large proportion of them—24%—said that one of the
things that kept them awake at night was their children’s
future. Another 38% said that finances kept them awake. So we know that
finances press hard on families’ worries about their
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that the child trust fund was a really important step to help
families plan for their future and build an asset that their children
could rely on in future, but it would also get them in the habit of
saving. We know from all the evidence that the families who are least
likely to save are inevitably those with least money. The evidence that
we have seen coming through the child trust fund is that the largest
amount of money is actually getting to those families on lowest income,
with 50% of the funds going to those on less than £16,000, and
also that the take-up has been good, with a real increase in families
taking up savings, with up to 50% of families where there is an active
provider doing so. Clearly, that can build for those families who are
least likely to save in the first instance, but also for those children
who will most benefit and be least likely to have that financial saving
in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000165">&#160;</a>

Longfield:</strong>
                           </em> I do. I think saving is about habit. If
that is wrapped up in wider support that is there on a constant basis
for families, that helps support and encourage them to save for the
future, that can be a real catalyst—the nudge—that makes
them do that. You also have the potential for a really good
partnership. I know you have had people throughout the day from the
financial institutions, which can use the marketing powers and
experience they have and reach out to families and help them to start
to put quite modest investments into their trust funds. When those add
up—and we are talking now about £24 being the average
investment—over time, you are talking about nearly
£10,000 of savings. Clearly, we all know that the future is
uncertain for our young people. Given decisions that have been made on
higher education, that could be a real boost that would enable children
to make real choices. At the moment, if you are from a middle class
family, you are likely to do it anyway. If you are not, it is something
that is less likely to be there. Therefore, that could really be the
bridge that enables futures to open
up.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000169">&#160;</a>

Longfield:</strong>
                           </em> Clearly, there are choices to be made.
Personally, I think that the universality of the scheme is important.
It reflects a wider concern that we all benefit from children being
brought up and that if we support all parents to get into the savings
habit we will see those children have assets for the future, so it is
money well spent. If you look at the proportion of money that goes to
those on lower incomes, you will see that a vast amount of money is
going into the trust funds of those with the least income. It is a
simple system, and one that people understand. It is a system that
everyone can feel part of. Because all children receive it, it has now
become part of life, and we have some examples of teachers using it as
part of their own financial literacy and capability. They know that it
is something that is part of all their children’s lives. That is
an important lesson, and a factor that we should take into account.
Clearly, however, there are choices that can be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000171">&#160;</a>

important because it does not stigmatise families with disabled
children, which is why there tends to be a good uptake in benefits from
families with disabled children when there is a universal element.
However, given the current financial climate, I think that there is
merit in looking at some of the alternative proposals, such as
ResPublica’s ABC account, which sets out asset building for
children. Effectively, you would use means-testing to create some kind
of fund that could be reinvested back into the most disadvantaged
families.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000172">&#160;</a>

the introduction, and that proposal is welcome in many ways, but one of
the things that has been very reassuring about many of the decisions
that have been made over the past few months is the commitment not to
change structures where they do not need to be changed for the sake of
it. I think that we do have a structure here. There has been a massive
investment in getting the information out to parents, and it is
becoming very well known. For very little money, that could be
maintained and built upon. If we change the system, we would have to
not only reinvest in a completely new mechanism, but start to get that
information out to others, which is bound to cause confusion. There
would also be a time delay. On the grounds of keeping things simple,
there is much to be said for building upon what is already there and
already
works.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000174">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I definitely agree; it is about building on the
solid base that we have. However, we have to keep it in mind that child
trust funds, particularly for disabled children, work so well because
there are no alternative savings products that work for families with
disabled children, mainly because of the penalties that are inbuilt
within the benefits system. That said, we have talked to many parents
who have had officials question whether the child trust fund is an
asset. They then see a reduction in their benefits, which is a bit
worrying. I think that it is really essential that we have some form of
asset-building mechanism that recognises the extra cost incurred by
having a family with a disabled child. That is why the payments that
came through the child trust fund were so important. The Government
have said that they will redirect some of those payments to short break
provision. Short break provision for families with disabled children is
essential, but it is not mutually exclusive to building towards their
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One key
anxiety of parents with disabled children is that when their children
go through transition—around age 14 to 24, depending on the
child—they do not have any assets, and that tends to be when
life becomes very expensive: when they move from much better
children’s service provision to adult care, particularly social
care, and have to subsidise their own care. That is when that lump sum
could be extremely useful, in tie-over. I am not saying that it should
subsidise inadequate state provision, but it can bridge that gap. My
concern is that if we do not continue to recognise the extra costs that
families with disabled people incur and their difficulty finding
appropriate asset-building mechanisms, those children will be the most
disadvantaged, and when they come to 18, they will not have the extra
money that they need to bridge the gap during
transition.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000176">&#160;</a>

think that it is fair to say that family life is complicated and
complex. One reason why we are so in favour of this as a positive idea
is that we know that good intentions often get lost in the day-to-day
busyness of life. We also know that a lot of families absolutely have
all the best intentions for their children around the birth of the
child, and that is a moment to capture, but undoubtedly, some families,
for whatever reason, will not take advantage of it. They may lose it;
they may not understand it; they may not be prompted. It may mean that
they do not think that it is appropriate for them. The vast
majority—85% is a high take-up rate—do. That means
unreservedly that it is being met positively by

incentive built within it, and that is why the uptake was fairly high.
The concern that we had was that people were not really getting the
proper financial information and advice that they needed, so families
really were not sure what impact building an asset through the child
trust fund would have on their other benefit income. That
disincentivised some families with disabled children; they ended up in
quite complex arguments with local officials about what that asset
meant. That is of real concern to us, because it was effectively one of
the only saving mechanisms.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000182">&#160;</a>

is another great asset that we have been able to release from the
private sector. They will market to parents, make contact with parents
and promote this in an active way. From that, it seems that parents are

estimated savings from not having the child trust fund are about
£500,000,000 a year. If you had £500,000,000 a year, what do you

and have a great debate about it. I think the starting point would be
that both are important. You can spend money on actively engaging with
families to help reduce poverty, and you can look at giving financial
support—that is important, too—but we do not necessarily
have to choose between them. There are choices to be made that do not
look at putting children and families first. We can look beyond that.
Information has been widely disseminated that shows that families with
children have been adversely affected by some of the decisions around
cuts so far. From our point of view, that is the wrong place to start.
Actually, they have already been hit—a lot of the cuts are
cumulative. Both of the approaches are very important: we need to help
parents get out of poverty now but we also need to help them plan for
the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000190">&#160;</a>

to see that drop off the table would be really worrying, particularly
for groups such as low income families and disabled children, who are
very asset
poor.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000198">&#160;</a>

further question, one of the things that makes the child trust fund
work is that it is wrapped up in wider support around things such as
Sure Start, so that there

			Column number: 61<a class="bkMark" name="Column61">&#160;</a>
                           </div>is added value and benefit from running these kinds of things alongside
each other. The fact that you have Sure Start people who are actively
engaged with families to help build their own strengths and assets for
the future means that they can also advise and support those families
not only on how they can make the most of savings like this but on how
they can build their own financial capability. Many Sure Start centres
have advice sessions, drop-in sessions and the like which actively help
families build their own financial security for the future. This is a
powerfully important tool to help them do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000199">&#160;</a>

from the Institute for Fiscal Studies this morning that it is not
necessarily in the interest of lower-income families to save. It
suggested to us that in fact money ought to support income or pay down
debt or whatever before families start saving. I would be interested to
hear your comments on that, and on whether you think people at the
lower income level have reason to
save.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000200">&#160;</a>

second question is a follow-up to the previous one. The choice is
paying down debt or the child trust fund savings account and so on.
There is obviously an argument going on about deficit reduction, which
is important and all the rest of it, but how would you say the child
trust fund’s impact on families has a wider impact in the
community? I was interested in your comment about how it plays out in
the Sure Start in terms of general financial responsibility. If we are
looking at deficit reduction versus these kinds of measures, what are
the on-costs to the economy of removing

report of what was said this morning and I think that is a little bit
simplistic. I guess that lots of people sitting around the table here
would have had payments that their parents made—often £1
or £2 a week—over many years. Certainly I remember having
three or four of those. They added up to something as heady as about
£250 by the time I was 16. It was part of what we did; a small
amount was put away as part of the habit of saving for the future. Some
£250 did not release an immense amount, but it was important
enough to be treated as an asset about which a decision could be made
that could actually do something really valuable.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000203">&#160;</a>

whether you had to spend every penny you had no matter how small your
income was. There are positive habits around saving, on which we would
probably all agree. Parents want to save for their children. They are
clearly very worried about their children’s financial future and
they know that many of the things they thought they could take for
granted in the past might not be there in there future. We are talking
about 17 or 18 years into the future. It is something that I think
parents want to do and see as being a responsible thing for them to do.
In that way, they can be helped and encouraged to get there.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000204">&#160;</a>

terms of opportunity costs, clearly if we can encourage children to
understand finances, budget for themselves and plan for their future,
there are immense benefits we can talk about in terms of how they can
run their own lives in the future and the kind of skills they can gain
from that. But in terms of distinct opportunity costs, that would
probably take a bit of a longer session with a few others here as

people. It is really important to avoid that, and keeping it simple
needs to be the absolute starting point, in terms of where we look in
the future. There clearly will be a gap in terms of take-up of the
system as well. When we get into language such as “junior
ISA”, that feels far removed from what many families have
experience of, and that will add to the difficulties in encouraging
families and explaining to them what that means.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000211">&#160;</a>

that the language of ISAs is far removed from the vast majority of

concerns and problems with their finances at the moment—we know
from our own children’s centres that the demand for debt
counselling sessions, advice, support about finances and debt financing
is high—means that this is an issue which is not a luxury for
most families. It is absolute reality for an awful lot of families. The
value of this method is that it tackles that at the birth of a child.
You have a window there, where all families would say that they want to
do the best for their children. They are prepared to make sacrifices at
that point, and we can harness that. The habits that they can get into
really will build a valuable asset for the future, so the answer to
your question is yes. Also, that is what families want to do; they want
to get into those habits.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000214">&#160;</a>

that those families who are just coping have, in the main, the best
possible intentions, but life events knock them off course. A loss of
housing here, a relationship difficulty here, problems with work or
loss of a job there, mean that those good intentions often get knocked
sideways and can constantly set people back. The beauty of this is that
it sets people up in a way that they can build on at their own pace and
in their own way, and they can really invest for their
children’s future. On the anecdote about the school being able
to use this, the fact that the fund is part of life for all children
means that it becomes part of the grain of the way that people live.
Schools can use that within their own lessons, confident that it
affects all

                           </em> There are two benefits, one linked to the child
and one linked to the parent and the wider family. In terms of the
child, disabled children have told us and many other organisations that
they feel financial hardship on their family, mainly because the costs
incurred through disability affect not only the immediate family, but
the wider family as well. Many disabled children grow up thinking that
they should not save and that they should invest within state benefits,
because if they save they will just have to spend it on a wheelchair, a
piece of equipment or a housing adaption that they could not get
funded. Seeing an asset grow with you is a great way of giving disabled
children a positive attitude and confidence that they can build assets
and can contribute towards their finances. That is something that
disabled people have found very difficult, because historically they
have been one of the most financially excluded and dependent groups,
through state regulation and state policy.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000216">&#160;</a>

the family, families with disabled children feel great anxiety about
what the future holds for their children, and a lot of that is bound up
with finance. We hear a lot about families with children with learning
difficulties, who ask, “What happens when I die? What happens to
that child when they transition?” This method guarantees that
during that transition bracket there will be some stability. We cannot
say that there will be definite stability in adulthood because of the
inadequate funding of social care. There is, however, some kind of
stability, not only for the parents, but for the wider family as well,
who are concerned for the child’s financial
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000217">&#160;</a>

things are not going to happen. To be able to ingrain some of these
habits around building for the future, personal responsibility and the
fact that small savings can actually build into something worth while,
is a worthy and worth while thing to do. In terms of families, not only
are you putting in place the habits of finance for children, but these
children will also be the parents of the future, so actually you are

reassured by many of the things that they have heard, certainly in
terms of some of the announcements around Sure Start and two, three and
four-year-olds; they are very good. But evidence is out
there—clearly, it is not my evidence—that shows that
children and families are taking quite a hit here, and often they are
the ones on a low income or on the margins.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000220">&#160;</a>

figures on those who have said that they stay awake at night and worry,
24% of those are families who actually earn between £40,000 and
£50,000, so there are many families who are doing their best.
They are working hard, but they have got reductions in the child care
element of the tax credit, they are losing their child benefit and
there are rises in VAT. A whole raft of things have been thrown their
way. If you are a family living in London with two or three children,
you will not feel financially secure if you are earning
£40,000.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000221">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a recognition that we, as a country, need to give to the importance
of families bringing up children. The measures that you talked about
are very important and, as I said, very welcome, but we have to
recognise that it is actually families on low incomes with children who
have been shown to be disproportionately worse off following the cuts,
rather than those without children. It has raised an important debate
about universality and what we, as a country, value in terms of the
jobs we do. If that leads to more debate about the importance of

ability of the child trust fund to encourage saving among families.
What about those children and young people who are in care? At the age
of 18, under the current scheme, they would have a financial asset, but
if the scheme and their eligibility end, as is proposed in clause 1,
they will not have that asset. What do you feel should be the general

knows that children who come out of it are some of the most vulnerable,
in terms of the experience that they have had, and also in terms of the
lack of assets with which to take themselves forward into the future.
Additional payments for children in care were particularly welcome.
That was a really important recognition, and one that we need to hold
on to. There are children coming out of care who are still relatively
in their infancy, if you like, and they are having to cope with
budgeting, buying food, dealing with further education, and getting to
work or training, too. Experience of dealing with those children shows
that that is so much to take on. The fund would be an important asset
for those families. It was important that it was there, and it is
important that it is not lost.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000224">&#160;</a>

point that links to what you were saying about scrutiny. There is real
concern that, as with other measures, there has not been assessment of
the impact that the measure will have on specific groups. Groups that
will be disproportionately affected by the reform are families with
disabled children, and disabled people themselves. My concern is that
if we put a new saving mechanism in place and it does not have that
level of scrutiny or, especially, that impact assessment, we will not
know what the impact will be of transitioning from a child trust fund
to a junior ISA. For us, that is a real concern, given that when the
independent think-tank, Demos, looked at the financial impact of the
emergency Budget, it showed a substantial financial impact on families
with disabled
children.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000232">&#160;</a>

It would help people who perhaps wanted to move on to further
education, given the reduction in the number of placements in further
education for disabled young people, particularly in specialist further
education. The payments would have gone towards new equipment, if these
people wanted to move in with their friends, or if they wanted to live
in their own house and the adaptations for which they had received
grants were no longer suitable. The payments would have given them
extra finance for life opportunities, so that they were able to go out
with other people in their local community. Fundamentally, the payments
would have allowed them to have an asset that they could invest in
whatever they saw as their priority. We know that families with
disabled children need those assets, not, as the media suggest, to
spend on a PlayStation or a trip round the world, but for fundamental
care or life
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000241">&#160;</a>

of the £3.2 billion that would have been paid out over the
course of this Parliament, the Government would have had to borrow
£800 million, given the current public finances. If we are
trying to recapitalise the country, surely incurring extra debt it is
an odd way to go about it. To pick up on the point raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Congleton, there is so much going on. There is a
commitment to Sure Start, 5,000 additional health visitors and targeted
help for the poorest families, so is this really the highest
priority?<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000246">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Going
back to your point about inequality, Anne, the child trust fund is a
universal benefit, so there is no change in inequality when the
children get to 18, because they are all getting the same amount. There
will be no impact on equality, other than for the disabled and
looked-after children, who receive a higher payment. There is
incontrovertible evidence that, unfortunately, it is the most
financially literate and the richest families who, as with ISAs, took
advantage of this mechanism, and it is not the poorest and the most
financially excluded families who benefited from
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000247">&#160;</a>

Bush:</strong>
                           </em> I totally agree with you in some respects,
given that I have not ruled out not going forward with universality.
The key reason for that is that we need to ensure that we are targeting
resources at those who will be most disadvantaged by the proposed
measures. I am concerned that, if we do not target intervention, people
who incur more costs and who are more disadvantaged will not receive
the boost that they need. My other concern relates to the fact that
universality is important, because you see a higher take-up of schemes
when they are universal, but we have to weigh those things up. Without
any form of impact assessment it is difficult to know what the impact
would be of withdrawing child trust funds from disabled children from
higher-income families, or from disabled children who do not receive
disability living
allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000248">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point is that the Government opened a child trust fund for those
families who did not save, paid in a higher rate for disabled children,
and were going to do even more for those in receipt of disability
living allowance. There are families with disabled children who want to
save, but cannot find the products and do not know what to do, so it
was great that the Government were incentivising them or, on their
behalf, investing in products that the families did not feel they could
invest in at the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000249">&#160;</a>

rather than just having a market of products that such families would
not normally enter into. Clearly, these choices have to be made, so it
is very welcome that the measures that we talked about earlier have
been committed
to.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000250">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a simple scheme. On the universality argument, the vast majority of
money already goes to those on lower incomes. If we are looking at
inequalities and changing the pattern of saving behaviour, clearly we
have to ensure that those on lower incomes are the most protected. In
terms of the rationale of where we are in the economic recovery, it is
our responsibility to help people build for their
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000251">&#160;</a>

we have talked to families, the thing that they tell us time and again
is that they want to be the architects of their own solutions. This is
one way in which they can do that. They want to be financially

Bush:</strong>
                           </em> Yes. The most comprehensive piece of analysis
is again—because of where investment tends to go—from
families with disabled children. Family Fund and Social Finance have
done a very large-scale piece of work that has proved that the current
market of products does not work because it cannot navigate the very
complex interactions between benefits and family income, and the
flexibility that needs to go with that.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our own
research found that there are three aggravating features that compound
disabled people’s financial exclusion, which saving gateway was
moving towards resolving. The first was the inadequate financial
capabilities and skills that disabled people have. They are one of most
financially excluded groups. The previous Government and the current
Government have said that they want to roll out personalisation.
Personalisation involves, in many cases, people having devolved to them
a large sum of money. You are asking adults, who have never had any
savings, to look after £50,000 and effectively commission their
own services. That is a massive jump from people who have no money to
the financial capability and skills that they need. This could have
started to build on that. All of the work that was done by the previous
Government around generic financial advice did not—although it
was very worth while—touch disabled people, because it could not
look at the interaction between benefits or the interactions that
disabled people have within their own financial
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
aggravating feature is inappropriate, or a lack of, financial
information advice. That links into that fact about the lack of generic
financial advice, or appropriate advice services for disabled people.
When they go to banks, banks do not really know how to deal with them.
We have quite a lot of data—in fact, I have 90 pages of
qualitative data if you really want to sift through it. That led to
quite a large survey that we did 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 70<a class="bkMark" name="Column70">&#160;</a>
                           </div>with 50% of respondents—disabled people—telling us that
they preferred to go to family or a friend, rather than someone who
actually knew about the financial services industry, because they did
not think that they were compassionate and did not really want to find
the solution for them. On top of that, we have to remember that because
of cuts to local government there are reductions in local information
advice and advocacy services, which means that disabled people who rely
on those services to be able to get financial inclusion or financial
advice will not be receiving it. People, particularly with a limited
mental capacity, need advocacy services in order to know the value of
money, how to use it, and how they are going to use that budget that is
devolved to them. Sorry, I know I am going on a bit.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The third
aggravating feature, which is the one I started with, is the absence of
appropriate financial products. They are not flexible enough. They tend
to penalise disabled people. Let me give you a really clear situation.
A disabled person could not manage their direct payment through a
normal, basic bank account. They were forced to take out a business
account, which meant that they incurred significant costs on the
transactions on that account. That is just bizarre given that both the
previous Government and the current Government have been pushing
towards personalisation and many more disabled adults are going to find
themselves in those situations.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
real risk of not having appropriate financial products is that disabled
people rely on riskier and highly expensive forms of credit. We know
that that spirals into debt. Particularly since the election we have
had lots—hundreds and hundreds—of disabled people calling
our helpline and talking about financial distress that they are now
finding. We have found that the only time disabled people feel like
they get true financial advice is when they are in financial or mental
distress, which is very concerning.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000261">&#160;</a>

the challenges that disabled people have when they seek financial
advice. The Government are bringing in a new provision from spring
whereby there will be a national financial advice service and everyone
will have the opportunity to have a personalised financial health check
and talk about their individual financial needs and savings plans. I
want to take this opportunity to ask you what particular aspects of
that you think would be beneficial to disabled people, because clearly,
the Government are serious about supporting people in terms of
financial education, and particularly, obviously, the most

Government have an opportunity that the last Government missed. There
was a large review of generic financial advice, which was implemented
from 2008. Financial capability was implemented within school
curricula. However, none of that met the needs of disabled children and
young people, mainly because they were also thinking about the
interaction with benefits and their finances more generally.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000269">&#160;</a>

measure. My concern is that it did not work last time; how do we make
it work this time? That is why, cumulatively, I am worried about
removing more of the existing structures that can create financial
capability, such as the saving gateway. I am concerned by the lack of
specificity about how tailored and personalised generic advice can be.
At least the saving gateway builds a generic savings culture among
disabled people. It starts them on the road to having assets and gives
them the confidence that they need to get over the hurdle of
interacting with benefits and navigating a complex
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000270">&#160;</a>

Again, we can sit in this room and feel comfortable talking of
financial products, advice and decisions, but for families who have
never experienced that, feel vulnerable and have financial pressures
that bear down on them or come out of nowhere, the hurdles to get them
into a situation where they are confident, comfortable and able to make
good financial decisions, even with that welcome advice, are immense.
We should hold on to that challenge. One benefit of the saving gateway,
again, is that it takes the financial world and translates it in a way
that those on the lowest income—the poorest—feel is
accessible. Again, that is an important principle that we should hold

not want to give the impression that the saving gateway was the
panacea. It was not. It would have replicated many of the
barriers—particularly the three that I listed—that
disabled people ordinarily face within financial institutions. The real
benefit would have been that it went to people, as Anne said, and
created a mechanism by which they could start rationalising savings
behaviour. That was the main
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000273">&#160;</a>

particular benefits. The national roll-out would have targeted many

Longfield:</strong>
                           </em> I think that those on low incomes are
disproportionately affected by health inequalities—that is the
first starting point—which is an important issue for those
families, for those individuals, for those children and, indeed, for
all of us. If we are looking at the economic cost of that in years to
come, I think it immense. So, we know that is an important
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
also know that a lot of families on low incomes say that they have real
concerns about not having enough money to feed their families properly.
We have figures that show that a huge 39% of families on lower incomes
say that they worry about not having enough money to get through the
week and feed their family. Again, 31% of families say that they do not
think that they can afford to provide nutritionally balanced food. Now,
there is a lively debate about the cost of nutritionally balanced
food—whether it is cheaper or more expensive—but I think
that we know that a lot of families rely on food that is accessible,
near to their home, but which can often not always be the most
nutritional food. We know that that is an issue and also that pregnancy
is a key
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is about changing habits and is part of a wider range of support, again
from midwives and antenatal workers, and through Sure Start, which is
all around giving people confidence in being able to make good
decisions about their health and welfare and giving them some practical
support—a bit of a nudge, if you like, to put that good
intention into effect. It is something that should be seen as part of
the wider measure of support for families in that kind of pregnancy
period. You can say that £190 is not much, and that no one would
notice it, but it is an important recognition that pregnancy is a
crucial time, and that healthy eating during that time is absolutely
essential for both baby and family. It is that nudge that can go as
part of a wider set of information and support, actually getting people
on to a healthy eating
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000279">&#160;</a>

better to look at the evidence for whether, arguably, there might have
been a better time, rather than simply saying, “Don’t do

recognition that has been new. It has been something which has I think
been wholly welcomed by parents. Again, the experience of Sure Start
centres shows that, in its interaction with parents. It needs to be
based on evidence. We need to look at where that money can be best
spent. We need to look at the impact if it has been withdrawn. So, yes,
I would agree—we need to look at it much more in the round and,
again, at the wider impact on the work. We have a situation in which
there is positive investment in Sure Start and in more health visitors,
as part of this, but actually this is a really important tool for a lot
of those health visitors to use. We need to look at the impact of
taking away there and at the added burden for health visitors and the
ability for them to be able to do what we all want them to do, which is
to help get those poorer families to a best
start.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000282">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is absolutely no doubt that maternal health
is incredibly important, both to the mum and to the unborn child. I
have quite major concerns about this grant, because it is so late in
pregnancy and we know that the health benefits are really derived
before a baby is conceived and during the early stages. Of course,
there is no way of knowing how this money is going to be spent,
although I am sure that anyone who has had a baby knows that
£190 is very welcome because of the cost of having a child. I am
wondering what analysis you have made, because of course we have got
the Healthy Start programme, which targets nutrition pre-conception and
throughout pregnancy especially for people on low incomes. That is very
much welcomed by Sure Start centres. There is the Sure Start maternity
grant, along with additions to family tax credits and, as you said, the
Government’s absolute determination—with the support of
Sure Start centres and increased resources for health
visiting—to support families on low incomes. I am wondering what
analysis you have done on the Healthy Start programme.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000283">&#160;</a>

Longfield:</strong>
                           </em> I think this needs to be part of a wider
assessment of how we support families, and how we support parents
during that important phase. It is complicated, it is new and there are
different measures in place. We perhaps need to look at some
realignment of that. I think that we need consistently to look over the
programmes; we need to look at the evidence base; we need to look again
at the impact assessment; and we need to enter into dialogue about the
right time to look at support and how that can be best be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000284">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Certainly, it
is an important recognition around the health visitors. There is
important support there for parents in terms of the Sure Start grant,
although of course that is just for the first child now. Again, this is
absolutely the most crucial time for families. It is the poorest
families that we are looking to support, and we need to get it right,
because otherwise there will be a generation of children who do not get
off to the best start that we know they need. Parents will know that
this is on the way; expectations have been raised, and I think that we
need to be very careful if we are going to remove some of those. We
need to know why we are doing so, and what the consequences
are.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000285">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Absolutely. First, there is an important
recognition about maternal health, and its impact on the baby and their
future life chances not only in childhood but for years to come.
Secondly, in that wider measure to support families—I am talking
a lot about Sure Start because I think that has been a really important
introduction in terms of support for families—the introduction
of more help is important, but we need to recognise that we cannot just
spirit these changes. These people need their tools too. The impact on
families is to be able really to put into practice what they want to
do, which is to create the best start for their children. If you look
at middle-class families, such as members of my staff team, I have
people who are planning for conception in three or six months’
time. This is not the case, clearly, in a lot of families who are
living on a much more day-to-day basis. If we can give them some help
early on, couple that with advice and actually stick with them
throughout the pregnancy—so it is not just a one off either in
payment or in support—and if there are problems make sure that
they are referred on to support once the child is born, I think we
stand the best chance not only of tackling the welfare of that child
but of breaking some of the cycles that we know will be generationally
there for many families.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000287">&#160;</a>

just say that it is an important recognition. Of course we do not want
to replicate efforts, and we want to make sure that we are targeting
efforts. A really good thing about the new Government is that they are
very committed to early intervention. Trying to get that right, and to
get that intervention period right, is really important. I would just
return, however, to the fact that this feels a bit too fast. It feels
as though there is not an alternative, or that in-depth research

alternative.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000288">&#160;</a>

the introduction of the grant, where is the evidence that it would
actually be taken up and used effectively, particularly in buying
better nutrition? I know the grant has been in place for only a short
period of time, but is there any fact base at all that it either acted
as a bribe to encourage people to see their health visitors at 25
weeks, which is effectively what it has become, or indeed that it was
used to buy fruit and vegetables and improved health? Are these just
nice-to-haves or is there any specific evidence base that can help us
rank these programmes? Are these all just part of a parcel of things

that a lot of these programmes have evolved over time and they have
been incrementally added, which may not present a perfect situation
now, and some of them might bump up against each other. There is an
opportunity here—with a clear commitment to early intervention
and the best start for children during this period to break the cycle
of poverty—to look properly at what

                           </div>the evidence says and what the impact is, and, if
there is a better alternative, what that might be. I think that that is
taking responsibility seriously. It is capturing the recognition that
is already there in terms of the reason that many of the programmes
were introduced, but it is taking the new situation and the opportunity
within that to look again at whether these can be streamlined, and even
improved on where we are so
far.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000289">&#160;</a>

visitors and parents will speak positively about the impact of the
grant. I know there is always a worry about what it is spent on, but we
could take you to a room full of 20 families at a moment’s
notice and they will tell you that they will spend it wisely on their
families’ needs and their own health. They will invest in their
children, because that is what they need. But I do think there is a
role there and a possibility to look properly at the impact of a whole
range of measures and take a balanced view on whether there is a
better, more streamlined way of moving forward. But I do not think that
a more slicing approach benefits the important recognition that exists

of the interesting and distressing things that we are seeing emerging
through our Sure Start is a real increase in demand for mental health
services, and that has increased over the last six to 12 months to the
extent that we have to double our mental health support for those
families at this time. We know that the things driving it are
uncertainties about their financial futures and difficulties in
balancing their finances and their work and home now. It is absolutely
crucial. It is the time when there is most risk and most families are
vulnerable. It is also the time when there is most opportunity to do
something about it.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000298">&#160;</a>

of someone living on unemployment benefit: a woman aged 18 to 25, and
how the Joseph Rowntree Foundation minimum income food standard would
be £44 compared with the £51.85 they were getting for the
benefit. When we spoke earlier about child trust funds, you were very
positive about the universal nature of the child trust fund. All your
evidence on the health in pregnancy grant has focused on its particular
benefit for people on low incomes. I just wondered if you could give us

targeting—universality, I think, in terms of recognition of the
importance of bringing up children is a starting point for everything
that I have said. But in terms of the health in pregnancy grant, there
are particular pressures. There are particular changes that we are
looking to see in behaviour, and there will be a prioritising in terms
of the work that health visitors do in any case in supporting those
parents. It is particularly important that they have the tools to be
able to nudge those families along where £190 will be noticeable
and make a difference. It is part of that kit bag of tools those health
visitors
have.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000304">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">January
is too soon. The discussions we have had show that the impact
assessment isn’t at a stage where proper decisions can be made.
I fear that some of the very important recognition of the commitments
that have been made to date will be taken away to the detriment of
those on the lowest income—the poorest—whose futures we
all agree that we want to change. We want to make a difference through
wide agreement across political parties about the importance of
reducing poverty and in changing life chances for those families, and
breaking those cycles. This needs to be considered against that
backdrop of coalition commitment, and commitment across all parties.
Marc Bush will probably say that it is a disproportionate reduction,
but clearly £190 for those on the lowest income will mean the
most.<a class="bkMark" name="1011037000305">&#160;</a>

honest, we would feel much more confident in knowing what that impact
is going be and knowing what the alternatives are going to be.
Otherwise, there will be a disproportionate effect on disabled people
and families with disabled members. We already know that the emergency
Budget had a disproportionate impact. We already know that the spending
review also had a disproportionate impact, despite the lack of impact
assessment from the Government. My concern is that the cumulative
effect of that will be a disproportionate impact on disabled mothers or
mothers with disabled
