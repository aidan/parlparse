<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> When the Committee adjourned on 12 February it had just disposed of amendment No. 1, in clause 2, page 1, line 16. Since then, the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) has tabled an amendment, No. 105, to line 14, to leave out subsection (2) of clause 2. Under the rules of the House, the Committee can entertain amendments--assuming that they are selected by the Chairman--as far back in the same clause as the point at which the clause was last amended.
<P>
I have decided, therefore, to exercise my discretion to select amendment No. 105, but for a Division only, as I judge that the matters raised by the amendment have already been adequately discussed in the debate that took place at the last sitting on the amendments to subsection (2).

<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 1, line 18, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) The Police Authority shall, with the approval of the Secretary of State, determine the manpower establishment of the police force as to--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the maximum number of each rank; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the maximum number of persons appointed, as either civilian staff or traffic wardens'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with the manpower levels of the RUC. Section 6 of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 sets out the role of the Police Authority in relation to the strength and operational control of the police force.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall, subject to the approval of the Minister of Home Affairs''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
subsequently the Secretary of State--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``given with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance, from time to time determine the maximum number of persons of each rank which is to constitute the establishment of the police force and the maximum number of persons who may be appointed as police cadets and traffic wardens respectively.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the current position under the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. The Police Authority has considerable powers, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, to determine levels of manpower.
<P>
The Bill would remove the power that I have outlined--as, indeed, it has been removed for England and Wales under the 1994 and 1996 legislation. Under the more recent provisions, the Police Authority's involvement in setting manpower levels ceases to be statutory and becomes a matter of discretion, or negotiation involving the Chief Constable and the authority.
<P>
The power currently enjoyed by the Police Authority for Northern Ireland is significant. It is a prestigious responsibility, which confers real influence over a key aspect of policing organisation. It is a boost to the standing of the Police Authority in the community and it enhances and promotes the public's perception of the authority as an impartial and independent non-political influence on policing matters. I believe that the Labour party felt the same when it was in opposition. The Labour party consultation paper entitled ``Policing in Northern Ireland--A Service for all People'' which is claimed as the blueprint for the Bill, lists on page 10 the powers and responsibilities envisaged for the Police Authority, including (h), which is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Other duties, as at present, such as setting the establishment of the police''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The previous Government produced a White Paper on the matter, which set out responsibilities for the Police Authority in annexe B. Nowhere under the heading of ``Personnel'' does the document mention anything about the Police Authority having a say in determining police manning levels. I have already said that the 1996 Act does not mention powers of police authorities to set manpower grades and levels in England and Wales. Under the 1996 Act authorities have powers and responsibilities as to personnel management. For instance, section 11 deals with appointment and removal of chief constables, section 12 with the appointment of assistant chief constables, section 13 with the various ranks in the police force and section 15 with the employment of civilian staff. Section 16 deals with the employment of a clerk and section 17 covers the appointment of persons not employed directly by the police authorities. But that legislation for England and Wales does not grant police authorities any powers to determine establishment numbers and structure. Has the omission of that power from the Bill more to do with the England and Wales legislation and the previous Government's designs than with the Government's stated aims in the consultation paper, which led the Police Authority to believe that it would retain that important power?
<P>
The Government have to explain the reasons for changing their minds. Does the change constitute a U-turn? Was the change based on civil servants' advice or a desire to bring the measure in line with England and Wales legislation, without considering the uniqueness and differences that pertain to Northern Ireland? What is the present Police Authority's view? It was probably misled by the consultation paper into believing that it would retain the important powers that we are considering.
<P>
In the past few years, which included two ceasefire periods, the role and organisation of the RUC has been closely scrutinised. The reorganisation of the duties and role of RUC officers during the first ceasefire was supposed to lead to the so-called peace dividend, which was to come from substantial savings on police overtime and money for compensation. Discussions on the downsizing of the RUC also took place. The Minister and I referred to that fundamental review. I shall return to that subject later.
<P>
The size of the police force was a fundamental issue, which the Police Authority, representatives from the Northern Ireland Office and from among the Chief Constable's officers considered not only during the ceasefire but afterwards. The subject of manpower levels is no less topical or contentious during the current ceasefire. The Police Authority believes that it is essential that it plays a pivotal role in any discussions about the size of the police force in future. It also believes that the removal of the power for which the 1970 Act provides would remove the community voice from the deliberations on the crucial matter of the size of the police force.
<P>
The size of the police force and its relationship with the community, and the powers given to the Chief Constable and the Police Authority are topical, important issues. In their overall approach, the Government share the previous Government's view that those matters are important to Northern Ireland. However it could be construed that removing this power from the Police Authority at this sensitive time would send a clear signal to Northern Ireland.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): To help me prepare my response, could the hon. Gentleman clarify whether this is a--legitimate--probing amendment, or whether what he is saying constitutes the view of the Opposition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do not need to tell the Minister what my amendment is about. I am simply arguing a case. It is all in the context of which powers the Police Authority is to retain in the restructured tripartite structure. The Police Authority maintain--and we agree with much of what it believes--that this Bill attacks it from two sides. It gives additional powers to the Chief Constable and to the Secretary of State. The attack on the Police Authority comes from two directions.
<P>
The amendment must be seen in the context of the whittling away of the Police Authority's powers--as it sees the situation. The Minister, who I understand was the author of the consultation document, will not tell the Committee why he changed his mind between writing that document and the presentation of the Bill. The amendment must be seen in the context of the powers that the Police Authority is likely to retain and that are important to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Could the hon. Gentleman confirm that he has not changed his mind and that his position on the Police and Magistrates' Court Act 1994 is still the same as the Government's?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister keeps asking whether I have changed my mind, but I do not have to say. I cannot see the point of his questioning. We are dealing with legislation for Northern Ireland and the powers of the Police Authority. A power will be removed, but its removal will not, on its own, be an issue on which the Police Authority will make a final stand. It sees the removal of that power in the context of the removal of other powers and responsibilities from it, which partly explains its position.
<P>
The Police Authority sees the power as important, not just because it wants to be heavily involved in detailed discussions on manpower levels, but because it will be perceived in the wider community as a reduction in its power and influence on a critical issue. If part of the legislation is being brought forward--the Police Authority would say with some haste--in the context of the talks process and the overall political dimension, the Government must recognise the Police Authority's belief that too many powers are being taken away from it and that that will not sit well with the community as a whole. It may set the Government back on their intentions and desires to bring about a consensus on policing in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I promised that I would not take up too much of the Committee's time on this amendment. I emphasise that the issue must be seen in the context of the overall designation of powers that the Police Authority perceives. The Government must explain why they have changed their mind and why they see the power as irrelevant for the Police Authority--in the context of all other powers that they appear to be taking away.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is true that the Government have changed their mind since our 1996 consultation paper. We consulted, and listened, and came to a conclusion in line with the previous Government's position in the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 which applied to England and Wales, and Scotland. I shall take the Committee through the process.
<P>
The setting of establishments by police authorities was abolished in the other three territories in 1994. The feedback that we have received suggests that that was a significant step forward by the previous Government in providing a more efficient police service. There is agreement in all parts of the House that the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland and those elsewhere should have operational freedom to decide how an area is to be policed: afterwards it should be the job of the relevant Secretary of State and the police authorities to judge how effectively that work has been done.
<P>
The Government regarded the setting of an establishment--not merely a global figure but one that includes details of how many people, and of which rank--as a bureaucratic restriction. I recall examining years ago the establishment of the community involvement branch in Strathclyde and finding that it involved about 1&#183;96 per cent. of the force. To impose that from the level of the Scottish Office is an absurd restriction on the freedom of the police.
<P>
We have learnt from the 1994 Act that it seems appropriate to leave the figure as it is. If we agree that the chief constable should have operational freedom to decide, a basic component of that freedom is that he be allowed to allocate resources according to an area's needs rather than being restricted by imposition of some sort, either centrally or by the police authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Does not the Minister think that there is a fundamental difference between giving a chief constable power to determine locally in England and Wales what needs to be done in policing his area, and the situation in Northern Ireland, which was about three to four times the number of policemen per capita? If there is to be a peace dividend in the future in Northern Ireland, fewer police will be needed. Therefore, is not the downsizing of the RUC a political issue in which the Police Authority would wish to have a say?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The Police Authority has a say, in that it sets the objectives for the police and evaluates whether they are met. If it also had the decision-making power to allocate police resources in detail to each police station, it would be complicit in the way in which that area was policed. If it were holding the police to account, one way of lessening its power to evaluate whether a good job had been done would be to allow it to make operational decisions about allocation of resources.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson (Belfast, East):</B> I follow the Minister's argument to the extent that an unrepresentative police authority should not be involved in operational determinations of how many policemen should be deployed in a given area. However, the amendment does not say that, but would determine the ceiling on RUC recruitment--and indeed traffic wardens, which is nonsense. That is different from determining the operational and logistical problems faced by chief constables in locating their forces.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> In terms of setting the establishment one can respond only to the words on the amendment paper which would have the effect of giving powers to the Police Authority that are similar to those enjoyed by police authorities elsewhere--with all the implications that flow from that. I am glad to hear the hon. Gentleman agree that the Chief Constable should be able to use his professional judgment to determine the appropriate rank structure for constables under his direction and the appropriate mix of police officers and supporting staff. At the moment, the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is denied the ability to do that.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) spoke about the special nature of Northern Ireland--a point that is often made. However, in view of the special circumstances of Northern Ireland, is it not important to give the Chief Constable more rather than fewer powers? I heard nothing in the hon. Gentleman's argument to suggest that Northern Ireland's Chief Constable should be uniquely denied the necessary flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am more than happy to endorse what the Minister says. Yes, chief constables should have a great deal of power over operational control--especially in Northern Ireland because of its unique situation. But that was not my point. In answer to my previous question, the Minister said that the Police Authority will set objectives and that the power to determine manpower levels should be included in pursuance of those objectives.
<P>
However, clause 14--or, rather, clause 15--talks of the Police Authority setting objectives just for the following financial year--not for any longer period. Given a peaceful outcome to the present talks--we should be looking forward positively to the future--we need to look to the longer term, but the Police Authority will not have the requisite powers to do so in relation to overall policing levels throughout the Province.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> We are making the right judgment about the relative powers of the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State. The right balance is being struck in that tripartite system for both good and bad scenarios. When we debate clause 14 we shall be able to debate the issue further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is clause 15.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Whether it is clause 14 or, as the hon. Gentleman says clause 15, the Opposition will see that we are right. The clause gives the Chief Constable the freedom that all other British chief constables already have. That represents a significant step forward and will ensure that the people of Northern Ireland receive a more efficient and effective service. As in Britain, the Police Authority will have a strategic financial oversight role--a significant influence over the overall staffing levels of the Northern Ireland police service. We shall return to debate that matter when we reach clause 17.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and South Tyrone):</B> I apologise, Mr. Jones, for being late. The Minister is wrong in his assessment of the Chief Constable's responsibility in this respect. The Chief Constable should have, as everyone agrees, operational responsibility. When I complained about the erosion of the Police Authority's limited authority, I was told that it would still control the budget. The RUC establishment will be directly related to the budget, which in turn, will directly affect the establishment. It is somewhat nonsensical that the Police Authority, which will take possession of the budget, will not decide, in consultation with the Chief Constable, how the budget can best be expended on overall policy decisions but that the Chief Constable should be responsible for deciding every single detail relating to policy as well as--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are always brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> It is not for me to correct the Chair, but that is not my experience of interventions by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis). It is sometimes possible to pop out for lunch during one of his interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It takes a long time to put nonsense right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The problem is that the hon. Gentleman finds it difficult to distinguish between the strategic role of a body that sets parameters and considers the overall picture and the operational role of the Police Authority.
<P>
When the Police Authority has nitty-gritty powers to purchase goods and supplies, and control non-police matters, it becomes obsessed and over-involved with such issues, rather than concentrating on its central role: good work such as that carried out with police liaison committees considering the task of the police force. The Police Authority has not been as involved in those strategic aspects as we wish it to be.
<P>
The proposal is a step forward to allow the Chief Constable more flexibility in the deployment of his force. The message from the rest of Great Britain is that that has greatly improved policing. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, this is a probing amendment. It was proposed, legitimately, on behalf of the Police Authority to test our intentions, but it is not what the hon. Gentleman believes should happen. He believes, as we do, that removing from the Police Authority its bureaucratic powers to set the establishment in 1994 was a step forward. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> I am more confused than I was when we began the debate. I hope that the mover of the amendment, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, can tell me whether I was right to conclude that the effect of the amendment would be that operational control of the RUC would be retained by the Chief Constable, who should determine where and how many of his men should be deployed. However, the Police Authority, to which the Bill gives responsibility to secure the maintenance, efficiency and effectiveness of the RUC, should have a role in determining the level of the force, on the basis of what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said, because it has been presented with a budget. The Police Authority would decide what is to be RUC's recruitment ceiling, its membership and its numbers of civilian staff and traffic wardens.
<P>
That would not remove the Chief Constable's ability to decide how to deploy the men that he recruits to his force. He will have full operational responsibility; he will be able to make a professional judgement about where his men should be deployed. It is a division of the role that would work and I can see no reason why it should not work. If the Chief Constable believes that the Police Authority--unrepresentative body that it is--has not made a thorough judgment on such matters and has not given him enough men, or has given him too many--although that is unlikely--he can made a case to the authority for a change in manpower. I did not have the impression that the Minister was entirely opposed to that proposition. He did not say so expressly.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> Assuming that the hon. Gentleman supports the amendment, is he arguing that the Police Authority should be able to tell the Chief Constable what the maximum number of superintendents or sergeants should be? That is the intention of the amendment and it would deny the operational independence of the Chief Constable. Does the hon. Gentleman support the amendment, or is he on some kind of trawling expedition to raise other issues relating to the Police Authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> As the Minister has raised the other issues, I would be happy to discuss them, but you might be rather restless, Mr. Jones, if I did so.
<P>
The Government set restrictions on the Chief Constable in terms of recruitment levels. There is nothing new about that. In Northern Ireland the choice is whether such matters are decided by an unrepresentative Government or by an unrepresentative Police Authority. None of these things would happen without normal consultations between the Chief Constable and whoever had the final responsibility for paying. The Chief Constable could give advice on the levels that would be set, in the same way that he gives advice on many other matters. I see no difficulty about that.
<P>
The Police Authority would not be able to decide about recruitment levels on its own; it would consult with the Chief Constable and it would take account of the policing plan, for which it has responsibility under the Bill. An integral part of that plan is how the police force will operate and what its structure will be. The Minister has argued that there is a separate policing plan, which would describe, instrumentally, the nature of the force, but that it would not include the next step, which would determine what the level of the force should be.
<P>
Will the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire confirm that my interpretation of his amendment is correct? If it is I am happy to support the amendment, but if not, I shall have to reconsider my position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It is difficult to talk to Northern Ireland Ministers at present. They cite examples from other police forces in the United Kingdom, but they never substantiate any of their claims. They ascribe a degree of arrogance to the Police Authority, an arrogance that perhaps we saw from the previous Chief Constable and which we see from Ministers and their advisers. They believe that the Police Authority will dictate to the Chief Constable exactly how many men he is to have at every rank. That is not, and has never been, the way in which the Police Authority has worked. The authority makes decisions corporately, after discussions with the Chief Constable and his senior officers. That strikes me as being the way in which society as a whole can have a police service that reflects its needs. I do not disagree with the Minister when he talks about the Police Authority having a relationship with police community liaison committees. I just wish that he was a bit more enthusiastic about the relationship: it is one on which society depends to have its views reflected right to the top of the pyramid.
<P>
The amendment is a worthy one. Ministers may not be listening but they will hear me say again and again that there is a danger of the Bill creating a situation in which, de facto, the Chief Constable will have to relate much more to the Secretary of State than to his Police Authority. The amendment is worthy because it reflects what society as well as the police believes. The Ministers know that I have a great deal of concern and regard for the Royal Ulster Constabulary. I put its needs high on my agenda, but neither I nor my party do that to the detriment of the needs of society as a whole. We must try to dissuade the Government from eroding the process of bringing the needs of grass roots society through the police and community liaison committees to the Police Authority and then to the Secretary of State for consultation and to the Minister directly responsible and the Chief Constable. If that could predominate the Government would not turn their face against the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We have had a short but interesting debate. At the heart of it and the amendments is the question of where in the Bill is the Police Authority given the power and influence to have a strong say about manning levels for the police in Northern Ireland. As I emphasised, this is not an ordinary situation. We need to write legislation that looks 10 or 20 years ahead when there will be peace in Northern Ireland and a very different situation from the present one. In that context the Police Authority for Northern Ireland should enjoy the powers and the influence of police authorities in England and Wales. It currently does not, and the Bill does not carry it as far as that.
<P>
The Minister did not answer the fundamental question about where the Bill states that the Police Authority has an influence on future RUC manning levels. It is no good arguing that clause 15 gives the Police Authority the opportunity to determine objectives for the policing of Northern Ireland. That is only at the beginning of each financial year and for that year: there is no time scale to set objectives beyond that one year. We are discussing a continuing strategy that looks ahead five years or more. The Police Authority is simply saying that it has the power at present and is seen in legislation to have an influence over manpower levels. I do not for one moment believe that any police authority would issue diktats to a chief constable. It will make an arrangement and reach agreement through discussions with him. There would not be a problem if the Bill stated clearly that that was one of the powers, but it does not. I am happy to be persuaded that the Bill empowers him to be influential, but that is not clear to me or to the Police Authority. People will compare the 1970 Act with the Bill and claim that the Government have removed a fundamental power and influence, that they are denuding the Police Authority of its current powers, and that they want more power through the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not press the amendments to a Division if the Minister gives me a sensible answer and shows that the Bill gives the Police Authority clear powers to be involved in discussions. I await the Minister's response with interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Clause 15 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall, before the beginning of each financial year--determine objectives for the policing of Northern Ireland during that year; and establish levels of performance .
.
. to be aimed at in seeking to achieve such objectives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It allows the Police Authority, with the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable, to set a framework that should improve policing in Northern Ireland. Setting rigid, bureaucratic establishment levels that specify the number of people of a particular rank for each location in Northern Ireland would remove everybody's power, including that of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. It would bind everyone to an inappropriate framework.
<P>
The establishment level refers only to an upper level. The Chief Constable cannot go beyond it. Policing will be better if the Chief Constable has greater flexibility. That will enhance accountability. The Bill makes it clear that the Chief Constable is responsible for policing. Currently, the Police Authority makes what seems to be an operational decision about the way in which to deploy police. [Interruption.] We can only go by the words of the amendment paper. Everyone accepts that setting the establishment means what has happened in the past. Therefore we cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we embark on the next group of amendments, I shall make a brief statement, which, I hope, will assist the Committee.
<P>
The group of amendments that is headed by amendment No. 20 also contains clauses 14 and 15 stand part. The contents of the clauses are so closely linked to the subject of amendment No. 20 and the other amendments in the group that it would not be sensible to separate the debate on the principle of the clauses from that on the amendments. Hon. Members should discuss clauses 14 and 15 now, because, when we reach those clauses in the Bill, I am minded to exercise my discretion under Standing Order No. 68 to put the Question forthwith that the two clauses stand part of the Bill. Of course, if any further amendments to either clause are tabled before we reach them in the Bill, I shall consider them in the usual way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 2, line 2, leave out `and performance targets established' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for the policing of Northern Ireland'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 27, in page 2, line 3, leave out `Secretary of State; and insert `Authority'.
<P>
	No. 28, in clause 14, page 7, line 29, leave out `Secretary of State' and insert `Authority'.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> All the amendments relate to performance targets and the question of who sets them. Amendment No. 20 relates to clause 2 and the other amendments relate to clauses 14 and 15. Clause 14 relates to the setting of objectives and performance targets by the Secretary of State. Clause 15 relates to the setting of objectives and performance targets by the Police Authority, albeit on different time scales.
<P>
	The amendments raise the vexacious question of defining the different roles in this tripartite structure. Much mention has been made of the differential powers in that structure enjoyed by the Secretary of State, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. Clauses 14 and 15 allow for some ambiguity. The Bill gives powers to both the Secretary of State and the Police Authority to determine, first, policing objectives, and secondly, performance targets. The key difference appears to be that the Secretary of State is required to address these matters over a time scale of not less than three years, and not more than four years. Clause 14(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Objectives shall be determined and performance targets established under this section by reference to a period (not being less than 3 years nor more than 5 years) specified therein.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 15 requires the Police Authority to determine objectives before the beginning of, or during, each financial year. They therefore share at least one year--the first--for setting objectives and performance targets. For the Police Authority, the coming financial year is important; for the Secretary of State it is the first of the three, or five, years.
<P>
The Secretary of State is required to consult the Police Authority and the Chief Constable before determining policing objectives. Clause 14(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before determining or revising any objectives under this section, the Secretary of State shall consult--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the Police Authority;
<P>
(b) the Chief Constable; and
<P>
(c) such other persons as he thinks appropriate.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Clause 15(1) obliges the Police Authority, in setting its objectives and performance targets, to consult only the Chief Constable. Subsection (3)(a) obliges the Police Authority, before it determines objectives, to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) consult the Chief Constable; and
<P>
(b) consider any views obtained by the Authority in accordance with arangements made under section 7.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Section 7 of the 1996 legislation relates to the duties of the Police Authority to take on board the views of the public and the community that it serves. The Police Authority has to set performance targets for one year--the next financial year--after consultation with the Chief Constable and the public, while the Secretary of State sets performance targets for the same year--but without consulting the public. There is ambiguity here, which might lead to significant differences between the Police Authority's and the Secretary of State's objectives during the first year. It might lead to more than differences of opinion; it could lead to confrontation. We need to tighten up the provisions to make the Bill less ambiguous and clearer about exactly who is to do what.
<P>
The Police Act 1996 provides for a rather different situation: it is more clear-cut and less ambiguous. Section 37 (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may by order determine objectives for the policing of the areas of all police authorities established under section 3.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
First, the objectives are achieved by an order, so there is at least some additional parliamentary scrutiny. Even a negative resolution allows provisions to be prayed against. That contrasts strongly with Northern Ireland legislation under which the Secretary of State simply gets on and does what he wants without any need for scrutiny. There is no ``by order'' in the Northern Ireland legislation.
<P>
Secondly, it is the Secretary of State who determines objectives for the policing of police authority areas. Under section 37 (2),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before making an order . . . the Secretary of State shall consult . . . persons whom he considers to represent the interests of police authorities''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
at least an association of police authorities has some say in setting objectives--and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``persons whom he considers to represent the interests of chief constables of forces maintained by those authorities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, an association of chief constables has an input into the determination of objectives.
<P>
Under section 38 of the 1996 Act, the setting of performance targets is not done by the Secretary of State. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where an objective has been determined under section 37, the Secretary of State may''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not shall--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``direct police authorities to establish levels of performance (``performance targets'') to be aimed at in seeking to achieve the objective.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thus under section 37 the Secretary of State can determine objectives by order after consultation with associations of chief constables and police authorities; then under section 38, the Secretary of State is given the powers to direct police authorities to establish levels of performance. We should note that the Secretary of State is not determining the levels of performance, yet that is the case in the Bill. That amounts to a fundamental difference between the two legislative measures.
<P>
In discussions with the previous Government--and hopefully with the present one--the Police Authority for Northern Ireland was told that it would enjoy powers similar to those provided for in the Police Act 1996 and the 1994 Act. Yet the Bill gives the Secretary of State additional powers and takes some powers away from the Police Authority. Once again there is an erosion of power from the Police Authority and its transfer to the Secretary of State who oversees the Bill, looming large at every corner and every turn, controlling the whole edifice.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I have shown, the Police Act 1996 for England and Wales never envisaged the Secretary of State enjoying such power, and this is only the reference to a theme that runs throughout the Bill. The amendments would reinstate in the Northern Ireland legislation pretty much the same wording as that in the Police Act 1996. The Secretary of State should be able to set objectives--I do not have a problem with that. However, the Police Authority should determine the performance targets necessary for the achievement of the objectives set by the Secretary of State, albeit over three to five years. The Police Authority would also need to set its own objectives for policing over one year.
<P>
In commenting on amendment No. 78, I return to the theme that ran through my remarks on amendment No. 19. Amendment No. 78 would add that the ``other matters'' to which objectives determined under the clause could relate could include 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the establishment of the police force or the number of civilian employees''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to clarify that that would be a definite role for the Police Authority in its discussions with the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. The Minister said in a previous debate that it was clear to everyone that the issues to which amendment No. 19 related would be part of the discussons on the setting of objectives, and that the Police Authority need have no worries on that score. That brings me back to my theme. Failure to specify the matter clearly as 1970 Act did is an erosion of the Police Authority's power--perhaps perceived as such only by the authority and the public, but the perception is a reality. Amendment No. 78 would reinstate some wording about personnel and establishment levels. However, I do not claim that I have arrived at the perfect wording. Perhaps the word ``establishment'' will again set alarm bells ringing, on the basis that it is a prescriptive word relating to the setting of upper or lower levels. I would certainly agree to further consideration of an acceptable wording. However, the Police Authority wants the Bill to refer to its power to be involved in discussions about total membership of the police force and total civilian staffing.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments are logical. As the Bill stands, two sets of people are involved--on one hand the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland Office, setting objectives and performance targets for a three to five-year period, and on the other the Police Authority, attempting something similar on a one-year time scale. Clarification is needed. Perhaps more importantly, despite assurances to the Police Authority that the bottom line in any changes to the status quo would be on a par with the 1994 and 1996 legislation for England and Wales, the Bill goes beyond that legislation. The Secretary of State does not set performance targets in England and Wales, but the Government want the Secretary of State to have that power in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that performance targets and success indicators are ideas that the Royal Ulster Constabulary has had in place for many years? However, within months of being elected, the Government tell the whole world that they are creating something new in setting key performance indicators and targets--or at least they give that impression.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a telling point. There were internal performance targets in the past but they were not usually made public. I agree with the thrust of the proposals, which mirror the 1996 legislation in that they put the state's objectives clearly within the public domain, through the Secretary of State. In a shorter time scale, they set policing objectives and clear performance targets in police authority areas.
<P>
I agree that performance targets should be clearly stated at the beginning of the year, so that achievements can be measured against those objectives, but two bodies will be vying to do the same sort of work and when there is an overlap of responsibility it creates confusion and disagreement and encourages confrontation.
<P>
The 1996 Act is more clear cut: it separates the two functions and sets out longer-term objectives and performance targets for police authorities. It does not state that the Secretary of State ``shall'' direct police authorities in England and Wales to set performance targets, but that he ``may'' direct them to do so. Why was the word ``may'' used instead of ``shall'' in the legislation for England and Wales? There are many reasons; it is possible that it is only in areas where the chief constable and the police authority face policing difficulties that the Secretary of State feels that things must be tightened up and therefore insists that performance targets must be set so that objectives can be achieved. But when objectives are achieved without targets being set, he may feel that it is unnecessary to impose targets on police authorities. There are other reasons why the legislation for England and Wales was so drafted, but that is one that springs to mind.
<P>
The main contention is that the Bill goes beyond what was enshrined in the 1996 Act for England and Wales. Assurances were given, but the bottom line was that it would be no different, yet the clause is one example--there are others in the Bill which we will discuss later--of the Secretary of State being given extra powers over and above those enjoyed in mainland Britain. The Minister must give the Committee a good explanation for that change as there will be confusion about who is setting the objectives, what they are and the scale involved. These are important matters and we look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I am told that the Secretary of State's powers to set performance indicators are needed because Northern Ireland has only one police force and one Police Authority. The changes replicate the Home Secretary's powers to require police authorities in England and Wales to set performance indicators. What the Home Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has issued in respect of both objectives and performance indicators is in similar format, within that disregard.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that he wanted to see written into the Bill a provision that clauses 14 and 15 would not conflict. As he pointed out, the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority in some instances will be working in the same territory. He wanted an assurance that there would not be conflict between the roles of the Secretary of State and the Police Authority. That is covered in clause 15(2) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Objectives determined under this section may relate to matters to which objectives determined under section 14 also relate, or to other matters, but in any event shall be so framed as to be consistent with the objectives determined under that section.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I read that to mean that the Police Authority should avoid being in conflict with the objectives being laid down by the Secretary of State. There is a clear requirement that there should not be conflict, and that covers the hon. Gentleman's point. There is also clarity in the sense that the Secretary of State is being asked to set medium and long-term objectives and that the Police Authority's role is on an annual basis. I can see no conflict between the objectives set both by the Secretary of State and the Police Authority.
<P>
Late last year the Secretary of State produced her objectives to deal with terrorism, public order, violent crime, burglaries, road traffic accidents and illegal drugs and said that those were areas which she wanted to see emphasised. We have recently had the Police Authority's objectives for the Royal Ulster Constabulary which include reducing overall crime, raising public confidence in the RUC, targeting and preventing crimes and, in partnership with local communities and agencies, tackling behaviour that is threatening, intimidating and antisocial.
<P>
Objective setting and the introduction of performance indicators in a more clear-cut way will be a major step forward in terms of public accountability of the police force and will clarify people's roles. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire seems to want to diminish the Secretary of State's role. One can imagine the uproar in the House if we introduced legislation to allow the Secretary of State, in response to a major crime wave or terrorist incident, to say, ``It is not my business.'' I can just imagine how the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone would react if the Secretary of State said, ``It is not my responsibility; I wash my hands of it.''
<P>
The Secretary of State has a clear-cut responsibility, in conjunction with the Chief Constable and the Police Authority, for public order and crime levels in Northern Ireland. What matters, and it is transparent in the Bill, is that the Secretary of State should not be involved in actions that could be construed as directing the police or political interference in the policing process.
<P>
In terms of our responsibility for adequately financing the police, producing the legislation and working with the inspectorate, there is central role for the Secretary of State. What we have been trying to do in the Bill, and I think we have succeeded, is to clarify much more precisely the role of the Police Authority. People have had in their minds a clear-cut role for the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable. The third body, the Police Authority, should have the role of setting objectives and of forming links with community police liaison committees.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said that he wished that the Government would praise the work done by the community police liaison committees. We have done so, repeatedly. It is crucial to the success of policing in Northern Ireland that the Police Authority, in particular, has good links with, and good antennae for, the liaison committees and other bodies. When the authority frames its objectives and holds the Chief Constable to account, it does so on the basis of close links with the grass-roots work done by the community police liaison committees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Under-Secretary of State has dealt at some length with the role of the Secretary of State. Will he clarify what that role would be if there were a political agreement in Northern Ireland? Would it then be devolved to someone else? It would help the Committee if he could tell us that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I am not a participant in the talks process. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is. It would help members of the Committee if he told us how he sees the future role both of the Secretary of State and of a devolved local administration. That matter is central to the political talks process. It would be wrong for me to say what we think the Government should do. The matter is important, and should be dealt with as part of the peace process.
<P>
The Government believe that the clause achieves a good balance, and we resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Under-Secretary's reply to my intervention gives us a sense of the quality of the Government's contribution to the future of policing in Northern Ireland. By their own admission, they have not a clue about what may happen in terms of policing a mere three, four or six months from now. They do not know what the role of the Secretary of State will be. They do not know whether her role will be developed to someone else. Yet the Committee has to consider legislation that, as Ulster Unionist Members have said, should not have been introduced at this time. That was confirmed by the Under-Secretary of State's response. Perhaps his hon. Friend the Minister of State wishes to do better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I want to complement and supplement the remarks by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, but I should also like to have a clear understanding of the points made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Is he saying that he wants the Government to impose solutions in the current talks process? Surely he shares with me, and with the Government as a whole, the view that the participants in the talks have a clear role in determining the future governance of Northern Ireland. The matter would then be decided by the people of Northern Ireland. Does the hon. Gentleman want imposition or participation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That question does not nonplus me in the slightest. As far as the talks are concerned, we are making slow progress. The Government tell us that they hope that the talks will move forward so that we can have a referendum on 7 June or thereabouts. The Under-Secretary asks me to tell him about Government thinking; that is effectively what he is doing. He suggests that the Bill can be taken in limbo, detached from whatever may happen. Surely the Government must have an idea of what the Secretary of State intends. The Under-Secretary spoke for 10 minutes about the current role of the Secretary of State, but he does not know whether that will come to an end within the next six months.
<P>
Our amendments would provide some continuity and cohesion, and enable the Police Authority for Northern Ireland to retain and then augment its current authority. They would help to ensure that we have the right calibre of people to be placed in the invidious position between the bulk of society and the politicians who might interfere directly in day-to-day policing and bring undue pressure on the Chief Constable.
<P>
Everything in the Bill has a sinister aspect. The Police Authority's role is being so eroded that the Secretary of State will be able to dictate to the Chief Constable the way in which every policing objective and key performance target should be achieved. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made it clear that the Bill provides not that the Secretary of State ``shall'' but that she or he ``may'' allow the Police Authority a role.
<P>
The Under-Secretary introduced a red herring by asking me whether I would be annoyed if the Secretary of State did not take responsibility when things went wrong on the security front in Northern Ireland. If I were annoyed about that, I would be annoyed very often. I have never heard a Secretary of State or Minister with responsibility for security stand up and say, ``The escalation of bombing in Moira and Portadown and the escalation of murder throughout Northern Ireland society is my responsibility.'' They would run a thousand miles before admitting that it was their responsibility.
<P>
Time and again the Government have pointed to the Chief Constable and said, ``We are not capable of making decisions, political decisions, unless the Chief Constable tells us what to do.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No, I shall not give way on that point.
<P>
The Government force the Chief Constable to make political decisions. That is what happened last week. It is a reversal of the role that, according to the Minister, currently exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Of course, if the Minister wants to dig himself deeper into a hole, I shall give him the opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall not react to that comment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman claims that the Secretary of State and Ministers run away from their responsibility. I went to Portadown yesterday and I saw what was happening. I spoke to RUC officers, fire officers, members of the Royal Irish Regiment and the Chief Constable. My fellow Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) did that after the Moira incident. Far from running away, we witness what is happening and do our best to listen and communicate to find out how to tackle such matters in future.
<P>
It is clearly the role of the Chief Constable and the security advisers to assess what is happening and advise politicians, who act according to the powers and responsibilities that Parliament has given them. We take our responsibilities very seriously, and discharge them with vigour. I am saddened by the hon. Gentleman's attack.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I would hate to sadden the Minister. I did not say that Ministers ran away from their responsibilities. I said that they ran away from making decisions that they could get the Chief Constable to make. I am sure that the people of Moira and Portadown welcomed and were comforted by the Ministers' visits in dire circumstances, but what decisions have been made as a result of the consultations that took place? Are decisions currently under consideration?
<P>
I am sorry that I have allowed myself to be drawn down that path because I wanted to speak about the Bill rather than the unfortunate events of the past few days. However, it does no harm to point out that Ministers have made no definitive statement about the likely consequences of the upsurge of terrorism. We are confronted with the sad spectacle of Downing street considering whether the Prime Minister will give the IRA an audience during the fortnight in which it is suspended from the talks. I hope that someone will clarify that within the next few days.
<P>
My party has tabled amendments Nos. 27 and 28, and Nos. 29 to 32, and proposes that clause 14 should not stand part of the Bill, because the measure not only removes effective control of the budget from the Police Authority but grants the Secretary of State the right to dictate from on high. The Police Authority exists to provide the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable with a link to grass-roots society.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Secretary of State's role is reduced through a solution to our political problems and a devolved Administration in Northern Ireland, he or she will become even more remote from our society and its needs. That is why, instead of providing for the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other persons as he thinks appropriate'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
clause 14(2) should provide for the Police Authority to be required to consult the Secretary of State on the Government's overall policy and to consult the Chief Constable on his operational responsibilities and the assistance and co-operation required to maximise the constabulary's effectiveness.
<P>
The reference in clause 14(2) to ``such other persons'' disturbs me, as it could mean--in the Northern Ireland context--every Tom, Dick and Harry. The one who cries loudest is listened to in Northern Ireland, whereas the views of other people and long-established organisations that are properly respresentative of society could have been included in the present instance. I understand that Ministers do not want to cut out the possibility of talking to any group, but it is dangerous to want to talk to every group in Northern Ireland. Some people there exploit society in the most dangerous and devious ways. People from paramilitary organisations influence housing associations and community groups.
<P>
Clause 14(2)(c) is likely to cause great trouble that will land at the feet of the Secretary of State. It is a different matter for a corporate body such as the Police Authority, which, despite existing to represent society, has channels of communication that leave it less vulnerable, strangely enough, than the Secretary of State. We saw an example of what I am describing in June 1997 when the Secretary of State, whose courage or sincerity I do not doubt for a moment, became involved with community groups to the extent that she could not meet their increasing demands. Whatever she had done, their demands would have increased. She realised that, and ended up pleasing no one in that episode.The roles set out in the provision should be reversed. In clause 14 the Police Authority should stand in the place of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The Police Authority would be even stronger if the Bill's draftsmen had found some way of including a reference and a role for the community police liaison committees. I have spoken recently to some of their members, who now feel that they are a thing of the past, that will be brushed aside, ignored and not taken seriously in the true measure of policing issues.
<P>
I shall not bore you, Mr. Jones, or anyone else, by speaking about each one of six or seven amendments. Suffice it to say that each seeks to reverse the fact that the role is being clawed towards the Secretary of State, and to hand it back, enhanced, to the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Amendment Nos. 27 to 32 seek to transfer all responsibility for objective setting to the Police Authority. Although we accept that the Police Authority has a clear and proper role in the setting of objectives, there are areas where the Government, with their wider responsibilities and United Kingdom-wide perspective, are the appropriate body to decide priorities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone accused the Government of evading responsibility, but we are taking on responsibility, by setting out what ought to be done. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman realises the fact, but he has contradicted himself again. He frequently does that, sometimes within 30 seconds, and I wish to counsel him about it.
<P>
The Government and the authority must work together--as I think they are already doing successfully. The Government agreed with the objectives set out by the Police Authority, which in turn welcomed the Government's objectives. For that reason I reject the amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 would have no effect. My view is that amendments should improve legislation; amendment No. 74 clearly does not. It would make the wording of the Bill identical to that of section 37 of the Police Act 1996, but as I have said, the two systems already function in a similar way. I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press amendment No. 74, as I do not intend to accept it.
<P>
As for amendment No. 75, the Government intend to consult the Police Authority on objectives and performance indicators as a package, as they did in formulating the Secretary of State's objectives for Northern Ireland for 1998-99. We would not, in my opinion, be complying with the spirit of the proposed legislation if we consulted purely on the wording of objectives without discussing performance indicators. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 78 would make a wholly misconceived change to the Bill. The aim of the objective setting is to enable the Police Authority to set and monitor the standards that the RUC and its support staff must achieve in delivering a police service to the people of Northern Ireland. The amendment seeks to provide in statute that objectives relate to the way in which the Chief Constable delivers the service. That is wrong. The Chief Constable must decide how to attain the goals set for him by the Police Authority and the Secretary of State. He must make operational judgments about the best mix of police officers, support staff, police cars and other equipment to fight crime effectively. Such decisions should be made by a professional police officer.
<P>
The Police Authority must determine whether an officer has made the right decision, and, if he has made the wrong decision, it must hold him to account. The authority should not make operational judgements. That would compromise its ability to scrutinise such decisions objectively and would dilute its role of safeguarding the community's interests. The amendment seems designed to cause such a situation, and we will, therefore, resist it.
<P>
I think that I failed to respond to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire when he spoke about amendments Nos. 76 and 77. I understand that those amendments follow on from amendments Nos. 79 and 80 and would allow the Police Authority's objectives and performance indicators to be included in the RUC strategic plan. The Government have no problem with that. I have received representations on the matter from the Police Authority, and I am persuaded by its arguments. We are happy to accept the amendments in principle, but there are drafting difficulties. We shall consider the introduction of Government amendments to cover the matter at a later stage and I would, therefore, ask the hon. Member not to press the amendments.
<P>
Clause 14 enables the Secretary of State to set objectives and associated performance indicators for policing in Northern Ireland. It requires the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and other persons she thinks appropriate, before determining objectives that are to be set for a period of between three and five years. Following such consultations, the Secretary of State may revise her objectives at any time. That replicates the provisions that apply to England and Wales under the Police Act 1996.
<P>
Similarly, clause 15 places a duty on the Police Authority for Northern Ireland to determine, before the beginning of each financial year, policing objectives for the forthcoming year. The authority must ensure that such objectives are consistent with those determined by the Secretary of State under clause 14, and, in addition, must consult the Chief Constable and consider the views of the community, under the terms of clause 7. That provision recognises the importance of community links, a matter emphasised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.
<P>
The Bill makes considerable improvements in determining the responsibilities of each part of the tripartite structure. The Government resist totally the assertion made about dictation. The hon. Member who made that assertion cannot give a single example of when such dictation occured. It is important to achieve a correct balance of responsibilities and we believe that the Bill does that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister accused me of wishing, through the amendments, to diminish the power of the Secretary of State. That is not the case. I seek to gain parity between the Home Secretary's powers over policing in England and Wales and the powers that the Bill proposes for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Minister did not respond to the point that I made about the 1996 Act. In that Act the Secretary of State certainly sets policing objectives for all police authorities. Likewise, clause 14(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) determine, and from time to time revise, objectives for the policing of Northern Ireland''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>None of my amendments attacks that subsection; I am perfectly happy for the Secretary of State to set objectives for policing Northern Ireland. The amendments would not diminish that power or undermine it, because it is important.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I agree with the Minister's synopsis; the clauses, in the main, will improve policing in Northern Ireland. I did not say that they would not, merely that they are different from the sections in the 1996 Act, that refer to the Home Secretary's powers in England and Wales. The Minister did not say why they are different. Clause 14(1)(b) states that the Secretary of State may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``establish, and from time to time revise, levels of performance . . . to be aimed at in seeking to achieve such objectives''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Secretary of State will establish the performance targets. But the Police Act 1996 makes no similar assertion, nor does it give a similar power.
<P>
Section 38 of that Act, which sets out performance targets, states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State may direct police authorities to establish levels of performance''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fundamental difference; the Minister has not said why it is deemed necessary in Northern Ireland to give the power of establishing performance targets to the Secretary of State, but a similar power does not exist in England and Wales. The Home Secretary directs the police authorities as and when he feels like doing so. He does not set the performance targets, yet we are told that for the Secretary of State to do so is a necessity in Northern Ireland. The Minister has not told us why that should be so. His advisers may say that it is a good thing, but that is not a convincing argument for the Secretary of State to be given the additional power.
<P>
Many of the measures in the Bill are also in the 1996 Act, and most of them will improve policing in Northern Ireland, but there is an anomaly in the clause for which no explanation has been given. It will diminish or erode not the power of the Secretary of State but that of the Police Authority; that is how the authority sees it. In England and Wales the police authorities set performance targets, but in Northern Ireland the Secretary of State will set them, despite the fact that clause 15 states that the Police Authority shall, before the beginning of each financial year, set objectives and targets. But that is just for one year. It is not its primary responsibility.
<P>
Clause 15(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Objectives determined under this section may relate to matters to which objectives determined under section 14 also relate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Police Authority, in setting its objectives, must take into consideration the objectives set by the Secretary of State in the previous clause. I am not sure whether the phrase ``may relate to matters'' is the same as saying that it must take matters into consideration; no doubt the Minister will say why the word ``relate'' is used. It does not appear in the 1996 Act. The phrase ``may relate to'' is ambiguous. Does it mean that the Police Authority must agree with the Secretary of State, or that it must consider what he or she has set and, if it chooses, reject it and set its own objectives? I am not sure. We need clarification and the Minister must tell us why the word ``relate'' is in the clause.
<P>
I said earlier that clause 37 of the 1996 Act states that the Secretary of State ``may by order'' determine objectives, and I talked about the laying of statutory instruments. That is clarified in section 37(3) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A statutory instrument containing an order under this section shall be laid before Parliament after being made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I made the point that Parliament is given the chance to scrutinise the objectives set by the Home Secretary in that instance. It does not say that in the Bill at the beginning of clause 14 although clause 14(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall lay before both Houses of Parliament a copy of any objectives determined or revised or performance targets established or revised by him under this section.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That might be seeking to achieve the same thing. I should like clarification from the Minister that laying a copy of the objectives before both Houses is the same as the wording in the 1996 Act for England and Wales which is very specific and to me reads more strongly. Does the Minister believe that subsection (4) achieves the same aim?
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for accepting the basis for amendments Nos. 76 and 77. I am not sure that when I tabled them I had them relating to a later clause. I must be honest and say that I had not made that connection. They are small amendments which simply tidy up a slight ambiguity. I felt that ``during that year'' should apply to both the determining of the objectives and the establishing of the performance targets. The two go hand in hand. It was simply a tidying-up exercise with no deep thrust and did not relate to any later clause. I am flattered that the Minister or his advisers think that it did. It is encouraging to have little sops and crumbs thrown at one but it makes no difference to the main substance of the clause.
<P>
Essentially, the Committee needs to know the reason for the difference between the wording of the 1996 Act and the Bill in regard to the Secretary of State establishing or setting performance targets: in the 1996 Act the Secretary of State may direct police authorities but is not involved in setting targets. That is a fundamental difference and we have not yet had a proper explanation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> You will recall, Mr. Jones, that I earlier suggested that Ministers might quantify examples. I am pleased that they noted that to the extent that they endeavoured to turn the tables on me and suggest that I should give examples of the Secretary of State dictating to the police. That puzzled me because the Bill is not yet law and it was in respect of what it would do that I alluded to the opportunity for the Secretary of State to dictate. Perhaps I should have chosen my words more wisely and said that she would have been guilty of ill-considered interference in policing matters as I can give the Minister an example of that.
<P>
I recall that last year the Secretary of State--against advice from many quarters, including good operational policemen--decided to appoint a Parades Commission, on the basis that it would judge various parades and make recommendations that would be implemented by the Chief Constable. If the Chief Constable considered, however, that a recommendation was unwise, he could appeal the commission's decision to the Secretary of State, who would then have the option of saying to the Chief Constable, ``No, I shall not listen to your operational advice. You will do as the Parades Commission dictates,'' and with that diktat from the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable would have to carry out his function.
<P>
At the moment of real decision the Chief Constable, of course, has ultimate responsibility to say, ``I have heard from the Parades Commission and I have heard the Secretary of State's diktat, but I shall ignore them because I believe that my men cannot operationally carry out their function.'' We all know what would happen in that instance. The Chief Constable's defiance of the Secretary of State would become public knowledge, which would be an invitation to the ill-intentioned to create the most awful hiatus.
<P>
Where would responsibility lie? Not with those who had dictated but with the Chief Constable, who had had to make an operational decision when the rug had been pulled from under him before he could deal with the problem in hand. If Ministers want further examples and wish to consult me, I will give them many more which bear out my suspicion that the Bill will give a Secretary of State the opportunity to dictate.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State accused me of repeating myself. Perhaps I do; I am a simple village schoolmaster who cannot measure up to the erudite Minister. When in future he accuses me, perhaps, as with more substantive matters, he will quantify what he says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> On the issues raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, the hon. Gentleman will know that we seek where appropriate to replicate the Police Act 1996 because it seems to have worked well. In the context of Northern Ireland, there are complications because some of the powers, and geographical issues, are different. There is a difference between legislating for England and Wales, with 40 to 50 police authorities, and legislating for Northern Ireland, where there is co-terminosity between the responsibilities of the Secretary of State and those of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is also a difference between the powers, or the job, of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the position of the Home Secretary in England and Wales--partly because of the special nature of Northern Ireland, which means that the Secretary of State must have more hands-on responsibilities for security and public order. The terrorist situation requires that. Some objective-setting powers are appropriate for the Secretary of State but inappropriate for use in the rest of the United Kingdom. Moreover, the Secretary of State's power to set objectives is a ``may'' power, which may not have to be used.
<P>
I should like to reassure the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that we shall consider his points further, and that we may write to him or return to his suggestions--especially those about making an order--later. I cannot guarantee further action, but we have listened to his points--[Interruption.] The hon. Gentleman criticised us earlier for overestimating him and seeing more in the amendments than he saw himself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> If the Minister thinks that that is criticism, he should wait for more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Perhaps we are making the same mistake again and overestimating his points. Nevertheless, we can consider dealing with them in a spirit of co-operation on Report, if we feel that it would be appropriate. At this stage, we ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I return to the crumb argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Crummy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> No, I have seen definable crumbs tossed across the Committee Room. In the spirit of the tossing rather than the substance of the crumbs--[Interruption.] Is that intervention to be recorded in Hansard? I think not. I recognise a back-handed offer when I see one.
<P>
I shall not press the amendments to a Division this morning. In attempting to explain the difference between the wording of the 1996 Act for England and Wales and the wording of the Bill, the Minister reverted to arguing about the uniqueness of Northern Ireland. I put that same argument strongly when we debated my amendments to clause 3, which were all thrown out on the grounds that the provisions should be the same as in England and Wales. The Minister said that because chief constables ran the civilian work force in England and Wales, as stipulated in the 1994 and 1996 legislation, that was good enough for Northern Ireland. Yet now he reverses the argument and claims that because Northern Ireland is special, unique and different--
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It is called contradicting yourself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I was coming to that. Yes, it would appear to be so, and the Government do not have a sensible argument in favour of the difference. They now recognise that and want me to withdraw the amendments so that they can think further about them. My proposals were logical. The theme of comparability runs through the Bill, yet there is a glaring difference that has not been explained. It can be explained only in terms of the belief of the Northern Ireland Office that the Secretary of State should have that additional power. That is what the clause is about. Ministers did not write it; it was written by Northern Ireland Office officials and draftsmen. Will the Minister consider redrafting the clause to mirror the wording of the 1996 Act? I would be happy with that, and with the proviso that we shall return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Staff of the Police Authority</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 2, line 10, after `Authority', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and sub-accounting officer for the totality of the Police Grant.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment has to do with accounting. More than &#163;600 million is spent on policing. That is a huge amount. The Police Authority is expected to take possession of that money and to pass it over, in total, to the Chief Constable. The authority is then expected, according to the Bill--but perhaps not according to our debates--to negotiate with the Chief Constable about how much of that money will be returned to it to enable it to employ an unspecified number of personnel. I am confused about how that will work. The matter is rather vague, and the Minister may wish to clarify it.
<P>
The Police Authority is supposed to hold the Chief Constable to account, and yet the Chief Constable will appoint and provide the funding for, or the reverse funding for, the authority's employees. I will not belabour the point, but someone in the Police Authority, such as the chief executive, should ascertain exactly what is going on from day to day. Ulster Unionist Members have proposed the amendment to ensure that the chief executive of the Police Authority is designated a sub-accounting officer for the whole police grant. Without that provision, the authority will not be able to obtain the detailed information required to carry out its task of making the Chief Constable accountable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not think that we need a long debate on the amendment. the term ``accounting officer'' is not a legislative term; it is detemined by Treasury requirements. If I accepted the amendment the whole weight of the Treasury would come down upon me because every other Department would then face the same demands with regard to primary legislation. I therefore resist the amendment.
<P>
I should like to expand on some of the aspects to which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone alluded. He said that the responsibility for the accounting of the grant should be understood by all those who examine it. The Police Authority for Northern Ireland will retain a role in the management of the financial matters which devolve to it. It will have clear responsibilities for setting the high policing budgets. It will scrutinise RUC purchases of novel or contentious items of equipment to which, we shall come in later debates, and it will have the responsibility of holding the Chief Constable to account for his management of those resources.
<P>
The Bill sets out clear responsibilities and defines where the financial allocation of those responsibilities rests. The Police Authority will have specific roles in that, as will the Chief Constable. The hon. Gentleman asked about the Police Authority being subject to the scrutiny or determination of the Chief Constable in relation to the staff it employs. It is not grouped with this amendment but, with your leave, Mr. Jones, I shall explain what Government amendment No. 106 does as it deals with the representations that have been made by the Police Authority and which were raised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone in moving amendment No. 33.
<P>
As the Bill, unlike the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994, provides for the Police Authority for Northern Ireland to be financed through a set grant, there is no requirement for the authority to agree its staffing requirements with the Chief Constable. Government amendment No. 106 deletes that requirement. That is a workable way forward. It takes on board what the hon. Gentleman has said and the representations that have been made by the Police Authority. I ask him to withdraw his amendment and support amendment no. 106.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Government have responded positively to the amendment and I am grateful that the dilemma over the authority having to go the Chief Constable to seek its staff has been resolved. As to the accounting, I am not sure whether the Minister is saying--and I will take a nod from him on this point--that the Police Authority will have access to the detail of expenditure in every case. It is all very well to say that it will be involved in setting budgets and monitoring. However, I want to know about detailed expenditure.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Under clause 48(3) the Police Authority would have the power to call for reports on that detailed aspect of the matter. That is one of our reasons for wanting to give attention to the arrangements for implementing the legislation. We want discussion of the best way to proceed between the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and the office of the Secretary of State. We are working on the matter, and it will be possible to define what we want by closer engagement between those three parties, through the monitoring arrangements that I set out in an earlier debate on clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister is asking us to take matters on trust to a certain extent, and I am prepared to do so. We all appreciate it when our worries about the Bill are taken seriously and the Government make an effort to understand and respond, as the Miniser has just done. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment proposed, No. 106, in page 2, line 33, leave out from `be' to `the' in line 35 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`determined by the authority with the approval of'.-- [Mr. Ingram.]
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Moss:</B> I share the views expressed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone to the extent that I consider that the Government have tried to come, I shall not say half way, but a little way, to meet us and deal with our arguments about clause 3, and particularly those on amendments Nos. 21 and 22. The Government's response does not go the whole way, but at least some attention has been paid to a matter about which the Police Authority was concerned. It considered that the wording of clause 3(6) was completely unacceptable, and the Minister and his advisers have obviously taken that view on board. The Minister did not refer to discussions, but it is to be hoped that there were some.
<P>
The new wording provided by amendment No. 106 practically gives the Police Authority the power to decide which of its civilian employees engaged in authority work should be under its control and on its own books. That will be a matter for discussion with the Chief Constable or for any input by him. Like the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the Opposition welcome the Government's reconsideration of the problem and their tabling of an amendment that satisfies the Police Authority's requirements. The amendment will allow the authority to exercise control over its civilian employees who do Police Authority work, as opposed to those who are attached to police stations and work for, or in close proximity to, the RUC.
<P>
We are delighted that the Government have responded positively to the fears expressed in Committee. We commend them on the speed of their response, which has not gone unnoticed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his kind comments. He asked whether consultation has taken place. I assure him that it continues all the time. As I said earlier, we shall listen to the Police Authority and others who make representations on the likely impact of the Bill. We are willing to respond to reasoned arguments that have merit. On the basis of the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgement of that, we could make rapid progress through the rest of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> In the Minister's response to an earlier debate on amendments No. 21 and 22, which are relevant to clause 3, he implied that he was relying on evidence from the Police Authority. He said that, in its response to the fundamental review, the Police Authority had endorsed the changes in the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 to the relative roles of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority with regard to civilian staff.
<P>
In our deliberations on 12 February, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority for Northern Ireland looked at the effect of the 1994 changes in Great Britain in the context of the fundamental review of the RUC. That review was carried out jointly by the RUC, the NIO and the authority in 1995 and 1996. The summary of its findings was published in January last year . . .<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	In its contribution to the fundamental review report, the authority commented that reform in England and Wales had `successfully refined and clarified the respective tripartite roles and responsibilities for the management of policing resources . . . This has resulted in more efficient and effective use of resources'.
<P>
Commenting on the existing system in Northern Ireland, the authority's input to the fundamental review report noted: `civilian support staff, although being fully committed to their task, had divided allegiances due to their different terms and conditions and personnel management systems . . .
<P>
Lack of clear ownership by the Police Authority or the Chief Constable of the civilian support staff was seen to be a major debilitating factor in relation to the most effective use of this important resource . . . It was commented on by the RUC managers and staff themselves that the personnel management function exercised by the Police Authority was considered to be remote and out of touch with RUC strategic goals and not really in tune with RUC requirements. It was also evident that due to lack of ownership the RUC did not see the civilian staff as ``theirs''

'

''.
<P>
The Minister continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Commenting upon the passing of control of civilian staff to the Chief Constable, the authority noted that it would `remove the current confusion and provide the sense of belonging and ownership for both civilian staff and RUC management.'

''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister summed up his argument by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Those are direct quotes from the Police Authority''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I emphasise that he said Police Authority, capital ``P'', capital ``A''--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``stemming from its experience of previous legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I returned to the theme later that day, at our third sitting. I said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Minister quoted from the fundamental review this morning and referred to comments by the Police Authority. As far as I am aware, the results of the review that was undertaken have not been published or endorsed by the Secretary of State or by PANI. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether that fundamental review document is currently in the public domain. I hope that he will clarify that and revisit some of his comments.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was what I said during our debate on the amendments to clause 3.
<P>
The Minister responded later; he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire mentioned the fundamental review. He said that, as far as he was aware, it had not been approved by the Secretary of State or endorsed by the Chief Constable and PANI. I do not know who is advising the hon. Gentleman, but a summary of the fundamental review has been published and endorsed by the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. Until now, I thought that it had also been endorsed by the Police Authority. If that is no longer the case, the authority has certainly not communicated that to me.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	The full document has not been published, because it deals with some sensitive matters that should not be in the public domain. I do not wish to go into detail about those matters, but that was the judgment of those involved. The hon. Gentleman has got his facts wrong again.''
<P>
I came back to the Minister and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is a key question, however. Did the Minister quote from the original document, which is not in the public domain, or did he quote from the summary?''--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 12 February 1998; c. 80-88.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister did not answer that question in his response, in column 89.
<P>
The Minister employed arguments strongly and powerfully against my position on the movement of civilian staff to the control of the Chief Constable, which--I do not dispute it--is in line with the 1996 Act and the 1994 legislation. However, he gave the Committee the impression that the Police Authority, in its involvement with the fundamental review, had embraced and endorsed those views and fully accpeted the funamental changes proposed to its role in the control and management of civilian personnel.
<P>
	The approval structure for the review report was official endorsement by the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the chairman of the Police Authority. That was agreed at the start of the fundamental review during the previous Government's term of office. It was always to be a tripartite endorsement, but no meeting ever took place to endorse the review. The full review document has never been seen by the chairman of the Police Authority or by any other member of the authority. Where did the quotes come from and to whom are they attributed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to column 89, in which I responded to his points. I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I explained earlier that I was quoting from the views of the Police Authority submitted to the review, not from the fundamental review itself.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 12 February 1998; c. 89.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I ask the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire to take all of the debate on board, not just selective parts of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall go along with that as far as I can. I do not wish to mislead the Committee about what the Minister said, but earlier he said that he was quoting directly from the Police Authority, not from a Police Authority spokesperson. Later, he may have slightly amended what he said, but earlier in the day, he claimed that the quotes were from the Police Authority itself, which was not true. In the morning, when the argument was being advanced, he said that all the quotes were from the Police Authority, which they were not. The fundamental review--
