<H4><center>Tuesday 15 December 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/001/1999001.htm">Water Industry Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, if proceedings on the Water Industry Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Tuesday 12th January at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am very pleased that you will be chairing the Committee's meetings, Mr. McWilliam. I believe that you will be ably assisted from time to time after the recess by Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
Several hon. Members here today made a range of interesting points on Second Reading, when we had a useful and constructive debate. I have no doubt that we shall have an interesting and constructive debate here as well.
<P>
The sittings motion sets the times and days for our discussion of the Bill. The proposal is that we should meet on Tuesday 12 January at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm. I have proposed no further times at this stage because a report by the Modernisation Committee to be considered in the House tomorrow suggests changing the times at which Committees meet on Thursday mornings. It would, therefore, be premature to suggest dates and times for further meetings now. I hope, however, to move another sittings motion once the decision of the House has become clear.
<P>
It might be appropriate, while I am on my feet, to move the order of consideration motion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That has to be done separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have concluded my remarks on the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford):</B> I want to add to the Minister's comments. It is a pleasure to have you, Mr. McWilliam, and your colleague, Mr. Atkinson, presiding over our proceedings on the Bill.
<P>
Conservative Members have no objection to the sittings motion. I am sure that my next point will cause no problems as the Minister referred to it in his introductory remarks, but I should put on record the fact that we will expect another sittings motion once the report has been decided on in the House tomorrow night. A Bill of such importance clearly cannot be dealt with in just three short sittings. Provided that there is a clear understanding that we might need another day's sittings, we have no objection to the motion.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, if proceedings on the Water Industry Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Tuesday 12 January at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the Room. I should also remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call manuscript amendments or starred amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 12; Schedule 1; Clauses 13 to 15; Schedules 2 and 3; remaining Clauses; new Clauses; new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The order that has been suggested provides a simple and straightforward way of discussing the Bill's provisions. I hope that that is agreeable and finds favour with the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disconnection for non-payment of charges</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 13, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `which is occupied by a person as his only or principal home'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `except where it can be demonstrated that it is not occupied by a person as his only or principal home'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to probe the Government's intentions in relation to clause 1(2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
May hon. Members remove their jackets, so that they may make contributions in greater comfort?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is rather warm today. Hon. Members may remove their jackets&#151;ladies, of course, do not need to ask.
<P>
<B>Mr Burns:</B> The Committee is grateful to the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). Apart from his adjournment of sittings, his question was probably the most welcome remark that he will make during the Committee's consideration of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 1(2) will make it illegal for a water company to disconnect the domestic water supply of any dwelling that is the principal or prime residence of an individual or family. The provision was discussed at length on Second Reading, and I do not intend to rehearse comments made there. Presumably, the Government's main line of thought in clause 1(2) is not to extend the provision to holiday homes, to weekend retreats or to country homes used in the summer.
<P>
The Minister will be aware that during the past 10 or 15 years, a trend has occurred for people to take the advice of a noble Lord. Increasingly, people work away from home from Monday to Friday and live in accommodation that is effectively their main dwelling. That enables them to conduct their business away from their family home, to which they return at weekends.
<P>
As I understand it, the law provides that the home where an individual's family resides is his or her prime residence. As I said, a person may rent or own a flat or house to live in during the week for work purposes. That person will effectively be the main resident in the property, but will not be in legal terms. How will the clause apply to such people? Will their weekday homes be taken as second homes and not as an ``only or principal home''?
<P>
Will the disconnection provisions not apply to such homes, which are needed for work purposes rather than as holiday homes? Will users of such homes be liable for disconnection, under provisions that do not apply to their family home?
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that my assessment and reading of the Bill are correct, and explain how the provisions are justified in relation to the dwellings about which I have spoken?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Mr. Alan Meale): As the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) said, the amendment is intended to probe the principles that underlie the clause. I will come to his specific point later.
<P>
The amendment raises the issue of second homes. It is interesting to see so early in the proceedings that it appears from the amendment that Conservative Members agree with the Government's view that second homes do not merit statutory protection against disconnection for non-payment.
<P>
On a practical level, anyone who chooses to have more than one home has no good excuse for not budgeting to meet the necessary bills for those premises. That does not mean that the Government have anything against those people who find it necessary to live in more than one home. Many members of the Committee are in that position, as indeed I am. I do not regard myself as being particularly privileged in that respect. I feel comfortable about the fact that it is an affordable item and therefore should not be exempted from any proposed legislation. However, the Government are worried, not about people with more than one home, but about those who cannot pay.
<P>
If, as I understand is the case, members of the Committee are generally content that second homes should not be protected, the remaining question concerns the way in which second homes are to be sorted out from other homes. In those circumstances, it must be for the water companies to consider what steps to take to ascertain whether a particular dwelling is a main or an only home. The amendment is unclear about how the word ``demonstrated'' would work in practice. Who would have to demonstrate what was not an only or main home? To whom would they have to demonstrate it, and when and how?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Can the Minister confirm that he believes, as he implied, that everybody who has a second home&#151;for whatever reason&#151;can afford that home, and that they will never be in a situation in which they can't pay rather than won't pay?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I think that there are already regulations by which people in particular financial circumstances may apply, quite rightly, for support. In the Bill, the Government are trying to establish the principle of a home being the principal area that will be exempt. The example that I gave referred to Members of Parliament, many of whom have a second home. They do not regard themselves as being particularly privileged in that respect, but most of them would accept that, if the Bill becomes law, they will be expected to pay rates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> No.
<P>
If there were to be prescribed procedures, the effect would be unnecessarily bureaucratic. If there were to be no prescribed procedures, the amendment would do no more than stipulate that the water undertaker must show, if challenged, that he has not cut off someone's only or main home.
<P>
That is hardly different from the practical effect of the Bill, and I cannot see that it would represent an improvement. In practice, a water undertaker will be careful, as a responsible organisation should be, to ensure that any premises that it disconnects are definitely not ``excluded premises'' under the clause. If the undertaker is not sure, it will risk committing a criminal offence. I cannot believe that, with or without the amendment, water companies would disconnect what they hope are second homes without being quite sure of it and in a position to prove it in court. The amendment would not make water undertakers any more careful to ensure that they were acting within the law. I urge members of the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray (North Wiltshire):</B> I wished to make a brief intervention, but allowed the Minister to conclude his remarks before doing so.
<P>
How will it be possible to find out which homes are second homes and which are not? There are two possible ways of doing so. First, council tax data, whereby 50 per cent. council tax is due on a second home, could be made available to the water undertakers. Secondly, it is necessary for capital gains tax purposes to declare which is one's primary residence and which is one's secondary residence. The income tax authorities therefore hold information about people who have two homes. The Government should make available one or both of those registers to the water undertakers, so that the problem would not arise.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meale:</B> As I emphasised earlier, it is up to individuals to stipulate which is their primary residence and home. It is also incumbent on them to prove that if they are challenged.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I listened very carefully to what the Minister said. As I said earlier, this is a probing amendment, so we have no intention of pressing it to a Division this morning. I shall read the Official Report of this morning's proceedings with care. The Minister referred to the situation of Members of Parliament. I may be wrong, but I thought that he went further, and suggested that anyone with a second home would, almost by definition, have no financial problems. However, we shall have to wait until the Official Report comes out tomorrow to see whether that was what the Minister said. If he did, it would be a rather unusual generalisation. In the instance that I suggested, people who have to go away during the course of the week because of their work are not necessarily wealthy; they do not necessarily have a little cottage in the country with roses round the front door as a second home. They may need a flat to sleep in during their working week.
<P>
I take on board what the Minister has said, although I think that my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) raised an important point about how one legally defines a prime residence. Because some families live in two homes during the course of the week, whether some of them will start messing around to define each one as their prime residence for the wife and the husband&#151;or partner, depending on marital status&#151;remains to be seen. I suspect that some people did that under the community charge system, and some may even contrive to benefit financially from the council tax.
<P>
We are satisfied by the Minister's explanation regarding this probing amendment. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I wish to speak to the amendments in the name of my hon. Friends and myself. That does not include all the amendments in the group, a number of which have been tabled by the hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) and for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie). We shall want to discuss those as well in connection with our amendments Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 is a probing amendment, designed to seek information from the Minister. It would provide protection if it were needed&#151;no doubt the Minister will enlighten us if it is not&#151;to those renting bed-sits in a large house that has been divided up. Their weekly rent includes a charge for water, and the water bill is in the name of the owner of the property, who is almost certainly the landlord. What happens if the landlord fails to pay the bill even though the tenants in the bedsits have, in all good faith, paid their rent, which includes an element towards the water bill, in full? If the water companies cannot coax the money out of the landlord, will they disconnect the water supply? That would be punishing only the innocent tenants who have met their financial responsibilities. The landlord, to all intents and purposes, will have got off scot free, because he will almost certainly not be living on the premises, and so will not be affected. I wonder whether that is a correct analysis of the Bill&#151;the purpose of the amendment is to tease that out from the Government. Are the Government willing to give protection to tenants who live in bed-sits in houses in multiple occupancy who may, through no fault of their own, find their water disconnected because of an unscrupulous or lackadaisical landlord?
<P>
The second set of amendments&#151;amendments Nos. 7 to 10&#151;raises another issue that we raised on Second Reading. Sadly, on Second Reading, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), devoted most of his winding-up speech to the contents of the Bill, rather than to winding-up the debate and answering the questions raised during it. Mr. McWilliam, I will confine my comments to the Bill, so that I do not step out of order, but I will say that it is now common practice for the Government, when asked difficult questions, to sidestep them by ignoring them. Ministers can swap many stories with their colleagues about the best ways to do that. That is frustrating&#151;it is one of the many downsides of opposition. I hope that, in this Committee, we shall not sidestep the issues but get some answers.
<P>
We note that the Bill will make it illegal to disconnect the water supply of the main resident domestic water users&#151;plus hospitals and schools. On Second Reading, the Minister for the Environment helpfully said&#151;from a sedentary position, I believe&#151;that there had been no disconnections of the water supply to any hospital or school. That comes as no surprise to me or my hon. Friends&#151;or, I suspect to Labour Members. If we accept the Bill's philosophy&#151;I shall not rehearse the arguments about whether we should, because we did so on Second Reading&#151;that disconnection should be illegal in certain circumstances, it seems natural to include domestic homes, or prime residences. If that principle is to be extended, hospitals and schools appear an obvious choice. Although the evidence shows that it is most unlikely that a hospital or school would face disconnection, it is always possible. I can understand why the Government want to prevent that.
<P>
However, why have the Government restricted the provision to hospitals and schools? Why do they not include children's homes, which are basically domestic dwellings for children who have usually been placed there through the care system? It would be devastating if the water supply to such homes were disconnected because someone had failed to pay the water bill. By their nature, such institutions are children's domestic homes. So my hon. Friends and I are puzzled about why the Government have not included children's homes in the Bill.
<P>
Similarly, amendment No. 8&#151;and amendment No. 11, tabled by the hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington and for Edinburgh, West&#151;would cover nursing homes and residential homes. They look after some of the most vulnerable and frail members of our society; why have they been excluded from the provisions of the Bill? Until the community care programme came into full effect, many people who are now cared for in nursing homes would, of course, have been looked after in a long-stay national health service hospital, and would therefore have been covered by the Bill. But the system changed&#151;it was thought that the quality of life was greatly enhanced in a nursing home where people can be individually and properly looked after, rather than in the undignified long-stay hospitals that blighted our health-care system until about a decade ago. Why, then, are nursing homes not included in the list? Perhaps there is a good reason; maybe they are covered by the Registered Homes Act 1984. I suspect, however, that that is not so. If it were, no doubt the junior Minister would have pointed it out with glee when we raised the matter on Second Reading. I can only assume that the Government have taken a deliberate decision not to include nursing homes.
<P>
The same argument applies to residential homes. With an aging population, more and more people are living in residential homes. Again, many are privately run, and it would be devastating if the owner of a home were to forget or for other reasons failed to pay the water bill to the point where the water company felt that it had no alternative but to disconnect the establishment. In the end, as with children's homes and nursing homes, the innocent, frail and vulnerable would be most directly and most dramatically hit by the impact of such a decision.
<P>
Similarly, amendment No. 9 would add further education establishments to the list of places that cannot legally be disconnected by a water company. If schools are on that list, why not colleges of further education and universities&#151;and polytechnics, if they still exist? By definition, they are exactly the same type of establishment as a school, but higher up the education system and for older students. Surely, the principle remains the same. If you are going to include schools&#151;

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not going to include anything. When the word ``you'' is used in Committee, it refers to me. It has happened quite a few times. I know it is difficult and tiresome, but it is the rule: the word ``you'' refers to the Chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam, and I apologise. I slipped into autospeak and forgot. I shall seek to remain in order from now on.
<P>
If the Government accept that schools should be covered by the Bill, I find it odd&#151;unless there is a very good reason of which we are currently unaware&#151;that the Government have not included colleges of further education and universities. Logically, they should be included.
<P>
Will the Minister explain why the five types of establishment that we have specified in the amendments, all of which are crucial and involve vulnerable or frail people, are not being given the same protection as the establishments specified in the Bill? We will listen carefully to Ministers' explanations before we decide whether we will divide the Committee at the end of the debate on this group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake (Carshalton and Wallington)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Gentleman, I must tell the hon. Member for West Chelmsford that he should not feel too bad about his use of the word ``you'', because hon. Members on both sides make the same mistake. It is easy to do&#151;I have been accused of everything from Rachmanism to fathering unwanted children out of wedlock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> It is my pleasure to work under your chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 11 to 19, which have been tabled by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie) and myself. They cover much of the same ground as the amendments that were tabled by the official Opposition. I will not speak to each amendment individually, as I believe that the same principle applies to them all. I want to try to establish the precise definition of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``any dwelling which is occupied by a person as his only or principal home''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have done that because the legal advice that I have received is that ``dwelling'' has a tight legal definition. I seek also to extend the range of water users who will be protected from the threat of disconnection.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments No. 19, 18 and others refer to business premises. The disruption that the disconnection of such premises would cause would have such a severe impact on the users of the invaluable services that businesses provide that a ban on disconnection is justified.
<P>
If the Minister can confirm that some or all of the types of accommodation and housing that I have listed in the amendments are included in the definition in clause 1(2) (6) (a), I will willingly withdraw the amendments. If some or all of them are not included, however, I urge the Minister to add them to the list of exceptions to the rules about disconnections.
<P>
Some of the premises in the amendments&#151;such as residential care homes&#151;are used by vulnerable groups. In some instances, the occupant or occupants might have no control over whether water bills are paid, and the hon. Member of West Chelmsford has already given the example of multi-occupancy homes. The disconnection of some premises would have severe health implications.
<P>
If the Minister is not prepared to extend his list of exceptions to include sensible proposals on children's homes and residential care homes, I hope that he will at least explain in some detail why he is not prepared to take the relevant groups on board and offer them the protection that he is offering private dwellings, schools and hospitals. For now, we reserve our right to push any of our amendments to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Donald Gorrie </B>(Edinburgh, West): I am a recent arrival to the House of Commons, so it gives me great pleasure to sit under your august chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam. I remember when you controlled the financial affairs of Edinburgh.
<P>
To use that example, I am sure that even under your excellent leadership, the city of Edinburgh could sometimes fail to pay its bills timeously. Many of the premises in the amendments are different from private houses, where non-payment results from an individual's inability or unwillingness to pay. The amendments relate to administrative muddle and to organisations failing to pay. That is much more likely to be the case. Some organisations might be skint, although I am not sure whether that is a legitimate phrase. Such organisations might lack funds and be unable to pay. Administrative incompetence is, however, the more likely cause of non-payment.
<P>
We must accept that administrative incompetence exists in the world and that we should make allowance for it. It would be unfortunate if any of the places that we are discussing, which are essential for the life and health of the people who live and work in them and which serve the community, had their water cut off because of their administrative incompetence. The Bill should make allowance for that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This a complex set of amendments, so before I call the Minister for the Environment I should assist the Committee. The only amendment before us on which we may vote is amendment No. 6. Any member of the Committee who wants to press another amendment in the group to a Division should say so at the end of the debate. I will then ask him to move the amendment formally. Apart from amendment No. 6, none of the amendments has been moved yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The amendments are complex, but they are connected by a single thread of argument about extension of the prohibition of disconnection beyond its primary focus&#151;the principal or only home. The issue of second homes has been raised, and we have extended application to hospitals and schools.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford will receive full, comprehensive and convincing answers to his questions. Labour Members will try to ensure that he does.
<P>
I should like to spell out the basic principle that underlies the clause. Protection should apply in limited circumstances, in which premises are used primarily as dwellings for vulnerable groups that could suffer particular hardship if deprived of water. That principle underlies the proposal to extend the prohibition of disconnection to educational establishments and to hospitals.
<P>
The Bill's arrangements for schools are explained simply by the fact that children are not required to attend day-care centres or higher and further education establishments as they are to attend school. Universal attendance does not apply to any educational establishments other than schools.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire frowns. Before he rises, I should tell him that my remarks will be sympathetic. He should wait until I have spelt out the full panoply of the arguments that underlie the clause.
<P>
The Bill's approach to medical premises is justified because people undergoing treatment in a hospital are obviously especially vulnerable. The word ``hospital'' is defined widely, and is covered by section 2 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. The parameters cover any institution for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from illness, any maternity home and any institution for the reception and treatment of persons during convalescence or for persons requiring medical rehabilitation. Illness includes mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983 and any injury or disability requiring medical, surgical or dental treatment or nursing. My general point is that the word ``hospital'' is not as narrow as it might look, and is construed widely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am still on the outskirts of the mammoth speech that I am about to make, but the hon. Member for West Chelmsford may of course intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I have a question about a point of fact. The Minister gave the Committee definitions of ``hospital'' under relevant legislation. They did not refer to residential nursing homes, as we now know them. Does the Bill specifically cover them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think not. I shall come to the point, because it is one of the major proposed extensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Perhaps I could complete my answer.
<P>
Having set out the general principle, I am concerned that the Government should consider sympathetically reasonable extensions of protection against disconnection, provided that they are limited and that they adhere to that general principle.
<P>
I shall come to the Liberal Democrats' proposals, but the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington may intervene if he wishes. It seems that he does not wish to do so.
<P>
There is a balance to be struck. On Second Reading, I made it clear that we regard preventing household disconnectin as a vital priority. The Opposition have not tabled any amendments that would alter that position; I hope that that indicates that they agree with us&#151;we shall find out when we vote on the clause. In our view, it cannot be acceptable to allow domestic customers&#151;especially families&#151;to be deprived of access to a sufficient supply of clean water for drinking, washing, cooking and sanitation. The recent trend of reductions in disconnections is of course welcome. On Second Reading, it was much touted that the figure for disconnections for the first half of this year was as low as 640, but for the families concerned, that is still significant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way on the subject of the 640?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> it is a pity that I mentioned it, but yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman knows, I raised the issue on Second Reading. He was kind enough to look into the matter to tell me that of the 640 properties, none was vacant. What he failed to tell me was how many of them were second homes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I cannot answer that question now; I believe that very few indeed of them were second homes. I do not think that the information that I have been given includes second homes; if we have that information, I will be glad to give it to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Against that general principle, we clearly do not want to impose unduly onerous or inflexible requirements on water companies. There is a balance to be struck. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, even where water companies retain the power to disconnect in the event of non-payment, we expect them to use that power sensitively and sensibly. We therefore do not consider it necessary significantly to add to the list of excluded premises prescribed in clause 1. I repeat that household disconnection remains the focus of our concern; we want to ensure that consumers who may be especially hard-pressed do not face the risk of disconnection and the attendant risks to their health and well-being.
<P>
Having made clear our general position, which I hope is now widely accepted, I turn to the amendments. Amendment No. 6 asks us to protect houses in multiple occupation from disconnnection for non-payment.
<P>
I am glad to say that the informaion sought by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) has now arrived by pigeon post. We do not have information about second homes, because at present there is no need to break down the figures on that basis. So we do not know, but I suspect that the number is extremely small, if any. That is as far as I can take the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way for a second time on this point. It is interesting to know that he does not have that information. I suspect that nearly all of the 640 are holiday homes in Cornwall, for example, which means that there is no disadvantage to being disconnected. If so, the entire clause is pointless, because that would mean that at present there are no disconnections of families and the vulnerable&#151;the sort of people that the Minister has been describing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman must be speaking in cavalier fashion when he says that almost all of the 640 were holiday homes in Cornwall. We shall seek to gather further information&#151;there may be some. If we consider the figures, we see that disconnections are spread all over the country&#151;although, as I said on Second Reading, nine of the 27 water companies have not disconnected anyone, even if they have not set a policy to dispense with disconnection. That is an increase from six last year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> This is preliminary material, but I want to be helpful.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It seems to me extraordinary that the Government are proposing legislation based on the principle of disconnection, and yet we find ourselves in Committee with them still unable to tell us who the 640 disconnections represent. It is difficult for Opposition Members to accept that, although we are debating a major piece of legislation, which may have a major impact on consumers and the industry, the Minister is telling us that it is not necessary to understand the components of those 640 disconnections made this year. Indeed, his Department seems unable to shed any light on the background to those disconnections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) is getting carried away by his own rhetoric. I did not say that we could provide no further information on the 640 disconnections. In fact, detailed data about household disconnections have already been published; I have the relevant sheet in front of me. However, I did say that the information is not broken down as between principal home and second home.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman raised the point, let me highlight some of the larger figures for members of the Committee; they show that disconnection happens throughout the country. In the period between 1 April and 30 September 1998, 166 disconnections were made in the Thames Water area, 95 in the Dwr Cymru area, 23 in the Dee Valley area, 68 in the Portsmouth area, 31 in the Three Valleys Water area&#151;which is north of London&#151;and 107 in the Yorkshire Water area. [Interruption.] I am looking to see whether there are any in Cornwall. If there are, the number must be very small.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman (Meriden):</B> I thank the Minister for giving way again on this very important point. Opposition Members are not privy to the information about the nature of the 640 disconnections. Perhaps we might tackle the problem in another way.
<P>
The geographical distribution of the disconnections tells us nothing about the likely practical implications of the Bill. If the Minister cannot tell us how many of the 640 disconnections affected second homes as distinct from principal homes, can he tell us how many fall into the categories of people whom he would define as vulnerable? Our information matches exactly that given by the right hon. Gentleman about the geographical distribution. Each water company tells us that, of the millions of people that they serve, a handful do not pay their bills and are disconnected, often after a very long time. But we are still no better informed about the number of people who are vulnerable. That is important when it comes to theorising about which categories of institution should be exempt.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be just that&#151;interventions. That one was getting much too long. The hon. Lady is perfectly entitled to catch my eye later if she wishes to press the Minister further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I take note of the point made by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). However, if the Opposition were really worried about the application of disconnection and whether it affected vulnerable groups, they could have tabled amendments&#151;probing or otherwise&#151;to exclude particular groups. No such amendments have been tabled. All the interventions are about the general principle of disconnnection, and its application, not about whether there should be an extension of excluded premises. I am still struggling to reach the main point raised by this group of amendments.
<P>
As I wish to be helpful, let me say that the 640 disconnections represent a 35 per cent. reduction on the previous year, which I welcome. It is true that 41 per cent. of disconnections were reconnected within 24 hours. A further 6 per cent. were reconnected in the next 24 hours, which means that 47 per cent. were reconnected within two days. However, that means that 53 per cent. of disconnections were not reconnected within the first two days. More than half of those who were disconnected had to spend at least two whole days without water for any purpose. [Interruption.] Perhaps I could point out that it is not only the first two days, but we might talk about that later in the clause stand part debate. About 47 per cent.&#151;nearly half&#151;were disconnected for more than a week, and a considerable number for up to four weeks. That means that all those groups suffered severe deprivation. One must ask whether it is appropriate for vulnerable groups&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am still trying to answer the previous question.
<P>
I am saying that there is no question but that a significant proportion of these people are from vulnerable groups. They are subjected to extreme hardship and deprivation. That is the basis of the argument. If Committee members want to return to that, perhaps we could do so during the clause stand part debate.
<P>
I turn to the amendments. Amendment No. 6 invites us to protect houses in multiple occupation from disconnection. I take the point that has been made. However, there are technical problems with the amendment, although I make no complaint about that; Opposition Members do not have the drafting capability of the Government. I think that I am right in saying, for example, that the definition of a house in multiple occupation is not in the Housing Act 1996 but in the Housing Act 1985.
<P>
On the substance of the amendment, we are well aware that the umbrella term ``housing in multiple occupation'' covers a wide variety of different premises. We are not talking simply about small permanent homes such as bedsits, although that is what most people think of. Housing in multiple occupation includes, for instance, residential conference centres and Christian retreats. I do not think that anyone would expect or intend even a probing amendment to include such places.
<P>
The issue is complex. Of course we want to protect tenants in bedsits. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked what would happen if the landlord did not pay the water bill. That is also the key issue raised by amendment No. 15 and if I ever reach that amendment, I shall return to the point. With regard to amendment No. 6, I shall carefully consider the substantive points that have been made in this debate on whether the Bill should be extended to include houses in multiple occupation.
<P>
I turn now to children's homes, to which Amendment No. 7 refers. It is a useful amendment. Of course we all recognise the importance of protecting our children&#151;obviously our own, but also children who do not live with families of their own. It seems right that we should protect children who live in children's homes from being deprived of a water supply through no fault of their own. Again, however, there are problems with the application of the amendment. Its suggested definition would exclude homes that are run by local authorities, and it may contain other gaps that it is not possible to identify in this short time scale. I will listen to any other views from hon. Members on this issue and again, I am happy to consider the matter further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for what sounds like a genuine commitment and possibly a concession. May I just tease out from him what he means by ``consider further''? Does it mean that he may accept the amendment if we redraft it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Yes. It means that we will consider the application with regard to children's homes, which we believe is right and proper. We do not, for example, think it right to exclude homes that are run by local authorities. If Opposition Members want to table an amendment at a later stage, that is fine, but I am saying that the Government will consider the matter again and if we think it appropriate, we will table our own amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister. Perhaps I may ask one further question, as he seems to be in generous mode in the run-up to Christmas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to hear that. I shall test the right hon. Gentleman now. He said that if he feels on further reflection that there is a need to change the Bill to include children's homes, both local authority and private, he will do so. As he is being so generous, given that Conservative Members have raised and pressed the argument, would he, in the spirit of good will to all men and women, be even more generous and let us borrow his civil servants to draft the correct amendment so that we might table it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not push his luck. The amendment itself is the important thing, and with respect to the hon. Gentleman its authorship is not the issue. Conservative Members have made the point that they asked the Government to think again and that the Government were willing to do so. They will have to wait to see what the Government finally decide.
<P>
As I said, our concern is to establish the basic principle of a limited number of exceptions to protect vulnerable groups. I shall now turn to some other vulnerable groups, particularly nursing homes, with a little further generosity&#151;if I am allowed to reach that point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I should like to press the Minister further about children's homes. A principle is a principle, and the principle in this instance is that no vulnerable group should be cut off from the supply of water. Can the Minister give the Committee an undertaking that he will table an amendment that will guarantee that no child will be subject, for whatever reason, to disconnection because of bad behaviour by a landlord, whether private or public? The principle is that no vulnerable group should be cut off, and there is no more vulnerable group than that of children. The Minister should acknowledge a crucial point of principle and confirm that the Bill will fully protect children.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister addresses that point, it relates to clause stand part rather than to the amendment, and I hope that it will be saved for that part of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I have made the Government's position perfectly clear, and I shall not go further than that. We shall examine several options, and we will present a proper and defensible position that protects vulnerable groups but does not stretch the exception so widely as to be unreasonable or onerous to water companies.
<P>
Amendment No. 8 suggests that nursing homes, as defined in the Registered Homes Act 1984, should be included. It is useful to consider what that definition means in layman's terms. Broadly speaking, the definition includes a number of premises that would be included in the definition given in the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 that the Bill already included if they were run by the national health service. There may be good reasons for covering those premises. For example, those living in hospices that are run by charities rather than by the NHS would be covered by this definition. However, the premises, by the very nature of the definition, are commercial premises and include premises such as private cosmetic surgery clinics. I am not against the commercial aspect. The care of vulnerable elderly people, whether or not it is commercial, is the significant factor. I do not wish to include private cosmetic surgery clinics, for example. In addition, no local authority run premises would be included&#151;the same omission, as I assume that it was&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I think that the Minister will find, if my memory of the previous Conservative Government serves me correctly, that local authorities are not allowed to own or run nursing homes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That may be the case under legislation that was brought forward by the Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> It still is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I accept that. My point is that it needs to be confirmed that there are no nursing homes other than commercially owned premises that should be included when the issue is examined further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I beg to differ with the hon. Member for West Chelmsford. A home in my constituency is run jointly by the London borough of Sutton and the St. Helier trust. How would the provisions apply to such a home, which is a joint operation carried out by the national health service and by the local authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is precisely the point, and is something of an answer&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> It is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> All right, perhaps it is not. The home about which the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington spoke is the sort of institution that should be included, if the Bill were extended to cover nursing homes, and if it were appropriate. It is because of such examples that I am not prepared to give exact commitments about the Government's intentions. I am sympathetic to the amendment's aims, but we wish the Bill to include and to exclude the institutions that we intend. Residential homes in which people receive board and care but not nursing would not be covered.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am grateful to the Opposition for tabling the amendment. It should be examined again, and I am glad to say that we will further consider it.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 propose the inclusion of residential homes in the list of excluded premises. The suggested definitions cover a wide range of premises, so they involve the same problem as that which arose earlier. In layman's terms, the definitions would cover premises that provide board and care but not nursing care. Old people's homes would be covered, as would some drug or alcohol rehabilitation centres. That is why the amendment should be carefully considered.
<P>
In the Government consultation document, ``Water Charging in England and Wales: A New Approach'', we asked whether residential care homes should be covered by protection against disconnection. Water companies pointed out that care homes were commercial premises run on a commercial basis and argued that they should be treated as such. Eight local authorities argued against that view, saying that such premises should be protected against disconnection. In fairness, I should point out that even two water companies accepted that.
<P>
Many residents of such premises are vulnerable and are especially susceptible to adverse effects on their health in the event of disconnection. I should like to consider carefully the extension of protection to cover such premises.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 was tabled by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, who sits below the Gangway, if that is the correct way in which to refer to an hon. Member who sits along the row on the Opposition Benches. The amendment seeks to add sheltered accommodation for the elderly to the list of properties protected against disconnection.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the Government would not allow sheltered housing for the elderly to be disconnected. The amendment is not necessary, however, because sheltered accommodation is covered by the term ``private dwelling-house'', and will therefore be protected by clause 1. We will check that; it is our view, and if it turns out to be erroneous, we shall take necessary measures to ensure that sheltered accommodation is included. We understand that it is already included under clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Will the Minister confirm that he has given a firm undertaking that the question is not one that will be considered further, but one of definite inclusion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The Government will ensure that people who live in sheltered accommodation will be protected against disconnection.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 proposes the inclusion of university halls of residence in the list of excluded premises. Such halls of residence provide dwellings for many people, but will in many cases not be an individual's only home. They are also rarely lived in all year round. Most residents will have an alternative dwelling, whether with family or friends or elsewhere, to which they return during holidays.
<P>
The Commitee is wading through a range of various premises. I should be very surprised if any of them had been disconnected or were likely to be disconnected. To some extent, therefore, this debate is rather artificial. It is however, perfectly fair that we should be clear about the principles that underlie the proposals. It is in that spirit that I am trying to clarify matters.
<P>
Were a hall of residence is to the disconnected, residents could move elsewhere. That is not the case in a primary private dwelling house, whose residents are unlikely to have any other home. Again, the issue is important and I would be prepared to consider it further. It does not, however, seem to be an appropriate area for an extension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Will the Minister confirm for the Committee's benefit that his view is that accommodation 300 miles away is a suitable alternative for a student in term time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> No. I understand the point. We are talking about a hall of residence being disconnected, which is extremely unlikely. If that were the case, however, it would be technically possible for students quickly to find alternative accommodation. I am sure that the authorities in that unlikely contingency would make provision. I am, however, prepared to consider the issue again. Such students are not in the same situation as elderly people, children or those with a medical condition. They are much more able-bodied and can look after themselves. I am prepared to consider the matter again, although perhaps not hopefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister has raised another issue. He talked about university halls of residence. Does the Bill's provision to exclude schools include boarding schools in its definition of schools? In boarding schools you have dormitories, which are equivalent to halls of residence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I believe that boarding schools would be included. I will confirm that they fall within the definition. They are schools. We are concerned with all the premises within schools, and particularly with the living quarters&#151;they, rather than the classroom, are precisely where people need water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Member for West Chelmsford, I should remind him that I own no schools&#151;particularly not boarding schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister, but, logically, a dormitory is no different from a hall of residence. If students in a hall of residence can find alternative accommodation relatively easily&#151;even when their homes are 300 miles away&#151;pupils at a boarding school could, logically, also find alternative accommodation. They could return to the parental home, even though that might not coincide with their educational requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman was saying that tongue in cheek. There was a good degree of logic chopping. There is a great difference between the situation of young men and women who are adults and who find alternative accommodation in the unlikely circumstances that we are discussing and the situation of children. We could be talking about many children, and finding alternative accommodation for them would be extremely difficult. That is where I propose to draw the line, but I will consider the issue. It is&#151;[Interruption.]

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying to follow the Minister's remarks, but there is a lot of chatter. If any hon. Member catches my eye, I will call him at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Amendment No. 15 would add rented accommodation where the tenant was not responsible for paying the water charge to the list of excluded premises. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford specifically raised that issue.
<P>
I recognise that the amendment is linked to new clause 2, to which we shall come in due course. New clause 2 would make the owners rather than the tenants of rented property responsible for paying water charges. The amendment is, however, not necessary&#151;whether or not the Committee chooses to accept new clause 2. The existing wording of the protection conferred by clause 1 in no way depends on who is responsible for paying the water charges. Of course we do not want tenants to be disconnected because the landlord has not paid any water charges, but it is the occupiers&#151;the residents&#151;of dwelling-houses whom we wish to protect. All premises that are occupied as the only or main home, whether by tenants or owner-occupiers, will be protected from disconnection for non-payment, irrespective of who is paying&#151;or rather, not paying&#151;the bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Will the Minister explain how water companies will know that either the tenant or the landlord has not paid the bill? I am sure that, on occasion, the landlord's name will be on the bill and he will appear to be at a given address, so how will the water company know?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not listening. I was making it clear that it does not matter whether the rent is being paid by the landlord or the tenant. The important point is that the occupier&#151;who is the tenant&#151;for whom it is the principal or only home is protected under clause 1.
<P>
We recognise that there may be further cases, going beyond the specific focus on homes, which merit consideration for special protection. For that reason, we prohibited the disconnection of schools and hospitals. We want to ensure that, where there is a real prospect of particularly vulnerable groups facing hardship under current arrangements, or where there is a significant danger to public health, the risk of disconnection is removed. As I have tried to show, that means adopting a carefully targeted approach to ensure that water companies are not subject to unreasonable constraints in carrying out their operations.
<P>
I apologise for the length of my speech, but perhaps I may quickly move on to the remaining amendments, all of which raise further issues. Amendment No. 3 is consequential, and I shall consider it further in light of the amendments suggesting the extension of the list of excluded premises.
<P>
Amendment No. 9 relates to further education premises, which several hon. Members suggested should be included in the list of excluded premises. Obviously, we believe that education is an important function. We send our children to school so that they are educated, and we certainly expect them to be safe there. We do not expect them to go to school but to be unable to wash their hands or flush the toilet. That is why we are protecting schools from being threatened with disconnection.
<P>
However, students at further education institutions are not in the same position. They are often not expected to attend for the whole day and they carry out part of their work in other premises or in their own homes. Although we have been unable to study the proposed definition in depth, it is worth thinking about the sort of premises that might be covered by such an amendment. It might cover rooms above pubs, for example, which accommodate an evening class in philosophy or carpentry. Consequently, the rest of the pub might be covered, too. Obviously, that is not our intention. Company training centres for aspiring accountants and business schools might also be included. I would therefore ask hon. Members not to press amendment No. 9 to a vote.
<P>
Amendment No. 10 relates to higher education, to which many of the same considerations apply. I have talked about the differences between educating children and educating older people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Does the Bill's definition of schools include sixth-form colleges, where pupils go after leaving secondary or grammar schools to spend their final two years doing A-levels?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My belief is that sixth-form colleges would be included. They fall within the definition of education for children who go to school. I will confirm that, but that is my view.
<P>
A student in higher education attending lectures for only a few hours is obviously in a very different situation from a child who is at school from 9 am to 3.30 pm. Again, and for the same reason, I ask that that amendment is not pressed to a Division.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let me deal with two or three other issues that have been raised. Amendment No. 16 would add prisons to the list of properties protected against disconnection. Again, the drafting of the amendment is technically defective. Although the Prisons Act 1952 is the correct piece of legislation. We would need to consider not only the definition of prisons but how to treat the full range of institutions referred to in section 47 of that Act, including remand centres and secure centres, for example.
<P>
I turn to the substance of the amendment, because it raises a serious point. It is true that, under clause 1 as drafted, prisons are not protected against disconnection for non-payment of bills. It is difficult to justify that. It is almost inconceivable that the Home Office, the prison governor and the authorities who run prisons would refuse to pay their bill&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions are to be deplored. Also, the level of conversation on the Front Bench has increased a bit, and I am finding it difficult to hear the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was saying, Mr. McWilliam, that there is a case for reconsidering the matter. Prisoners are for the time being living in prisons&#151;they are there, we hope, for 24 hours a day. It could be argued that prisons should be protected against disconnection on the same basis and for much the same reasons as schools and hospitals. I take that on board; we will consider the matter and, if need be, table a Government amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 concerns day-care centres. I have already spoken about the importance of protecting children and their education. The key point is that children are required to attend school. Although day-care centres unquestionably provide a valuable service for many parents, there is not the same obligation to attend that makes protection against any possibility of disconnection essential for schools. By protecting schools from disconnection, we are ensuring that premises that we require children to attend for a considerable part of the day do not expose them to unacceptable risks to their health or provide unacceptable levels of hygiene. That is the basic principle, with which I am sure that everyone agrees. I am not sure that that test is met by day-care centres, which include any premises providing day care for children under the age of eight for more than two hours in any day. That might also include holiday provisions. For those reasons, I do not think that it is appropriate to extend the provision to day-care centres.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I am a little surprised by what the Minister has said. He made it clear that he was concerned about children who were in premises from 9 am until 5 pm, and who needed to be able to wash their hands. Of course, that applies equally to day-care centres and to nurseries. He should take into account the difficulties that parents would encounter&#151;perhaps I am closer to this experience than him&#151;if they were told at short notice, ``Your child cannot go to this day-care centre because the water has been cut off.'' Nurseries and day-care centres have waiting lists of two or three months.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. My child is lecturing at Reading university, so I do not think that she will be affected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. In the case of a day-care centre that provided care for a substantial part of the day&#151;approximating to that provided by schools&#151;there is an argument for reconsidering the matter. That is not the general case: care is usually limited and provided for restricted periods. I am anxious that we do not include too many extensions that are difficult to defend and unfair to water companies. As the hon. Gentleman presses me again, I am prepared to consider the matter, but I do not want him to think that I am likely to come forward with a different view.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 covers business premises that are occupied by doctors. It suggests that all business premises&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Donald Gorrie (Edinburgh, West):</B> The Minister has founded part of his argument on a rock of compulsion&#151;that if a child has to go to school they therefore need protection, whereas further and higher education and day centres are voluntary. There are two flaws in his argument. First, children who go to sixth-form colleges do not have to go; they go voluntarily, and having stopped being obliged to attend school at age 16. The Minister's element of compulsion falls down in that case. Secondly&#151;I speak tentatively, as I do not fully understand the English system&#151;in Scotland there can be legal compulsions on people, as part of a general arrangement, to send their children to day centres. By founding his argument on the rock of compulsion versus non-compulsion, the Minister has made a poor and unsustainable case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My argument was not based exclusively on the question of requirement or compulsion, although that is a factor where society requires a particular group to be in a certain situation for an extended period. Such people, whether they are children or elderly or ill, are vulnerable, and it is absolutely right that they should be protected against disconnection.
<P>
In the case of day-care centres, I accept that in some cases there may be an overlap, both in the amount of time that is spent in them and in the vulnerability of the group concerned. The question is whether that is sufficient to justify including at the other end of the spectrum day-care centres that children may be in for only two hours a day. I think that that is doubtful, but I shall consider the issue again in light of what the hon. Gentleman has said. I wish to be fair in support of the general principle that I have enunciated.
<P>
I cannot help feeling, as more and more avid discussion of what should be in or out of the list takes place, that there is a certain surrealism or aritificiality about the entire debate. We are discussing something that I suspect has hardly ever happened and is probably very unlikely to happen. Nevertheless, I am required by the situation in which I find myself to be as clear as possible. I hope that the hon. Members, in pushing for what is being called a concession, understand the debate in context.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am slightly surprised by that last remark. The Minister has encouraged us to seek the protection of vulnerable people by producing a Bill that stipulates that hospitals and schools are to be included&#151;or excluded, depending on which way one looks at it. By doing so the Government are, in effect, inviting Opposition Members to consider other areas within those definitions in which there are frail and vulnerable groups of individuals who might, on the Government's own logic, need protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I understand that. The hon. Gentleman has made the point that I should expect the leader of the Opposition in Committee to make, and that is why he is smiling broadly all over his face. He is perfectly entitled to make the point, and I am perfectly willing to try to answer it. However let us be clear in our minds that we are talking about a situation that has probably never arisen and may well never arise&#151;I hope that it never arises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I also hope that that was the last intervention on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> When the Minister is reconsidering the question of day-care centres, as he indicated that he is prepared to do, will he look closely at the question of nurseries that are based in school premises, unless they are broadly covered under the schools heading?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am sure that they will be included, because they take place on school premises and provide a form of education within that school. I am now eager, as I am sure are many hon. Members, to reach the end.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 concern business premises occupied by doctors and dentists. Those would include general practitioners' surgeries, but possibly also any other premises used by a doctor&#151;whether private or NHS&#151;for the purpose of carrying on his business. Such premises are not the same as hospitals&#151;they are used predominantly for the carrying on of a doctor's business, not for the residential care of vulnerable people. Again, I would obviously be most concerned if a doctor's premise were disconnected&#151;but that seems exceedingly unlikely ever to happen.
<P>
The same applies to dentists. Their premises are clearly for the purpose of carrying on a business, and should be treated as such. Again, I will reflect further on all the arguments advanced in this debate. We want to ensure that protection is given where there is a real prospect of a substantial adverse effect on public health. I can certainly assure the Committee that&#151;against the background of our approach to the matter&#151;we will consider tabling amendments on Report. We want to ensure that protection against disconnection is afforded in cases in which vulnerable groups could face severe hardship&#151;such as a severe risk to health&#151;by being deprived of a water supply. On that basis, I hope that the Committee is satisfied that the Government will seriously and sympathetically consider the arguments that have been made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said, as have my hon. Friends. We understand that he has recognised the compelling logic of several of our amendments. It was the Government who opened this Pandora's box by including hospitals and educational premises.
<P>
Whatever our view of the Bill's overall philosophy, if the Government are giving special protection to certain areas, even if they have never had their water disconnected in living memory, there are other areas, such as nursing homes and residential homes&#151;the list that the Minister went through&#151;where people also require protection under the Bill. That is why we tabled the amendments. We appreciate that the Government have considered the principles behind them, even if they suffer from what all Opposition parties' amendments suffer from&#151;technical defects&#151;and in some instances will probably return on Report with amendments to meet the aims of our amendments.
<P>
Against that background, it would be churlish for us to press the amendments to Divisions. We are getting what we want, so we may as well quit while we are ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I wish briefly to thank the Minister for his comments and the undertakings that he has given to consider some of the amendments in greater detail. I urge him closely to consider the position of general practitioners' surgeries&#151;as I believe he said that he would&#151;residential care homes, day-care centres and nurseries and, finally, prisons. We can imagine the risk to public safety of disconnecting a prison's water supply.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Member for West Chelmsford seeking leave to withdraw amendment No. 6?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Indeed, Mr. McWilliam. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I had not intended to speak in the clause stand part debate, but I listened to the early part of the discussion with increasing astonishment, and I want to register some general points of significance about the method of legislating as revealed by clause 1.
<P>
The Minister came close to admitting to the Committee that he had no clear idea what the effect of clause 1 will be. He was able to tell us roughly in which parts of the country some things that might be affected lie. That is of no great relevance, because he cannot tell us whether any of the things in those parts of the country would qualify, and that is because he does not know in which category those things would appear to fall. That is to say, he cannot tell us which of the 640 disconnections in the past year were of prime residences, for example.
<P>
That reflects poorly on the nature of the Bill, and in particular of clause 1. I would not expect Liberal Democrat Members below the Gangway to make this point, as they perhaps share the Government's mania for legislation. However, it is indicative of a mania for legislation to produce a clause that specifically prohibits the disconnection of people, or, rather, entities that may already not be being disconnected, for all the Minister knows. It would be extraordinary if on inspection it turned out that all the premises that were disconnected last year according to the Minister's figures, distributed around the country in the patterns that he observes, would also be allowed to be disconnected following the passage of the Bill. If that were so, the House of Commons would have spent time on Second Reading, the Committee would have spent time in Committee, and industry would have spent considerable time and effort, all to the effect of achieving nothing in the past year&#151;treating the past year as an example of what might be the case next year.
<P>
Beyond that, if the Minister were serious in promoting the Bill over the past 18 months, I would have expected him to have investigated in some detail not only the static condition of such things, but the dynamic. I would have expected him to be able to tell us what he expected would be the pattern over the next few years, without the Bill&#151;whether an increasing or decreasing number of premises would have fallen within the Bill's scope. It would have been a mark of a serious Administration, intent on legislating only where such legisaltion is necessary, had the Minister asked his officials to conduct such an investigation. We all know that his Department has officials of the highest calibre who could have conducted that investigation, which would have concluded whether clause 1 was necessary. Alas, the Minister has not the slightest idea whether clause 1 is necessary; he just thinks that it is a nice idea to introduce it in the hope that everyone will clap and cheer because the Government have prevented disconnection.
<P>
We must consider the other side of the register. We must ask ourselves whether any disadvantages may arise from disconnection. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford rightly argued that there is considerable reason for supposing that most people will be at least as much influenced by threats of the bailiffs and other legal proceedings as they would be by the threat of disconnection. I suppose that the Minister might therefore argue that removing the threat of disconnection will not have a great effect. However, I was surprised that he did not present any evidence&#151;perhaps he will do so in response to my remarks&#151;to suggest that the effect of removing the threat of disconnection will be slight. Certainly, if he is proposing acceptance of the Bill without having a clear idea whether it will affect anything positively, because he does not know whom it will affect positively, he should at least be clear that it will not affect anything negatively. Presumably the Minister has studied, and will be able to tell the Committee, what the number of people not paying their water bills&#151;by hypothesis, therefore, won't-pays rather that can't-pays, or people who are currently paying but who in future will not&#151;is likely to be over the next few years as a result of the Bill.
<P>
I am making a point about the character of the Bill and about the character of the Government in introducing it. A serious Administration proposing clause 1 would have examined what it would capture and whether, given the number of premises that it would capture, it could be justified, based on a fair and in-depth assessment of any disadvantages that might arise from it. So far there has been no indication, either on Second Reading or in Committee, that such an analysis has been undertaken, which makes me excessively despondent about the way in which the Bill has been prepared. I hope that the Minister will relieve some of my despondency by showing that the Government have at last provided the requisite analysis.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): I begin by echoing the comments already made on both sides of the Committee in saying how pleased I am to serve under your excellent chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
Clause 1 is a strong social measure about which we have heard much of interest today. It will protect and safeguard vulnerable groups, as indeed it should. Everyone has a right to water, and I hope that we all support removal of the power to disconnect.
<P>
I should like to move on to other key concerns. What if the environment decides to disconnect us all? What of the vagaries of climate change and our nation's relentless increase in demand for water?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That does not arise from clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> With reference to clause 1, I should like to make some environmental points and raise the issue of possible disconnection as a result of the vagaries of climate change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Lady would resume her seat, clause 1 refers to premises excluded from disconnection. It is quite a narrow clause and does not include any consideration of environmental matters.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for those helpful points.
<P>
We must ensure that clause 1 provides value and good sense for the customer as well as meeting social objectives. Everyone has a right to water and everyone has the responsibility to pay for it. Nobody wants to disconnect customers who cannot pay. It is right that the clause deprives companies of that option. However, we must also ensure that those who can pay do pay, so that we do not pass on the debt to the vast majority of paying customers. As our debate progresses, we can consider the best way to ensure that clause 1 achieves its objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I shall be brief. The Liberal Democrats support the principle of the clause and the ban on disconnections. We would support it even more enthusiastically if, as promised by the Minister, it re-emerges shortly, along with the anticipated bells and whistles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe (Birmingham, Hall Green):</B> I welcome the clause. The Minister referred earlier to its surreal quality, and I understand why. On Second Reading, and again in Committee this morning, we have heard Opposition Members say that there is no value whatever in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman reminds me that I forgot to mention that I wholly subscribed to the Minister's point&#151;he mentioned it twice&#151;about the artificiality and surreal quality of the debate. However, what is surreal is the fact that the Government are supporting the clause without any idea of its positive or negative effects.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I am glad that I have given the hon. Gentleman a chance to make such a vital point&#151;[Laughter.]
<P>
Opposition Members argued that there was no need for the clause on the ground that disconnections had already decreased substantially. However, there is a pressing need for the clause. the reason why disconnections decreased is that, in the period of public concern about disconnections, water companies sought to introduce disguised disconnections. Had that practice not been outlawed by the courts in February 1998, the water companies would of course have continued to do so.
<P>
In the Birmingham area, formal notification of only six disconnections was made over a nine-month period in 1998. However, that figure disguises 1,773 disconnections that the water companies and the regulator euphemistically described as ``self-disconnections''. That is clearly an attempt to continue disconnecting people who could not afford to pay, depriving them of water. Sixty-six per cent. of households disconnected for more than seven hours had children, and 24 per cent. had someone with a serious disability or illness. Such people were disregarded when disconnections were imposed. Those disconnections were not included in the official figures because they were not subject to formal court proceedings. The judge who ruled on budget payment units said that water companies had deliberately circumvented the statutory code.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the statutory right preventing water disconnection should be extended to gas and electricity?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) does not answer that question. Gas and electricity are not covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
The water companies attempted to deprive people of water and disguise their actions. So clause 1 is not unnecessary. Had the water authorities had their way, they would have continued to disconnect people, hiding the true figures from the public and Parliament. Clause 1 provides essential protection, so I welcome it.
<P>
I welcome the clarification that my right hon. Friend the Minister has provided on sheltered accommodation, children's homes and other premises. Unintentionally excluding such premises from the Bill's provisions would be an error.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman as he described the error that he felt would have been made, had the Minister not generously agreed to reconsider the matter. Obviously, the hon. Gentleman feels strongly about disconnection. Why, therefore, did he not table amendments himself?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I am glad to have been asked that. My answer is straightforward: I was confident that my right hon. Friend the Minister would give me the assurances that I sought in the course of our debate. I am glad that he has now done so.
<P>
It has been interesting to hear Committee members who do not regard disconnection as a problem listing premises, such as private boarding schools, that must be protected. They argue that such schools must be included because the children in them are obviously at great risk. People running private establishments at considerable profit must also be protected.
<P>
The debate has clarified what separates Conservative Members from Labour Members. The Government's view, which, I believe, is shared by Liberal Democrat Members, is that public health must be protected and that it is a disgrace deliberately to deprive people of water. Conservative Members are not worried about such matters, but they are happy to take the opportunity to force into the protected categories groups of people who might otherwise lose some of their vast profits.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I share the sense of surrealism&#151;if that is the right word&#151;that Government and Opposition Members have expressed in relation to our debate. That feeling has arisen because no one has persuaded anyone&#151;in this Room or anywhere else&#151;of the need for clause 1. Labour Members have said that saving vulnerable people is terribly important. Perhaps that can be attributed more to the Labour party's desire to be seen to be politically correct than to the desire to help vulnerable people. However, we are told that because of the voluntary code of conduct that the Conservatives introduced, only 640 houses were cut off last year. When we ask for evidence as to who lived in those 640 houses, we are not told that they were vulnerable people. We are not given heartrending evidence of how awful all this was for them. The Minister told us on Second Reading and again today that he does not know who lived in those 640 houses.
<P>
We suggested in supposition that perhaps they are secondary houses&#151;they might be owned by millionaires who do not want to pay the water bills on their second, third or fourth houses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman agree that it is extremely unlikely that the 50 per cent. of homes where water is reconnected within two days are holiday homes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I would not care to imagine the circumstances of those homes because the Government have now admitted on two separate occasions, separated by a week, that they do not know who the owners are.
<P>
Opposition Members are merely saying, ``If this is such an overwhelmingly important matter that it must be dealt with via primary legislation, will you please tell us who live in the 640 homes that are being saved by this proposed legislation?'' Are they, as I suspect, primarily second homes? Even if half of them are second homes, why are we protecting people who can perfectly well pay but have chosen not to?
<P>
The truth is that of the 20 million houses in this country, 640 were cut off last year and there is no compelling evidence that any of their owners or occupants are vulnerable. I challenge the Minister to tell us of any one of those 640 cases which was demonstrably deserving and vulnerable; if he can do so, perhaps the Opposition will be convinced of the need for the Bill.
<P>
The same argument applies to the exemptions from clause 1. Opposition Members have tabled amendments not so much because we necessarily believe that the various categories that we have described cover people who would be cut off; rather, we are attempting to highlight the fact that the exemption itself is unnecessary.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister was only too ready to admit that so far as he was aware, no school and no hospital had ever been cut off. In this morning's debate, he went to great lengths to assure us that he is still not aware of any circumstances in which residential care homes, primary schools, hospitals, Eton, Harrow&#151;Opposition Members are, of course, greatly concerned about Eton and Harrow, and I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that the Bill will protect them&#151;have been cut off. We do not know of any circumstance in which hospitals and schools would be cut off.
<P>
If the Minister can imagine any such circumstances, perhaps he will enlighten us and tell us why he has chosen to single them out in the Bill.
<P>
Might it be that local authorities or the Government themselves do not pay their bills? Perhaps the Department of Social Security, which is under his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, is so inefficient that it will not pay its bills. Has the Minister drafted the exemption because he has no confidence in his right hon. Friend? If that is the case, perhaps he would like to cast his mind to army barracks, because the Ministry of Defence is a pretty inefficient bunch, too. What about Government offices? What about this great Palace, because that is not exempt&#151;do we know that it will pay its bills, and if not, why has the Minister not exempted it? Goodness me, are we certain that those who run the right hon. Gentleman's own office will pay their water bills? Why are they not exempt?
<P>
The thrust of our amendments has been to try to demonstrate the absurdity and the political correctness of exempting only schools and hospitals but none of the other worthwhile organisations which are equally unlikely to fail to pay their bills. Clause 1 was included in the Bill not for its own value&#151;I think that the debate has established that it has no particular value&#151;but to go alongside later clauses relating to the extension of the use of rateable values in particular, which is the only real reason for bringing the Bill forward.
<P>
I would argue that the Government have given no thought to clause 1. They cannot explain why we need it and even if they could, they cannot explain why we are exempting these two categories. If the Bill is to hold its own on Report, on Third Reading and in the other place, the Government should come up with some really sound and convincing reasons why we should abolish disconnections. If we do, they should explain why we should exempt only these two categories of establishment, which have so far been entirely unaffected by disconnection.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> All Opposition Members welcome the Minister's comments on the amendments. The debate has clearly shown that they welcome the Minister's comments on the amendments. The debate has clearly shown that the Bill and the clause have not been logically thought through. On Second Reading, the Minister made it clear that he thought that the Bill would help millions of people. It is, however, not clear that that is the case. The Minister has not said how clause 1 will help millions of people.
<P>
It is rather startling and, as my hon. Friends have eloquently said, profoundly worrying that, although the Minister might know the geographical location of the 640 disconnections, he has no idea of their profile. They might all involve vulnerable people. The crucial point is that the Minister does not know.
<P>
We are debating a clause in a major Bill. As the Prime Minister said in the debate on the Loyal Address, other Bills cannot proceed through Committee because of Bills such as the one before us. We are spending time debating a Bill that many of us regard as not even necessary.
<P>
The industry's record of cutting disconnections in the past few years has been good. The Minister referred to a trend, but it is not a trend; we are talking about dramatic reductions in disconnections. The figures from when the industry was in public ownership pale by comparison. In the last year of public ownership, there were 10,000 disconnections; there were 640 in the first half of this year.
<P>
We should properly recognise the steps that the industry has taken to help people who have fallen into debt&#151;sometimes through no fault of their own&#151;and who have been unable to pay. It is interesting that this year's report by the director general of Ofwat acknowledges that seven water companies carried out no disconnections whatever. When we debate clause stand part, we should recognise that the industry has managed to achieve much without legislation; indeed, it has gone much further than the Minister's legislation can.
<P>
Labour Members have made light of the protection that should be given to children in private boarding schools. I find that somewhat repugnant. I am a director of Childline. We at Childline do not distinguish between a child in local authority care and one at a private school. The difference does not matter; a child is a child. A child is put somewhere by its parents. It is a mistake for hon. Members to make light of children's circumstances. They are the most vulnerable people in our society.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I am delighted that Childline, which serves a specific purpose, does not attempt to discriminate against children who are in need or in trouble. We are, however, talking about ``can't pay'' and ``won't pay''. That is where private boarding schools come in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Wherever the child is, he might be the victim of circumstances over which he has no control. He is entitled to the same protection as others under the law.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's assurances that he will reconsider the matter in light of the amendments. It is, however, difficult to understand why he cannot categorically say that he will be absolutely certain by the time that the Bill has passed through the Committee that it is not possible for children to be penalised. If the principle of the clause is that there should be no disconnections for vulnerable people, it must mean all children. The same can be seen to apply to the elderly in residential care and elsewhere.
<P>
The Bill lacks logic. We are talking about the principle of the right to water as a crucial utility. One should, therefore, ask the Minister whether he believes that the same principle should apply to gas and electricity. The principle applies as much to gas and electricity as it does to water.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have ruled on that matter. The clause does not deal with gas or electricity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. McWilliam. I was trying to tease out of the Government the level of their commitment in principle to the right to essential services. If they are genuine in their support for that principle, the gas and electricity industries have a great deal to fear from forthcoming Bills.
<P>
The Bill could help the water industry. The clause has, however, been rather poorly assembled. I hope that it can be improved, in light of the Minister's commitment to take on board the suggestions made in the amendments. The Minister and other Labour Members have done nothing to shed light on the reason for the clause, or on the identity of the millions that it will help.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> At last we have it&#151;the Opposition are beginning to show their real face. I have seldom listened to such artificial and strained rhetoric. They have made artificial points about an obvious requirement.
<P>
Two main arguments were advanced. First, a number of Opposition Members are obviously still secretly wedded to the principle of disconnection. That view is somewhat subdued, because the numbers involved are down to 640 in the first half of the present fiscal year. Since water privatisation, which occurred when the Opposition were in government, tens of thousands of people have been disconnected. The numbers grew very rapidly immediately after privatisation. As was pointed out on Second Reading, a major increase in dysentery in the west midlands happened to coincide with the huge increase in disconnections. The Government believe strongly that disconnection of water is wrong, and that all people have a right to water. That is still not accepted on the Opposition Back Benches.
<P>
Secondly, the Opposition Front Bench made a rather more sophisticated argument. Instead of making a frontal attack on the principle of prohibiting disconnection, they took a cleverer line, which was, however, more artificial and meaningless. They pointed out that the Government do not have figures for the number of secondary homes that are disconnected. We do not, and I do not believe that whether those homes are secondary homes matters in the slightest. We are enunciating the principle that water should not be cut off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> No. I shall have my say, and the hon. Gentleman may speak in a moment.
<P>
The suggestion that the great majority of such homes are secondary is utterly preposterous. That is implied by the geographical spread across the country. Many areas within the Thames Water area do not contain holiday homes&#151;[Interruption.] I shall not give way for the moment. The suggestion that the 166 homes disconnected in the Thames Water area were all holiday homes is ridiculous. That is not the point&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not in order to heckle the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> A curious Opposition Front Bench argument was that the Government should somehow use the extremely competent and extensive facilities available in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to examine the likely spread of future disconnections, as I think the hon. Member for North Wiltshire suggested. That is absurd. The hon. Gentleman is asking for information that he knows is systematically unobtainable, because he is struggling to make a point. Having accepted the prohibition of disconnections, he is now artificially seeking to demand information that is obviously unavailable and which is, frankly, unneccessary. It is also nonsense to suggest that all the households that would be disconnected without the clause are within the list of excluded premises. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has made such a ridiculous suggestion.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also said that it would be necessary to make a distinction between those who are disconnected who are in vulnerable groups and those who are not. Again, it is obviously not necessary for us to do that. We are simply saying that no vulnerable groups should be left without water. However, people who can pay&#151;whatever their number&#151;should certainly be made to pay. I made that very clear on Second Reading. I strongly support the water companies using the available legal mechanisms to ensure that bills are met. Indeed, I call in aid the argument of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford that to be distrained of certain goods is probably just as much a penalty as being deprived of water. I am not sure that I agree, but it is certainly a significant penalty which I believe will be effective.
<P>

</P>
<P>
It has been argued that water companies do not disconnect those who cannot pay, only those who will not. I am not convinced by that argument. In the first six months of this financial year, more than half of the disconnections continued for more than 48 hours, and a third for more than 28 days. A third of 640, if my maths is right, means that about 210-220 households were deprived of water for more than four weeks. Is there any justification for that? I do not believe that those people had the money to pay their bills, but simply decided to live without water for days&#151;or indeed weeks&#151;on end. I suspect that a dependant of anyone who wilfully did not pay their bill would find it pretty small comfort, when going without a wash, or not being able to flush the toilet, to be told that companies disconnect only ``won't pays'', not ``can't pays''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Without wearying the Minister on this point, his only justification, apparently, for arguing against the notion that most of these houses are second homes&#151;they sound like holiday homes to me, especially given the fact that one third of them has been disconnected for 28 days&#151;is to say that Thames Water, for example, does not supply water to holiday areas. Thames Water supplies water to large parts of the Cotswolds including, I suspect, the right hon. Gentleman's own very nice country house near, or just outside, Cirencester. Thames Water supplies very many holiday homes in my constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was not for a moment suggesting that there were no holiday homes within the Thames Water area. I am suggesting that it is ridiculous to suppose that a majoirity of the households, let alone all 166, were holiday homes. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire betrays his own prejudice in suggesting that the one third of households&#151;more than 200&#151;which were disconnected for more than 28 days sound, to him, like holiday homes. I think that he is not prepared to understand that there are many ordinary families who cannot pay and are forced to go without water for long periods. That is exactly the argument that we feel so strongly and passionately about. It is unacceptable simply to sweep these households away on the ground that they are probably holiday homes and the Government do not have the figures to prove otherwise. [Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions are not acceptable. Hon. Members must not heckle the Minister and, while I am on my feet, I remind the Committee that neither must anyone heckle anyone else who happens to be on his feet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I wish to conclude my remarks by saying that water is not merely an item to be bought and sold. It is, with food, the only absolute essential of life. I shall not go beyond your ruling, Mr. McWilliam, by making the comparison with electricity or gas, except to make the point that water is unique. It is an essential ingredient of life. I do not believe&#151;and this is simply the principle on which we base the Bill and the clause&#151;that in a modern and civilised society it can be right for people, whatever the proportions or numbers, to be deprived of water because they cannot afford to pay their bill. Those who cannot afford to pay are likely to be among the most vulnerable members of society, and the Government are concerned to protect them. That is what underlines the clause, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for calling me again. The Minister's statement was made with his usual charm and intellect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> Panache.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Indeed, panache, as the hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position. However, it did nothing more than confirm my theory. To take a particular example before I generalise, the Minister mentioned that some people had their water cut off for more than 28 days. I do not doubt it&#151;I have such a constituent myself. She is in the unfortunate position of having inherited a house from deceased relatives outside my constituency, and she finds it difficult to travel to it. As a result, she has not been paying her utility bills, and the water in that house has been disconnected. It is a subject of some concern to me and to her. She is, as a matter of fact, a vulnerable person, but it is not her prime residence, nor is it a holiday home. It is in another category&#151;I do not know how to describe that category, but it would not be caught by the clause.
<P>
As his speech revealed, it seems that the Minister genuinely does not have the slightest idea who the people who are being disconnected are. He describes as ludicrous the idea that he should be required to make some projection as to who will be disconnected. I do not find that ludicrous. It would be reasonable for a Minister of the Crown, in charge of this important part of our national life, to hold discussions with the water companies before bringing forward a clause of this kind, to find out how they see the future and how likely it is that such a clause will be necessary. He thinks that that is a ludicrous idea, so he has not done it.
<P>
The Minister bases his argument on a fine flourish&#151;the principle that water must not be cut off. That would be more than a fine flourish if it had meaning. Unfortunately, in regard to the rest of the clause and the amendments, the Minister proposed exceptions in the original drafting of the Bill and has accepted some amendments proposed by my hon. Friends and by Liberal Democrat Members. Therefore he has accepted great breaches of the principle. He has accepted that quite frequently people should have their water cut off or, rather, that certain types of premises or entities should have their water cut off. It falls to the right hon. Gentleman to explain whether anyone will actually be caught. He has not done so because he does not have the figures.
<P>
Secondly, and critically, I draw to the Committee's attention the fact that the Minister never once even addressed the question of the downside of the clause. Apparently, despite the fact that there used to be a requirement for a regulatory and financial appraisal of Bills&#151;a compliance cost assessment&#151;no one in the Minister's Department has been asked to investigate how far that will adversely affect the water companies. Given that the Minister has virtually admitted to the Committee that he does not know what the positive and negative effects will be, I am astonished that he has produced this flurry of evidence. He should merely have admitted that there is a problem, and that the Government are proposing legislation in a way in which they should not be. He should consider seriously whether his arguments hold.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall respond briefly to the hon. Gentleman's very fair comments. I made it very clear that the issue is not numbers but principle, and I make no apology for that. If there is only one disconnection&#151;and the number is certainly much greater than that&#151;the principle applies. It is not incumbent on the Government to say precisely how many would otherwise be disconnected but will not be if the Bill is passed. The figures have fallen quite dramatically recently&#151;there were 1,907 disconnections in 1997-98, which is substantial&#151;and it is still possible that they will not continue to fall. The numbers are still quite considerable. We are simply saying that, whatever the numbers, people should be protected from disconnection.
<P>
We have of course discussed the matter with the water companies. Their concern was not, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, that we had not told them how many people would be affected by the provisions and that they needed to know. Their concern was the effect on so-called bad debts. Immediately after we announced the main principles of the Bill, some of the tabloids were only too delighted to put out the message that consumers need not pay any more. That is, of course, absolute rubbish. I am determined that people who can pay should pay and will pay, and I believe that the panoply of measures that are available to water companies is sufficient to achieve that purpose.
<P>
I doubt, for two reasons, that there will be an increase in bad debts. First, if that were true, I would be surprised that nine companies have decided of their own accord to dispense with, or not use, disconnection. As far as I know, that has not had any serious or significant effects on their revenue. Some of those nine are major companies, and I would therefore be surprised if it were to be a serious problem for anyone else.
<P>
Secondly, it is in water companies' interests to establish early on that those people who do not pay their water bills will be pursued vigorously. I want them to do that, and I repeat that other possible methods of obtaining payment do not, as the hon. Member for West Chelmsford said, represent an easy option for customers. The proposals will not add significantly to bad debt it companies make clear their intention to enforce debts. That is the basis on which our discussions have taken place. I would not pretend that some of the water companies that still practise disconnection are delighted with the clause, but on balance they understand the reasoning behind it and I believe that they can live with it perfectly satisfactorily.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. This may be a helpful moment to move that the Committee gives further consideration to the Bill in the new year and that the sitting should now be adjourned.
<P>
I wish you, Mr. McWilliam, the staff members present and all members of the Committee a very merry Christmas.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.&#151;[Mr. Allen.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish you all a safe journey home and a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at eighteen minutes to One o'clock till Tuesday 12 January 1999 at half-past Ten o'clock.
