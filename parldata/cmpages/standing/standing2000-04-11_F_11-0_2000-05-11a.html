<P>
(2) The Secretary of State may by order make such provision as he thinks appropriate in relation to the appointment as trustees and impose conditions on persons to administer such trust property; and such trustees shall cause proper accounts to be kept of the capital, accretions, income and expenditure vested in, received by and expended by them; and shall cause such accounts to be audited and an abstract thereof to be published in such manner as the Secretary of State may from time to time approve.'.<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
It is nice to have you back in the chair, Mr. Hancock. We have been well looked after in this Committee and I do not intend to trespass on your generosity unreasonably today. However, there are important issues to raise: two in relation to new clauses on provisions for England and a number in relation to those for Wales.
<P>
New clause 3 appears to be technical. For reasons that I shall go into later, it is couched in legally terse language and might, at first sight, seem dry and boring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): Never.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for that encouragement from the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). The new clause involves a substantial issue on which I and, I am sure, my colleagues feel strongly.
<P>
During exchanges in our last sitting, remarks by the Minister, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) clarified two points. The first was that the Learning and Skills Council will have the power to receive and make use of any assets or money it can get its hands on. By that I mean, it will receive its substantial, base-load funding from the Government, but that will not prevent it from taking money from elsewhere. If, for example, someone wished to leave money to the council, or there was an educational trust that no longer wished to fulfil its functions independently because of overhead costs or administrative difficulties, that money could, I think, be reversed into the remit of the LSC. Those assurances primarily arose in the discussion we had on new clause 1--or was it new clause 2--about partnership working, so that is not a problem. We want the council to be able to use any money that is sensibly to hand.
<P>
The second point that became clear from the Committee's deliberations, which were wider than that on the new clause, was that the LSC and its constituent or local learning and skills councils will operate as a single entity, a unitary body. On reflection, this morning I realised that I had not asked the Minister, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) whether it is intended that the LSC will produce what in the private sector would be called consolidated accounts, including the activities and assets of all the local learning and skills councils for the time being on a yearly basis. That would be a large task, although it is not beyond the powers of most commercial companies. It would make for good order and a business-like approach if we knew at least what the total assets were, and it would be important for the council to have that information. I see that the Minister is acknowledging the point that I am making.
<P>
The new clause explores whether property that may come from outside public sources to the council is held centrally or locally. That is a substantial point. The Minister is engaged indirectly in the Bill--and we are not challenging Government policy in this clause at least--in winding up the training and enterprise councils. As the Committee knows, those are private sector entrepreneurial bodies, albeit primarily publicly funded. They have a good deal of flexibility and, to some extent, display considerable variation in delivering their missions locally. Along the way, they may or may not have acquired property, and a body might do so in future.
<P>
I have sought to draw out this point from the Minister in a number of written parliamentary questions and we are beginning to get a clearer picture. We all understand that grants have been directed from public funds and it is perfectly proper for the Government to seek to recover those assets for the Learning and Skills Council, although there will be opportunities to discuss that when later we look at the more administrative clauses of the Bill. Then there is a grey area about assets that have arisen from any TEC surpluses derived from effective trading out of money primarily derived from public funds. That may not be the only explanation for such surpluses, but we will assume for this purpose that it is. There is also the question of entirely private acquisitions, which will be their money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I think I see where the hon. Gentleman is going, but he needs to tell us, in the context of companies by guarantee--as the TECs generally are--how he knows what the distribution of surplus assets will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For this purpose I can certainly call the hon. Gentleman my hon. Friend because he is assisting me. That is precisely the conundrum with which Ministers are faced. One assumes, for the purpose of debate, that the process will be broadly agreed and that there is not--although there might be, given the circumstances--a turf war or argument going on about it. The hon. Gentleman has, through his intervention, helped me to put to the Committee that whatever the present position, there is the potential that money could have been derived from a number of sources. One of those is, of course, directly private accretions.
<P>
There is, therefore, a need to start to apportion this, unless one takes the view that the money should simply be collared by the centre for the Learning and Skills Council. If that is the view of Ministers it should be explained. Given that some of the money came from private sector sources or may have arisen as a result of surpluses that are at least arguably derived from private sector funds, the matter is worth consideration, particularly in connection with the 16 TECs that have merged with their local chambers of commerce. I can see the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) nodding. My own Northamptonshire TEC chamber of commerce is in precisely that position, although I have not been heavily briefed by it. The matter is of more general application.
<P>
Where there are such chambers of commerce mergers--and I find that an attractive model that has worked well locally--the private sector partners have an interest in the disposition of funds. As the hon. Gentleman anticipated, since these are not profit-making companies, there is a question about how the surplus could be run off and so on. I am not seeking to argue that the money should be returned to the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> May I probe a little further? It seems to me that an examination of the source and application of funds within any of the companies limited by guarantee would show that any unapplied government cash would then return automatically to government. I can see no other way to proceed with that part of any surplus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not want to lengthen the debate because another related issue follows shortly. The hon. Gentleman is enunciating a principle that seems to be entirely acceptable. If it is possible to say that a certain asset was derived from public funds or a cash balance results from having been given public funds, the principle of returning that and redistributing it on whatever basis Ministers are accountable for doing, is entirely fair. It is not always easy to unpick this, but unless Ministers say that they are going to nationalise the assets of the TEC movement collectively, whatever those are, there has to be some element of appraisal and apportion. That is all that I am saying. I shall go on to develop the argument in relation to the new clause which is geared not only to the existing assets of TECs but to potential future activities of local learning and skills councils and any private sector accretions that may come to them in the way that I have briefly mentioned.
<P>
The other point that I wish to make on apportionment is that, as a Minister coming into the further education portfolio shortly before incorporation of the sector and having had, as it were, to manage that process, I had a good deal of experience about some complicated property issues relating to apportionment--in that case between further education colleges and, typically, local education authorities. There could be, and sometimes there were, animosities stirred up about the ownership of a car park or the primary assets and so forth. We sought to deal with those various disputes on what I believed to be a fair basis and they were eventually resolved. What I am seeking to point out in relation to the clause is that unless Ministers decide to collectivise all the assets of the TEC movement, wherever derived--and there are certain problems in equity and fairness in doing that--there will have to be an apportionment process to sort it out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I am listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman. What does the hon. Gentleman believe would happen if, for example, a few years down the line when, as we all hope, local learning and skills councils and, indeed, the national Learning and Skills Council will have gained a high profile, someone makes a significant bequest to a local learning and skills council in his locality or attempts to do so by some form of will procedure? Will the current form of legislation be able to cope with that and, if not, how would the new clause address it?

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) for that intervention. He is mirroring the kinds of considerations that are in my mind in tabling the new clause. I shall explain the new clause in a moment. First, to close the points on where we are so far, nobody is seeking to argue that it is impossible to sort out the assets. It would be a major task to do so, and I believe that the Committee, in a general spirit of goodwill, would wish it to be done on a principled and fair basis.
<P>
As to what the residual assets of the TEC movement are at this stage, nobody readily knows. The inference from the written answers that I have received--which is not necessarily the same as the word on the street--is that the overall residual assets of the movement, if expressed in terms of their accounting services, are quite small. They may actually be much bigger, but that will need to be looked at. The new clause is predicated on there being either assets from TEC private sector residuals, if I may put it that way, or the possibility, as the hon. Member for Blackpool, South has presciently intervened to suggest, of future acquisitions to the LSC from bequests, benefactors or otherwise.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although I am no lawyer, I have some experience of charity law because I used to be chairman of the all-party group that responded to the Government's submissions on charity law reform in the early 1990s. Clearly, any money that is charitable is for a public purpose. It is not government money, but it is for the public good, according to rules that were set out in statutes in 1601. Furthermore, that charitable money should not be applied directly for the fulfilment of a statutory duty. One cannot collect money from the public to spend on something which one has an obligation as a Government to do anyway. There is a slight tension there but it is one that has been resolved in a number of other areas, including the national health service, to which I shall return shortly.
<P>
I hope that what I have said so far at least sets out some of the considerations in my mind in tabling the new clause. In fairness, Ministers will have to think about this and worry it out to find an answer. A question then arises, which is immediately germane to the new clause: what should be done about any residual private sector assets that may arise? That assumes that there is some understanding as to what happens where there are joint or merged chambers as being a special but important case. In many cases there will be something left over and the question then is whether it should go national or be retained at local level. Ministers may not want to resolve that finally at this stage. They may even need to know 391 392 what the assets are before they can decide what to do with them. That I understand in principle. However, the new clause provides an opportunity for some local discretion and local focus in the shape of local learning and skills councils disposing of moneys locally.
<P>
At an earlier stage of our consideration we said that there might be some worries about there being enough public money in the local learning and skills councils. The area of discretion is 10 to 15 per cent. and I sought to show to the Committee that that was lower than the current expenditure of the TEC movement, with the inference, therefore, that some of that expenditure will be squeezed. The Ministers may not accept that argument and other resources may be made available. I do not want to rehearse those arguments again. What is quite clear is that if the local learning and skills councils are to be effective, they need an important degree of local discretion. Leaving aside their base load--their core funding from public funds--it would be highly desirable if they were to have an opportunity to spend moneys locally freely and, as I described it on a previous occasion, off the formula.
<P>
I have entered a note of reservation for Ministers, because I am trying to be entirely fair about this. When one looks at the wind-up of industrial training boards and the conversion of some international training organisations and so on, the distribution of assets is not always perfectly even. That I understand. Some may be very rich and others not, and that may be for adventitious reasons. I am not saying, therefore, that the Minister must return absolutely all assets locally. What I seek to do is to probe his mind and tell him that in our view there is an important case for some local involvement. For some money, nobody should have to go to Ministers, although they are accountable to the general law. The local learning and skills council should be able to say, "We think this is important. We don't have time to wait until the money comes down through the formula. Our discretionary funds are already fully committed. We want to back this and do something about it today. Can we draw on our residual funds?" Given the consensual nature of the Committee, I cannot see that this is objectionable in principle. If it is, I hope that hon. Members will say so, but it would be useful to have this power.
<P>
The new clause itself has some resonance in relation to the national health service. The reason that I know this, and the reason the new clause is drafted as it is, is because I raised a related issue on hospital trusts and other public trusts that were held in parallel with national health service central funding under the legislation which culminated in the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. When I raised it in Committee, the then Minister was kind enough to acknowledge that I had a point and he invited me to table a new clause, which was accepted. The clause in the 1990 Act. giving that power is substantially the same as new clause 3. I copied it with a few embellishments and shortenings, and trust that I have made a reasonably workmanlike Job of it.
<P>
If one accepts that local learning and skills councils may have assets that have derived from the TEC movement--I am not being prescriptive about that, Ministers may say how they think it should go--and if there is money floating around in the system that is public money but not government money, there should be a vehicle whereby it can be handled locally. It would be a good idea if the trustees handling that money were not the local learning and skills councils. In other words, there should be a filter of agreement: they should have to get some signatures on the cheque. The trust would be bolted on to their normal activities. For example, if charitable moneys or other acquisitions come to a local hospital trust, they can be held as a separate trust with trustees for the benefit of the local national health service activities.
<P>
The new clause, though legally terse, is simple in concept. If there were money around in the system for the public good, which may or may not be derived from existing TEC assets that were not government property or from further acquisitions by bequest or from other sources that may come to a local learning and skills council--and we welcome that, in no sense do we want to regard it as an embarrassment--and if there were also a need for local discretion in the spending of money outside the government formula or the council's formula, that would be fine. However, if that is to happen we need a proper system of trustees and management to ensure that the money is properly handled for the public good, but not directly as part of the main activities either of the national council or of the local learning and skills councils.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to probe the Minister's intentions in relation both to disposition of TEC assets and to administration by local learning and skills councils of any funds that come to them. I hope that he will respond in the spirit in which the new clause is moved.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> This is a useful probing of an important issue. The hon. Gentleman has put forward his proposal for the Bill looking to the future with learning and skills councils but has also reflected on the complex issue of TEC assets. I, too, will deal with both.
<P>
The new clause is designed to enable a local LSC to hold in trust any property that it acquires, whether that property comes through a transfer under the provisions of the Bill or through the LSC's own acquisition. Having listened to the hon. Gentleman's arguments, I see the importance of the issue but I remain sceptical that it would be of benefit for the LSC to hold the property in trust. Let me explain why.
<P>
In our view, the Bill as currently drafted--in particular, clause 18--enables the LSC to do all that it needs to do in terms of owning and managing property so as to perform all its statutory functions. The Further Education Funding Council does not have an express power along the lines proposed by the hon. Gentleman.  I am not aware that that has caused the FEFC any problems, although perhaps he will correct me if I am wrong about that.
<P>
The principal effect of creating an express power for the Learning and Skills Council to allocate property to a trust would be to put property beyond its control and into private hands. Although the new clause gives the Secretary of State wide-ranging powers in respect of the conduct of that trust, the trustees would still not be directly accountable to Parliament or the Secretary of State, which would be the purpose of the trust in some respects. It would put public resources under the control of independent trustees with their own legal responsibilities. I do not see any obvious benefit in doing that. It would create unnecessary legislation and unnecessary bureaucracy. The new clause has teased out an interesting issue, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
Let me say something about the complex matter of TEC assets and their future use. It is complex for at least two reasons. First, TECs vary a great deal in the work that they have taken on and the partnerships into which they have entered, such as, for example, with chambers of commerce. We are not dealing with one animal, but with a number of different institutions. Secondly, judging which of their assets can properly be described as public or private, to use simple descriptions, is quite complicated.
<P>
When a TEC licence expires, all assets and reserves derived from payments made by the Secretary of State revert to him under the terms of the contract. The recovery of reserves attributable to payments derived from the Secretary of State covers the whole of any TEC group, including assets held by any subsidiary companies established as charitable trusts, unless such funds have passed to the trust with the specific agreement of the Secretary of State. Only a handful of such trusts will be affected. We are currently discussing with individual TECs as part of their transition plans how such resources should be used. We will be dealing with that in more detail when we reach clause 87.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Graham Brady (Altrincham and Sale, West):</B> I am finding the Minister's comments interesting. Given that it has apparently been necessary under certain circumstances for particular TECs to set up trusts, can he tell us a little more about the purposes of those trusts? Might not the same imperatives apply in future under the LSC provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Before I respond to that, let me say something more about the question of reserves deriving from public or private sources. For some years, TECs have been asked to report in their annual accounts the division of their reserves between public and private sources. We have allowed for that eventuality. We have issued guidance to them on how to undertake that task. An exercise is currently under way to validate the way that TECs have undertaken that splitting of reserves. We will confirm the apportionment with each TEC after the exercise has been completed. The work is being undertaken for the Department by a Firm of accountants called Robson Rhodes.
<P>
One cannot prejudge the exercise, but the question arises about what would happen to any assets that were not to be allocated back to the Secretary of State but were produced in other situations. Ministers, prompted by a particular case, have recently considered the matter carefully. They concluded that, in principle, if funds remain after the overall national costs of transition and the commitment to individual learning accounts have been met, those funds should be made available to the local learning and skills councils in the local areas from which they were drawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> The Minister may be able to clear up the following matter. He said that any residual unapplied assets might be used by the Secretary of State to support the learning and skills councils. Will not the memorandum and articles of association of many of the companies limited by guarantee specify, within company law, what unapplied residual assets may be used for? There may be conditions to the application of money that has been bequeathed. It may be outwith the powers of the Secretary of State to do otherwise with those assets than what the directors wish to do. Will the Minister clarify that point?
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall try my best to do so, but I shall first give way to the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who may have a related point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister gloss the point that has just been made by confirming whether the Government intend to set aside the memorandum and articles of any TEC--as a private sector company, albeit limited by a guarantee of public purpose--as part of the re-allocation of assets?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Both questions have shown the complexity of the task facing us. We need to know more about what has happened at each TEC level, which is why we have recently paved the way by asking TECs to start to split what might be termed their public and private assets. We have a duty as a Department to validate that exercise because it is a complex task that one TEC may go about honestly, but in a different way from another. We need the famous level playing field and, because of the complexity of that task, we have asked a team of accountants to help.
<P>
We do not have all the answers to those questions but, broadly speaking, when the funds properly belong to the Secretary of State, they will go back to the Secretary of State for proper public uses. However, we have made a judgment in the past few days that it is right and proper that locally generated money should go to the new local learning and skills councils for local purposes, provided that we are convinced that the assets have been obtained in that way, and that there is money left over after our commitments to individual learning accounts have been met. That judgment will be well regarded by local TECs in that position, and will be seen to make sense by local people.
<P>
We do not have a full record of the different types of trusts and their purposes. The purpose of the exercise is to make that record, and I will be happy to make the information available to Parliament and to the Committee, if it is still sitting. Some of the trusts may have tax advantages for TECs as private companies, but the LSC will be in a different position.
<P>
I welcome the probing new clause--I assume that that is its intention--proposed by the hon. Member for Daventry. We do not believe that we need trusts to fulfil 395 396 our objectives for the learning and skills councils. However, there will be consolidated accounts, because the LSC amounts to one public body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I want to pick up on the Minister's response to my earlier point. I am grateful for his candid, if not complete, answer. The Government are clearly endeavouring to gather information on the matter. Will the Minister give an assurance that if, in the course of those investigations, reasons why trusts have served purposes other than the tax advantages to which he referred are uncovered, the Government will later reconsider whether the powers of the LSC should be incorporated into the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We are very much in the middle of the exercise. As I said, a later clause will enable us to reconsider some of the issues on Report. We are not dealing with a matter of great principle or ideology; we are trying to establish some commonsense arrangements. We do not anticipate doing so at this stage, but if the exercise that I have described and the intelligence that we are gathering make us think again, we will come back with sensible proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I reiterate my earlier question: what is the Government's understanding of the situation for local learning and skills councils that want to accept future bequests or donations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am heartened by the vision that has emerged today of many of our future citizens--and I suspect many members of the Committee, doubtless including you, Mr. Hancock--wanting to bequeath large resources to that area when writing their wills--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the Minister is speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, indeed. During dull moments in the Committee--not that there have been any--people could draft appropriate amendments to their will.
<P>
The powers exist to accept that money and for local learning and skills councils to be sensitive about applying it to the purposes for which the donor intended it. I will confirm with the Department that that is the case. To avoid my own embarrassment, I will not accept money in brown envelopes. It has to be done properly.
<P>
I hope that we have had a full debate about an important matter, relating not only to the current and transitional situation, but to the future. I hope that, with the assurances I have given, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I shall be brief. I wish simply to reinforce the points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady).
<P>
My constituency of City of London has absorbed an enormous amount of money over eight centuries, which has, by sensible investment, hugely increased to enable it to carry out a series of purposes. Because it has private, independent and charitable use of that money, which does not go straight into the overall rate fund, it has been able to do good--even in the past decade when tasks have arisen in greater London that could not be funded from any other natural resource and would otherwise have had to be met by Government money.
<P>
An analogous example to that used by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry was the appeal by Lord Mayor Treloar in 1908 for an orthopaedic hospital for children, which was taken over by the national health service in 1948. The trustees of the charity that had previously run the hospital built a boarding school, which was first for boys and then for girls, fairly close to the hospital, in order to provide education for children who needed to be within reach of the hospital. It made a major contribution to the education of children with orthopaedic disorders during that period. We are all familiar with the charities set up over the past eight or 10 centuries, of which perhaps too many are under the care of the Charity Commission--my favourite is the Society for the Suppression of Mendacity, which was created in the first quarter of the 19th century. Incidentally, its glory of all time must be the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. I understand why the Government are doing an analysis in tandem with the Bill--the exercise by Robson Rhodes to which the Minister referred. However, I want to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West about the need to return to the matter if the Robson Rhodes inquiry indicates that some of the charities have genuine purposes, which, in terms of the future of the clause, would be of profound value. I am not criticising the Government for their current lack of knowledge, but, if the inquiry has not been concluded, their reaction to the new clause is necessarily based on a slight degree of ignorance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been an interesting and broadly constructive debate. The highlight for me was the image, which began to appear, of new Labour Members receiving pager messages saying, "Please immediately complete codicil in favour of the local learning and skills council".
<P>
A serious point is at stake, however, which probes the awkward but important relationship and boundary between the public and private sectors. Hon. Members have contributed helpfully to that debate. The Minister did not begin his response well--he seemed dismissive of the discussion. However, he warmed to some of the arguments--if not mine, those of my right hon. and hon. Friends--by saying that the new clause would provide a degree of flexibility and opportunity.
<P>
If I may contribute some personal experience, a fairly substantial charity, of which I was once chairman, first came into existence to run a college of agricultural instruction and engineering as a company limited by guarantee--a charitable company. In turn, its main role was subsumed by the growth of publicly funded agricultural colleges after 1945. It became redundant in that role, but subsequently became involved in related activities in connection with the support of agricultural education and research. It continues to this day--I remain a member, but not, of course, an executive--to fulfil an important parallel role. No Committee member should be concerned in relation to the principle of common interest. Equally, for the avoidance of doubt, I want to make it clear that we understand the principle that moneys that are, or are seen to be, derivable from public funds, are and remain the property of the Secretary of State, who has the responsibility to dispose of such moneys, and is accountable to the House. That must be adhered to firmly.
<P>
The Minister's contribution improved in response to interventions, which were made tellingly from both sides of the Committee, and in terms of explaining the Department's investigatory and research work on the existing split and the basis of that split in the assets of training and enterprise councils, and on parallel trusts and their purpose. The new clause is purely permissive--it would enable local learning and skills councils to have the power to set up such trusts, which may have a continuing role. In response to the hon. Member for Blackpool, South, the difficulty is that, if everyone signed a codicil to their will tomorrow, the money, if it went anywhere, would go to the national Learning and Skills Council rather than to local learning and skills councils. That might diminish people's generosity and commitment, which would be a pity.
<P>
The Minister has provided some assurance, and has been candid about what he is not yet able to say. He announced a welcome principle in relation to any residual private assets of training and enterprise councils, which was that they should stay local and not be centralised. That shows a measure of good intention and, given that he said it, I do not want to press the new clause.

<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I join my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry in welcoming you, Mr. Hancock, to the Chair again this morning. This important new clause deals with a different subject from that just touched on. It is designed to require the LSC to help with the transport costs of people with learning disabilities in post-16 education and training. It follows from a debate in another place on a similar if not identical new clause, and its provisions speak for themselves.
<P>
We hope to take the debate a little further than they did in the other place. We recognise that the Government accept that transport provision needs to be improved for such people, as they said in the other place that they were examining how that could be done. We therefore look forward to the Minister being able to say whether the Government have made any progress since that debate, and what their thinking is about how to improve existing transport provision.
<P>
People with learning disabilities may need not only transport provision, but what is described as travel training, which would enable them to access available transport. It is clear that problems other than physical difficulties can often restrict people with learning disabilities from using public transport, and so those problems need to be tackled. One sad statistic that came as a surprise to me was in Mencap's report, "Living in Fear". It stated that 25 per cent. of the people with learning disabilities who were surveyed had been bullied on public transport in the past year. That issue is dealt with in one of the proposed new subsections of the new clause, and we would like to hear about it from the Minister.
<P>
We would also like the Minister to say more about how the Government propose to extend provision specifically for people with learning disabilities, especially those who do not now have access to such transport. We gather that much has been done on that subject, but we would like to hear whether the Minister is confident that all people with learning disabilities who need transport to get to their places of learning and training will receive it. What will the Government do for people with learning disabilities who do not have access to such transport at the moment?
<P>
We look forward to hearing the Minister's responses on those issues and perhaps others that he thinks germane to this important subject. We hope that he will treat the debate as an opportunity to say more about it.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins (Staffordshire, Moorlands):</B> I apologise to you, Mr. Hancock, and the Committee for being a little late this morning. It is clear that our mayor has not lived up to his responsibility of ensuring that traffic congestion is removed from the roads of London.
<P>
The new clause mainly deals with transport for people with learning disabilities, but I am sure that we are all aware that transport is an important issue for all post-16 students, especially in rural areas. Before incorporation, many FE colleges provided subsidised transport, but many reconsidered their positions after incorporation. 399 400 Many urban colleges to which students might have travelled only three or four miles did not consider that as a priority for their funding.
<P>
The issue is different in rural areas. At my local college at Leek in Staffordshire, before incorporation, students' fares were paid by the county council, both for those with learning disabilities and for others. After incorporation, the college issued--and still does issue--bus passes because many students could not afford to go to the college unless that was done. According to the principal, nine out of 10 of those students travel on the school bus. That is not surprising, especially after deregulation of buses, because many of the local villages have barely one bus a day going anywhere near the college in Leek.
<P>
I am pleased to say that the college has many students with learning disabilities on its roll. Some of them travel on the school bus, others come from the local clinic on their own transport. The important point is that they are using existing transport resources.
<P>
That obviously creates challenges for the college because it has to organise its curriculum around the core hours of 9 am to 4 pm. That is very difficult, especially when guidance from the Department says that it should be extending its hours and making them more flexible. It is an issue that the Minister will recognise. It also demonstrates that transport can be provided co-operatively right across the education institutions in this field.
<P>
The new clause addresses the needs of people with learning disabilities. Increasingly our education system is adopting an inclusive approach rather than providing separate facilities for people with learning disabilities. I hope that this issue will be addressed in an integrated way to ensure that people with learning disabilities use the same facilities as other students. That has valuable lessons not only for people with learning disabilities but--just as importantly--for people who should understand the needs of people with learning disabilities. It is important to encourage the mixing of people with learning disabilities and those who do not have that problem.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) mentioned bullying. I hope that for people with learning disabilities the school bus is an area free from bullying. I recognise that that is not always the case, but with the excellent bus drivers who to some extent take responsibility for behaviour on school buses, I hope that that problem does not arise, certainly not on school buses in Staffordshire. I hope that the issue of mobility training, to which the hon. Gentleman drew attention, will be dealt with in the more sheltered environment of the school bus rather than on public transport.
<P>
I am concerned about the modern day scourge of the school gates problem. There is congestion around probably every school, whether it be in an urban or rural environment. My own local education authority in Staffordshire provides many school buses, and they charge for that service when the pupil reaches the age of 16. I have very much opposed that because I believe that it encourages congestion. Rather than pay for the school bus for their 16-year-old, parents drive the student to school, perhaps with younger siblings at the same or nearby school. Indeed, when a student has passed his driving test, having to pay for the school bus encourages him to drive to school, creating even more congestion. At worst, the practice discourages those students from staying on at school. That is very inconsistent with the approach adopted by Leek college: it subsidises transport for its students, whereas the local education authority does not.
<P>
I hope, therefore, that the learning and skills councils will help to pull the levers to engage all the available funding streams to create an equitable solution not simply for people with learning disabilities up to the age of 25, but also for other students particularly in the age group 16 to 19, to ensure that no student will be denied access to learning because of a transport problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I was reflecting that during the early days of new Labour I would have been enthusiastically asking all Members to support new clause 4, but that victorious battle is long over. On this occasion, although new clause 4 also raises some important issues and I am sympathetic to the introductory comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, I shall ask the Committee to resist it. The hon. Gentleman and all the Committee share the view that if our ambition to widen participation in post-16 education and training is to be achieved--not least for those with disabilities or learning difficulties--it is important that they have access through the effective provision of transport, and we have just had a valuable contribution on that from my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins).
<P>
Our debate is concerned with the best way of meeting the needs of students. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I believe that their needs will be served if the lead responsibility for post-16 support for transport remains with LEAS. There are three compelling reasons for that, as my noble friend Baroness Blackstone explained when the amendment was discussed in the other place. First, some LEAs do an excellent job in ensuring that transport is available for students with mobility problems. I do not want to knock all local authorities because of the failings of some to perform their current statutory duties. Secondly, even if the amendment were accepted, LEAs would remain responsible for arranging transport for pupils under 16. We would then have a real mess, with transport being laid on for school pupils by the LEA, but a statutory duty for students at the neighbouring sixth-form college falling on the LSC. We need some joined up thinking here, along the lines described by my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands in her own locality. We would lose all the opportunities for sensible and effective use of school transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister is describing the broader arrangements, which are not entirely joined up, whereby school sixth-form funding is never transferred to the LSCs. If the funding can be provided by the LSC for sixth-form provision via the LEA, why is it not also logically consistent for the same approach to be taken in relation to school transport?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> That is a good debating point. As the hon. Gentleman was speaking, I was thinking that we join up things in different ways. The logic of the Learning and Skills Bill is the need to bring coherence and rationalisation to the post-16 agenda. I am anxious that we resist--albeit politely--the logic of the new clause, which would inhibit the real possibility of some sensible transport planning for children and students.
<P>
The third reason is that, just when we are trying to strengthen local authority responsibilities and vision for overall public transport in their area--because we should see this in the wider context--it would make no sense at all for the responsibility for the needs of one group to be sectioned off to a different statutory body. That is why I do not think that the best way of helping disabled students is by making changes to legislation along the lines proposed in the new clause. We must be concerned with how we can improve on the services currently provided by LEAs. My noble friend, Baroness Blackstone, set out a range of practical proposals, and I want to renew our commitment to making progress in this area. Over and above the role of LEAs, there are a number of other things that can be done. There is no one single policy or practical solution.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, still early days, but the results so far from education maintenance allowance pilots are promising. They have been used as a basis for four new pilots that have recently been introduced aimed specifically at helping students with their transport costs. We have worked with disability organisations in the design of these pilots, and there are real opportunities in such an approach to student support. In fact I hope that in due course the education maintenance allowance will become the basis of a national system of support for learners.
<P>
I also see a new role for local learning partnerships in examining local provision and in bringing together all the main local players to make the best use of their combined resources for transport. There are excellent examples on the ground of how local transport needs can be met in specific localities through partnership working. We have seen good examples in new deal partnerships specifically for young people. If we could identify the best practices of colleges and LEAs, we could promote more local solutions. My officials are now working with disability organisations to issue guidance to local learning partnerships to give them this new role.
<P>
In due course I hope to supplement the best practice that learning partnerships develop with the results of more systematic research. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has been looking into the provision of transport for school pupils with special educational needs. I want to take that work a step further and commission a similar study into transport provision for post-16 students, with the objective of helping local learning partnerships.
<P>
The local LSCs must also play their full part. In emphasising the role of the LEA, I am not diminishing that of the LSC. We have made sure that the funding powers of the LSC are wide enough to fund transport provision. That is explicit on the face of the Bill. Where the LSC identifies gaps in transport provision, typically through the work with the local learning partnership, it will be able to commit resources to local provision in support of disabled students. The FEFC is already making progress in the use of its access funds, and the Government have substantially increased expenditure in this area. We would welcome the participation of representatives of disability organisations in the FEFC's access funds working group, which will develop the methodology and good practice for use of these funds as we prepare the LSC to take over work in this area.
<P>
Last Thursday, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough raised the importance of mobility training and the hon. Member for Hertsmere spoke with much conviction on that subject. I too remember the harrowing findings of the Mencap report, which must make us all feel a sense of shame about what our society can sometimes do to its most vulnerable members. We know that today one or two hon. Members had problems getting to this Committee. Transport can be a complex task, even for those with maximum mobility and no learning difficulties. That must be true in the rural areas too, but as a city dweller I know how difficult using transport can be in London. It is important that we understand and empathise with those with frailties and physical or learning disabilities who must find the whole endeavour far more challenging. It requires not only physical mobility, but a sense of confidence to access our cities and rural areas. Mobility training is therefore important. We have a genuine opportunity to make progress on the matter, and to enable students who have disabilities and who experience difficulties to benefit from the help that is often available but not necessarily taken advantage of. We have taken great care to ensure that the LSC's powers are set out in such a way as to avoid ambiguities in the FEFC's existing powers to provide such training. I shall expect the LSC to take advantage of the opportunity to tackle the obvious need for improved mobility training. I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
Although I cannot accept the new clause, I believe that the LSC can and must work effectively with LEAs to improve provision for disabled students. We want to tackle problems through effective partnership and by continuing to develop the system of student support for post-16 learning.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the Government's proposals, and will in turn withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his careful response to the new clause and for the tone of his remarks, which were in keeping with the spirit in which I proposed the motion. As I said, this is an important subject that we shall continue to monitor. The hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands made a thoughtful speech, much of which I agreed with.
<P>
I shall briefly engage in some special pleading for my constituency. Hertfordshire, and especially my constituency of Hertsmere, contains many long-stay institutions of Victorian heritage, many of whose residents have moved on to care in the community, and, having lost contact with their regional family roots, into local, smaller-scale provision. As a result, Hertfordshire, and especially Hertsmere, contains many people with learning disabilities who live in small-scale provision. 403 404 Hertfordshire county council strongly feels that central Government support through the standard spending assessment is not sufficient and does not reflect the concentration of people with learning difficulties in Hertfordshire. That is my special pleading, to which I shall return, I hope on the Floor of the House, on another occasion and in another context.
<P>
The specific transport provision that people with learning difficulties need should be available. We are not fixated on providing it in a particular way, but we hope that, through the various initiatives that have been described, including the access fund, provision will be available for people with learning difficulties who have a particular transport need in accessing learning and training. Our idea of an integrated system is one in which everyone has entitlement and access, and particular needs are met to enable access.
<P>
We shall reflect carefully on the Minister's speech, and will watch with particular interest the outcome of consultations with organisations that represent people with learning disabilities, on which we shall also reflect. I am pleased that the Minister recognises the importance of this subject, to which we may want to return. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We now move to part II, which contains the provisions that relate to Wales. Later we shall discuss the inspectorate arrangements for Wales. I tread rather diffidently in discussing the matter, not entirely without experience or confidence, but nevertheless trying to respect some of the sensitivities involved. I am not a Welsh Member, but, as I have already reminded the Committee, I am married to Welsh lady. She is a teacher. My mother-in-law was formerly a senior mistress at Gowerton and Welsh-speaking teachers are in the family, some of whom teach in the Principality, so I have a certain interest in such matters. When the policies for Wales and England are so closely aligned, there is no purpose in our rehearsing, rehashing or revisiting the debate on those for England. I see that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East is relieved by that. We work on the assumption that the policies are aligned and it would be helpful if the Minister clarified that. To a casual reader, the clauses are identical.
<P>
There are self-evident differences, such as the use of the Welsh language. I recall the time when an exceptionally able friend was being examined for entry to read classics at Cambridge university. I was reliably informed--or possibly unreliably informed--that an unseen translation from modern languages was always attempted after the decision about entry had been taken. Because of his knowledge of Latin, my friend attempted the Italian unseen--and unknown, given that he did not know any Italian--but he seemed to manage it perfectly well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have done law papers like that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere shocks me. Luckily, this is not the confessional and I shall not trespass too far into such matters. My limited knowledge of Welsh leads me not to wish to translate or pronounce it in Committee. I am reminded of Churchill's phrase "Prenez garde je parle franais", which would not be appropriate. Such limited knowledge also gives me a certain reluctance to adopt my usual pettifogging habits of checking each syllable of the Bill, not least because Welsh is a mutated language and that the word "Cymru" can begin with an "N" in certain cases, for example, and because I shall probably make a tremendous fool of myself if I do.
<P>
It will be helpful if the Minister can confirm that, save in the references to Wales, to the National Assembly as against the Secretary of State and the regional committees, the substance of the policy is broadly the same as that concerning England as is its wording. I know that it is a terribly boring and painstaking task, but I hope that officials will continue to make sure that every last syllable is absolutely right in both the Welsh text and the references. Amendment No. 32 went down early because of one misstated reference, when it referred back to the English clauses and not the Welsh. The Committee need not prolong its consideration of the matter, but with those reservations in mind we can continue to look at particular clauses in relation to Wales. Welsh members of the Committee may also wish to contribute to that debate.
<P>
If we considered the amendments that we tabled de nouveau to the debates, they would seem a little eclectic. In certain cases, they enable us to rehearse matters relating to England, but which may require a little more explanation or revisiting in relation to Wales. They also enable us to open certain issues that have not been developed fully in relation to England, therefore the replication of the clauses in relation to Wales will be to the benefit of both countries. They allow us to touch on cross-border and jurisdictional issues that are of considerable interest to all members of the Committee. Finally, they enable us to touch on some of the sensitive issues in relation to language, bearing in mind that Wales is the part of the United Kingdom with the most significant number of speakers of a language other than English as their primary language. I use that phrase delicately because my pair--in the days when we had one--was one of the two Gallic speakers of this place. It is clearly important that the Welsh language issue is properly rehearsed and understood and that there should be, in the view of all members of the Committee, no discrimination against or differentiation between persons on account of whether they speak that language.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have considerable affection for the Welsh language. I wish that I spoke it. I am reliably assured that it is, after all, the language that is spoken in heaven, but that may not be a problem for me, certainly at the moment. Equally, I hope that the Committee will not discriminate against me because I cannot speak the language. These are sensitive issues and it is important that they are rehearsed properly. If we occasionally adopt a slightly flippant tone, it is not because they do not matter. They do. All members of the Committee should be treated fairly.
<P>
My right hon. and noble Friend, Lord Roberts of Conwy referred in another place to the Council for Education and Training in Wales and the Enterprise Council's description of the current economic and educational position in Wales. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Wales has the lowest rate of economic activity in Great Britain... the lowest rates of A-level and higher education graduates of any region of the United Kingdom. For those in work the position is not much better:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The net effect of this is obvious; we see it everywhere. The Welsh economy is under-performing. Only a new, coherent approach to economic development will put it right.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 10 February 2000; Vol. 609, c.886.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is not the occasion to go over the Welsh economy, but it is the time to reassert the importance of what were traditionally regarded as the strengths of Wales in education and training, and their current importance for the improved economic standards and better social conditions for Wales. The key is not merely in external or capital investment. It is in improving the skills and abilities of the people of Wales, so that they can make their contribution to the United Kingdom, as they have always successfully done. We feel strongly, as I am sure the Minister does, that that should be supported.
<P>
I now come to the clutch of amendments that relates to the appointment of the council and wish to rehearse several substantive points. I deal first with amendment No. 167, as it is slightly different from the others. It would impose on the appointment what might loosely be called the Nolan principles. I hope that the Minister and the Committee will accept that we are trying to do what he wishes. There is a certain difficulty, particularly with those of us who are not familiar with devolution procedures and provisions, in ensuring that the appointment of the council is the responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales. In England we are naturally used to assuming that such matters are the responsibility of the Secretary of State who is accountable to this place. Parliament rarely appoints people. We elect a Speaker. We appoint the Comptroller and Auditor-General, but we do not generally have the power of appointment in this place. We deliberate and legislate. In Wales, the Assembly acts as the appointing body. It might be helpful if the Minister can remind, certainly those English members of the Committee, how that happens. The Assembly is a body corporate, but the relationship between the views of the Assembly, the First Minister and the Executive would be interesting, particularly because there is no overall majority in the Assembly.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 167 is to ensure that appointments are open and above board, in accordance with Nolan principles. The other three amendments concern the constitution of the council and, in a sense, operate together. Amendments Nos. 140 and 141 would widen the scope by increasing the membership.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chris Ruane </B>(Vale of Clwyd): I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his stated sensitivity towards Wales, the Welsh language, Welsh matters and the National Assembly for Wales. What representations has he received from any political grouping in the Assembly, particularly the Conservative grouping, on extending the number of people on the council?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have received some representations from the Conservative grouping, and I have studied the comments of my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Roberts of Conwy, in which he suggests flexibility. It is important for the Committee to debate how the council is constituted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> We should remember that the Assembly is new and that we in Westminster especially need to treat it sensitively. Were the views that the hon. Gentleman heard from his Conservative colleagues in the Assembly representative of all in the Assembly's Conservative group?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I dealt with the Conservative spokesman for education, the Assembly Member Jonathan Morgan, whose representations were sufficient. There may be different views on the number and it is right that the Committee should debate them. I raise the issue not simply as a Conservative, but as an interested and friendly observer with an obligation to legislate. I will develop the argument, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will respond.
<P>
It seems odd that fewer people are on the council in Wales than the one in England. That is another difference between the two. Wales has fewer students, but the interests involved and the need to incorporate a broad balance of interests remain the same. Business, trade unions, educationists, education providers and local authorities are still involved. A smaller number of people does not automatically require a smaller council.
<P>
The Committee has no wish to inflate matters ridiculously or to make the council unmanageable or have too many members. The hon. Gentleman may have had that perfectly reasonable point in mind. Having studied what my noble Friend said in another place, I accept the argument for a slightly wider council, which would impart flexibility. Although the conventional wisdom may be that the Government want the maximum powers and the Opposition resist, it is interesting that Government Members have occasionally not wanted to take the flexibility that we have offered. Increasing the number would improve flexibility. As we said, the process is not an exact science, but an increase from 12 to 16 would replicate the position in England and provide some flexibility.
<P>
There is a reason for the appointment of regional committees to be considered. We will discuss the committees later, and decide whether the Assembly should have a mandatory or a permissive power. However, if the Council decides to have regional committees and the permissive power is available, four places on the CETW will automatically be taken by the chairs of those committees. If the maximum number of places is 12, that will be a fairly heavy prior charge on the membership of the council.
<P>
That brings me to business representation and amendment No. 142, which deals with the range and balance of experience on the council. We are concerned that business should be properly represented. As I understand it--the Minister may want to disabuse me of this notion--the Secretary of State's commitment that 40 per cent. of the members of the LSC and of local LSCs in England should come from the business community is not replicated in any commitment on the part of the Welsh Secretary or in the Bill. It appears from the debate in another place that the Government are sheltering behind the Assembly's decision, and well they might--the Assembly is not bound by the Government's approach and might want to take a different view. However, I think that all members of the Committee would like there to be strong business representation in Wales. If that is to be secured, there must be a strong steer from the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> I share the hon. Gentleman's concern that the council should be strongly influenced by the business community, but the National Assembly for Wales has made a statement that it wants no group or sector to have overall control on the council. The hon. Gentleman stated at the outset that he was sensitive to feelings in Wales, but it would send the wrong message if we in Westminster said, "No, you've got it wrong." The people on the ground have stated their opinion, and we should respect it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not think that we shall have to debate the issue, because we agree on it. I am certainly anxious that there should be great sensitivity to local interests. However, it would be useful to hear what is in the Minister's mind on the matter.
<P>
To continue with the case that I was constructing, if we took four of the 12 places on the council for regional chairs and roughly five for business, we would have taken nine places and left precious few for local authorities, educationists and others. As we mentioned when we debated the clauses relating to England, certain people might have a dual capacity--they will probably have to if there is to be a good balance and range of interests. To reassure the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr Ruane), I should say that people will almost certainly not be appointed as delegates for a particular interest. We want people who will have their own mind and their own say, and who will sometimes speak off their brief or say things that we would not necessarily expect. Of course we want that. However, it is important that the Minister articulates how he sees the council's composition, what kind of balance he would like his Assembly colleagues to produce and what sort of outcome he would welcome.
<P>
The amendments were tabled for those reasons. We are looking first for arrangements that ensure that public appointments are made on an open, straightforward, Nolan-inspired basis. We also want there to be an adequate range and balance of council members. It is not sufficient for the Committee to be assured that this is entirely a matter for the National Assembly, although, in response to the hon. Gentleman, I should say that it is of course important to reflect the Assembly's sensitivities. We also want to ensure that the council is big enough to do its job and of an adequate size to embrace representatives of the various interests. I hope that the Minister will respond to those points of genuine concern and probing with some constructive comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. I echo everything he has said about the sensitivity that we need to show, including to the Welsh language. When my noble mother seconded the Loyal Address in the House of Lords some years ago, she quoted the episode of the inquest on a drowning in a public swimming bath in Wales where the attendant was asked by the coroner why he had made no attempt to save the person who was drowning. The swimming bath attendant said, "Can't swim." The coroner said, "When you were recruited for the job, were no questions asked about whether you could swim or not?" The swimming bath attendant replied, "No, the only question I was asked was 'Are you bilingual?'"
<P>
10.30 am
<P>
In the earlier debate on the size of the council in England, I alluded--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my right. hon. Friend recall another sad story about drowning, which is entirely germane to an education debate? Indeed, I was brought up on it. Someone was allowed to drown in not unrelated circumstances because in this case a person's knowledge of grammar was so punctilious that he was unable to respond to a cry of, "I will drown and no one shall save me."
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before anyone else thinks of a drowning story, we have got to the bottom of that one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It is true, Mr. Hancock, that I had embarked on the next stage of my speech when my hon. Friend intervened. I was reverting to the numbers in the council in England. I quote the late, great John Garnett who put the optimum size of human groups between the number of 12 disciples and a rugby football team of 15. I reintroduce rugby football because of the presence of the Welsh Minister. I said earlier that my grandfather played rugby football for Wales. He was also a canon in the Church in Wales. I acknowledge that the Government have chosen a figure which embraces the first of the late John Gamett's figures but not the second. I do not want to make too much of it, but there is a national resonance about rugby football in the context of this section of the Bill which has a relevance to the numbers.
<P>
I do not want to start a discussion about cricket to complicate matters for the Minister. However, I notice that amendment No. 142 to clause 30(3) follows the language used in clause 1. I did not notice the somewhat Pooterish language of the clause in the English context and I am slightly embarrassed that I have only noticed it in the Welsh context. There is an argument in favour of the size of the council in Wales being capable of providing a series of different skills, backgrounds and experiences that could be useful to the task in hand. My grandfather played in the first international in Wales--a match against Scotland--that saw the present configuration of the back division. There are specialist activities in both cricket and rugby football that are best served by people who have direct skills and specialist activity. I shall not, Mr. Hancock, go down that road and fill it out any further.
<P>
On 10 February in another place, the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, in response to my right and noble Friend Lord Roberts of Conwy, who was quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, acknowledged--and I acknowledge--the regional argument, which she deployed, that there are not as many regions in Wales as in England. Frankly, beyond that, as far as I can see all she said about numbers on the council was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are confident that with a membership of between 10 and 12 we are striking the right balance. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 10 February 2000; Vol. 609, c. 890.]<P>

I acknowledge that the noble Baroness hales from Lancashire--

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> She has a Welsh mother, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I acknowledge that, too, and that the debate occurred at a very late hour and everyone may have wanted to go to bed. Nevertheless, that seems to be a slightly slender response from the Government to the arguments of my hon. Friends and, indeed, of the Opposition in the other House. It is, therefore, perfectly reasonable for my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry to be bringing this matter back to the Committee because of the slightly slender nature of the discussion in another place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my right. hon. Friend accept that one of the interesting and relevant differences between the Welsh and English provisions that makes this even more surprising is that whereas it would, at least in principle, be a physical possibility to incorporate chairs of the regional committees, if there were to be four such chairs, in the Welsh framework, nobody would countenance for one moment or wish to suggest that the 47 chairs of the local learning skills councils in England should be incorporated? We are, therefore, automatically dealing with a different position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reinforcing my point. To go back to the argument that the noble Baroness deployed, which is one of the reasons why we have come back to this in the Committee today, when the late Lord Brecon, who also haled from the Principality, was an appointed Member of the European Parliament, he suddenly found himself at short notice appearing on a sub-committee in Brussels and received instructions that it was important for the British to resist the argument being deployed by the Commission. He was given no briefing, so had no arguments to deploy--a little like the noble Baroness in the House of Lords on this subject--and he simply said with great firmness that the British were wholly opposed to the provision. Up to that point there had been no reaction at all from other members of the committee that there might be anything wrong with the Commission's proposals, but as soon as that was uttered the German member of the committee stood up and said how glad he was that the British had raised the matter with such a degree of firmness and that he also had a number of concerns. That is a further reinforcement of what we are about.
<P>
On amendment No. 167, my hon. Friend spoke about the Nolan principle. I apologise to the Committee for not having gone back to the source documents in terms of the National Assembly. The language that the noble Baroness used on that occasion was again somewhat opaque and ambiguous. She implied, but did not state, that the procedures of the National Assembly automatically involved the Nolan principles. The Minister may well be about to tell us that. If he tells us, we shall at least have it firmly on the record, so making my hon. Friend's amendment otiose, but until he does so we need to explore this a little further.
<P>
My hon. Friend quoted our noble Friend Lord Roberts of Conwy in connection with the Welsh economy and the levels of education prevailing there. I cannot help but recall when I was a Minister in Northern Ireland where there was concern about the number of students who were leaving Northern Ireland to come to universities outside that country, mainly in Great Britain, and the possibility that they would never go back to Northern Ireland. Despite the fact that the water between Great Britain and the island of Ireland makes a transfer out of Ireland more unlikely, in that era more Welsh students left Wales to seek higher education. That is a further reason why we should reach the optimal arrangements at this time.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd for not intervening on me as he intervened on my hon. Friend. Creative dialogue between the various parts of the Kingdom is needed to make devolution work. Jonathan Morgan, the Conservative member quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, was the only person who brought the Bill and its implications into the debate in the National Assembly. The discussion there was mainly at the level of policy and did not address the issue of numbers. I am very supportive of my hon. Friend's proposals. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): The clause sets out a structure for the Council for Education and Training for Wales that is fundamentally different from that for the Learning and Skills Council. I am not convinced that the Welsh language will be a major issue. I have gone through the Bill in the many hours that we have spent in Committee and have found 62 Welsh words in total: seven in this clause, 45 in clause 70 and 10 in clause 78. It was an enjoyable occupation. [Laughter.] I do not know what other hon. Members do at times, but that is my hobby. Most of the words are the translations of the titles of the various bodies and inspectors. I hope that they will be correct and that there will not be too many problems.
<P>
The issue that is fundamentally different in the Welsh context is that of the direct line of accountability between the CETW and the National Assembly. The point about 411 412 the appointments is significant. The hon. Member for Daventry has already asked the Minister how he expects them to be made. Clearly, it is entirely a matter for the National Assembly; the Bill simply sets out that it has the responsibility for making those appointments. We would not seek to interfere in any way and are happy for that to be left to the Assembly. It would be helpful to have any information that the Minister has received from it on that. A system in which a body such as the National Assembly makes appointments is in principle better than one in which a Secretary of State does so independently. We are pleased that after discussions it has turned out that the Assembly, as a body, will make the appointments, rather than the person responsible for education in the Welsh Executive.
<P>
Amendment No. 167 talks about the Nolan principles, which were principally drawn up for appointments made by Ministers to bodies across the UK. Here we are moving into an area that is quite common in many other jurisdictions. The Americans have confirmation hearings all the time. We would welcome that in the context of the UK Parliament. Indeed, we would like the members of the LSC to be appointed by Parliament if at all possible. We would certainly argue for appointments to local learning and skills councils to be made by a regional body, through a process similar to that proposed for the National Assembly for Wales. We would much rather see an open process in which people who are coming forward for the public good would have nothing to fear from coming before a body. That is preferable to the rather shadowy process of appointment by a Secretary of State, albeit to a set of principles, in which the public cannot see what has happened and do not know why those decisions have been taken because the individuals are never tested in public. Amendment No. 167, by mentioning appointments, properly touches on a fundamentally different issue. The other side of the coin of accountability is schedule 4, which, in the context of the Nolan principles, refers to members being removed if they are unfit for office. Accountability is as much about removals as about appointments and the Assembly is the appropriate body to do both.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry and I have different views on devolution. I was concerned that on the subject of the membership of the National Council for Education and Training in Wales there were strong steers from the Government to ensure that the Assembly fell into line. That is not my party's view of devolution. We believe that the body should be created in the context of national legislation and in consultation with the National Assembly for Wales. I was pleased to see that the Bill was drafted by the two bodies on a bipartisan basis. When everything is completed, it is up to the National Assembly for Wales to take responsibility for the appointments.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There should be no question of the National Assembly being given detailed guidance on how to operate, because it is perfectly competent to do so. The point of devolution is to create bodies that are politically able to develop by being responsible for their own actions rather than being steered by Ministers in London. It would be regrettable if the Department was overly prescriptive and told the National Assembly how to manage the appointments that it has a right to make under clause 30. I hope that the National Assembly will be afforded genuine, devolved power to make the appointments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 140 and 141 would increase the number of members. My colleague, the noble Lord Thomas of Gresford consulted our members on the National Assembly for Wales and they were happy with 10 to 12. The Conservatives argued strongly that the creation of the National Assembly would lead to jobs for the boys and a huge growth in appointments to quangos. Now they are arguing for a larger body than is absolutely necessary. My hon. Friends and I believe that 10 to 12 is appropriate because the Council for Education and Training in Wales will operate not on its own, but with many other bodies, which have a varied membership. The CETW, the Learning and Skills Council and the local LSCs are fundamentally different creations. Excessive posts should not be created if they are not needed, but what is created must be able to function.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If the hon. Gentleman's remarks about devolution are serious, why is it necessary for the Bill to specify a figure? Could there not be an enabling clause stating that the maximum number should be set by the National Assembly? I say that for the purposes of the debate without necessarily endorsing it as a proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is an interesting point. The clause sets out a number, as is common in legislation, and that number reflects agreement between National Assembly representatives and the United Kingdom Government in drafting the Bill and introducing the proposals. It could be argued that the measure is a National Assembly proposal incorporated into a United Kingdom Bill. I am sure that the Minister will be able to explain how that has occurred. My hon. Friends are comfortable with the proposal, but we propose that the National Assembly should develop in the same way as the Scottish Parliament, with its own legislative control over education. However, that is a subject for a wider debate another time.
<P>
We have had consultations and we are comfortable with 10 to 12 members, so we do not support amendments Nos. 140 and 141. As for amendments Nos. 167 and 142, will the Minister tell us, as far as he can, about the Assembly's intentions? Liberal Democrats do not seek to fetter the Assembly's discretion, because we welcome the system that it will have for making appointments.
<P>
The Minister who will respond to the amendments is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales. However, I address the Minister sitting at the back of the Government Benches, the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State, the hon. Member for Croydon, North who is responsible for English matters. Will he research the possibility of moving towards an appointments system for the learning and skills councils in England that is similar to the one in clause 30? Those English appointments could be made by our representative bodies, either the United Kingdom Parliament or the regional assemblies, which we expect to be set up in England, led by the Prime Minister's region of the north-east. That would be preferable to having the Secretary of State make all the English appointments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall make a few brief comments on amendments Nos. 140 and 141. I come back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry in his intervention. It seems perverse that the two parties who claim to be the most vigorous proponents of devolution are those that are defending a clause that gives a narrower discretion and leeway to the body in Wales than to that in England, in terms of size and membership. A more logical standpoint might be to allow the membership to be between 10 and 16. It seems odd that a Government who claim to believe in devolution are setting such tightly defined limits. They give so little discretion that one wonders why they bother to give any at all. They have narrowed it down so much that they might as well say, "There will be 11 members". This is not a ringing endorsement of their pretended commitment to devolution. They go so far as to give the body a different name from the LSC, which is highly significant and perhaps translates better into Welsh. However, in the substantive matters, they clearly limit the discretion and leeway available to the Assembly.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) that there is scope for more appointments to be made by Parliament or the Assembly. It begs many questions, however, particularly in the United Kingdom where we have, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry observed, little tradition of such an appointments system. We will have to watch closely to see how that system operates and how fairly it is put into operation. If it leads to greater openness, as it should, one would hope that that would lead to a better quality of decision making, which would be a good thing.
<P>
The control of the appointments process and the requirement that it should be, in the words of amendment No. 167,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in accordance with the Code of Practice for Public Appointments issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is important. We should like some clear assurances from the Minister as to how that process will be implemented. We have recently had a significant report from the Commissioner for Public Appointments, which has some relevance here in its scrutiny of the way in which Government appointments to health authorities and trusts have been made. One criticism that report made was of the influence that Members of Parliament have had in the appointments process, which the Commissioner for Public Appointments said had led to a systematic politicisation of the appointments process. There is a danger in transferring the appointments process to the Assembly because one might institutionalise a situation in which routine consultation between the Secretary of State and Members of Parliament on shortlists for appointments leads inexorably to a systematic politicisation, there must be a danger that the transfer of the whole appointments process to the Assembly might lead to greater emphasis being placed on the political views and outlook of the individuals concerned. I accept that there is a balancing factor in that the greater openness of the Assembly's appointments might discourage that approach to appointment-making. It is worth noting, particularly in relation to amendment No. 167, that even if the Minister gives an assurance that the Nolan principles will apply to the appointments process, the Commissioner for Public Appointments has highlighted significant problems in the application of those principles. Amendment No. 167 would strengthen the requirement for the Nolan rules to be applied by giving a clear remit to the Commissioner for Public Appointments. It would add to the safeguards that we should seek to ensure fair and balanced public appointment processes.
<P>
For reasons not of my making, I could not be present when we debated clause 1. I have no desire to revisit that territory but the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has experience relevant to the Council's functions<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which appears in clause 1 as well as clause 30 leaves a great deal to be desired. One might say that the council's functions are administrative and that the desirable skills and experience would be administrative ones, whether in Wales or England. However, it would be beneficial to have tighter guarantees that some of the experience sought would be relevant not just to the council's functions but to its responsibilities. That is the importance of having significant representation from the business community, as from the educational world. Again, Ministers can give assurances in relation to England, where Ministers may be directly responsible for appointments, and they can say that it is their whole-hearted intention to act in certain ways. Knowing that the Ministers on this Committee, at least, always act in good faith and are as open and candid as possible with us, we can be reassured by that. However, the appointments process in regard to the clauses relating to Wales is explicitly delegated to the National Assembly for Wales. So ministerial assurances about the importance of business representation on the council, from further education, local authorities and other bodies, have little impact, given that they can be disregarded by the Assembly, which can take as wide a view as it wishes about the need to have regard to appointing a certain type of person to the council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful for hon. Members' contributions. It has been a useful debate, highlighting genuine concerns that also arose in another place.
<P>
I would like particularly to reassure the hon. Member for Daventry that despite the fact that this and the next few clauses, as well as later clauses dealing with inspection in Wales, deal with matters that are properly devolved to the National Assembly for Wales, we are still members of the UK Parliament. The purpose of our debate is to provide a framework for the Assembly. All the contributions from all hon. Members, including those who do not represent constituencies in Wales, are equally valid because primary legislation rests with the House of Commons. Our debate today is important.
<P>
As my hon. Friends have said on a number of occasions, they are keen to tease out the general nature of what is intended for Wales. There are many similarities between the objectives of the National Assembly for Wales in education and training and those for England. Wales has perhaps even led the way in suggesting some of the approaches that we shall be discussing for both England and Wales. My hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), who served as a junior minister in the Wales Office prior to devolution, produced the report of 415 416 the Education and Training Action Group for Wales, which the hon. Member for Daventry has in front of him. It deals with a number of the issues that, in many cases, have provided the foundations for the policy decisions that we have discussed for Wales and for England.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our discussions will reveal similarities, but the key aspect of today's debate is that our job in the Wales Office and the House of Commons is to provide the framework to allow legislative capacity for the National Assembly to act. I share the objectives of the hon. Member for Hallam to allow the National Assembly the flexibility and discretion to take forward decisions that are best suited to Wales. Once the powers have been given, within the spheres that we are discussing today the Assembly is charged with implementing policy decisions. There will necessarily be differences between the implementation of the framework legislation in Wales and in England, according to the matters brought forward.
<P>
I find myself in sympathy with a number of the points that hon. Members have made about their parentage and involvement. The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned that his wife was Welsh-born, and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) told us that his mother was, too. I have the great honour of representing 16,000 plus Welsh constituents, but I was born in England, of Welsh parents--my mother is a Glenda Jones--although I have lived within 20 miles of my constituency all my life, apart from when I was at university. So we can all bring different experiences to the debate.
<P>
Hon. Members have raised a number of valuable points. I shall try to deal with some of their concerns and give them the reassurances that they seek. Amendments Nos. 140 and 141 have been debated here today and on a previous occasion in another place. I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry and other Opposition Members who referred to those amendments will understand that, despite the difference in time scale between the debate in the Lords and that here today, similar arguments will be deployed by Ministers. We have considered these matters in great detail in the intervening time. The amendments deal with the size of the council in Wales. I can reiterate what was said by my noble friend Baroness Ribbleton--Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton. I am sorry, I got my Farringtons and Ribbletons mixed up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> It is easily done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Yes. Incidentally, I understand that she has a Welsh mother, who still resides in Wales, so although she has a Lancashire background, she is related to the Principality, as are many other members of the parliamentary community in Westminster. She made a strong case, which I believe to be true, that a membership of between 10 and 12 for the national council for Wales would not be too small to reflect the diversity of interests in post-16 education and training.
<P>
It may help hon. Members if I compare and contrast the position in England with that in Wales. In Wales, the council's budget for post-16 learning, including sixth-form funding, will be in the region of 400 million, compared with the budget of 6 million that will be controlled by the LSC. The post-16 population of England is about 40 million--some 16 times greater than the post-16 population of Wales. The CETW will be responsible for a fraction of the number of providers with which the LSC will work. Given those facts, it is eminently sensible for the LSC to have more members than the CETW, just as the existing Further Education Funding Council for England has more members than its current counterpart in Wales. In a previous incarnation in government, the hon. Member for Daventry would have had some ministerial responsibility in that regard.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the hon. Member for Hallam, who said that one of the National Assembly's aims was to reduce the quango culture that prevailed in Wales before the general election. A National Assembly elected by the people of Wales and which consists of 60 members, will ensure that that culture is not perpetuated and that quangos are not too large.
<P>
I should say to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, and the hon. Members for Daventry, for Altrincham and Sale, West, and for Hallam, that a council of 10 to 12 members will be sufficient for the National Assembly to ensure that the CETW has the right balance of membership. The killer point, as my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd noted, is that the National Assembly has had sight of the Bill since its introduction last December. Part of the devolution process is that we work together closely. I have regular discussions with the Assembly secretary on how to develop legislation and liaise with other bodies, and on the relationship between the UK Parliament and the National Assembly.
<P>
On one level, I discuss with National Assembly Ministers political issues relating to the framework of the Bill. Since its publication, the National Assembly has examined the Bill and made comments and suggestions. With regard to amendments Nos. 140 and 141, the National Assembly has not suggested that it wants the size of the council to be increased.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned Jonathan Morgan, an Assembly Member who, I believe, represents South Wales, central. Whether in plenary discussion in the National Assembly, in the National Assembly committee that deals with such matters, or in correspondence, Jonathan Morgan has expressed no wish that the size of the council be increased. Perhaps he feels that the best way to influence legislation is to write to the hon. Member for Daventry. In saying so, I am not being flippant. However, one of the best ways to influence such a decision would be to convince his colleagues in the National Assembly that the change is required. He should raise the matter in plenary discussion and in committee, and write to the Assembly secretary. If devolution is to work, such discussions must take place in Cardiff as well as Westminster.
<P>
I am not taking a flippant attitude towards the important points that were raised, but there is no burning desire on the Assembly's part for the size of the council to be increased. Without wishing to sound smug, the Assembly has expressed total satisfaction with the Government's proposals to date.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister gives an adequate explanation. In the context of it, can he assure us that, should a future National Assembly for Wales take a different view and want to increase membership of the council, will the Government--assuming that they are still in power--be happy to introduce legislation that would widen the scope and allow that discretion in Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman has said. He will agree that we are trying to establish legislation for the medium and long term, and I would not wish to introduce uncertainty into the proposals. However, part of the protocol and the job of the Secretary of State for Wales, and me as the junior Minister, in representing Wales's interest in the Government and the Government's interest in Wales is to listen to what the National Assembly says. Should it wish to make a proposal to provide that discretion in due course, I hope that it will discuss the issues with us as early as possible, including the need for legislative approval.
<P>
That is not to give a commitment that the Government would agree. On many issues on which the Government have discussions with the Assembly we do not agree with what it is proposing; on some occasions we agree with it, but on others it makes demands that we do not approve of. That is part of the creative tension in our partnership. The Assembly will always be able to seek approval for legislation from the House of Commons as long as the settlement agreed by the referendum about two years ago that the House should retain responsibility for primary legislation remains in force.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Daventry and others have referred to the need expressed in amendment No. 167 to ensure that appointments by the National Assembly are in accordance with the code of practice for public appointments the Nolan principles, as they are colloquially known. The National Assembly adheres to the principles and guidance issued in the code by the Commissioner for Public Appointments for all appointments to its public bodies. Appointments to the CETW will be made by Members of the Assembly, which is a corporate body and responsible for its actions under statute. It is likely that Tom Middlehurst, the Assembly secretary, in conjunction with other Assembly secretaries and Members, will make the appointments to the council in accordance with Nolan principles. I hope that that reassures hon. Members.
<P>
Amendment No. 142 reflects the lengthy discussions on clause 1 and the LSC in the Committee's first sitting. As my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment stressed then, we fully understand and share the desire of both Opposition and Government Members that membership of the LSC and the CETW should represent all stakeholders with an interest in post-16 education and training. We all want a wide base of representation, and to have people who will lend experience and balance to the council.
<P>
The National Assembly has said that it wants to ensure that the right balance of stakeholders in post-16 education and training is represented on the council. It has also made clear its commitment to selection on the basis of merit. I hope that that shows that the legislative framework that we are giving the Assembly will allow it to exercise its powers in accordance with the Nolan principles, reinforced by the well-informed choice of people with a broad range of knowledge and expertise relevant to the new council's functions.
<P>
There seems to be a hang-up about business and other representation. I would encourage business people, voluntary agency representatives and trade unionists to become involved, but the National Assembly has discretion. Occasionally, business men are trade unionists, and voluntary sector workers are trade unionists as well as business men in their private lives. Therefore, a range of experiences and backgrounds can be tapped. I hope that the National Assembly will use its flexibility to choose people on merit and bring to the table a range of people who are key stakeholders in the post-16 education and training system.
<P>
I accept the amendment's underlying methodology but, as the hon. Member for Hallam said, the National Assembly should have the discretion to choose who it wishes to sit on the council. It has made a clear commitment to ensure strong business representation, but has not yet specified whether a particular number of members will be reserved for that category.

I hope that I have dealt with the concerns that were raised. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster made a good point about the swimming pool attendant who was appointed on the basis of bilingualism. Given the right hon. Gentleman's contributions, I wonder whether the candidate for the constituency of Cities of London and Westminster has to be appointed on the basis of their ability to speak Latin. I am aware that he is retiring at the next election and that his prospective replacement has been chosen, but I do not know whether that was part of the selection criteria.
<P>
We shall return to language issues at a later stage of our proceedings and I look forward to further experiences drawn from the right hon. Gentleman's Welsh roots, which I studied with interest after he mentioned them in Committee. I referred to his mother's biography in order fully to brief myself and learned about the activities of his great antecedents in Welsh politics. Let no one say that Government Members never learn from Opposition Members' contributions to Committees--I have learned a considerable amount. I have little knowledge of or interest in cricket and, sadly, given that I represent a Welsh constituency, the same is true of rugby. My sport is football; if any member of the Committee wants to allude to that, they are welcome to do so.
<P>
I hope that I have clarified the Government's thinking and that the hon. Member for Daventry will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for his sensitive response to these important issues. I am pleased that he has been mindful of our responsibilities in respect of a relationship that we, as Members of Parliament, are in the process of exploring and trying to get right. We have had some valuable exchanges and received some of the assurances that we wanted. That is especially true of the Nolan principles. I understand why the Minister feels unable to give a definite commitment regarding business representation. He suggested that the Committee was hung up about that. If that were so, it would perhaps be because English Ministers are hung up on the specific issue of business representation to the exclusion of anything else.
<P>
I hope that the sentiments that have been expressed will inform the deliberations of the National Assembly in making appointments. Given the numbers involved--which are set by the Bill, thus constraining the Assembly's decisions--there will be no scope for people who are not multi-capable and represent, or have experience of, a range of interests.
<P>
For the avoidance of doubt, I should clarify a point concerning the exchange with the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd. I have drawn on discussions with my Assembly colleague, Jonathan Morgan, and have seen the representations from Lord Roberts of Conwy, who is extremely experienced in Welsh educational issues.
<P>
I do not intend to prescribe to the Assembly the exact size of the council. The amendment was a well-intentioned attempt to spark a debate and to propose a slightly greater range of flexibility.  If I were to press an amendment to a vote, it would be consistent with the arguments to press not amendment No. 140--that is, to leave the lower limit at 10--but amendment No. 141, which would set the upper limit at 16. That would give wider scope for discretion to the Assembly.
<P>
If the measures do not work, the Assembly could come back to us for primary legislation. I am sure that the Minister would not welcome having to find time for that. It may also be the case that their recourse, should they require representation, would be to invent committees that were permissive rather than mandatory under the schedule, which would not be under the influence of this House. They would thus achieve their objectives by the back door.
<P>
Be that as it may, these have been useful exchanges and we have made some progress. Although we have not achieved all that we wanted to and we might not have given the Assembly all the discretion and flexibility that it would welcome, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
