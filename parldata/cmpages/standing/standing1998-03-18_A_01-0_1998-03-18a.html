</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power of certain local authorities to take steps to minimise generation of household, commercial or industrial waste</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I congratulate you, Dr. Clark, on your appointment to the Chair. Having worked on two contentious Bills during the past few weeks, it is unusual for me to sit in Committee and not witness controversy. I welcome the support that I have received. I also welcome the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), and thank her for her support.
<P>
As a new Member of Parliament, I welcome the opportunity to bring the Bill before the House. There was no debate on Second Reading, but similar Bills have been considered by the House in earlier sessions. Just over a year ago the Bill's predecessor, the Waste Prevention Bill, was debated in Committee and reported to the House. I have taken on board comments made by hon. Members at that time.
<P>
I pay tribute to hon. Members who have brought similar Bills before the House: my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) who is now the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) and the former hon. Member for Beckenham, Mr. Merchant. I extend special thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West for his support for this Bill.
<P>
The Bill has had several false starts, but support from both sides of the House should ensure its success today. I thank Committee members for their commitment and interest. There is a great deal of interest and expertise on environmental issues in the Committee, and the great and the good supporting the Bill have an excellent track record.
<P>
The Bill is enabling legislation for local authorities. They currently deal with waste that is produced, but they cannot necessarily stop that waste being produced. The average household produces more than 1 tonne of waste a year, and that demonstrates the extent of the problem. Currently 20 million tonnes of domestic waste are produced each year. Business and commercial enterprise produce even greater quantities of waste.
<P>
Recycling measures are important, but it is impossible to recycle all that waste. We need to practise re-use and take preventive measures.
<P>
The Bill has the support of the Women's Environmental Network, Friends of the Earth, Waste Watch, the Institute of Wastes Management and the Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee. Before I took on the Bill, I did not realise how much interest in waste there is in this country. Packaging Week has taken a great interest in the Committee's work and has been in regular contact with me, as has cardboard box monthly. [Laughter.] I hasten to add that I do not usually talk to such media, but I welcome their support.
<P>
I have been heartened by support from local authorities. The Bill does not impose a duty on local authorities, but encourages them to minimise the generation of waste. They have been very forthcoming. Ceredigion county council--forgive my Welsh--Newbury district council, Cotswold district council, Barry town council, Swindon borough council and Hove borough council have written in support of the Bill.
<P>
Somerset county councillors have been especially supportive. They have telephoned councillors in other parts of the country, encouraging them to support the Bill and take on board its measures. I have been heartened by the support of my own local authorities, Thurrock and Basildon district councils. Following a meeting of its environment committee, Basildon district council sent me a letter, stating that the
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the local authority--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``are encouraged that through your Bill, the Council, together with its partners will be able to further these initiatives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are fine words, and I am delighted that Basildon council wants to further the Bill's initiatives. However, what practical steps can councils take? I have examples that I hope other local authorities will also take on board.
<P>
The Bill will enable a number of steps to be taken. It will enable councils to start repair schemes for household appliances, which will also provide local employment and training. Local authorities will be able to enter into partnership or alliance with local businesses that provide services to help avoid wasteful products. Importantly, local authorities will be able to inform and advise local people on alternatives to wasteful products.
<P>
Local authorities will also be able to promote low waste restaurants, cafes and other businesses by giving them awards. That will encourage other businesses to follow suit, and I hope every local authority will adopt such practice.
<P>
Local authorities will also be able to promote the use of reusable cups, plates and cutlery at public events. That may sound frivolous, but it is an extremely important point given the amount of disposable cutlery and plates used at such events.
<P>
Local authorities will also be able to encourage people to re-use junk mail, and to inform companies and individuals how to stop receiving it. That will be welcomed by the many people whose letter boxes, like mine, are inundated with unsolicited junk mail.
<P>
The Bill is a reforming measure that should be seen in the context of a wider strategy to reduce waste in society as a whole, one which the Government and the public support. The Bill will assist local authorities to take specific action against, and to promote awareness of, waste. If the problem of waste is to be tackled, awareness must be raised. I commend the Bill to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Angela Eagle): I am pleased once more to serve with you, Dr. Clark, in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): And opposite me.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> And opposite the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
We do not always have the privilege of retaining a Chairman from previous Committees. So far, Mr. Clark, all the Committees in which I have participated have been chaired by you. I have, therefore, yet to discover the difference that a change of style can make.
<P>
The Government welcome the Bill's underlying principle. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) on the way in which she has pursued the Bill. It has had all-party support in the past, and I assume that it continues to do so, given that it is a sensible Bill which had an unopposed Second Reading.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon cited examples of the current level of waste creation. Many people do not realise the sheer volume of waste that they generate. My hon. Friend illustrated well the extent of the problem when she mentioned that each household currently generates more than 1 tonne of waste a year.
<P>
The domestic waste that currently goes into landfill sites could fill Lake Windermere every nine months. Landfill is an unsustainable method that reflects the thoughtlessness, lack of structure and lack of attention to detail currently prevailing in waste management. Countries that have progressed towards ecologically sensible waste management have proved that a large percentage of waste can be eliminated, recycled or reused rather than sent to landfill sites. There is considerable room for progress.
<P>
Some authorities try to educate households about waste minimisation, and that is essential if we are to tackle the problem effectively. However, many do not because the existing legislation is unclear. That is what my hon. Friend's admirable Bill seeks to put right. As she says, the Bill will not put a duty on local authorities to undertake this work but enable them to do it in a way which is much clearer and more obvious than the existing law.
<P>
Local action is obviously where the real difference will be made in tackling the problem, so we want to make it clear to local authorities that if they wish to promote waste minimisation in their areas they can do so. Clarification of local authority powers with regard to waste minimisation is necessary. It is important to promote that vital part of the waste strategy.
<P>
Clause 1 allows new section 63A to be inserted in the Environmental Protection Act 1990. New section 63A(1) provides relevant authority, in this case a local authority or a waste collection or waste disposal authority, with powers to minimise the generation of controlled waste. It would be up to the authority to decide whether to exercise such powers.
<P>
New section 63A(2) provides that if an authority decided to take such steps it must consult other authorities which are responsible for the same or part of the same geographical area in order to avoid the setting up of measures that run contrary to each other. It is important that the appropriate consultation is undertaken before any strategy is put in place. New section 63A(3) simply defines ``relevant authority''. The Government are content that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): The Liberal Democrats also support the Bill. I appreciate the kind remarks that the hon. Member for Basildon made about Somerset county council and the work that it has been doing. It is important that local authorities take their duties seriously when it comes to waste minimisation. They have an important role to play. The waste disposal and waste collection authorities are clearly at the heart of that.
<P>
The Bill's objectives are sensible and sound and will give an incentive and a push to those local authorities which perhaps need some encouragement to develop their policies much more effectively. The situation varies greatly throughout the United Kingdom. In my own waste disposal area of Greater Manchester some authorities are currently achieving 3 per cent. or less waste minimisation. Others are getting up towards 10 per cent. Yet local authorities in other parts of the country are achieving 20 per cent. and, internationally, figures approach 50 per cent. or more. There is clearly plenty of work to be done and plenty of activity to be encouraged.
<P>
I was delighted to hear the examples that the hon. Member for Basildon brought to the Committee, such as the possibility of giving advice and even the possibility of setting up small-scale enterprises for the renewal, repair and recycling of equipment. My constituency is fortunate to have the Furniture Station, which does an excellent job recycling furniture for those on very low incomes. It is a classic example of a way of ensuring that materials which might otherwise simply drop into a deep hole somewhere creating a problem can be used for the common good.
<P>
I hope that the Bill will also facilitate the setting up of schemes for returning packaging to retailers and give the public strong incentives to minimise the amount of packaging that they bring away from retail premises and then have to throw away. The Liberal Democrats are happy to support the Bill, and clause 1 in particular. I do not intend to detain the Committee. The Bill has broad all-party support and the sooner that it passes into law the better.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee but I thought that it was important simply to put on record that clause 3 not only cites the name of the Bill, which will be the Waste Minimisation Act 1998, but states that it shall not extend to Northern Ireland. That is not because of any lack of willingness to create waste minimisation strategies in Northern Ireland, but simply because part II of the Environment Protection Act 1990 which the Bill seeks to amend does not extend to Northern Ireland either. The Northern Ireland Office has already started looking at appropriate strategies for that part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
