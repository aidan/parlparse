							<a name="08012372000449"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> It is a pleasure to see you back in the Chair, Sir
John. We thought that we would change the shift on our Front Bench for
the afternoon as
well.</div>
					<a name="08012372000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
looks at the means by which applications for development consent can be
dealt with. We are moving on to part 4, which deals with the question
of the requirement for development consent. This group of amendments
addresses an issue that the Government have still not got right: the
existence of parallel regimes. We discussed the matter earlier today,
but we are still not convinced that the Government understand the
potential
difficulty.</div>
					<a name="08012372000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would change the wording from saying that
consent &#147;is required&#148; under the infrastructure planning
commission procedure, to saying that it &#147;may be applied
for&#148;. The reason for tabling it is to tease out from the
Government further comment on how they see the two regimes sitting
together. Amendments Nos. 257 to 259 are consequential amendments and I
need not go into too much detail. Essentially, they follow on from
those changes in subsequent parts of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012372000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there are
going to be two regimes, the Government should either rule national
infrastructure projects out completely or there should be a measure of
flexibility for the applicant. Which is it to be? If we take the route
that we have suggested and use the Bill to separate policy statements
from site-specific elements, the logic suggests that everything should
go through a single consent regime. The reasons for that have already
been rehearsed and I will not repeat them. We are in favour 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>of that, but we seem to be in the position that duplicate regimes will
exist. Do I take it that anything that falls within
the category of nationally significant infrastructure projects will
automatically be dealt with under the single consent regime and also by
the IPC? Clarity on that is important for people. Some of the evidence
that we heard expressed concern about the two regimes. We would like
the Government to spell it out. The amendment is not intended to wreck,
but to find a more constructive way
forward.</div>
					<a name="08012372000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
without trespassing too much, Sir John, I may mention amendment No. 9,
which is in the next group, because it is part of the overall picture.
I will try to keep in order by saying that we will find that a
subsequent amendment also relates to our alternative approach. First,
the scheme will work best if there is a clear
separation between national policy and site-specific elements.
Secondly, that could be achieved without the need for the large and
cumbersome bureaucracy of the IPC. My hon. Friend the Member for
Beckenham has already rehearsed the reasons for that. It could be done
by adapting the Planning Inspectorate and the role of the High Court in
dealing with issues of fact and the construction of statutory matters.
Those are well-established routes and that separation of areas could be
used to cut down repetition and the lengthy
cross-examination of inquiries. We will return to that matter
in more detail
later.</div>
					<a name="08012372000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
are not complex, but I would like to hear exactly
where the Ministers are going with regard to single consent or
otherwise. If two regimes are to be in existence, the temptation will
be for someone to argue the toss as to whether they are caught by the
national infrastructure regime, or whether they should make an
application under the existing
rules.</div>
					<a name="08012372000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
see the point that it will, generally, be in the applicant&#146;s
interest, if he has multiple applications, to go under the national
infrastructure regime. But one can think of circumstances in which the
project&#151;we will return to the definition of that later&#151;
might simply be one discrete piece of development that would require
only one application. In that regard, looking at some of the other
elements of fees and other matters that we will come on to later, there
may be circumstances in which there is a temptation for the applicant
to say, &#147;Actually, I would rather go under the old
route&#148;. That may seem unlikely, but it is possible. We would
like what is in and what is out of the regime to be clear, and I hope
that the Minister can help us on
that.</div>
					<a name="08012372000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000450"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim
Fitzpatrick):
						</b> It is a pleasure to see you back in the
Chair this afternoon, Sir John. Allow me to add my welcome to your
return. I have not had the opportunity to welcome you to presiding at
all so far in Committee, and it is nice to see you
back.</div>
					<a name="08012372000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also welcome
the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst to his place. A West Ham
double act means that perhaps we can get back on to some football
anecdotes, and get away from some of the Scottish questions, although I
am not sure that that will be wholly
achievable.</div>
					<a name="08012372000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
ask the Committee, with the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, to
reject the amendments. They remove an obligation on
promoters of nationally significant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>infrastructure projects to seek developing consent under the new single
consent regime. Instead, promoters would be given the opportunity to
seek consent for their project, either under the single consent regime
or under any of the existing regimes. That would have the effect of
substantially reducing the benefits of the new single consent regime,
as well as potentially confusing both promoters and the wider public as
to the steps that must be gone through in order to proceed with an
application.</div>
					<a name="08012372000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were the
amendments accepted, the result would be that promoters of nationally
significant infrastructure projects could continue to apply under the
current multiplicity of consent regimes, thereby providing none
of the benefits of the single consent regime to
promoters and the public. Such applications would not go through the
procedure set out in the Bill, which is a substantial improvement on
the current planning system, particularly, as we have discussed on a
number of occasions, at the pre-application and examination stages. The
legal test for deciding such applications would be that set out in the
consent regime chosen. As a result, the primary consideration for such
applications would not necessarily be Government policy in relation to
the particular infrastructure, as set out in the form of a policy
statement that had been subject to parliamentary
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="08012372000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
approach adopted in the Bill is better. Infrastructure projects of
national significance should be determined through a national planning
body, and through a single application for order-granting development
consent, rather than through a handful of applications to different
bodies for different partial consents. Decisions on nationally
significant infrastructure projects should be made in accordance with
appropriate national policy statements that have been subject to
thorough consultation, unless there are very good reasons not to do so.
Similarly, we believe that applications for NSIPs would benefit from
the pre-application requirements that we have set out in the single
consent regime. The benefits of those will be lost if promoters can
choose to avoid them by going down an alternative
route.</div>
					<a name="08012372000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude, the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked whether the
Government should rule out NSIPs from existing regimes; that is exactly
what the Bill does. Clause 29 prevents any existing regime requirements
from being required for NSIPs. No order on a nationally significant
infrastructure project can be made under existing regimes either, with
the exception of Welsh offshore wind farms, which we discussed this
morning. If a project is an NSIP, it must go through the single consent
regime. On that basis, I recommend that the Committee reject the
amendment, if the hon. Gentleman insists on pressing it to a
vote.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000451"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I will not press the
amendment to a vote, but I hope that he will make clear on Report in
precisely what circumstances, if any, it is envisaged that leaving the
existing regime in place will achieve something. If clause 29 has the
desired effect, are we clear that it is set out
unequivocally so that no one will be tempted to go down that
route?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000452"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> We are leaving the existing regime in place
because there will be applications for planning permission that will
not be NSIPs and therefore the existing legislation will be
required.</div>

							<a name="08012372000453"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I appreciate that part, but I was

ambiguity in that
regard.</div>

						<a name="08012372000454"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Jacqui Lait</b> (Beckenham) (Con): I still think that there is
one area that we need to look at. The legislation that was set up for
that is now quite elderly and it would therefore be logical and in the
interests of better regulation if the Government were to move the
remainder of those bits of legislation into the planning system under
the Town and Country Planning Acts, rather than having separate Acts
under the control of what was the Department of Trade and
Industry.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000455"></a>Robert

						</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point and, in
the interests of co-operation and clarity, I will endeavour to speak
sufficiently slowly to enable those advising the Minister to get the
note to him, as I am sure that he will want to help us in that regard.
The issue of clarity is important and I hope that we will be able to
deal with it adequately.</div>
					<a name="08012372000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister feels that that is
enough. I am grateful to him and have given him that chance, but if we
are unhappy we will return to the matter on Report. At this stage,
however, perhaps we will regard what he and I have
said as the same outcome as Saturday&#146;s Manchester City game,
1-1, and I will withdraw the amendment; and I apologise, Sir John, for
the Bournemouth and Southend game. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

							<a name="08012372000459"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I ask the Committee to reject
amendments Nos. 9, 164 and 10 and adopt Government
amendments Nos. 340, 360 and 361. The Bill currently provides that when
there is doubt as to whether a project requires development consent,
the commission will decide the question. The amendments tabled by
Opposition Members would only be relevant in a case 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>in which a promoter submits an application for a project whose capacity
is closer to the threshold set out in clauses 13 to 26.</div>
					<a name="08012372000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current clause would allow
the IPC to decide whether the proposed development
meets the thresholds to be constituted a nationally significant
infrastructure project. We agree a mechanism for determining whether a
project meets the threshold of being an NSIP is necessary, and believe
that the IPC will be best placed to analyse the proposals set out by a
promoter and to decide whether the project falls within the specified
thresholds. We take that view because of the technical expertise that
will be available to it and because it will handle such applications
regularly.</div>
					<a name="08012372000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question of whether a proposed development meets the thresholds in
order to be a nationally significant infrastructure project is
primarily a matter of fact. As such, we do not believe that the High
Court should be involved at that stage. There will be a right of
recourse to the High Court at the appropriate stage of proceedings as
set out in clause 104. Amendment No. 10 provides that the High Court
itself be able to issue an order granting development consent, and we
do not consider that to be appropriate either.</div>
					<a name="08012372000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
what I have said, the Government are not content with clause 27 as it
stands. We believe that decisions on whether an application requires
development consent should take place earlier in the process. Leaving
those questions until they are raised could lead to both considerable
uncertainty for promoters and objectors and potentially nugatory work.
Instead, the Government propose an amendment to clause 49 to
allow the IPC to take those decisions earlier in the
preparation of an application. Amendment No. 360 provides that when the
commission receives an application purporting to be for an order
granting development consent, it may only accept the application if it
concludes within 28 days that development consent is required for all
or some of the development contained in the application.</div>
					<a name="08012372000410"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012372000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
that period the commission will need to consider whether, for example,
the proposed development meets the threshold set out in relation to
NSIPs. It would check, along with other matters, that the application
complies with the rules regarding the content and form of an
application and the standards set out in clause 32(5), and that the
applicant has complied with the pre-application procedures. As a
result, clause 27(2) is no longer needed; amendment No. 340 therefore
deletes the subsection. On that basis, I recommend that the Committee
reject the Opposition amendments. I commend to the Committee the
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Minister for Local
Government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000460"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 were primarily tabled as
part of our overall scheme for an alternative that would use the
Planning Inspectorate and the High Court as the means, rather than
having to create the IPC. I need not repeat that point. I appreciate
that the votes have not been with us so far on that, but the point is
made for consistency. The Ministers know that our concerns about the
principle remain, and that will be referred to in due course.</div>

					<a name="08012372000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue of concern,
particularly in relation to amendment No. 9, is whether it will be
practical and appropriate for the IPC to act to some degree as judge
and jury under those circumstances. It may be that
expertise can be made available&#151;that comes back to the point
made earlier about the importance of a proper range of expertise within
the IPC, so that the issues can be dealt with. I appreciate that
sometimes these will be questions of fact, but to use the jargon, they
are often mixed questions of fact and law, which have historically been
decided through the courts. It is therefore important that there is
adequate legal membership of the commission, as well as adequate
representation of other professionals, to ensure that there is a legal
input. Otherwise, we might have to hire some expensive lawyers, the
very thought of which will make the Government blanch, to ensure that
the decision is legally watertight.</div>

Minister&#146;s observations about his own changes to the Bill, and
his bringing forward those issues, are welcome. I am glad that the
discussion until now has managed to highlight those issues. Clearly, it
is right, in the interests of speed and efficiency, that as much as
possible is dealt with at the pre-application and earlier stage, so
that the issues in dispute are narrowed down for any hearing, whatever
form that takes, which we will debate later. I think that that is
common ground among all members of the Committee and virtually
everybody who has expressed an interest in the Bill, whether
professional or lay. We understand that clause 10 was put in place to
try to save time under such circumstances, but given the
Minister&#146;s comments and having flagged up the issue, we are
content at this stage to withdraw our
amendments.</div>

Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I join other hon. Members
in welcoming you back to the Chair, Sir John. I rise to speak to
amendment No. 164, which I have tabled. Along similar lines to the hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, I had concerns about the commission
deciding whether or not it should consider an
application, and felt that it might be more appropriate for that
decision to be a matter for the Secretary of State. However, the
Government amendment that deletes that provision is an alternative and
it reassures us that the Bill is watertight enough and that these
matters will fall within the scope of the Bill, so there will not need
to be a decision by the commission. On that basis, I am happy to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

the same as is currently the case in the Town and Country Planning Act
1990. Subsection (2) adds two further categories of works which should
be considered development: the conversion of a power station&#146;s
fuel source and starting to use underground strata for the purposes of
gas storage. Amendments Nos. 143 and 144 amend the clause so that
development will also include starting to use underground cavities for
the purpose of gas storage. That is a technical change to ensure that

referred to the Secretary of State. It is not appropriate to remove the

to safety conditions may not also be given in relation to that project.
A notice under section 16(1) of the 1965 Act is issued by the Secretary
of State and imposes safety conditions on the development or operation
of an underground gas storage facility. It also applies to gas storage
facilities that have received a consent by means of an order under

automatically the case that notices about safety conditions under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>section 16(1) of the 1965 Act cannot be made for gas storage facilities

1992 Act. Provisions of the 1992 Act have been devolved to Welsh
Ministers for projects based entirely in Wales. Welsh Ministers have
made an order under the 1992 Act for an offshore wind farm at
Scarweather Sands. In order to preserve the devolution settlement,
these amendments are needed to allow Welsh Ministers to use the 1992
Act to consent to offshore wind farms in territorial waters adjoining

the Secretary of State with a power, in such cases, to direct that
certain requirements of the Bill are modified in relation to the
proposed development, or are to be treated as having been complied
with. The ability to modify the Bill&#146;s requirements in relation
to an application, or to deem that such requirements have been
satisfied, is essential. If it did not exist it would mean that a
promoter could 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>be required to re-do all the work
involved in the pre-application stage simply because the Secretary of
State directed the case after the application was submitted to the
local planning authority. That is not to say that further work to the
application would not be needed on the part of the promoter. Indeed, in
many cases it will be necessary for a promoter to alter an application
so that it becomes an application for an order granting development
consent. An example of that might be rewording the application to fit
the format of an order, as set out in clause 32.</div>
					<a name="08012372000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The promoter may also need to
engage more fully with the IPC and local communities under part 5, to
reflect the revised application more fully. To that end, there is no
obligation on the Secretary of State to include the provisions in
clause 30(2)(c) in a direction referring the case to
the IPC. Nevertheless, the principle should remain that a promoter
should not be unreasonably penalised through having to do additional
work because the Secretary of State has decided that an application
made in good faith to a local planning authority should be referred to
the IPC.</div>

						</b> There is one question on which I would like the
Minister to be a little more specific. Does he anticipate circumstances
in which&#151;perhaps he will give a practical
example&#151;an application has commenced under the Town and Country
Planning Acts regime, but it fits the nationally significant
infrastructure projects criteria and the power of direction will have
to be used? He said that clause 29 means that anything that comes
within the national infrastructure projects criteria will have to be
commenced under that regime. Perhaps it is my fault, but I am
struggling to understand the circumstances in which a project might
commence outside the regime but could subsequently be brought under it.
Is it a question of size thresholds? We are concerned that the measure
has the potential for mission creep as far as the IPC is concerned.
Will the Minister explain a little more about the rationale behind the
measure?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000491"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> Further to that question from my hon. Friend, I
note that the provisions apply in England only and not in Wales. Will
the Minister explain why a similar power is not given to Welsh
Ministers to make the direction that the Secretary of State can make in
England? The normal mantra is that the Government are reluctant to
disturb the devolution settlement but, if anything, such a provision
would enhance and strengthen the devolution settlement. Given that the
thrust of the legislation is to streamline and generally to speed up
the processes involved with consent application, there is no good
reason why an equivalent power should not be devolved to Welsh
Ministers.</div>

							<a name="08012372000492"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. It
looks like there is an inconsistency but, having devolved the power to
Welsh Ministers, it is for them to make a judgment call. We discussed
that only a few moments ago, and the position is that they have used
the power under the 1992 Act or the 1989 Act and they will make a
judgment on what is appropriate for Wales. I apologise for saying that
the settlement allows them to do that&#151;we do not intend to
disturb the settlement because it is working very well. It would be a
matter for them to judge an application as to which direction they
recommend.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>
					<a name="08012372000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State would use the power mentioned by the hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst only in rare circumstances and on the basis of clear
criteria. There might be a situation in which a series of proposed
projects that are individually beneath the thresholds collectively
represent a nationally significant project. For example, a series of
offshore wind farms might be below the 100 MW limit individually, but
above the limit when taken together. Directing such applications to the
IPC would allow a better examination of the collective benefits and
impacts of such a project.</div>
					<a name="08012372000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of
the White Paper consultation, we questioned whether it was appropriate
for Ministers to be able to specify projects for consideration by the
IPC by means of a direction, and a large majority of those who
commented on the proposal believed that it was appropriate as long as
the power was used sparingly and on the basis of clear
criteria.</div>

						</b> I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I
am wrong, but my reading of the clause is that there is provision for
the Secretary of State to step in and take something away from a local
authority and take it to the IPC. We are concerned that, although the
Bill has already set out in what circumstances that should happen,
there is an extra facility for the Secretary of State to do so. The
amendment seeks to probe the Government on this issue. We have heard
why they feel that this power is needed, but I am yet to be convinced
that we should allow the Secretary of State further powers to remove
things from local authority consideration and give them to the
IPC.</div>
					<a name="08012372000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Minister was not leading for the Government when we debated the
IPC, he will know that there is considerable concern among all
Opposition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>parties about whether the provision is necessary. Having passed that
part of the Bill, we are concerned that the IPC will gather in more
powers or that more applications will go to it than necessary.
Amendments Nos. 165 and 239 were tabled to test the Government on which
measures it is appropriate to remove from local authorities and give to
the IPC. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me that this
power will not be used very
often.</div>

							<a name="08012372000498"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> May I refer to amendment No. 260 in
this group? I understand the point that the hon.
Member for North Cornwall made about his amendments. Our amendment
makes a slightly different point, but I do not disagree with his
observations. We are trying to seek clarity about definitions in this
part of the Bill. As we observed when we started discussing this part
of the Bill, the meaning of &#147;development&#148;&#151;a
well-known phrase for all who are involved in these matters&#151;is
sensibly restated in clause 28 as being defined in the normal Town and
Country Planning Act terms. We are intrigued as to why it is
appropriate to move away from the normal test for development, which
requires planning permission, to something else, which is called
&#147;a project&#148; and requires development consent. What is the
difference in practical and legal terms between a
development and a project? If something is a project, does
that not automatically involve development? What is the
distinction?</div>
					<a name="08012372000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Clwyd, West raised the further
issue of whether the Minister was saying&#151;and it seemed to be the
case&#151;that a number of adjacent areas of development can amount
to a project. Who is to decide that? Are they not individual projects?
Are they not all developments? It is not entirely clear why the
Government chose to use the word, &#147;project&#148;, which is a
novel term to bring into the legislation, as opposed to
&#147;development&#148;, which is tried and tested as far as the
courts and all those involved in planning are
concerned.</div>

to take the matter to the
court?</div>

						</b> I am grateful&#151;I think&#151;to my hon.
Friend for that intervention. The Minister said that we are working as
a team and team members are always keen to test each other&#146;s
mettle, as my hon. Friend&#146;s question
shows.</div>
					<a name="08012372000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give an
example. Many people would refer to the Thames
Gateway as a project, but it is clearly a series of developments. I
hope that nobody would pretend that the developments at Barking Reach
at the London end of the gateway are part of the same project, for
planning law purposes, as the development of the port facilities at
Shell Haven or a barrage at Sheerness, if one is ever to be built.
People might argue&#151;and it is common parlance for the man in the
street&#151;that they are part of the Thames Gateway project, but
they are all significant developments in their own right, and some of
them could qualify as nationally significant infrastructure projects.
That is one example of a negative application of the term,
&#147;project&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>
					<a name="08012372000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The implication is that a
project involves more than one piece of development. I can see that
that might work if multiple consents are required&#151;for instance,
when we deal with a pipeline to a refinery or an energy
plant&#151;but that seems the only sensible reason for using the
provision, which would allow all the consents to be rolled up together.
I would be grateful if the Minister would amplify that point, because
there is a risk of confusion in the public&#146;s mind. I do not
think that that was the Government&#146;s intention&#151;and I am
sure that they had a lot of advice from lawyers on the use of the
&#147;project&#148;&#151;but because the term is a novel
departure, I would be grateful for a clear justification for its use
before some of my erstwhile colleagues find themselves extremely busy
litigating on the
definitions.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>With respect, I urge the Committee to
reject the amendment. We believe that amendments Nos. 165 and 239 go
together. They are intended to remove the need for the Secretary of
State to be satisfied that a project that is the subject of an
application to a body other than the commission is of national
significance before directing it to the IPC. We are not sure why hon.
Members believe that that is a good idea, because there seems to be
little justification for calling in small projects from local
authorities for a decision by a national body. As the Committee knows,
we intend the single consents regime to be reserved for the biggest and
most important infrastructure projects. Only projects of national
significance should go through that regime. Others are best decided by
local planning
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012372000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 260 would require the Secretary of State to be satisfied about the
national significance of a &#147;development&#148;, rather
than a &#147;project&#148;, before directing an application to the
IPC. Again, with respect to the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst, we believe that it is not necessary. The single consents
regime will work on the basis of projects being nationally significant,
as can be seen in clause 27(1). Development consent will be required
for development</div>

The Secretary of State might make a direction in such terms if he or
she was satisfied that work already done while making an application to
the authority would substantially satisfy the requirements in the Bill
on pre-application consultation in chapter 2 of part 5. That works on
the principle that a promoter should not be unreasonably penalised
through having to do additional work because the Secretary of State has
decided that an application made in good faith to a local planning
authority should be referred to the IPC. I commend the amendments to
the
Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000513"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> This debate relates to one of the most important
issues in the Bill. I have had help with some of the drafting from the
Campaign to Protect Rural England. On some aspects of the Bill, I am
much more enthusiastic and sympathetic to the Government&#146;s
approach than perhaps the CPRE is. Nevertheless, on the issue of who
should make the final decision on an application that is being
considered by the commission, I have come to a different view from that
of Ministers. The amendment, therefore, together with
other amendments that relate to later clauses, but are necessary for a
consistency of approach, would substitute the Secretary of State for
the commission as the final decision maker, as is the case under
current town and country planning legislation.</div>
					<a name="08012372000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
fundamental issue of accountability. The decisions that will be made
concerning major projects will be major, which is why we are setting up
a new procedure for dealing with national infrastructure projects. By
their very nature, they are important matters. More than one individual
in the commission will ultimately make the decision, but it is
important that individuals are accountable, at least to an extent. They
must be accountable in the sense that hon. Members know who they are. I
doubt that many people could name a single member of the Planning
Inspectorate, and I am sure that once we have a commission and the
commissioners have been appointed, not many people in the House will
know who any of them are. We know who the Secretary of State is,
however, and we know who the Ministers are, if a Minister makes the
ultimate decision because the Secretary of State has a particular
conflict of interest under current legislation. The Secretary of State
can be held to account in a number of ways: a debate in the House;
written questions; and oral questions. The general methods that the
House uses to hold Ministers to account can be used to hold them to
account for decisions on matters that would be considered and
recommended by the commission.</div>
					<a name="08012372000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that while
Parliament will eventually approve a national policy statement, in the
end it will be the commission that interprets that policy statement to
decide whether a particular application should be
approved. Therefore, ultimately, it should be a
politician who makes the final decision on whether the interpretation
by the commission is correct. I know that the response 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>will be that in such cases Ministers act in a quasi-judicial manner, not
as politicians, and I accept that. Under existing planning legislation,
Ministers act in not a purely political way, but a quasi-judicial
way&#151;there is a difference. Nevertheless, they can still be held
to account to explain how they have acted. That decision cannot be
voted on in the House, a Minister cannot be second-guessed, and a
Secretary of State&#146;s view cannot be challenged by tabling an
amendment to it, but at least the Secretary of State is can respond
across the Dispatch Box in the Chamber, or by replying to a
parliamentary question, and give reasons for a decision in a way that a
commission cannot.</div>
					<a name="08012372000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be interesting to hear from the Minister precisely how the
commission might be accountable. If a Member tables a question asking
for reasons why a particular decision has been reached, will the
Secretary of State answer it, or will it be passed on
to the commission? How can a commission answer a parliamentary
question? We have struggled sometimes, when dealing with agencies, to
get questions actually responded to properly. Some of those decisions
will be very important, such as where a nuclear power station is
located or whether one should be located in a particular place at all.
We need to understand the nature of
accountability.</div>
					<a name="08012372000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
great respect for my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government. He
has taken the matters that have been raised very
seriously. However, the Government must understand that it is not only
groups such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England that have
concerns. Many of my colleagues on this side of the Committee also
share this type of concern.</div>
					<a name="08012372000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I ask my colleagues who are
not fortunate enough to be members of the Committee for their
impressions about what the Bill does, they say that it takes away
accountability from politicians and passes it to a quango. However, it
is a fact that there are good things about the Bill, such as the
attempt to take major decisions on major infrastructure projects by
using a better process&#151;I believe that it is a better process.
The fact that it is often characterised as being undemocratic is
largely down to the fact that the Secretary of State is removed from
the process at the end.</div>
					<a name="08012372000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012372000514"></a>
							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth)
(Lab/Co-op): My hon. Friend makes a good
case in his examination of what the Government propose. I look forward
to hearing the Minister for Local Government&#146;s reply. However,
is part of the problem the fact that advice to Ministers is often
excessively inhibiting in terms of the application of common sense? I
say that with the experience of having had to make decisions on
planning appeals, when sometimes the advice of officials was that one
could not even look at the application in proper terms. Therefore,
something more clinical that allows the application of judgment within
a context set by Ministers might be a way of reintroducing common sense
into the examination of such matters.</div>
					<a name="08012372000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000515"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I bow to my right hon. Friend&#146;s greater
knowledge. He has been on the inside track and has been responsible for
some of the decisions that Ministers have to take. That proposal would
take my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>amendment further. I am talking about not the basis on which decisions
are made, but who actually makes them. He goes one stage further and
asks whether, if a Secretary of State makes a decision, that decision
should be made on a different basis&#151;a less quasi-judicial basis,
and a more common-sense basis, as he would term
it.</div>
					<a name="08012372000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000516"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> Two aspects concern me. One is that
the degree of detail regarding a major or serious
application might require such an enormous amount of commitment from
Ministers that the situation would be rendered almost impractical. The
other is about the sort of advice that tends to become excessively
protective about what might be said about how a decision has been
taken. That constricts the process with which Ministers have to engage
at present when dealing with detailed and complex
applications.</div>
					<a name="08012372000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000517"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I take that point, and I also accept the
point about the amount of information that the
Secretary of State would have to consider. There are obvious time
constraints, but that applies some pressure to limit the number of
projects that go through the process. Most of us are keen to see that
there should not be an open house for a large number of
projects.</div>
					<a name="08012372000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the number of decisions, Secretaries of State will, of course, have
to take such decisions on a range of issues that have gone into the
planning appeal system. They will not be kept out of decisions on
planning matters. The slight irony is that Secretaries of State will
make decisions on all sorts of relatively small projects, but not the
biggest ones. Today we have looked at the nature of the projects that
will go through the new process. Essentially, when we go through
clauses 13 to 26&#151;I am giving a quick r(c)sum(c)
here&#151;small projects go through the traditional planning route,
and larger ones take the new route through to the IPC. The same
projects will be considered, but some will be large and some will be
small. In many cases, the small projects will end up with the Secretary
of State and the large ones will not. There is something strange about
a situation in which the smaller and less important a project is, the
more likely it is that Ministers will be
involved.</div>
				
					<a name="08012372000414"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012372000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
the intervention of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South
and Penarth about the basis on which decisions are made, Secretaries of
State can come to a different view from inspectors under the current
planning regime. That is presumably because they can look at things in
a different way. During the evidence hearings, we had a good discussion
about the expertise that commissioners would need. One thing that they
need is an understanding of how the public regard things. That is not
the most important matter in planning decisions, but Secretaries of
State appear to be more able to apply a wider understanding of matters
than planning inspectors when reaching
decisions.</div>
					<a name="08012372000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
case in point that Brighton and Hove Albion football club probably
would not be looking forward to a new ground if the decision had not
gone through the Secretary of State. I am sure that the Secretary of
State made that decision in an entirely proper manner, but came to a
different decision from the planning inspector. I was in Snowdonia
national park last year 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>and saw the reopening of an old railway line. My understanding, again,
is that the Secretary of State&#151;the Deputy Prime Minister at that
time&#151;overturned the inspector&#146;s
decision. That railway line will be a major tourist attraction and an
advantage to the area, but it would not have reopened if the planning
inspector&#146;s decision had stood. The Secretary of State saw the
matter in a slightly wider and rounder
context.</div>
					<a name="08012372000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers can
come to a proper view and they hold a role that is
different from that of the planning inspector, due to their particular
knowledge and experience. They come to decisions that are, presumably,
also different to those that a commission would make. There are
examples of when having the involvement of a Secretary of State proved
beneficial. I am sure that Ministers will not say that the decisions of
those Secretaries of State were wrong. If they were right, surely there
is an advantage in having them in that role. I will not take up too
much of the Committee&#146;s time, but these are important
matters.</div>
					<a name="08012372000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have heard the counter-argument that it is wrong for Secretaries of
State to take decisions because they can be the applicant and the
eventual determiner of the application, but that is not true in most
cases. I would be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Minister say
how many of the cases that will go to the IPC are likely to have the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government as the
applicant. We had a good discussion on clause 13 and I got assurances
that even new examples of projects would fall within the categories
listed under clause 13(5)(a) to (e): energy, transport, water, waste
water and waste. My understanding is that even if the applicant were a
Secretary of State, in those cases, they would be the Secretary of
State for Transport, the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform, or the Secretary of State for Environment, Food
and Rural
Affairs.</div>
					<a name="08012372000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite
possibly, the Secretary of State would not be the applicant at all,
because while they would be responsible for the national policy
statement on nuclear power stations, for example, it would be likely
that a private company would be the applicant. In how many cases is it
likely that the applicant will be the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local
Government?</div>
					<a name="08012372000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000518"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful case and I
agree with his point. Perhaps he might also consider that his logic is
reinforced, while that of those who object to his amendment is
undermined, by the situation in London. The Mayor of London was given
planning powers through the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Some of
us made the objection that the Mayor might find himself as the judge of
a matter in which he was the applicant and the promoter. The Government
took the stance that that was not a problem because it was highly
unlikely that the Mayor himself would ever be the applicant, and it was
more likely that the applicant would be Transport for London, which is
part of the empire that he controls, but not
him.</div>
					<a name="08012372000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State for Transport is far less directly controlled by the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government than Transport
for London is by the Mayor. If such an argument was valid for the
Greater London authority, it is even more valid in this instance. I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will take that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>argument as something that reinforces his point. There is a precedent of
the Government conceding to his
argument.</div>
					<a name="08012372000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000519"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I take that intervention as reinforcing my
point, subject to anything that my hon. Friend the
Minister might say to correct it. I will take the argument at face
value.</div>
					<a name="08012372000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under existing
planning law, it is possible for the Secretary of
State to be the applicant and the determiner. It is quite possible for
the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to put in a
planning application for a new office building, an alteration to an
existing office building, or any other project. However, just because
the Secretary of State could be the applicant under current planning
legislation, and will remain the applicant for all but major projects
and the determiner in such circumstances in the future, we should not
amend the whole of existing planning law and remove the Secretary of
State as the final arbiter for appeals within that legislation.
Because, for the occasional project, a Secretary of State could be the
applicant and the determiner, is there really a case for removing the
Secretary of State, in every circumstance, from being the final arbiter
on these most important projects?</div>
					<a name="08012372000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that the case has been made for why these major projects should be
treated differently from every other appeal on every smaller planning
application that is made. If the fundamental argument is that the
Secretary of State should not be the applicant and the determiner, in
how many cases, realistically, will the Secretary of State be the
applicant? Probably one, occasionally, out of the 40-odd that will be
appear before the commission each year. If that is the only reason
behind the approach, for all other reasons&#151;accountability, the
general view that is taken of the Bill, consistency, and the fact that
the Secretary of State just might bring to bear a different viewpoint
that might occasionally mean that a decision of the commission is
changed&#151;I hope that my amendment will be given careful
consideration.</div>

							<a name="08012372000520"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on
tabling the amendment and on putting forward an
extremely cogent and powerful case. It is hard to say much more than
that my hon. Friends and I agree with it. The case is compelling. I
urge Ministers to think again about this because it harks back to the
concern that many of us have expressed almost from the beginning of our
consideration of the Bill. The good in the Bill&#151;the idea of the
separation of national policy from the consideration of specific sites
to save time at inquiries, and the virtue of the single consent
regime&#151;could all be undermined by a lack of public confidence
arising from an ultimate lack of accountability.</div>
					<a name="08012372000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the public&#146;s point
of view, it is desirable that the decision maker should be capable of
being put on the spot. That is precisely the point that the hon.
Gentleman made. The Minister, even acting quasi-judicially, can be put
on the spot in this House. If Ministers get a reputation and it is
perceived by the public and, let us be blunt, by the Prime Minister and
others, that they are too often put on the spot, they will not remain
Ministers for much longer. There is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>discipline on Ministers, when exercising even quasi-judicial powers, to
make sure that they get things right because they can be put on the
spot either by hon. Members or in the courts.</div>
					<a name="08012372000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will
also be a professional discipline on members of the IPC to get it
right, but the big difference will be the public perception of whether
that discipline is exercised clearly and transparently. We can have as
much confidence as we would hope that members of the IPC will get
things right, but that is not the same as the fact that the ultimate
arbiter is someone who is elected. Ultimately, if we dislike a decision
enough, we can kick out the person who reached it or their party. When
we are talking about decisions that profoundly affect the lives of
those immediately concerned, that seems to be right and proper, which
is why we strongly support the amendment moved by the hon. Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe and hope to have a chance to vote for
it.</div>
					<a name="08012372000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments in this group are less ambitious in scope, but if, for any
reason, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment does not succeed, we will
want to return to them. If one looks at subsequent clauses in the Bill
that are linked to this, such as clause 66, one sees that there is a
dangerous circumstance in which it will be possible for the commission
effectively to disapply certain legislation when making its decisions.
The point of our amendments is to address that and change it
consistently throughout the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012372000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 206 and 207 set
out the scheme of what we are seeking to do. They
would insert in clause 66 a new subsection (1A) so that if it was
proposed that a development consent order would apply, modify or
exclude legislation&#151;that power will reside with the
IPC&#151;such cases should be decided by not the IPC, but the
Secretary of State. It seems to us that that represents a more middle
view than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment. Even if the Government
persisted in giving the ultimate power of decision to the IPC, it
cannot be right constitutionally, never mind in terms of
accountability, for an unelected and unaccountable body to have the
power to apply, modify or exclude legislation that has been passed by
the House. The decision to exclude or modify legislation passed by the
House should be taken only by someone who can be put on the spot in
this House and who is directly accountable to it, and that means the
Secretary of State. I hope that the Committee will go further by
accepting the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument that that should apply
across the board, but we think that the power is a striking example of
how transparency and democratic accountability will be seriously
undermined if we leave the provision as it
is.</div>

						</b> I support the comments made by the hon. Member
for Sheffield, Attercliffe, who raised a question
that concerns many Members in the Committee and others in the House.
The ultimate test will be when constituents come to us regarding one of
these applications and ask what the next stage is and how things will
work. They will be surprised to find that, ultimately, the decision
does not rest with the Secretary of State, which is what they are
accustomed to. The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst also made
some strong points in that regard.</div>

							<a name="08012372000522"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> I want to challenge one of the points that was
made by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst.
He said that the pressure in the current system is pressure on
Ministers to get things right, but I suggest that that is not actually
true. The pressure on Ministers is to play safe and anticipate the
legal challenges that might arise if they do not get the procedure
right. That is an inhibition, rather than an encouragement to come up
with the right decision, and that is why, along with one other issue
that I shall address in a moment, there is a need to reconsider how we
have been doing things up to now.</div>
					<a name="08012372000415"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08012372000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe rightly referred to the decision
taken by my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East
(Mr. Prescott), the former Deputy Prime Minister, to reopen
a railway in north
Wales.</div>
				
					<a name="08012372000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remember that application and the discussion around it particularly
well&#151;not just because I am a north Walian and I know that part
of that county, but because I was Secretary of State for Wales at the
time and followed the deliberations and the decision of the then Deputy
Prime Minister with great interest. I think that he made the right
decision, but it was also a decision that took a certain amount of
courage because, as my hon. Friend said, a Secretary of State took a
different decision to that recommended by an inspector. Indeed, the
opinions on both sides of that particular debate were very strong
indeed. Rather than taking the courageous step of re-examining the
issue and trying to make the right decision, the easy option would have
been to say, &#147;I will do what the inspector says because that is
the safe option and no one can criticise me for it&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012372000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest to
the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that the pressures in the
system actually relate to safety. Another type of inhibition that
Ministers may face is the way in which actions can be misinterpreted.
When I was Secretary of State for Wales there was an application where
the pros and cons did not make sense on paper, and I was advised by
officials not to visit the site because it would be interpreted as
becoming involved with the details. In that particular case, the
argument was whether granting planning permission for a single house at
the end of a row would create a precedent for opening up further
applications for development in the open countryside. When driving
through that particular area, as I did after ignoring the advice I had
been given, it became clear that although on a plan the area seemed to
be the next stage into the open countryside, the next site to the
appeal site was a hill that was so steep a house would have to be hung
off it to build there. Absolutely no precedent at all was being
created; it was simply an obvious infill site. As I said, the hon.
Gentleman is wrong to suggest that all the pressures are in the
direction of good decision making. It is greatly to the credit of
Ministers that often they pursue the idea of taking the right decision
against the play-safe advice.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): Of course I defer to the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s experience in these matters, but in his
intervention on the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe he
seemed to suggest that the process could on occasion swamp a
Minister&#146;s ability to take a decision. He also suggests that to
take the right decision, a Minister often has to show some courage. To
pursue the logic of that argument, he is saying that we should not go
down the proposed path because of process and the likelihood that
Ministers would lack courage. I have a slightly more generous view of
human nature and of the strength of the will of the electorate. I also
believe that a Minister&#146;s superiors would get rid of poor
Ministers who lack courage and that Ministers should improve the
process so better decisions are taken. Am I being
naive?</div>
					<a name="08012372000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000524"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is of course
being naive, but he is also doing what Members of
Parliament do best: jumping into the middle of an argument to avoid
understanding the full logic of it. I was about to continue the point
about the system not acting in the way that naive Conservative Members
seem to believe to develop a point about the complexity of
issues.</div>
					<a name="08012372000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
application with which I had to deal was the final stages of whether
the New Forest should be declared a national park. At that time, I was
dealing with the matter as Minister of State at the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs rather than as a Secretary of
State, so I was not under quite the same pressure as a Secretary of
State, who has to focus for a considerable time on the complexities of
a major application; nevertheless it involved carving out lots of time
trying to understand complex issues and arguments that had continued
for about 40 or 50 years&#151;it was a long, drawn-out process. I had
the benefit of the inquiry report and so on, but I had to study a great
deal of detailed information to apply logic to what the outcome should
be.</div>
					<a name="08012372000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
suggest that in balancing the accountability issues it asks an awful
lot of Ministers for them to deal with the whole of a major
application, because the bigger the application and the more serious
the issues the greater the detail. In such circumstances, there is an
alternative, which has merit: the principles are decided by Ministers
and a body is established to consider the details and decide whether
those principles will be fully applied in respect of a big, complex
application.</div>
					<a name="08012372000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, who made a strong
case for ministerial accountability. However, sometimes the pressure of
playing safe combined with the complexity of taking major decisions
does not necessarily result in a satisfactory process and that must be
weighed in the balance with my hon. Friend&#146;s conclusion. I shall
be interested to hear how our ministerial colleagues came to their
conclusion to introduce the Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000525"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe and add my
congratulations to those of others on his common-sense approach to the
proposal. I was particularly struck by the irony of the Secretary of
State having to make decisions on small but controversial planning
applications but not having 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>any responsibility for the large ones, although the Minister will
probably tell us that they will have been dealt with by Parliament
under the national policy statements
procedure.</div>
					<a name="08012372000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">This debate
brings us back to the responsibility of Parliament, which the Bill
ignores. The Government are taking away the role of Members of
Parliament to hold Ministers to account on matters that are of deep and
immediate concern to the electorate.</div>
					<a name="08012372000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
not just about small decisions being taken by the Secretary of State
but about how we hold the IPC to account. I do not want to put words in
the Minister&#146;s mouth but I suspect that he will say that the IPC
has to provide the Secretary of State with an annual report. That is
hardly the same as a written question, an Adjournment debate or
bringing Ministers to the Floor of the House to answer for their
decisions.</div>
					<a name="08012372000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another,
slightly mischievous, thought crosses my mind on the matter of small
but controversial planning applications. Despite our concerns that an
ever-increasing number of planning applications will go to the IPC and
bearing in mind the discussion that my hon. Friend the Member for
Clwyd, West had about offshore wind farms, it could be in the interests
of developers to put together a project rather than a development so it
does not have to go to the Secretary of State but is, theoretically,
dealt with more speedily under the IPC process. In that case, our
constituents would feel doubly offended that they had no right of
recourse to the House on planning applications, many of which should
have been decided by the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="08012372000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000526"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I am interested in my hon. Friend&#146;s example,
which is not far-fetched. My constituency seems to have been targeted
by different wind farm developers who make separate applications and
large tracts of it are being covered by wind turbines. I can see the
attraction to those developers of putting together a concerted
application so that it can be dealt with by the IPC rather than having
to go through the planning process and suffering the opprobrium of
local
people.</div>
					<a name="08012372000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000527"></a>Mrs.

						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely
right.</div>
					<a name="08012372000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="08012372000528"></a>The

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000529"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> But our purpose in trying to get this sort of
information out of Ministers is precisely to test whether our
suppositions are right and whether there is a robust reply to them. For
example, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for a new nuclear
power station to be built in Dungeness, which would indeed be a
nationally significant infrastructure project. A wind farm is already
going up not far from there and there could be another application for
a wind farm. We are still discussing the size of hazardous waste
facilities and with the development of technology there could be
applications for smallish facilities to be built into the nuclear power
application.</div>
					<a name="08012372000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
not be difficult to put together a series of developments that would go
to the Secretary of State if they were taken singly, but put together
as a project would have to go through the IPC, when we would not be
able to raise the issue on behalf of our constituents. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>If the Minister could answer all our questions about the role of
Parliament and Ministers&#146; responsibilities we would be
exceedingly
grateful.</div>

Healey:
						</b> I welcome you back to the Chair, Sir
John.</div>
					<a name="08012372000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">This large
group of amendments tries to do two different things: one block, tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield,
Attercliffe and others would make the IPC a recommending rather than a
decision-taking body, requiring the panel of the IPC or a single
commissioner to report their recommendations to the Secretary of State
for his decision. The other block of amendments would allow the IPC, in
certain circumstances, to take decisions but not when orders that
granted development consent included the application, modification or
exclusion of other
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08012372000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend was right to say that this is one of the most important
parts of the Bill. The arguments have had a good airing both this
afternoon and in our debates on parts 1 and 2, as my hon. Friend
acknowledged, and he made some clear and important points. I am glad he
accepts that Ministers with a planning role act in a quasi-judicial
way; he also recognised that in that capacity Ministers&#146;
decisions cannot be challenged or overturned in Parliament as that is
for the courts.</div>
					<a name="08012372000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend&#146;s main concern, however, was that under the Bill as
drafted, the IPC can take decisions in a limited number of cases and
Ministers cannot be questioned. His argument was that at present
Ministers can at least be questioned in the House but he was concerned
about whether the IPC could be
questioned.</div>
				
					<a name="08012372000416"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08012372000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
there are differences. It would not be possible to call the IPC to
account on the Floor of the House, but there are ways of doing so and
some of my hon. Friends are used to doing just that with bodies such as
Ofsted.</div>
					<a name="08012372000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the House
accepts our proposal to set up a special Select Committee, that
Committee could regularly be active in requiring the chair and the
commission to account for the decisions that they take, rather than
simply explaining the work that may be periodically set out as
decisions included in an annual
report.</div>
					<a name="08012372000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with
Ofsted, it is possible to table parliamentary questions that demand
answers directly from the IPC. I say &#147;directly from the
IPC&#148;, but of course the convention of the House is that answers
are routed through Ministers. Nevertheless, the answers are given by
the bodies. When I was Minister responsible for statistics, I performed
that function regularly with the Office for National Statistics. If the
answer is in a letter to any hon. Member, that information and
explanation is printed in <i class="I">Hansard</i>. It is available to all hon.
Members via the House&#146;s procedures. It is not the same, but
there is considerable scope for holding the IPC directly to account for
its work and
decisions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000531"></a>Mr.

						</b> Is the Minister not simply saying that a

							<a name="08012372000532"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Not precisely. In the case of the Office for
National Statistics, I was not even a mouthpiece in respect of
questions that were properly for the national statistician. I was the
postbox, and, in many respects, the post boy. The questions came to me;
I passed them to the national statistician. I got the answers back,
then passed them on to the Member of
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08012372000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
context of planning, it is not that the Minister is the mouthpiece. The
House can challenge Ministers to explain decisions that they take in
their planning capacity. It is not for Parliament to challenge or to
overturn those decisions. Any challenge or overturning of a decision
that a Minister takes in their planning capacity must be done through
the courts. The same would be the case for rights to challenge and
methods to overturn any decision that may be taken by the
IPC.</div>

Michael:
						</b> The example of statistics that my hon. Friend has
just referred to is quite illuminating in the context. Does not he
agree that, in acting as a postbox for the Office for
National Statistics and in transmitting those replies on to Members of
the House, he would have been informed and aware both of the concerns
being raised by hon. Members, and of the answers being given,
independently, by the Office for National Statistics? Did he not find
that experience useful when he came to deal with the Statistics and
Registration Service Bill not many months ago, when, as a Minister, he
was accountable for the legislation going through the House? The
relationship is not merely one of passing pieces of paper, it is an
intelligent engagement with an independent body pursuing things that
have been decided by Government or
Parliament.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000534"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I did, indeed. My right hon. Friend knows that
well, as he also served on the Statistics and Registration Service Bill
Committee, for which I am grateful to him. I found that useful in that
context. As the Minister responsible for the Office for National
Statistics, I did not answer those particular
parliamentary questions for the national statistician, but I did answer
those that were a matter of statistics
policy.</div>
					<a name="08012372000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend says that that is an illuminating comparison,
as it is, in some ways. Planning policy would remain a matter for
Ministers, although the accountability and explanation of the
IPC&#146;s work and decisions would be a matter for itself, in
operational
terms.</div>

trying to test out, within the established procedures of the House,
what the House could decide to do, within the framework of the
proposals we make relating to the Bill, to hold this important body to
account to explain the very important decisions that we are charging it
to make. Of course there is a world of difference. I do not use the
comparison in any way to belittle the importance of what we are
discussing. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>trying to cast some light on what may be possible. I hope that the hon.

							<a name="08012372000539"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I appreciate the serious intent with which the
Minister raises the matter, but may I make one final point for him to
take on board? Occasionally a Secretary of State will come to a
decision that is different from the recommendation of the inspector.
That may be the courageous thing to do, as the right hon. Gentleman
said. But the whole point is that it is very clear to the public that
the Secretary of State has done that. The public might well conclude
that it was a pretty tight decision under those circumstances. I do not
criticise a Minister who does that, but it is there, it is on the
record and it is very accountable.</div>
					<a name="08012372000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is within the IPC and it
is dealt with by the panel or by an individual commissioner, how do we
know whether the commissioner decided to go against certain technical
or expert advice that he had in-house? If it is a decision of the
panel, how do we know whether the chairman of the panel dealt with it
on his casting vote or something like that? It is not a small thing. If
people can review the decision, see that it was tight and that the
Secretary of State chose, perhaps bravely, to go down a different route
and can be questioned about that here in this House, albeit that it is
subject to the rules of being quasi-judicial, is that not a significant
difference in transparency? How, if the Minister is right, will we
achieve a similar degree of transparency about the decisions and the
reasoning processes of the IPC
?</div>

that there is a difference in principle between a decision that a
Secretary of State may take in a planning case where they happen to
agree with the inspector, and a decision where they disagree. The
important question the hon. Gentleman was posing was how open and how
clear will the process of making the decision that the IPC undertakes
be, and how clear will it have to be about the reasons for the
decisions that it comes to. We come on in part 6 to the process of
considering applications and making decisions. On the question of being
clear about the reasons, the IPC will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>be required to publish an explanation of the decisions it reaches, and
its reasons for doing so. That will give those with an interest plenty
of opportunity to understand the IPC&#146;s
stance.</div>

							<b class="B">Jeff
Ennis</b> (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab): Just to add
my two penn&#146;orth on this point, the main
difference with the Secretary of State&#146;s
involvement under the new model, with the involvement of the IPC in
major planning decisions, is that it will be front-loaded through the
national policy statements. He will set the framework within which the
IPC must work. Not only that, but under clause 6 it will be incumbent
on him to review the overall policy contained in the national policy
statement at regular intervals. There is therefore a check and balance
for the Secretary of State to ensure that the IPC is conforming to the
model that he has laid down in the national policy
statement.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000544"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right. The national policy
statement framework within which the IPC will make decisions, which we
have set out, will be very different to the regime within which the
Secretary of State and the planning inspector currently operate. That
is recognised on both sides of the Committee as an important element of
the new system and it creates a different basis upon which decisions
will be taken.</div>
					<a name="08012372000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my
hon. Friend quite rightly said, there is not just a
front-loading of ministerial involvement. There is a significant
strengthening and front-loading of parliamentary involvement because of
the role that Parliament will play in developing national policy
statements.</div>
					<a name="08012372000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
some of the substantive points that my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe and others have raised. There
was a question over whether Secretaries of State will be left, as they
are now, to make decisions on certain smaller projects, but not larger
ones. It is precisely because these projects are bigger and nationally
more significant that the current system is not up to dealing with
them. It is because of that that we believe that we need a new system
together with the IPC. I will come on to some of the reasons for the
IPC in a moment. It is because there are relatively few nationally
significant infrastructure projects and because they are reasonably
predictable that we can be confident that we can set out clear,
detailed national policy statements to cover
them.</div>
					<a name="08012372000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nationally
significant infrastructure projects are different from commercial
developments and large-scale housing developments, which the Planning
Inspectorate and the current Town and Country Planning Act regime will
continue to deal with. There is a substantive difference with the few,
more predictable national projects that we envisage, for which we can
set out national policy statement frameworks within which decisions
should be taken and which Parliament will have a very strong role in
developing.</div>
					<a name="08012372000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">In setting
out the national policy statements, we can do what my hon. Friend the
Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough mentioned and set out the
basis for separating policy making from decision making. Policy making
is properly the province of Ministers, along with Parliament. Decision
making is an area for an independent, expert panel through the
commission.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>
					<a name="08012372000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those projects that will still
be dealt with under the current regime, such as
commercial housing developments, which are exercising my hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, come in all shapes and sizes and
vary considerably, as the collected experience from all of our
constituencies would demonstrate. They are much more difficult to
capture in the new framework. It is more difficult to set out detailed
policy statements that cover all such cases. That means that the
Secretary of State might occasionally need to call in certain cases due
to an exceptional set of circumstances or because policy issues are
raised that require a decision for
clarification.</div>
					<a name="08012372000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
view, there is a good reason why there should be a
distinction between bigger projects and smaller ones. Rather than the
latter undermining the case for the former, that distinction allows us
to make the proposals to treat them
differently.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08012372000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hesitate in
some ways, Sir John, because I have already gone over the principal
benefits that we believe will come from an independent IPC. I have
stated them in some detail in giving evidence and in the scrutiny part
of the Committee stage. Suffice it to say that in summary, the benefits
are three-fold. We believe that the IPC will increase the speed and
efficiency of decision
making.</div>

							<a name="08012372000545"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I have trouble listening to what my hon.
Friend is saying, particularly about the greater
certainty that the policy statements will give to the commission when
it looks at individual projects. Can he foresee any circumstances in
which the policy statement might not be absolutely comprehensive? For
example, there might be gaps in it whereby the commission would have to
arrive at an interpretation of policy if there is a dispute between the
parties about what the policy is. Does he see the danger that, under
those circumstances, we could end up with a situation where policy is
made by the commission without any review of that decision by the
Secretary of State?</div>
					<a name="08012372000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000546"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The intention of the system is clear.
Policy making is rightfully for Ministers together
with Parliament. The Bill specifically provides for circumstances where
the policy is deficient, either because it does not cover the required
areas or because it is out of date. The second principle benefit of the
IPC is the belief that it will improve the quality of the decisions
taken. Thirdly, it will improve clarity and transparency within a
system that currently, and my hon. Friend dwelt on this, could include
a situation where the same Secretary of State is responsible for
policy, interested in the promotion of particular applications and is
ultimately the decision taking authority. It is likely to be less a
matter for the Secretary of the State of my own Department, and more
common in the areas of transport.</div>
					<a name="08012372000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the question at the heart of my hon. Friend&#146;s
concerns&#151;that of how the IPC will be accountable. I will try to
set out a number of ways in which that will be the case and I hope that
he will reflect on them and feel reassured. First, the IPC will always,
and only, operate within the legislative framework set by Parliament, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>and within the policy framework set out by Ministers
and scrutinised by Parliament in the national policy statements. As I
have said, it will be required to give reasons for any decisions that
it takes, and it will account to Ministers and to Parliament for its
performance and for those decisions. The commission&#146;s annual
reports will be available to Parliament via Ministers.</div>
					<a name="08012372000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have suggested a special
Select Committee to deal with national policy statements and elements
of the new system, and it will be able to call the chair of the
commission to give evidence before it&#151;something that I am sure
all members of the Committee expect to happen. The commission will be
subject to freedom of information provisions
and, in the case of maladministration, to the parliamentary
commissioner for administration. Ultimately, the Secretary of State can
remove a commissioner from office if he or she is satisfied that the
circumstances meet the criteria set out in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012372000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second group of amendments
deals with the IPC&#146;s powers to apply, modify or exclude
legislative provisions. Perhaps I could first attempt to reassure the
Committee that this is not a swingeing new power to amend the
legislation. It is a narrow and confined area of
competence for the IPC. The sorts of primary legislation that we
envisage the IPC will need to discharge its primary function of
allowing the development consent are Private Acts of Parliament in
relation to transport projects, many of which, as hon. Members will
know, date from the 19th century. There will also be some byways and
other provisions.</div>
					<a name="08012372000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that this is a controversial area. As it underpins some of
our later deliberations as well as these amendments, I would like to
try to demonstrate why the IPC needs these powers and emphasise the
safeguards that are in place to ensure that they are used
appropriately. We believe that putting the IPC in charge, not just of
examining applications, but of the decisions that are essential to
speeding up the process on national infrastructure projects, will
improve the quality of those decisions and make the system clearer and
more transparent. Those points lie at the heart of our
proposals.</div>
					<a name="08012372000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is that the sorts of infrastructure projects that we are talking about
are different from many other sorts of projects. Particularly with
railways and ports, alterations to existing infrastructure&#151;often
built under the authorisation of Local Acts of Parliament in the 19th
century and sometimes earlier&#151;cannot be made without minor
changes to existing legislation. As soon as anyone starts to develop or
plan the concepts, they run up against the statutory provisions that
regulate the existing infrastructure and would not permit those works
to take place. Almost from the word go, questions about minor
amendments to legislation are integrally bound up with the preparation
and consideration of any planning projects for major infrastructure.
That is particularly clear with railway infrastructure, where no
alterations can be made to such infrastructure and therefore no further
projects can be built on such land, unless the original Acts of
Parliament are changed.</div>
					<a name="08012372000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is precisely because of that
problem that under the previous Government, Parliament recognised and
granted the Secretary of State powers under section 5 of the Transport
and Works Act 1992, which included the ability to make an order that
can apply, modify or exclude any statutory
provision relating to any matter 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>on which an order could be made under that Act. The
Act also permitted the Secretary of State to make
amendments, appeals or revocations of statutory provisions of local
application, as appeared to him or her as expedient in connection with
an order. In clause 105(6), which is at the heart of the provision, we
have used wording that is closely modelled on the Transport and Works
Act&#151;it is not something that we have created specifically for
the IPC. If we do not give the IPC these powers it simply will not be
able to deal with projects, such as railways and ports, that cannot be
built without making minor amendments to existing
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08012372000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the argument of some hon. Members that we
should treat those cases as a special case and have the IPC report them
and its consideration of applications to Ministers, but I hope that
hon. Members will accept that were we to do that, we would be back
where we started. We would lose the advantages of the single consent
regime and the potential benefits that lie in creating the IPC and
giving it this decision-making role. We would have a functionally
separate process for the consideration of the application and for the
derivative legislative changes and we would have separate
responsibilities for those two areas. In other words, we would not have
an independent planning commission, but an extension of Ministers. That
would not speed up the decision-making process because we would have
the same two-stage process with two separate bodies going over much of
the same ground, separately and sequentially. We would not get improved
decisions because the commission would be just a reporting body to
Ministers; a sort of souped-up Planning Inspectorate. Finally, we would
not have greater clarity regarding roles and responsibilities because
Ministers would be setting policy and still taking decisions to deliver
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000547"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I do not understand how what the Minister has just
said about delay and undermining the IPC fits with his earlier
observation that the power to amend or disapply legislation is narrow
and confined. If it is narrow and confined, it is likely to be used in
a very discrete set of circumstances. I do not see how either two
parallel structures or inordinate delay will be created. If Ministers
are efficient and it is simply a question of a recommendation being
made to them, that is not unscrambling the whole of the IPC. I hope
that he does not misunderstand that, and I should like to know the
basis for his suggestion. Surely, Ministers can come to a swift
decision on a narrow and discrete, but important, constitutionally
sensitive point.</div>
					<a name="08012372000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000548"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I repeat that the IPC will absolutely have a
narrow, confined and well specified competence within which to exercise
the powers. I am tackling the proposition in the amendments that when
there are to be primary legislative changes as a result of an
application, the application and the changes should automatically be
referred to the Secretary of State for decision. That would be a
two-stage process, with two bodies going over the same ground and
losing the greater efficiency, speed and certainty of the
decision-making
process.</div>
					<a name="08012372000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are back
where we started. I said that I would spell out some of the safeguards
that I hope will reassure hon. Members. The use of the IPC&#146;s
legislative modification powers must be contained within an application
for a particular infrastructure project. The
application must be in the form of an order that
has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>been drafted according to model provisions in the
Bill and must be in accordance with the national policy statement. The
draft order must be submitted to the Secretary of State, who may demand
changes if the modifications would contravene European Union or human
rights legislation.</div>
					<a name="08012372000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given those reassurances and
comments, I hope that hon. Members feel that we have had a good,
important debate and will not press their amendments to votes. If they
do, I urge my hon. Friends to resist.</div>

the issues that I and other hon. Members have raised,
and for doing so in his usual helpful and thorough fashion. However, he
has reassured me only partially, because his explanation about the
IPC&#146;s accountability is that it will be partially accountable. I
am not convinced that it will have the same accountability for its
decisions as the Secretary of State would have.</div>
					<a name="08012372000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that
Ministers&#146; recommendations and parliamentary
votes will determine the national policy statements within which the
IPC must operate, but I would be happier if the Secretary of State were
to oversee that that is properly done on an individual application. I
am still struggling with the fundamental reason why having the
Secretary of State as the final arbiter would cause a considerable
problem, and I am not fully reassured on that. I shall not press my
amendment to a vote, but I think that we will have to return to this on

Several witnesses raised with us in various ways
their concerns about how the national policy statements regime and the
way in which statements are handled will or will not satisfactorily
interface with existing policy documents and frameworks. We seek to
clarify that at an early stage by requiring the applicant to say
whether he can comply and, if not, set out his
reasons.</div>
					<a name="08012372000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
why there may be a departure from that for a major piece of

						</b> I had regarded the amendment as over-prescriptive.
I had not quite understood it, but I think I now divine the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s underlying concern. It seems to be to ensure that
controversies and local views are, to use his words, flagged up early
and, ideally, in advance of the application
process.</div>
					<a name="08012372000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is over-prescriptive principally for this reason.
Once a national policy statement is established, it should, of course,
be reflected in relevant local development frameworks or regional
spatial strategies. However, the hon. Gentleman will know well, given
his experience, that local development frameworks do not necessarily
respond immediately, and such a framework may not have the opportunity
to reflect and take into account the provisions of a national policy
statement. Instead&#151;this deals with his underlying concerns
rather than meeting the terms of his amendment&#151;the Bill requires
any promoter to consult local authorities that will be affected by the
proposals and to have regard to their views. During that consultation
process, local authorities will be able to raise all relevant local
concerns and controversies, enabling the promoters to take account of
their views early and in advance of the application process. That will
enable applications to be better prepared before being submitted. The
Bill allows local authorities to bring up relevant concerns both at the
pre-application stage and during the inquiry
phases.</div>

news is that this will be the last that hon. Members hear from
me&#151;for a little time, at any rate. The amendment follows on from
the principle that I referred to, which is about
embracing the Government&#146;s argument about front-loading as much
of the work as possible. We are seeking to enhance the consultation and
publicity at the early stage of the application. The amendment would
extend the scope of the consultation report that is required to be
provided to consultation under clause 37 and to publicity under clause
43, as well as what is in clause 42, which can broadly be referred to
as the community consultation element. We do not have a problem with
that. It seems sensible that there should be early community
consultation, and to a high and robust standard&#151;I think that
that is the phrase that the CBI used in its evidence. However, we think
it appropriate that the report that sets out how that has been gone
about should embrace all the elements of consultation that have to take
place. That would include the local authorities under clause 37 and the
way in which publicity has been gone about under clause
43.</div>
					<a name="08012372000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are seeking to
make the consultation report more comprehensive at that early stage.
That seems sensible. Again, it would be likely to
concentrate the minds of applicants and would ensure consistency. It
certainly appears to be consistent with, for example, the approach
adopted in clause 49(5), to which our explanatory statement refers.
There is a desire on our part to seek clarity early on. That would add
to the efficiency that I hope we and the Government want to achieve,
even if we might sometimes disagree about the
means.</div>

consultation under clause 42, rather than spreading the importance of
it more widely. That is why clause 42 requires that a statement be
drawn up setting out how the applicant proposes to
consult the local community&#151;a statement on which local
authorities must be consulted&#151;and provides for it to benefit
from guidance from both the commission and the Secretary of State as to
what should be in
it.</div>
					<a name="08012372000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;this
deals with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s wider concerns&#151;the
applicant must have regard to responses to the consultation and
publicity under all three provisions to which his amendment refers.
Similarly, the commission must have regard to the adequacy of the
consultation representation made by a local authority consultee as part
of the evidence and information that it has towards the end of the

explore this clause further. The hon. Member for Bromley and

circumstances in which the Government may depart from the provisions
that everyone else in the country has to conform to.</div>
					<a name="08012372000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, will
the Minister define what is meant by Crown land? Does it include, for
example, Duchy of Lancaster land or, in the case of my own
constituency, Duchy of Cornwall land, because that land serves a
different purpose from Crown land, which is used for purposes on behalf
of Government and the nation as a whole? I would be interested to have
some clarification of exactly what is covered by this measure. I hope
that the Minister can see the distinction that I am making about
estates in which the primary purpose is to raise revenue for particular
members of the royal
family.</div>
					<a name="08012372000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, whose amendment prompted the debate
on clause 32, referred to the potential conflict of interest in the
Secretary of State determining applications. He saw
that as a potential criticism of his own argument. Here, we could have
the conflict of interest above all others if the Government are able to
impose particular strictures upon anyone else who applies to construct
a development. They could completely disregard the applicant for their
own ends. It would be helpful for us to hear from the Minister how
often he thinks that such action would be appropriate. Even if he is
able to clarify the matter, I am a little uneasy with the whole
concept. I think that members of the public and people in industry who
are forced to live by the Bill would feel aggrieved if the Crown were
able to sidestep the regulations that are imposed on everybody else. I
will be interested to hear what the Minister has to
say.</div>

raising his eyes about the progress that we are making&#151;I would
like to mention that there are significant plans for housing
developments on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, which may have
complicated implications for infrastructure projects. That is the

						</b> The hon. Gentleman must appreciate
that this regime does not cover housing. We have
already dealt in some detail with the criteria that qualify an
application for a project. This is principally about Crown applications
for Government projects, such as highway projects in which the Highways
Agency would be the promoter. The measure is designed to be a fall-back
provision that is used in special circumstance. Hon. Members will
recognise that occasionally domestic or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>international circumstance require the Government to
be able to act quickly in response to events that by their nature are
unpredictable and may not be capable of being captured and set out in a
national policy statement. Without the power set out in the clause, the
Government would not be able to respond.</div>
					<a name="08012372000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give an example. The
foot and mouth crisis required the urgent provision of infrastructure
in order to deal with the large quantities of animal waste that

circumstance.</div>
					<a name="08012372000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations we propose would be subject to the negative procedure in

						</b> On a point of order, Sir John. Before I launch into
moving the amendment, I seek your guidance on a matter that I raised at
the beginning of this morning&#146;s sitting. The Minister kindly
indicated to us that he was hoping to get the
consultation on the community infrastructure levy out in plenty of time
for organisations and ourselves to be able to consider amendments. I
now understand that it will be next week before that consultation goes
out, which makes it exceedingly tight for us to be able to get advice
from the bodies that are most directly concerned and to table
amendments, particularly if we were to be able to move on to
consideration of that next Friday. Could you give us some guidance as
to how we could cope with that situation, so that we can have a proper
debate on the
levy?</div>

morning. I said that we would get the consultation out, that it would
not be, as the hon. Lady mistakenly argued this morning, about
consultation on the draft regulations, but it would be a consultation
that set out more fully our approach to developing the community
infrastructure levy. We aim to do that in good time for the debate in
the Committee and that remains my
intention.</div>

Lait:
						</b> I am sorry. That was a procedural mistake and I
thank you for your guidance, Sir John. I will, indeed, speak to
amendment No. 11, which sets the tone for all the amendments in the
group. They are all to do with trying to get the pre-inquiry
consultation, and the people who need to be consulted,
correct.</div>
					<a name="08012372000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
concern, across a broad front, that the lists in the
clause are tight. They mention various organisations and people. I
assume that, where the Bill mentions &#147;persons&#148;, it means
that people are able to represent the organisations. However crucial
the contribution made by organisations to the development of the
national policy statement, if they have a particular interest in an
area, they will probably tie the IPC in knots by demanding the right to
represent their views on a particular application because of their
detailed interest in it.</div>
					<a name="08012372000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">We see the practice emerging of
developers realising the importance of good consultation before putting
in an application. Frankly, they recognise that sorting out the
problems before putting in an application has the benefit that it will
go through much more speedily. We strongly support pre-inquiry
consultation because it is a key element in speeding
up planning inquiries, whether it goes through the IPC or through our
preferred route of an improved Planning Inspectorate. It is therefore
crucial that the right people are consulted, and that includes all who
feel that they have a legitimate point to make.</div>
					<a name="08012372000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment No. 11, we suggest
adding to clause 37 the
words</div>
					<a name="08012372000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;residents affected
by the proposed
application&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012372000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as
I understand it, clause 39 confines those who must be
consulted to the owners, lessees, tenants or occupiers of the land, or
persons who are &#147;interested&#148; in the land or who have the
power to sell, convey or release it. My reading of a person who is
interested in the land, coupled with the phrase &#147;has power...to
sell&#148;, implies that it is someone with a direct interest in the
land, and not necessarily a person who is concerned about the
development of the land and its impact on their community.</div>
					<a name="08012372000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">If my
interpretation is right&#151;I hope that the Minister will assure me
that I am wrong&#151;it could, for instance, mean that someone whose
property was not necessarily contiguous with the property being
developed but who happened to live in the village and who had a problem
with sight lines, or one of the many other of the complaints frequently
made under the planning system, could be ruled out from making a
complaint or from applying to be represented.</div>
					<a name="08012372000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because pre-inquiry
consultation is improving, I want to be assured that organisations that
represent people with a direct interest can continue to insist on being
consulted. I have in mind evidence from the Wildlife Trust, which I am
sure other hon. Members have received, particularly about electricity
cables in Kent. Because the trust was consulted by the developer before
the inquiry, it was able to resolve many of the issues, some to do with
the habitats directive and especially the habitat of the marsh harrier,
and a number of other clear and direct matters that were of benefit to
the environment. That was done under the auspices of a formal group. In
the spirit of getting the pre-inquiry consultation right, I would not
want such organisations to be unable to represent local residents 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>and local interests merely because they were not regarded as having a
direct interest. With that, you will be relieved to hear, Sir John, I
have covered all the ground that I need to on the
amendments.</div>

					<a name="08012372000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Lady rightly said,
it appears from clause 39 that those who will be consulted will have a

has</div>

plants, hazardous waste facilities, railways, which can be intrusive,
highways and pipelines, as well as to the extension of
airports&#151;we all know about those&#151;and the underground
storage of gas. Indeed, some large gas pipelines are currently being
sent through south Wales and are causing grave concern in many
communities throughout the area. However, I am thinking more of
airports. Sticking strictly to the proprietary interest line that a
person must be interested in the land contiguous to the development
tends to miss the point. Those who can be badly affected by airport
extensions can live miles away from the land that is being
developed.</div>
					<a name="08012372000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
think that the Bill should be amended. My amendment is along the same
lines as the hon. Lady&#146;s, with which I do not disagree. We are
both aiming at the same end product&#151;a thorough inquiry that
places an obligation on the IPC to consult properly all those who might
be badly or substantially affected. That is the very least that we
should be aiming for in this aspect of the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="08012372000577"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> The amendments that I tabled fall into two
groups. Amendments Nos. 168, 169, 321 and 322 refer
to the inclusion of parish councils or their equivalent in the
provisions. I might have been over-zealous in my reference to community
councils in Scotland, given that their appearance in later amendments
makes that superfluous. However, it is important that parish councils
are included in the process.</div>
					<a name="08012372000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are 70 parish councils in
my constituency, all of which very much enjoy their role as statutory
consultees on planning
applications&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I think that
some hon. Members are surprised that there are 70 in my constituency,
but I try to get to as many of them as I can. They take their
role in planning applications seriously, and they quite often dispute
with the district council whether their views have been taken into
account. At that point, anyone who has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>chosen to attend the public gallery of a parish
council meeting gets very interested. We should reflect on that
fact.</div>
					<a name="08012372000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parish
councils would be a useful addition to this and later parts of the
Bill. They provide an excellent forum for ensuring that information
about a proposed development is filtered out into the community and
that those views are reflected back. I hope that the Minister will be
able to accept that they ought to be added and that they are missing
from the Bill. If he feels that my amendments are not elegant enough,
perhaps he will undertake to examine at the issue and return to us
later.</div>
					<a name="08012372000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point relates to an issue that concerns me a little: developers
being asked to undertake consultation. The most important thing about
consultation is that it should be meaningful. As it is part of the
speeding up the process, anything that happens at the pre-application
stage will later be relied on for evidence, if the application is
considered. Let us take the example of a community that feels aggrieved
about something on which the IPC is due to make a decision. The local
people might feel that the consultation undertaken by the applicant at
the pre-application stage, or someone appointed by the applicant, does
not entirely reflect their views. While the IPC will no doubt want to
hear that that evidence is robust and that the consultation has taken
place properly, amendments Nos. 174, 297 and 298 would provide for the
employment of a third party to undertake that consultation. The third
party would be appointed by the IPC, although the charge would fall
upon the applicant.</div>
					<a name="08012372000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">No doubt the
Minister will say that it would not be right for the IPC to get
involved in such a way prior to the application. However, that would be
a way in which we could guarantee that the important pre-application
consultation, which seeks to improve applications and overcome one of
the factors that can delay them, is robust and not just fair, but seen
to be fair by those in the community concerned. I hope that the
Minister will consider the amendments and tell us how the Government
feel these points can be taken into
account.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000578"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I do not think that there is any
significant difference in our objective of having the most effective
and thorough pre-application consultation and ensuring that those who
may be affected or who have an interest are included in that process.
All hon. Members would recognise that the consultation at the
pre-application stage is one of the cornerstones of the Bill. It is a
new requirement, as witnesses at our evidence sessions confirmed. It
will put a new requirement on project promoters that will lead to
better applications and new opportunities for local communities, local
residents and others to put forward their views. It will be an
opportunity not just to put forward views, but to influence the
development of a promoter&#146;s proposal. Indeed, there is the
example of local residents working with the Wildlife Trust in Kent.
Once the application was submitted, it went through a process like this
and was vastly
improved.</div>
					<a name="08012372000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 11 and 63 are not necessary to achieve the aims of the hon. Lady
and the hon. Member for North Cornwall. Taken as a whole, the
provisions in part 5 already set a strong requirement to consult local
communities and the people affected. Clauses 42 to 44 will require the
promoter to prepare a statement setting out how the local community
will be consulted, to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>publicise that statement in the relevant area, and to carry out the
consultation in accordance with the statement. It will also require
them to publicise a proposed application locally and to take account of
responses to the consultation.</div>
					<a name="08012372000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 37
and 39 have a different and more specific purpose. They will require
consultation with anyone with an interest in the land, anyone who might
be entitled to a compensation claim, even under the Compulsory Purchase
Act 1965 or the Land Compensation Act 1973, and those who may be
entitled to a claim for nuisance. The measure applies to owners,
lessees, tenants, occupiers of land, and other parties with such
interests. In addition, other statutory consultees can be
specified&#151;there is provision to do so under regulations. That
answers the hon. Gentleman, but we will consider the points he raised.
I have already invited the Committee to make suggestions about what we
should consider under the process. We will use the regulations to
specify consultees after proper and widespread consultation.</div>
					<a name="08012372000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">That also answers the hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who asked about the position of
harbour authorities during a debate on part 3 of the Bill. Of course,
they come into precisely the category that I am talking about. We would
consider their position under the power I
described.</div>
					<a name="08012372000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000579"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> Clause 39(5)(c) is about persons who might have
&#147;a claim for nuisance.&#148; Will that category catch those
whom I described as being significantly affected by a development? For
example, will it catch a person who lives two miles away from a new
runway? Would they come within the ambit of the measure? It would be
encouraging if they did.</div>
					<a name="08012372000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000580"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I cannot say that such people will necessarily be
caught by the measure because I cannot anticipate
what circumstances will arise. However, the general provision for the
consultation requirements of a promoter in the local area and community
are likely to encompass the sort of people whom the hon. Gentleman has
in mind. To be honest, it is difficult to think of people who should be
consulted who are not covered by the proposals as they stand. Local
people, those who have a direct interest and those whose interests
could be affected are covered.</div>
					<a name="08012372000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
addressed the question of parish and community-level councils but, in
summary, the strong duty to consult the local community at the
pre-application stage is set out in this part of the Bill. I have
covered hon. Members concerns. In addition, when a person makes a
written representation on a particular application, they will
automatically become an interested party under clause 92.</div>
					<a name="08012372000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
hon. Member for North Cornwall proposed third party intervention.
Specifying the requirements and responsibilities on the promoter,
giving them the principal responsibility to undertake those
effectively, and giving ourselves the capability to elaborate on them
later represents the better approach and the right one. The
responsibility should properly sit with the
promoter.</div>

							<a name="08012372000581"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> Let me give an example. There is an application
to build a wind farm in my constituency&#151;I have heard of similar
things happening in north-east 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>Wales. The local residents who are
opposed to the scheme are a little suspicious of the pre-application
consultation that is being carried out by the developer. That
consultation is pretty much following the provisions set out in the
Bill by taking over church halls in the parish to put on displays and
so on. The local residents feel that the developer has all of the
resources at its disposal and that the conclusions that appear on the
website do not reflect the points that they have seen fit to put
across, not least by standing outside and giving alternative views on
what form the development might take and how it might affect the area.
The issue is whether people see the consultation as being biased
because it is the developer that undertakes
it.</div>
					<a name="08012372000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000582"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I understand that point, but we are setting out a
framework that will require certain things to be undertaken by any
promoter during consultation. The commission must be satisfied that the
promoter has complied with their duty of consultation before it can
accept the application. It must also have regard to the representations
that the local authority makes, specifically about how adequate the
consultation has been. The circumstances in which the pre-application
consultation will take place will be clearly specified and there will
be significant requirements on the
promoter.</div>
					<a name="08012372000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
responsibility must rest with the promoter to undertake the
consultation and we all want to ensure that promoters do it in certain
ways. Under the Bill, the commission must be satisfied that that has
been done properly before it even accepts the application for
subsequent
consideration.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000583"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> In the example that I gave, a crucial point for
those who oppose the development is not that the consultation has not
taken place. They do not dispute that it has. Their concern is how the
evidence will be reported back to the commission. I am not clear about
how the commission can determine whether the information that is
presented to it is a fair reflection of the consultation that has taken
place. For example, there is no representative of the commission in the
church hall while it is going on and there is no one to say what
members of the public did or did not say while looking at the displays.
The concern I have is that the developer will be able to present the
picture that it has talked to people in the local community and that
they are happy with the project, subject to one or two changes, when
that is not a fair reflection of what went on at the public
meeting.</div>
					<a name="08012372000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000584"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I have touched on this point, but the commission
will have the scope to set standards and requirements on the
pre-application process in addition to what is specified in the Bill.
It is obliged to make an assessment of the extent to which that has
been carried out. The local authority is in a formal position to file a
report and make representations on the adequacy of the consultation. I
hope that the hon. Gentleman feels that this process will create
greater confidence and help to create better applications. The
application might not be entirely accepted by local interests, but it
will be a better application as a result of the
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08012372000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000585"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his assurances on
amendment No. 169 on parish and community councils. We tabled a similar
amendment and look forward to those bodies being included in the list
of the statutory consultees.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>
					<a name="08012372000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful,
too, for the Minister&#146;s explanation of his reading of how the
clause relates to the amendment. I am therefore unlikely to press it to
a vote, but I was interested that he did not refer to Government
amendments Nos. 357 to 359. I was waiting to hear him speak about them
and I deliberately did not refer to them. If I read them correctly,
those amendments will require the local authority to reply to a
consultation within 28 days of the date that it is received. A serious
consultation will take much longer. In due course, we will come to how
I envisage such a consultation being
conducted.</div>
					<a name="08012372000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the example cited by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, I
imagine that local people would feel most aggrieved about a wind farm
application if they had only 28 days in which to be consulted and to
make their views known about its impact on them singly, collectively,
as a community, as residents, as activists or as people whose land is
contiguous to the development. With the best will in the world, it
would take them considerably longer than 28 days to get legal advice
about their powers and responsibilities and about the impact a planning
application for a wind farm might have on them or their
neighbours.</div>
					<a name="08012372000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want the
Minister to enlighten us on the thinking behind the 28 days&#146;
limit for the local authority, because it entirely ignores the speed at
which local authorities progress, as even setting up a committee for a
local authority to consider an application takes longer than 28 days.
If an officer&#146;s authorisation is required to confirm that the
consultation is adequate, aggrieved councillors will complain. If the
reference is to a portfolio-holder or the cabinet, they do not
necessarily meet every 28 days. Some clarification of the
Government&#146;s amendments would be useful in helping us to decide
how to treat the
proposals.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000586"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> The hon. Lady is concerned about local
authorities, but applications will not come out of the blue. There is a
statutory minimum period. Some applications will be more complex than
others and it is plausible that a promoter will decide that a longer
period is needed for complex proposals or that the information is not
required in the 28-day time scale. In such cases, the promoter could
set a longer
deadline.</div>
					<a name="08012372000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals refer to the pre-application process and are a new,
additional requirement on promoters. They are an innovation in the
application stage and represent a useful marker in the Bill, which
tries to strike a balance between ensuring that the work in preparing
and contributing to applications is done without delay and giving those
who have an interest or a viewpoint the chance to register it with the
promoter.</div>

reply and I need to think much longer and harder
about it. However, I intend to withdraw the amendment
so that we can devote more thought to the matter and return to it on

will take into account my submission that parish and community councils
should be included.</div>

					<a name="08012372000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second group of amendments
is about who commissions the research and undertakes consultation at
the pre-application stage. The Minister said he would ensure that the
proposal is tightly drawn so that the commission can be confident that
the report it receives accurately reflects the views of people in the
community. On that basis, I will not press my amendment to a Division

							<a name="08012372000593"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I shall try to be brief, in anticipation that my
hon. Friend the Minister will be even briefer and say that he accepts
the amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012372000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have discussed the nature of the applications that
will be dealt with by the IPC which could have
transport implications&#151;indeed, they could be about transport
projects. It is therefore entirely logical that the authority within
the public sector that is concerned with transport matters&#151;the
passenger transport authority&#151;should be named as one of the
organisations, even though it is not technically a local authority,
that is consulted about applications and notified by the commission
under clause 50 of an application being accepted.</div>
					<a name="08012372000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be some anomalies if
we do not include transport authorities. In south Yorkshire, for
example, the PTA is responsible for passenger transport matters, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>but under the Bill it would not be notified about applications. Next
door in Derbyshire, however, the county council would be notified, as
it is responsible for passenger transport. Equally, it is slightly odd
that in south Yorkshire, the bodies responsible for highways&#151;the
city and borough councils&#151;would be notified, but the body
responsible for passenger transport matters, the PTA, would
not.</div>
					<a name="08012372000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">A PTA
comprises members of the various district councils in the county area,
but it is a separate statutory body with rights and powers that it
exercises without reference to the district council. It therefore ought
to be involved in the consultation and notification process. If we get
to the position under the Local Transport Bill in which passenger
transport authorities become integrated transport authorities and take
on some of the wider roles of transport, including road transport in
their areas, surely they would need to be consulted. Consultation about
road matters that currently goes to the district council might in the
future go to an integrated transport authority, which would be the
successor body to the passenger transport authority. That would clearly
need to be reflected in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012372000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendments
would clear up some of the current concerns about the neglect of
passenger transport issues, and the fact that county councils, as the
relevant bodies, will be consulted but transport authorities in the old
metropolitan areas will not. For those reasons, they are at least
worthy of the Minister&#146;s consideration, if he cannot accept them
immediately.</div>
					<a name="08012372000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012372000594"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I believe my hon. Friend will accept that the sort
of applications that we are considering for the IPC
will vary greatly in terms of the impact on a particular area,
depending on the type of infrastructure that is proposed. In some
cases, the local transport authority will have a great interest in the
proposals, but it may well not in others. We are seeking to set out
those parties that will have an interest in each and every national
infrastructure project application, and which therefore must always be
consulted as a matter of
course.</div>
					<a name="08012372000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
that my hon. Friend has made the case that passenger transport
authorities fall into that category. The proper place to deal with his
concerns is in secondary legislation. I shall indeed reflect further on
his comments in that context, but the Bill is not the proper place to
