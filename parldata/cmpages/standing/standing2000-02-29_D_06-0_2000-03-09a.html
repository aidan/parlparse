<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 124, in page 32, line 41, leave out ``Before dealing summarily with a charge'' and insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>After dealing summarily with a charge, and having found the charge proved, but before imposing sentence,<P>

<P>
No. 126, in page 33, leave out lines 30 to 36.
<P>
No. 127, in page 33, line 36, at end insert—
<P>
(3A) In section 52D of the 1957 Act (summary trial) (a) subsection (2) is omitted, and (b) a new subsection is inserted, as follows—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) If he determines that the charge has been proved, the Commanding Officer or appropriate superior authority shall, before recording a finding that the charge has been proved, afford the accused an opportunity of electing court-martial trial.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 131, in schedule 2, page 50, leave out lines 38 to 40.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am delighted to move the amendments, which are tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt). I apologise for my hon. Friend's absence. He is standing in for me on a course at the Royal College of Defence Studies this morning. It is an admirable institution and too important for Members not to be there, but my hon. Friend regrets his absence.
<P>
I express surpise and regret that we have no evidence of video links, which I had hoped we might be able to witness. No doubt, we shall return to that matter later, but it is evident that video link systems are not readily transportable, accessible, cheap and easy to install or able to be taken home at night by duty officers. It has taken 48 hours to prove that the system does not work and cannot be relied upon. [Interruption.] Does the Under-Secretary wish to intervene?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Dr. Lewis Moonie):</B> I will mention it later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I shall put the amendments into context. This debate is about the great traditions of the British forces. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall said that he wanted

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to dispel a second misapprehension; namely, that noble and gallant Lords, and other noble Lords who criticise this Bill somehow belong to a dying breed who hark back to the days of iron discipline and fierce regulations all designed to inculcate a great fear than the enemy could possibly achieve, and that somehow we find it difficult to adapt to the development of man management and the greater sensitivies of the modern solider.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
He then quoted

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>something that was written about one of the battalions of my regiment,<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I have the pleasure to observe this regiment possesses an excellent spirit and that both officers and men take a pride in doing their duty. Their movement in the field is perfect; it is evident that not only officers but each individual soldier knows perfectly what he has to do; the discipline is carried on without severity; the officers are attached to the men, the men to the officers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Lord Bramall said that he was not ``blowing his own trumpet'' because that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>was written in Sicily in 1806 by the great British general, Sir John Moore, about a battalion of the 52nd Light Infantry, later the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, now part of my own regiment, the Royal Greenjackets.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 365.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Lord Bramall returned to that theme yesterday in another place. In moving for papers on the defence White Paper, Command Paper 4446, he said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, on the debit side, there are a number of what one might loosely describe as ``politically correct pressures'' bearing down on individuals in the Armed Forces and the chain of command that may increasingly affect the ethos, leadership and professionalism of our forces.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 8 March 2000; Vol. 610, c. 1048.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That concern was frequently referred to in the debate in the other place yesterday afternoon. One part of that debate is of particular relevance to the amendments. Lord Renton said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The issue is simple. The exercise of human rights by any member of the Armed Forces under, for example, Article 10 of the convention—which is set out in the Schedule to the 1998 Act—could easily conflict with good order and military discipline. Article 10 grants the right to freedom of expression ``without interference by public authority''. I emphasise those words; they are in the article. Therefore, a private soldier could criticise a general publicly and could not be stopped. The noble Baroness—<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Baroness Symons—

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>challenged by interpretation of Article 11 when I asked a Question on 22 February. She rightly drew attention to the last sentence of Article 11, which states: ``This article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Lord Renton continued:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That is not the whole answer. If no steps are taken to prevent the exercise of these rights, chaos will result. It means that a matter will have to go to court, which, bearing in mind the uncertainty of the wording, may or may not grant an immediate injunction. In any event, even if the court grants an immediate injunction, the matter will have to be decided by the High Court, <P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
and it could take weeks before a final decision is made. The Government really must do something about this while the Armed Forces Discipline Bill is in another place.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 8 March 2000; Vol. 610, c. 1054.]<P>


<P>
The Government now have the opportunity to start doing something about it.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amendments would protect the current position in the Army and the Royal Air Force whereby the commanding officer has the opportunity to find an accused person not guilty of an offence before the accused has an opportunity to opt for a court martial. Amendment No. 127 would change the system in the Royal Navy to be consistent with that of the Army and the RAF. It seems fairer to individuals if they have an opportunity to be cleared by their commanding officer before they have to opt for court martial. The current system is in favour of the accused, as it affords him an opportunity to be cleared before he has to make an election and decide whether to receive the punishment of the commanding officer or have the entire case heard by a court martial.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Government's arguments were advanced by Baroness Symons:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, we do not wish there to be any confusion between the new right of appeal and the existing right to elect trial by court martial. We believe that there could be such confusion if we leave the procedures for electing trial by court martial as they are. That would be part of the effect of the amendments which we are discussing—<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
and they were similar to the amendments that we are debating today. She continued:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That is because in the Army and the Royal Air Force the accused is not given the right to elect for trial by court martial until after the commanding officer has found the charge proved.
We should remember that the commanding officer does not report that he has found the charge proved if the accused elects for court martial and that the commanding officer's findings then have no influence on its subsequent proceedings. Baroness Symons went on:<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As I said on Second Reading, that procedure may be considered to have some of the characteristics of an appeal.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, 
c. 360.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The noble Baroness' argument centres on the allegation that the system could be confusing—but we disagree. The changes in the Bill will remove from the accused the opportunity for his commanding officer to dismiss the charges that he can hear and nothing else. We believe that the procedure should be extended to the Royal Navy to ensure consistency in the three armed services, which would be the effect of amendment No. 127.

<P>
The arguments of the Minister for Defence Procurement simply do not stand up when she says that in the context of the convention, it is necessary that the right to elect from the outside is established. The effect of the changes will be to force the accused to take an earlier decision about an election for court martial. Ironically, that makes the new system more prejudicial to the accused than the existing one. That surely cannot be a problem with the European convention.

<P>
I should like to ask for your clarification, Mr. Malins. Are we supposed to be debating amendments Nos. 122 and 125?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. Amendments Nos. 122 and 125 will be the subject of our next debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Malins.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will recognise that these amendments are practical and important. They would ensure that the European convention—and it is right to keep coming back to this point—does not undermine the authority of the chain of command. The amendments, while strengthening that chain of command, would at the same time do nothing to diminish the human rights of the accused.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Viggers </B>(Gosport): The amendments go to the heart of the Bill. The contrast the present system, which relies on the commanding officer's knowledge of the men and women under his command, with the Government's proposed new system. The two systems demonstrate a fundamental difference in attitude. I maintain that the present system works well. It is paternalistic, personal and relies on the mutual trust and respect between those in command and those under command. It maintains the present disciplinary structure in the armed forces.

<P>
I have experience of working in the RAF, the Territorial Army and, above all, of serving for 26 years as a Member of Parliament representing a garrison town which has more people serving in the Royal Navy than any other constituency, as well as many Army, and RAF families, not to mention civilian families whose breadwinner works within the structure of the Ministry of Defence. In all that experience, I can count on the fingers of one hand the occasions on which individuals have come to my constituency surgery to complain about the procedures of armed forces discipline. In those few cases, it was not the individual service man or woman, but a member of the family—usually the wife or partner, occasionally the mother—who came to see me.

<P>
I make that important point because later in the Bill I shall argue that the number of cases subject to appeal will be much larger than originally planned. At the moment, I shall restrict myself to the amendment and argue that the present structure of summary hearings, in which the commanding officer has the right to hear individual cases, works extremely well, so it is inappropriate to change it. Change will be expensive, taking resources from the defence budget, and will undermine the disciplinary structure of the armed forces. In its place will be a system that seeks to be independent and fair, but which will provide an opportunity to complain against the chain of command.

<P>
Amendment No. 123 would delete the words

<P>
Before dealing summarily with a charge
and insert the words:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>After dealing summarily with a charge and having found the charge proved, but before imposing sentence.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That would maintain the crucial respect that individuals within the armed forces have for the existing structure of the administration of justice. The amendments were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate, who also has wide and personal experience of the armed forces and a sound knowledge of the administration of justice system within the Army. They would be most helpful, as I said, for maintaining the current structure of respect.

<P>
I therefore support the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key). I look forward to hearing the Minister's response, but I doubt whether I shall be persuaded by him. My mind is open to hear his representations, but I presently feel that the arguments in favour of the amendments are persuasive.

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I apologise for my apparent failure to provide access to video links. We looked into the problem. I thought that we should leave no stone unturned. Unfortunately, the equipment we used for the trial was hired and is no longer in our possession. When one thinks about that it is quite natural. We will enter a proper system of purchasing once we have decided exactly what we want to use.

<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Can the Under-Secretary give the Committee an absolute assurance that this absence of equipment will never occur when the process is working in practice?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Like any Minister, I would hesitate to give an absolute assurance on anything that is outside my direct influence. As far as I know, that would be the case. The equipment will be available where it is likely to be needed.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Clause 11 inserts a new section into the Army and Air Force Acts of 1955 to alter the process of electing trial by court martial. The availability of a right to choose to be tried by court martial, instead of being dealt with summarily, is long established. The right to make that choice was extended by the Armed Forces Act 1996, so that it became available to all individuals facing summary proceedings in the Army and Royal Air Force. In the Royal Navy it was accepted that this change should not be made, because of the need to be able to deal with minor disciplinary problems at sea quickly. Nevertheless, there is at present in the Royal Navy the right to elect trial by court martial for the more serious offences capable of being dealt with summarily.

<P>
As the hon. Gentleman is well aware, the Bill proposes to establish a summary appeal court. Apart from what the Government see as the intrinsic fairness of providing a proper mechanism for appealing against summary findings, this new procedure is necessary to put beyond doubt the question of compatibility with the convention. The advice we have is that the measures taken in the 1996 Act to extend the right of election to trial by court martial were not sufficient for that purpose. Although a step in the right direction, they meant that an individual who elected to be dealt with summarily was closing himself off from the possibility of eventual access to a compliant court. That is why we have introduced the right to appeal in the Bill.

<P>
However, we do not wish there to be any confusion between the new right of appeal and the existing right to elect trial by court martial. There could be confusion if we leave the procedures for electing trial by court martial as they are because, in the Army and Royal Air Force, the accused is not given the right to elect trial by court martial until after the commanding officer has found the charge proved and that procedure may be considered to have some of the characteristics of an appeal. So it is to avoid any confusion that we have drafted clause 11 to provide that the accused will have the right to elect trial by court martial prior to the commencement of any summary dealings. That will bring the Army and Royal Air Force into line with the procedure that already operates in the Royal Navy, where the accused has the right to elect trial by court martial at the beginning of the summary process.

<P>
We have confidence in the new arrangements for the simple reason that the new procedures in the Army and Royal Air Force will mirror those procedures relating to the point at which an individual may elect trial by court martial already in operation in the Royal Navy. The amendments are similar in effect to amendments that were tabled at the Committee stage in another place, although they go further this time in seeking to change the system in the Navy so that it falls in line with the other two services. We believe that our proposals should be left as it is because it will enable the accused to elect to be dealt with by a compliant court from the outset. My colleague, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, gave an assurance in another place that the new procedures will be monitored closely once they have been introduced. She undertook to consider options for remedial action if it became clear that there was a need for modification. I am happy to repeat that assurance today, but I am afraid that I cannot go further than that and I cannot accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) made a powerful point based on his long experience. I can confirm that in nearly 17 years as the Member of Parliament for Salisbury, which includes a number of garrison towns, I have had hardly any complaints about service discipline and the way the present system works. Some might say that I would say that or that it would have been kept quiet. However, in that sort of community it is difficult to keep these things quiet because people do not all live behind the wire. They are part of our communities and we tend to hear about these things.

<P>
The Minister said that there are advantages for the accused in having access to a compliant court from the outset. I take his point, but the amendments would remove that. The hon. Gentleman said that the Government would monitor the new procedures and consider possible remedial action if necessary. That underlines once more the point that all this is goldplating, or going over the top, as noble and gallant Lords have said many times in the other place.

<P>
The Select Committee on Defence has also drawn attention to these problems. It was most concerned about the matter. It looked at the number of courts martial and summary proceedings over some years. The number of courts martial in the Army rose between 1996 and 1999 from 374 to 395. That is not a startling increase but it was already a trend upwards, even before the Bill was introduced. The number of summary proceedings in the Army had dropped substantially over the same years. Trends are appearing.

<P>
The Defence Select Committee said on page ix, paragraph 18:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We were concerned that these provisions might mean that without the risk of incurring a more severe punishment, more personnel might elect for trial by court-martial. This might mean that courts-martial would be dealing with quite trivial offences, possibly leading to a backlog of cases, therefore delays in justice being administered.
That is the problem. The option of courts martial from an early stage could have the reverse effect of what the Government intended. It would clog up the system and the accused's human rights would be diminished.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): The hon. Gentleman quoted the Select Committee's report, but only in part.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Yes, there are pages more.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> We took evidence from witnesses. Another sentence in the paragraph states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The witnesses did not believe this would be the case. Courts-martial would be able to award sentences within the ``range of parameters of avialable punishment.''
It then explains what the witnesses said. The hon. Gentleman will see that the evidence did not back up what he is now saying.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> One advantage of a Select Committee is that its members can examine an issue carefully and in detail. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) has managed to read half a paragraph ahead of me. If he had not intervened, I would have quoted that paragraph. I am therefore delighed that he is not only contributing to the debate—we welcome that from Labour Members, who have hardly opened their mouths in two weeks—but is actually paying attention and is entirely to the point. Following the penultimate sentence of paragraph 18 which the hon. Gentleman read, the report continues.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Minister argued that if an accused opts for trial by court-martial—<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not a risk-free option because it is the maximum that could be awarded by the Commanding Officer under the summary system, not necessarily the same punishment as he might have awarded.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Select Committee then discussed the basis of surveys conducted by the Army at Colchester. The hon. Member for Ilford, South probably will not like this. The report states that the Committee was

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>told that it was likely that the possibility of a more severe punishment would remain as a disincentive; the majority of personnel believed it remained quite high-risk to go straight to a court-martial.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is my point, and it is the reason that the amendments are important. The hon. Gentleman had a jolly nice bit of fun but what he said was completely irrelevant to the fact that going straight to court martial poses a high risk. We do not think that it is a good idea.

<P>
I am completely unconvinced by what the Minister said. Our amendments would have improved the Bill substantially. We have had a sad record throughout the Committee stage. Each time we have tried to propose an improvement to the Bill, we have been told either that the Minister has no obligation to say anything at all by way of explanation—as on one occasion—or that the Government will do it their way in any case. That is not a constructive way to conduct the Committee stage of a Bill. I hoped that the Minister would change his mind but he has not done so. Therefore—my hon. Friend the Minister for Gosport agrees with me—we will have to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 125, in page 33, line 25, at end insert

<P>
if the accused was legally represented when he withdrew his election for court-martial with leave.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The amendment was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate. These sections of the Army Act 1955 and the Air Force Act 1955 are designed to prevent an accused electing for court-martial, withdrawing the election and then throwing the process into chaos by electing for court-martial again, thereby effectively spinning matters out. The sections are clearly laudable. However, an accused's decision to withdraw his election by court martial could prejudice his position if his change of mind was not made on the basis of legal advice. The amendment would protect the position of people who elect for court martial but then withdraw their election and find themselves being judged in a summary discipline procedure with no exit route. Therefore should not we consider whether such a decision was made without the benefit of legal advice?

<P>
Under the amendment, an accused could be committed to the summary justice system after having withdrawn his election for court martial only if he withdrew that election on the basis of legal advice. This is an important point. We are putting a more complicated system into effect for Her Majesty's forces, and it is not fair to make the legal processes more difficult, not to have available in theatre the type of legal advice that would be available in a garrison town in this country, and to allow an accused to put himself in a position that is clearly against his own interests. The amendment would be some proof against an appeal later on that ground. It is a simple question of the protection of service personnel in circumstances in which a soldier might make a rash decision, the consequences of which he does not understand which could have a serious effect on his future career.

<P>
If we want to give Her Majesty's forces better human rights, we have to recognise that military law is entirely different from civilian law and there is no question, even under the Bill, of the position of a member of Her Majesty's forces being anything like comparable to that of a constituent who, in the course of his daily business, finds himself before a court. They system is separate. The consequences of appearing in Colchester magistrates court as a civilian would be entirely different from those of appearing before a commanding officer or a court martial as a service man or woman. The amendments would protect service men and women in such circumstances.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I support the amendment. Subsection (5), enabling the accused to make a further application for court martial trial, will apply only if the accused was legally represented when he withdrew his election for court martial with leave to do so. It is entirely appropriate to encourage the accused to be legally represented at an early stage to enable him to be informed about the process in which he is involved.

<P>
As one of the modest number of lawyers present, Mr. Malins, you would probably agree with me that there is confusion between criminal and civil law. People simply do not understand the language of law and they approach it with diffidence, shyness and uncertainty, as they do the profession of medicine.

<P>
The most famous example of public ingnorance of the law is that well-known statement, ``Trespassers will be prosecuted''. On his land in Whitchurch in Hampshire, Lord Denning put up signs saying, ``Trespassers cannot be prosecuted'', which is the truth. Trespass is not a crime; it is a civil right which has been abused. It is incorrect to say that trespassers will be prosecuted because prosecution is a procedure that relates to the criminal law and trespass is a civil act. If a person trespasses on someone's land, the owner of that land has the right to ask the person to leave or to use minimal force to ensure that he or she does so. What the landowner cannot do is to prosecute the trespasser. There is widespread confusion about the matter; some people do not know and some do not care. Ministers have within their ranks someone who in the past was not only a trespasser but a squatter; that is the kind of person whom the Government choose to make a Minister in the other place. Perhaps they do not care very much about the legal procedures.

<P>
Ignorance about legal procedures goes deep; people are baffled by mens rea, whether it exists or not. They do not understand the difference between ratio decidendi and obiter dicta; most people think that a pendente lite is a pendant light rather than a case that is pending. If an expensive edifice of legal procedure is being constructed, individuals should be legally represented.

<P>
I draw a parallel from my experience as a lawyer with my wife's experience as a doctor. She says that many of the people who come to see her—she is a cancer specialist—cannot take in the information that she gives them in one fell swoop and she therefore recommends that they bring along a friend with whom they can later discuss the advice that the doctor has given them.

<P>
It is extremely helpful for the accused who are subject to military discipline to have early legal advice; they should be guided through the structure that is being created. It would therefore be appropriate to accept the amendment. We should support the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate, who put his finger on an important point.

<P>
If the amendment is not accepted and the reference to legal advice is not included in the clause, the Government's crumbling retreat on legal procedures in respect of the armed forces will be more extensive and it will be necessary to introduce further proposals for the accused to be represented by lawyers. The history of the Bill shows that the Government are withdrawing in the face of demands placed upon them by the European convention on human rights. They are making concession after concession to those who use the convention to demand greater objectivity and independence rather than using the paternalistic system that has worked so well until now.

<P>
I urge the Government to accept the amendment; if they fail to do so I suspect that the Minister appearing before the Committee considering the next armed forces Bill—it will be appointed in January next year or soon thereafter—will make further concession to satisfy the European convention on human rights. For those reasons, I urge the Government to accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell </B>(Tatton): I apologise for arriving a little late to the Commitee this morning. I suffer from a rare and disabling psychiatric disorder: a horror of long speeches, including my own, so I shall be brief.

<P>
It is no handicap to the Committee that it is not over-freighted with lawyers. All that is needed is common sense and a profound sympathy with the military, its peculiar disciplines and the peculiar sacrifices that those who serve in the military are sometimes called upon to make in their daily lives.

<P>
I know from my wide experience in the matter that accused soldiers, sailors and airmen and women find the military procedures more intimidating than the civilian equivalents. The penalties also seem harsher. The Committee should do everything that it can to safeguard and improve the rights of serving men and women. I support the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Jane Kennedy):</B> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Malins.

<P>
Opposition Members are stretching the point as their case is rather weak. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Members for Salisbury, for Gosport and for Tatton (Mr. Bell) that it is important that men and women serving in the armed forces should have the best possible advice before deciding on the method of trial. We envisage that, after being informed of the charge, the accused will have a reasonable period in which to decide whether to be dealt with summarily or by court martial. During that time, the accused will have access to legal advice; if, having decided to be tried by court martial, he then considers changing his mind, he will, as a matter of practice, be encouraged to take legal advice.

<P>
The amendment would make it a statutory requirement for an individual to act on legal advice, and that is unnecessary. The individual must take important decisions, but there is no case for foisting legal advice on people who do not want it. We shall ensure that the guidance prepared for the Bill's enactment makes it clear that it is desirable for individuals to be encouraged to seek legal advice at all stages of the proceedings and before taking decisions that affect their mode of trial. I shall encourage my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> What a disappointing response. I am glad that the Minister believes that there should be a reasonable period in which the accused can decide between summary process and court martial, but what is a reasonable period? I do not want to dance on pinheads with the Minister—it would need a darn big pin. [Interruption.] I mean the Under-Secretary. I can think of nothing nicer than dancing on the head of a pin with the Parliamentary Secretary, but it is a pleasure that will no doubt be denied me. This is a serious matter. What is a reasonable period in Colchester is different in Pristina. That is an excuse, not a reason for resiting the amendments.

<P>
The hon. Lady says that a statutory requirement is unnecessary; the idea of the Army foisting legal advice on those who do not want it is an interesting thought. I return to the matter of the right to legal advice. What the Minister said flies in the face of her own code of practice on the right to legal advice. Paragraph 3.1 states:

<P>
Any suspect being interviewed by the Service police in conjunction with a Serious Service Offence may consult and communicate privately, whether in person, in writing or on the telephone with a Legal Adviser, who may be:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. A Legal Adviser of his own choice;

<P>
b. The duty solicitor (where a Duty Solicitor Scheme is in operation);

<P>
c. A Legal Adviser selected by him from a list of Legal Advisers who have indicated that they are available for the purpose of providing legal advice;

<P>
d. In certain overseas theatres a Service Legal Adviser.
That relates to a point that I made earlier. The Ministry of Defence seeks to extend human rights to service men and women. However, at the same time, it and the Lord Chancellor's Department are cutting back the availability of private legal advice.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The code of practice makes clear that members of Her Majesty's forces have a right to legal advice that is not part of the chain of command. Regrettably, some people believe that service legal advice is not independent. The Ministry therefore recognises the right to seek advice from private firms of solicitors. People should have independent legal advice if they want it.

<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Surely, the hon. Gentleman undermines his point by reading out sources from which legal advice may be drawn and by stating that there is a wide range of arrangements by which individuals may receive legal advice. As I have already said, they will be encouraged to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary, who is wholly right. However, everthing hinges on the little word ``may''. The system is getting complicated, so rather than using the word ``may'', perhaps we should use ``will'', as the accused is not in a voluntary position. Indeed, soliders might be under all sorts of pressure in all sorts of circumstances not to bother the chain of command by insisting on legal advice. That is understandable, given the position of the Army and other services.

<P>
However, that is beside the point. My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate has tabled some reasonable amendments, which would extend the human rights available to Her Majesty's forces. The Government would be wrong to resist them and we shall press them to a vote.

<P>
</FONT>Qeustion accordingly negatived.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> At present, accused people serving in the Army or the Royal Air Force may elect trial by court martial instead of being dealt with summarily by the commanding officer. In the Army and Air Force that right may be exercised only once the commanding officer has found the charge proved. Furthermore, a court martial has the power to award a greater sentence than the commanding officer.

<P>
The Armed Forces Act 1996 expended the right to elect trial by court martial as a result of concern that, on their own, summary proceedings may not be compliant with the European convention on human rights. It was considered that offering a wider right to ECHR-compliant court trial would meet such concerns.

<P>
The Bill reviews procedures for electing trial by court martial. From the outset, the accused will now have the right to be dealt with by a court complying with the convention. The accused will be offered that right prior to the commanding officer hearing evidence on the charge. The sentensing powers of the court martial are now being limited to those that a commanding officer could have exercised if he had the charge. That is dealt with in clause 12 and will ensure that the accused is not disadvantaged by electing trial by court martial.

<P>
The new procedure is damaging as it will slow down and delay armed forces' discipline. Many former service men have noted that the swift passage of military discipline is vital. If it is delayed, unit morale may be adversely affected. Furthermore, the Bill may encourage people to elect trial by court martial rather than by commanding officers, as the Defence Committee pointed out. That will have an adverse impact on commanding officers' authority, which is vital to unit cohesion and operational effectiveness.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
As I said earlier, the Defence Committee noted that the 1996 Act appeared to have resulted in cases dealt with by military court martial cases rising from 10 per cent. in 1996 to 20 per cent. in 1999. Statistical evidence points to fewer summary proceedings and a far higher proportion of courts martial. The system therefore risks getting clogged up. The Defence Committee invited the Under-Secretary to explain those changes during debate on the later stages of the Bill's progress: I hope that he will heed that request.

<P>
The existing system is not demonstrably non-compliant with the ECHR. During the Bill's passage through the other place, it was argued convincingly that changes to the discipline system resulting from the 1996 Act, making courts marial ECHR-compliant would suffice. Those changes were made in response to an ECHR ruling that a court martial convened and presided over by a higher military authority was not independent and impartial.

<P>
In the other place, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, a former chief of defence said that if

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a soldier can have free and direct access to a European Convention on Human Rights compliant court—that is a courts martial, with its own right of appeal—the right of appeal against the commanding officer's summary sentence to a special court would seem to be superfluous.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 366.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We agree. When the Bill reached the Report stage in the House of Lords, Lord Carver made an uncharacteristic retreat when he withdrew his amendments. He said that he had received legal advice indicating

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that if the existing retained arrangements for the Army and Air Force Acts over election for trial by court martial at the end of summary proceedings rather than at the beginning were to remain, we would almost lose the case at the European Court, even if we did not lose at a court in this country.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Lord Carver continued:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the course of that being considered by the European Court, the danger is that the whole issue of whether summary proceedings were themselves in conformity with the convention on human rights might be brought into question.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 18 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 982.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That raises the question of the application of the ECHR to military matters. Could it strike so deep into military affairs that it would render the bulk of armed forces discipline illegal?

<P>
The Under-Secretary's lawyers are taking that view, but we are not so sure. During the Committee stage of the debate in the other place, the distinguished Scottish lawyer, Lord Campbell of Alloway said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no binding system of judicial precedent. Instead, there is a system of overriding flexility in which each case is decided on its own facts and merits.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 367.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We should also remember that some countries have obtained reservations on ratifying the convention so that their military forces are not affected by the ECHR. That is a point that the national media have now latched on to and realised that there is quite a problem for us. A notable example is the reservation obtain by France on its accession in 1974. The United Kingdom did not obtain such a reservation when it acceded to the ECHR in 1951. There is no provision for doing this retrospectively. The Defence Select Committee asked the Minister to comment on a suggestion that as the summary justice system was such a vital element of service discipline an alternative way of dealing with the problem of compliance would be to leave the ECHR and rejoin, with a reservation, in relation to armed forces discipline.

<P>
The Minister for the Armed Forces said:

<P>
that would be a theoretical possibility but one that does not seem to have commended itself to any Government since 1951. It is a theoretical possibility but the question we would then have to face as to the application to join at that time and the great complications that would be involved means it is a fairly far out possibility.
The Select Committee noted that that course of action did not appear to have been considered actively. It looked forward to the Government addressing it during the Bill's further stages. We have reached the opportunity for the Minister to accede to the request of the Select Committee on Defence in considering this matter.

<P>
Seeing as matters pertaining to the ECHR are so crucial to the Bill—indeed, it is the sole reason for the Bill's existence—The Committee should expect a statement from the Minister about the Ministry of Defence's views on the ECHR. There has been a steady chipping away in recent years of many elements of our military ethos and the Minister really must draw a line in the sand. My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport made that point very forcefully. The chipping away must stop or it will continue in the Armed Forces Bill and this Bill may have to be amended subsequently.

<P>
What would cause the Ministry of Defence to recommend seriously that Britain should, in some way or another, engineer a derogation or reservation from the ECHR on military matters? Given that it is theoretically possible to leave and rejoin in a day, what is the Government's thinking on this? We are owed some clarity here. I cannot believe that the Government have not considered that at some point. It is not credible that the lawyers have not considered whether to give advice to Ministers one way or another on this issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> The hon. Gentleman was a Member of Parliament under the previous Government and, given his close association with defence matters, perhaps he could give us some insights into the attitudes of Tory Members up until 1977 on this issue?

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I was never a Defence Minister and so I cannot oblige. I do not doubt that Ministers sought advice on just that sort of point. I assume that Ministers in this Government will have done exactly the same.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem with the European Court is that it is incremental and irreversible and that, therefore, the British Government are obliged to consider every case that comes along? We may disagree so strongly with the judgment of the court in a case that we would want to seek a derogation. The Bill may well be that sort of turning point where we should be considering those options.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. The Ministry must take a stand on this at some point. It is an astonishing process that leads us to have our entire military system of law overturned, and, I would allege, in many cases undermined. What is the real risk here of our entire summary justice system being called into question? Is it a big risk or small risk? What is it in percentage terms? Is it a 50 per cent. risk, a 90 per cent. risk, a 10 per cent. risk? It is not something that we can ignore. If it is not a big risk, he should look again at the Bill.

<P>
We know that safeguards already exist, put in place by the Armed Forces Act 1996. Surely we can count on those safeguards until at least the quinquennial Act next year. In the Select Committee evidence session, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces also confirmed that neither he nor anyone else could guarantee that no further amendments to the service discipline Acts would be necessary in the future to ensure compliance with the ECHR. That is not at all an unreasonable position. In doing so, however, he backs up our point—that it is vital for the Ministry of Defence to draw a line with regard to our military's relationship with the ECHR. If not, we may find ourselves in this Committee Room annually tweaking and fiddling with various aspects of legislation relating to our armed forces and the way they are run. I do not relish that prospect and I am sure that neither does the Minister.
 
<P>
We need to remember that there are other NATO partner nations who operate on an entirely different system of military justice or, indeed, none at all—relying only upon civilian law. There is an agenda running which wishes us to go in that direction. I do not for one moment accuse the Government of joining that agenda or supporting it in any way. However, there is an agenda running.

<P>
As the Defence Select Committee noted,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Human rights jurisprudence is evolving, and its application is not an exact science.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The danger is that we will end up trying to continually second-guess the ECHR on the advice of Government lawyers. That is what we are doing in the Bill today. We think that the 1996 provisions may not have gone far enough, so we will go a bit further, do a bit of gold-plating, and hope that it will stop any challenges. Rather than waiting for the challenges to emerge.

<P>
I do hope, therefore, that the Minister will give us his assurance that if this legislation is passed, it will be the final concession to the ECHR and that the Government really will square up to the importance of the ECHR for the future of military discipline. If he is unable to give that assurance, we will loathe to support this clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I wonder how many Members of the Committee feel confident that they know the kind of person they are dealing with when we talk about ``the accused''. I wonder, for instance, how many Members of the Committee, have had the opportunity of visiting Colchester detention centre, which is the main Army detention centre. If any member of the Committee has visited Cochester at any time, I would be most grateful if they would make themselves known to me now so that we can assess what knowledge the Committee has on the subject.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I have visited Colchester, in fact I did so with my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport, during the passage of the previous Armed Forces Bill and we learned a huge amount. I do not think that there was a single member of any political party who attended that visit to Colchester who was unimpressed, as well as unmoved, by what it is doing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury. This is an important point. There may be members of the Committee who think that when they see the words ``the accused'' we are talking about some kind of Bill Sykes character—someone who is evil. How should we punish that person? They may not know the social implications that underpin ``the accused''. Those of us who visited Colchester were struck by the fact that in almost every case, the people detained in Colchester who had been through the judicial process in the armed forces and had been found needing detention were there for similar reasons. They were all young men—because women are noted for not falling foul of the judicial system in the armed forces. We were dealing with young men who stand up straight and are respectful but whose background involved, in almost every case, matrimonial difficulty or some problem with the person with whom he had been living. Another element is financial difficulty. Sometimes that relates to the matrimonial difficulty because the partner may be responsible for the financial difficulty. The third element is alcohol. Almost every case of an individual detained at Colchester involved a mixed-up chap who had got into trouble and a bit of a mess because of a woman, money and/or drink.

<P>
We are not really dealing with the normal pattern of criminal activity. We are dealing with young and lively people who are trained to be fit, and often trained to kill. They are trained to be aggressive in controlled circumstances and there is a strong social element to their crimes. That is why it is important that they are judged in a paternalistic manner by people who know them and who can take account of their background. We are dealing with not only crime and punishment, but individuals who have got things wrong and who need to be brought back on the rails.

<P>
I remember a story from my time as a Territorial Army officer. One evening, two rather shabby men turned up at the TA unit with a warrant for the arrest of one of my men, for failure to pay the instalments on a large and expensive motorbike. That baffled us, because he had seven children and we wondered how he could afford an expensive motorbike. We tried to detain the bailiffs in another room, and gave them a cup of coffee while we called in the man and cross-examined him on why he had bought an expensive motorbike when he had a wife and so many children. Why had he not bought a large car or a small van for transporting his family? His reply—which sticks in my memory—was, ``I don't like my wife.''

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
That man had financial and matrimonial difficulties, and drink may also have been a problem. We were able to iron him out. We found the money, paid the bailiffs and tried to put him back on the rails. If, at the appropriate moment, he had heard a seductive whisper that said, ``You need to remember the European convention on human rights and get legal advice,'' he might have been caught in the courts system and had great difficulties. Being able to iron people out is an important part of the summary justice procedure.

<P>
Let us compare the 1999 numbers for summary proceedings in the armed forces with those for courts martial. In the Navy, 1,806 cases went to summary proceedings, of which only 56 went to courts martial. In the Army, 2,112 cases went to summary proceedings, of which only 395 went to courts martial. In the Royal Air Force 1,343 cases went to summary proceedings, of which only 58 went to courts martial. Summary proceedings overwhelmingly outnumber courts martial.

<P>
I echo the views expressed in another place by Lord Craig of Radley, the former Chief of the Defence Staff and notable marshal of the RAF. He said that the approach in the Bill, and especially that in clause 11,

<P>
tends to undermine the importance of courts martial in the overall spread of legal arrangements that the services have. Historically, a courts martial is seen as a much more important court than any form of summary jurisdiction. I do not like to see a courts martial being placed in the position of having no greater tariff at its disposal than a lower summary court.
The noble Lord thought that the position of the commanding officer would be undermined. He referred to the Lord Chancellor's statement that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there was flexibility in the human rights convention and that it posed no threat to the effectiveness of the Armed Forces.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 364.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
and he urged the Lord Chancellor to clarify that point and to ensure flexibility.

<P>
If there is no flexibility, and if we must proceed along the route that the Bill sets out, I urge that we accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury said. We are nearing the point at which we will tolerate no further intrusions by the European convention on human rights on the administration of our armed forces. The Bill places severe personnel and financial burdens on the armed forces, and I urge that the clause should not stand part.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> We have reached an important provision, which alters the system of summary justice for our armed forces. The Government have told us that the raison d'être for doing so is that we must comply with the European Court of Human Rights, but they have not told us whether they believe that the European court's judgment is entirely necessary.

<P>
Many Lords have been cited and quoted—I shall do so later—but those who have the most knowledge of armed forces' discipline say that the existing system of justice is perfectly adequate. It is all very well the Government saying that we must implement the European convention—indeed, we are under treaty obligation to do so—but we should consider whether the European court's judgments are entirely necessary or right. We automatically incorporate into our law whatever judgments the European court hands down; we never even question intellectually whether it is necessary to do so.

<P>
The system of discipline in the armed forces has developed over centuries and has been refined by our courts. Appeals can take place more frequently under the 1996 Acts. However, a change to the system is proposed in the Bill whereby the right to appeal to a court martial involves no more serious a sentence than if an officer had been dealt with summarily by his commanding officer. Therefore, what is the disincentive to prevent barrack-room lawyers from misusing the court martial system, rather than have a case dealt with by summary appeal?

<P>
The essence of the debates in the Chamber about the right to trial by jury or summary trials in magistrates courts revolves around that point. It is a fundamental tenent of that system that, if people choose not to be dealt with summarily and opt for trial by jury, they may receive a more serious sentence. We should build into the system a disincentive, especially in relatively minor cases, to discourage people from misusing the panoply of court martial proceedings. Having said that, I am certain that most serving Army officers would rather have relatively minor disciplinary cases dealt with summarily so that they can get them out of the way and serve their sentences, but a few will want to drag matters on unnecessarily by using the panoply of provisions laid down in the Bill. We are perhaps creating a rod for our own back in the armed forces.

<P>
Under the old system, instead of charging someone who had committed a relatively minor offence in the heat of important operation, the commanding officer would have said, ``Look Jones, don't be so damn silly. Don't do it again.'' I am concerned that the type of turning a blind eye is incremental—every case chips away at discipline in our armed forces. Our armed forces operate on the basis of unswerving obedience to their commanding officers. I am not a soldier, but I have studied, by various means, how the armed forces work. The commanding officer knows the overall picture, but in the heat of an operation it is not always possible to tell every soldier the raison d'être for each action. There are times, especially if things go wrong, when a soldier must unswervingly obey the commands of his commanding officer. We should not create a culture in which people say, ``I may obey my commanding officer, but I may not. If I don't, I will have the full panoply of the law, including the courts martial arrangements, behind me.'' That would cause some difficulties.

<P>
The Minister should give a cast-iron reason for not retaining the system of summary justice for cases up to a certain severity. That approach was adopted in the service discipline Acts. There should be a summary right of justice, under which the commanding officer could deal with the situation. The summary appeal courts, which we shall discuss later, would still be available. Having the right of appeal to a court martial for a relatively minor offence takes the system of appeals and rights to justice too far.

<P>
It is ironical that the Government want on the one hand to restrict civilians' rights for relatively minor cases—they will be dealt with summarily by magistrates courts, not before a jury in a Crown court—and on the other to offer members of the armed forces, who operate under a different disciplinary system, an extended right in this context because the European Court of Human Rights said that they should do so.

<P>
Is there a mechanism for having discussions with the European Court of Human Rights? How does the system work? The Findlay case was handed down and we were obliged, under our treaty obligations, to amend our law. We should be able to say to the European Court, ``Look here, we have the most effective armed forces in the world. Your judgment was wrong, for various reasons.'' I described those reasons earlier. Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary, who could have given useful guidance in this respect, is not here.

<P>
I have reams of relevant information to hand, but I do not want to quote all of it. The evidence that I have given has come summarily from memory. Most of our most senior ex-armed forces officers believe that the Bill's approach is gilding the lily. If the Minister does not give us a precise answer, my right hon. and hon. Friends will return to this matter on Report. Do we need to have the right of appeal in all cases, no matter how petty the offence?

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I do not doubt that Opposition Members will return to this matter at great length on Report, irrespective of what I say.

<P>
I shall try to cover as many of the points that have been raised as possible. We seek to comply with the European Court of Human Rights—that requirement was incorporated into British law this year, and it was our duty so to do. The Bill provides a tightly drawn example of the way in which we shall do that in the armed forces. Two points are at issue in this context: an appeal court for summary findings, and the timing of elections for a court martial.

<P>
It was suggested that our decisions may be illegal. I doubt whether they are illegal, but they are certainly challengeable. That is why the present system is inadequate, and why we want to make progress in this regard.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Before the Under-Secretary dismisses the matter, will he explain what discussion mechanism is available? When the European Court makes a new landmark judgment, is the matter discussed with the judges to establish how British law should be amended to make it compliant with the ruling? Or do Ministers and parliamentary draftsmen simply say, ``I think that we should do this, and perhaps we should increase it incrementally a little to make sure that our compliance with the European Court is copper-bottomed''?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I cannot say that and I do not intend to. It is not relevant to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Of course it is.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That is a matter of debate, not of fact, as the hon. Gentleman well knows.

<P>
I want to make two points on the mare's nest of more courts martial. First, the accused will have no reason in future to have anything to fear from choosing to be dealt with by his commanding officer, because we are instituting a court of appeal against the decisions. Therefore, there will be no pressure on him in his own mind to move to court martial. He knows that, if he feels he has been wrongly treated, he has recourse to a compliant court to deal with his fears.

<P>
Secondly, I want to refer to Brigadier Ritchie's evidence to the Defence Committee. He said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as far as we can see into the minds of those who might be future miscreants—and we have done quite a lot of interviews with people residing at Her Majesty's pleasure in Colchester just to get a feel for it—their view is, very much as the Minister said, that they would expect a court-martial to give towards the top end of its powers, admittedly the same as Commanding Officers. They would rather chance it and go in front of the Commanding Officer, see what punishment is meted out, knowing that they then have a right of appeal to a summary appeal court.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Therefore, the professional opinion is that there will be no increased recourse to courts martial as a result of the provision. It is merely a matter of introducing additional safeguards.
 
<P>
Incremental law is not just the prerogative of the European Court of Human Rights. Incremental changes in the law always take place, as case law shows. One of the features of English law that differentiates it from Scottish law is that precedent is frequently cited. Law does change incrementally. Sometimes it changes more dramatically than the Government would like.

<P>
There is nothing special about the European Court of Human Rights. I did not notice many Conservative Members voting against their Government when decisions from the European courts were incorporated in the past. When courts find against them, by and large Governments rightly comply with court orders. That is what they are for. I seem to remember an inordinate number of occasions when the British courts found against the previous Government, who had to comply with their rulings, to their great embarassment on many occasions. That is standard practice, and where the law has to be changed, we do our duty to comply with it. As it is being incorporated in British law this year, clearly we see the need to do it in parallel, so that it can also come into effect this year.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> But the difference between the European system and the British system is that the House of Lords can overturn its own judgments. It is a British court adjudicating on British citizens, whereas the European court is composed of judges of different nationalities; it does not overrule its own judgments and its law tends to be incremental and reversible.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I see nothing wrong with the court comprising experts on the law from different countries. In a way, that is an additional safeguard which enables it to come to decisions that are generally in keeping with the ethos of the society in which we live. Therefore, I reject the hon. Gentleman's proposition totally.

<P>
We believe that it is a right to comply with the Europe convention on human rights. The hon. Gentleman clearly does not, and we disagree on that. We shall continue to disagree, even if he brings it up on every clause stand part debate on the Bill. That is our decision.

<H4><center>Limit on powers of courts-martial where accused elected court-martial trial</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 34, line 4, leave out ``shall not award any'' and insert ``may award a''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 129, in page 34, line 22, leave out ``shall not award any'' and insert ``may award a''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The Bill clearly undermines the position of commanding officers and the discipline system in the Army. I know that the use of the word ``undermines'' is contentious. Those who defend the legislation say that it does not udnermine the armed forces; indeed, the Minister for the Armed Forces has frequently said that it is strengthening because if we did not have it, we would be challenged in the European Court and so on. That is the Government's view, but our view is different. We believe—and it is a widely held perception—that the entire Bill udnermines the chain of command.
<P>
I am prepared to believe that Ministers have discussed the matter with the Chief of the Defence Staff and other senior officers in all three services, who have said that they could make the proposal work. I am sure that they will make it work. In a sense, it is their job to agree that they can deliver. That is why they have as much scrambled egg as they do. It goes with the rations. However, it is difficult to maintain the balance between achieving the targets that have been agreed with the higher echelons and explaining to operation levels lower down the chain of command, such as that of lieutenant colonel, how they are to be achieved and delivered.

<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> Before my hon. Friend leaves the point about the Chief of the Defence Staff and the chiefs of individual services, does he agree that it has been invaluable that until recently former Chiefs of the Defence Staff have always been invited to accept nobility and to join the House of Lords? Having former Chiefs of the Defence Staff in the House of Lords has been extremely valuable in giving us the view of someone with vast experience of defence matters but the objectivity that comes with no longer being in post. Does my hon. Friend also agree that all the former Chiefs of the Defence Staff in the House of Lords were unanimous in their view that the Bill posed a threat to the structure of the armed forces and that the Government should reconsider it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. They did say that. They qualified, to various degrees, their acceptance of the inevitability of the proposed changes. My hon. Friend is also absolutely right about the value of having former service chiefs in the other place. I began our proceedings today by quoting the noble and gallant Lord Bramall who cited an early 19th century general in support of his contention that the mere fact that someone is a former chief of staff does not mean that he is out of touch with military thinking. Former Chiefs of the Defence Staff are not some fuddy-duddy group of former service men with a distorted view of what things are like now. They represent the continuity of the tradition of former members of all three services being in the upper House. I regret that we cannot ensure better representation of Her Majesty's forces in the House and that Ministers, through no fault of their own, have not had the opportunity of serving in the forces. That is not a criticism; it is just the way the cookie crumbles. We have so successfully promoted peace in Europe over the past half-century, almost entirely thanks to the NATO alliance, that very few hon. Members have served in the armed forces in any capacity.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> While the hon. Gentleman is accurate in what he said about Ministers, two of my brothers, my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law have served in the armed forces.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> That is a notable and extraordinary record that I am sure could not be equalled by any other hon. member. It is therefore clear that the Parliamentary Secretary is never short of military advice from her own family members. I hope that she has thoroughly consulted them about the legislation and can assure us that she has accepted their advice. She nods in assent. I am sure that they will be glad to read that their advice has been accepted and included in the Bill.

<P>
The armed forces parliamentary scheme has its annual dinner next Monday in Speaker's House and no doubt some members of the Committee will be present. The scheme has done a great deal to try to keep the House in touch with the realities of military life. It is inconceivable that any Member of Parliament does not have a constituent in the armed forces.

<P>
The Government's argument about the legislation was that, for the accused to have a genuine choice between summary dealing and court martial, the punishment available to the court martial could not be more than that available to the commanding officer. My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate tabled the amendment because of that extraordinary proposition. The Government's case is that, because the summary justice system is not compliant, one could not use the parallel between a magistrates court and a Crown court. If one appeals at the earliest stage of a magistrates court trial for a Crown court trial, one knows that the outcome could be worse because the stakes are higher. I fail to see why that should not apply to the military as well.

<P>
The accused has an opportunity to be tried in a compliant court that has a range of punishments available, as laid down in statute, to match the seriousness of the charges made. We have already heard that one of the problems is that the proposed system could lead to the gumming-up of the courts by trivial cases that would normally have been heard summarily. Most soldiers would have accepted such summary dealing, but they might now feel some pressure to raise the stakes and go to a court martial.

<P>
It is for the benefit of the accused that he has the opportunity, albeit in a non-compliant system, to have charges heard before a commanding officer, whose powers of punishment are more circumscribed. He can make a choice to have a convention-compliant trial if he so wishes. The fact that he will be given the facility to appeal against the commanding officer's decision is further proof against challenge. My hon. Friend's amendment restores sound common sense. It is also consistent with the civil law and is proof against the convention in cases brought under it. The proposals are straightforward, and the Government simply have not made a case in this House or the other place for saying that the extraordinary position should be that a worse sentence could not be meted out by the court martial than by the commanding officer. The amendment is an opportunity for the Government to explain themselves.

<P>

<B>Mr. Martin Bell:</B> I was impressed to hear of the Parliamentary Secretary's military connections and I hope that some of them were with the other ranks. In this House, we pay too much attention to the officer class. I speak as someone who has been a dedicated other-rank troublemaker and barrack-room lawyer in my time. I hope that the hon. Lady can find time this evening to attend my Adjournment debate on former far east prisoners of war, which concerns military culture and the sacrifices that are made.

<P>
It, too, have been struck by the difference in the nature of the advice that comes from the former, now ennobled, Chiefs of the Defence staff, and the men now in post. With what degree of reluctance or enthusiasm have the changes been embraced at that level? I always listen with great care to what the Parliamentary Secretary says, and will vote in line with the quality of her assurances.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> After the Under-Secretary's rather boorish and bullying reply to my last intervention, perhaps we will get a better response this time. We made a perfectly reasonable request to know what discussions took place with the European Court to ensure that the Bill was compliant with the convention. He was plain wrong to dismiss that request summarily, and tell us that that was nothing to do with the Committee. I hope that he will be able to do better when he replies in this debate.

<P>
I come back to what I said on the previous clause, when we discussed the question of service men who opt for trial by court martial rather than have their case summarily dealt with by the commanding officer. It is a fundamental tenet of civilian law that if one opts for trial in a higher court, the sentence meted out by that court should be more severe. For that reason, the court has a whole panoply of defending and prosecuting officials and a more elaborate procedure. When people opt for the court, they should be fully conversant with the fact that it can hand out a more severe sentence, or the whole ethos of service discipline will be undermined.

<P>
I have been on the armed forces parliamentary scheme with the Royal Air Force, and most service men whom I have met are decent, honest, down to earth people. If such people commit a relatively minor offence, most of them—as the Minister made clear—will want to be dealt with by their commanding officer. Unfortunately, however, there is an element, which I have come across in all three services, which could be called the awkward squad or the barrack-room lawyer squad. Those people may have been in the services for several years and become disillusioned, but have not reached the time when they can leave—they may be in their final year. I have seen such people in the RAF, who want to leave but cannot; perhaps they have not completed their period of contract, or perhaps they need to achieve a particular level of service to obtain a certain level of pension. Those people will want to take advantage of the full panoply of appeals and the court martial system laid out in the Bill, and there should be a provision to ensure that they know that they may receive a more severe sentence.

<P>
Will the Minister reconsider the matter? He has not accepted any of our amendments, and he may not accept this one. This has been a relatively good-tempered Committee, but it is incumbent on the Minister not to dismiss the Opposition with a wave of his hand, saying, ``I will not accept any of their amendments.'' Otherwise we may as well take the whole Bill formally and not bother with the Committee stage at all. We are here to debate the amendments sensibly and my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury has made a good case. I hope therefore that the Minister will consider accepting the amendment. If it is not fully legally compliant with the Bill, perhaps he can consider introducing something similar.

<P>
<B>Mr. Viggers:</B> We live in an increasingly litigious age. The number of claims for personal injury is rising all the time. We live in a society that knows its rights and will seek, rightly or wrongly, to ensure that they are upheld. I will refer to service men only because there are many more of them than service women—for masculine, hon. Members should read feminine and vice versa.

<P>
I said on Second Reading that a service man is likely to accept a judgment laid down by his commanding officer in summary procedures. Overwhelmingly, the evidence is that service men accept the current system of justice. However, drawing again on my constituency experience, I know that it is the family and, above all, the wife who tends to question summary justice. We can all take pride in the fact that our families probably have a higher regard for us than our employers do. In politics, most wives or husbands certainly feel surprised when their spouse is not promoted to an even higher office in the House of Commons. It is an endearing feature of life that wives feel that their husbands deserve greater recognition and that, if their husbands are subject to disciplinary proceedings, they are being unfairly treated. A wife's loyalty to her husband—and vice versa—is perhaps greater than the individual who is subject to discipline.

<P>
That leads me to believe that there will be strains and pressures. When an individual is subject to discipline, there will be pressure from the wife who says, ``They can't do that to you. I'm sure it wasn't bad as they say. They've misunderstood you dear; of course you must appeal.'' If the structure of the courts martial and appeal procedure means that there is nothing to be lost by going to courts martial, there will undoubtedly be more of them. As night follows day, I will show in future that I was right to say that the number of people who opt for courts martial—and accordingly the costs, delays and administrative burden on the armed forces—will be greater than the Government anticipate. I will remember that and come back to haunt the Minister. My hon. Friend's amendment is sensible and straightforward. It would be entirely sensible to make it clear to the accused that if he does elect court martial, the sentencing powers may be greater than those imposed by the commanding officer. If we do not have that check and balance, an extremely large number of appeals will go straight to courts martial which, for the reasons that I have given, would be disastrous. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I assure the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) that I always consider Opposition amendments carefully, quite apart from the fact that there is a grave risk that I will trip myself up if I do not. The fact that we do not generally accept them—in line with Government practice throughout the ages—does not mean that we do not consider them carefully. Like us, the hon. Gentleman may have noted wryly in the past that trenchant and logical arguments by the Opposition were ignored in Committee, but then magically reappeared, frequently in another place. I regret that I have not experienced that yet and I remain to be convinced.

<P>
I have given much thought to the provision and the Opposition make a fair point. I will outline our reasoning because the provision is part and parcel of the system that we are trying to introduce. In all the previous sittings, the hon. Member for Salisbury has tried to reassure me that his amendments are intended in good faith, and I am prepared to accept that. Again, this is a reasonable attempt at an improvement. However, the hon. Member for Reigate tabled two amendments that were identical in word and effect to those tabled in Committee in another place. My noble Friend, Baroness Symons, put forward very reasoned arguments in response to them. They were not voted on and I had hoped to persuade the hon. Gentlemen opposite not to re-submit them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> The reason they did not vote on them in the other place was because they knew we would vote on them here.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> That is often the case, I agree.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> Joined-up opposition.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> As Baroness Symons explained, we cannot condemn the clause on the basis that it is out of kilter with the civilian system. It is not always possible to make a direct comparison between the civilian system and ours. There, an accused facing the choice between trial by magistrate or in the Crown court does indeed face the possibility of a heavier sentence in the higher court. However, his choice is between two forms of trial that are both compatible with the European convention on human rights. There is that phrase again. I can almost see the Conservative Members' backs bristling. The choice is between two fully-compliant courts.

<P>
In the services, on the other hand, as has frequently been advanced, it may not be so easy to argue that summary dealings on their own are compatible with the convention. They can be made sound in convention terms by offering the alternative of trial by a compliant court and the right of appeal, hence the appearance of both of them in the form that we have chosen to put them in the Bill. The choise needs to be genuine and an accused is not compelled to put himself in jeopardy of greater punishment in order to secure their rights to a compliant court. To retain the power for a court martial to award a more severe sentence or, indeed, to allow the new summary appeal court to do so, would therefore not achieve the effect of bringing summary dealings within the scope of the convention.

<P>
We must remember, however, that election for court martial is not without risk from an accused's point of view. Although the court martial will be limited to the maximum sentencing powers available to the commanding officer, the accused would need to consider whether, within those powers, he is likely to receive a heavier sentence from the court or the CO. He will also face the risk, if he elects trial by court martial, that the prosecuting authority will consider that he could face a different charge. In this case, the accused may not be offered the option of election on a new charge in which case there would be no limitation on the sentencing powers of the court martial.

<P>
As was stressed time and time again, our main purpose is to ensure that the procedures for summary dealing remain as far as possible within the scope of the convention in order to permit the services to continue to be able to deal with matters summarily. We agree with Opposition Members that summary punishments are a good way of continuing: we are merely trying to make them compliant. The amendment would defeat that objective. It would place somebody in the position of having to gamble on whether they faced a more severe punishment. It would be improper to choose between a court that in some respects is non-compliant and one that is. Therefore, the amendments would not be of benefit.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Could the hon. Gentleman explain the Government's logic in the matter? On the one hand they are trying to give service men greater rights when dealing with summary justice to a higher court—in effect a court martial—but on the other, in the Chamber on another Bill, they are trying to restrict ordinary citizens' right of appeal to a Crown court. They will be dealt with summarily in a magistrates' court for a range of smaller offences. How can the two things be consistent?

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> As I said earlier, we are concerned that there should be an absolute parallel between civilian and military justice. We accept the need for summary punishment. As a Scotsman, I strongly resent the implication that improving the English system to bring it in line with ours is anything other than a good thing. I am the last member of the Committee to need convincing of that—or perhaps the second last. It is not a very good argument to advance to a Scotsman when we already have a system very similar to that being proposed. We do think the summary punishment system is worth preserving. We just want to make sure that it is compliant, which is why we are proceeding as we are.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> My hon. Friend, if I may refer to him as such, the Member for Tatton, is a most unlikely trouble-maker. The notion of him as an other-rank trouble-maker or barrack-room lawyer is beyond my comprehension. I note, however, that he will cast his vote according to the Under-Secretary's answer on the degree of enthusiasm with which senior officers embrace the changes—a matter that was not addressed at all.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold said that the new system will undermine the ethos of service discipline—and he is right. As a member of the armed forces parliamentary scheme for the Royal Air Force, he has spoken to many of the honest, decent people who serve in it. He rightly acknowledged that there will always be an awkward squad in all three services. Some service people want to leave, but do not—either because they are under contract or because they know that it is in their interest to stay longer and gain a better pension. Such people will want to use the range of available remedies.

<P>
Drafters of legislation sometimes fail to understand that enormous pressures are placed on our service men. We take for granted the stereotype of the tough soldier, who sometimes gets frustrated by the military system. In my Salisbury surgeries, I have encountered the toughest of tough staff sergeants with heart-rending personal cases, which, given that they are on a huge pedestal, they feel would be extremely damaging to pursue through the chain of command. A staff sergeant with a Child Support Agency problem came to my surgery. He was a linchpin of the Royal Artillery's training programme and was almost in tears as he explained the pressures that he faced in dealing with overstretch and meeting his professional commitments. He lived in the abject fear that his whole life would tumble and crumble around him because he did not have the time or expertise to cope with an unhappy marriage.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport spoke about our litigious age in which there is a culture of personal injury claims and rights to compensation. Families face pressures and the wives are particularly important in all these matters. A court martial is not, of course, a jury trial. Whether compliant or not, it is not the same as a jury trial. That is why the amendment is so sensible and straightforward as my hon. Friend put it.

<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the Opposition had not voted against the measure in another place. It caused wry amusement when I suggested that joined-up opposition meant pre-planning. Labour could certainly learn from the Conservatives in that respect, as we have always taken the House of Lords more seriously. If they had joined-up government between Lords and Commons they might have avoided some of the trouble that they face in another place now.

<P>
The Under-Secretary made a series of assertions. He did not address the issues or seek to satisfy our concerns. He read out a beautifully written brief—he has some jolly good writers and he should be grateful to them—but no one could possibly believe that it addressed the concerns that Opposition Members expressed in the debate.

<P>
We return to the fundamental point, which the Government will not accept. It was raised in another place by the noble Lord Campbell of Alloway, who argued that there was no evidence that the European Court of Human Rights would say that our military law, as amended in 1996, does not comply with the European convention.

<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is not a question of waiting for the courts to rule against us? If we believe on the basis of best legal advice that there is a chance of this happening, it is incumbent on us to make the change as timeously as possible. The last thing we want is to be forced into making hurried legislative changes in response to an adverse decision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> We have had this debate before. We have argued that the Government have been inconsistent. On the homosexuality issue, they waited to be taken to the European Court and it was there that, having lost the case, they decided that they would have to change their ways. In the present case they are saying, ``Let's run ahead of this. We don't want it to happen. Let's gold-plate it and go the extra mile to avoid this happening.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of the question put to the Defence Committee by the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes)? He said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Is there not an argument that people might elect to go to a court-martial as a way to avoid the punishment at an earlier stage, thereby delaying the system, and that the system itself becomes clogged up because of people electing to do this rather than having a system which would lead to more summary and speedier punishment for offences? Can you see my point? Is there not a danger that that might happen?<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Does my hon. Friend think that the hon. Member for Ilford, South will vote with us on the amendment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> I doubt it. He has not shown much free spirit yet and the Whip is sitting in front of him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not spoken.

<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> To be fair, the hon. Gentleman has spoken during the course of the morning, which is more than can be said for the Liberal Democrats, who have yet again failed to show up—[Interruption.] We are all agreed on that, but that is where our agreement ends. I am disappointed that our simple point has not been accepted and that there has been no adequate explanation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> We are in the realms of what I am sure the hon. Gentleman with an honest heart would accept. Some people may try to take advantage of the provisions, but the point is that, in general, the provisions should be made compliant. If people try to take advantage in future it may make things difficult. We do not think that it will, but only time will tell. I concede the hon. Gentleman's point, but it does not alter the need for the legislation or the way in which it has been framed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Key:</B> And that does not alter the need for the amendment to be accepted, therefore I shall vote in its favour.
