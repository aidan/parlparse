<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 11, line 33, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
I very much welcome the part II of the Bill, "Provisions of children". I supported the Protection of Children Act 1999, and served on the Committee that considered the Bill. We were aware at the time that there were gaps in the Government's programme for the protection of children that had to be filed. I have no problems with most of the measures in part II--in fact, I welcome them--but we have tabled a few amendments. The amendment under discussion repeats a familiar refrain from the Liberal Democrat about testing the order-making powers of the Secretary of State.
<P>
In schedule 4 there is already a long list of provisions for offences that would disbar someone from working with children in future. I would like to question the Minister on the abuse of trust provision mentioned in schedule 4(1)(j). My understanding is that as the paragraph refers to the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000--currently a Bill before Parliament--the provision is restricted to residential care workers and teachers, who are specifically mentioned in that legislation. I presume that the clause does not have the effect of widening that provision to include other people.
<P>
The amendment addresses the open-ended and unnecessary powers that the clause gives the Secretary of State to extend or modify the list of offences. There may be occasions when it will be possible to remove offences from the list--some things may no longer be treated as offences--and one may also want to add offences. That should be done by affirmative resolution so that there can be debate; we should not create order-making powers by which items might be arbitrarily added to the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I support the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) Like, I am sure, all other members of the Committee we support the Government's general approach to the provisions, although we wish to probe the Minister on some matters at this and other stages of the Bill. We share the Government's intention that there should be fresh provisions for the protection of children that will give the courts further powers. However, I agree with the hon. Lady that we need to ensure that the Secretary of State does not have unfettered power. If she were to press the matter to a Division, I would certainly support her.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I support my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton. Earlier in the Committee, the Minister asked her whether she  had counted the number of powers given uniquely to the Secretary of State. She has tried to do so, but it is such a labour of Hercules that it will take her a long time. Does the Secretary of State really need such wide powers as are given in the clause, not only to add but to remove offences? If there are to be changes to the list in schedule 4, they should be made by statutory instrument and affirmative resolution.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) has got it wrong-- uncharacteristically. I did not ask the hon. Member for Taunton to count the number of powers given to the Secretary of State; she asked me to engage in that labour. I declined to do so, not because it was the labour of Hercules--something that I am resigned to in my life--
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): And well equipped for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. It was more a labour of Sisyphus and I am not prepared for that. I do not intend to roll a stone up a hill and have it roll down on to me.
<P>
I understand the point. It is important that there should be a power to reflect changes in circumstances in such a serious and important area. It will be necessary to make it possible by order of the Secretary of State to add to the list. The demands that the protection of children rightly makes on those with responsibility for them, mean that it is necessary from time to time to reassess how to protect children and vulnerable people. Indeed, we have been doing that as a result of the work of the interministerial and interdepartmental group that followed Sir William Utting's report and the initiative, which the hon. Member for Taunton recognised, that led to the Protection of Children Act 1999. As we increase our knowledge and understanding of the risks that face children and young people, it will be necessary occasionally to add to the list, and that should be done only by affirmative resolution. I can draw the hon. Lady's attention to clause 58(5)(a) in which we propose that that power should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. That should introduce all the safeguards that I believe the hon. Lady--understandably--seeks in the amendment. The amendment would remove the power to amend by order, and that is not at all desirable, as I am sure that she accepts. She wants us to have that power, but she wants there to be proper parliamentary debate about it. We have made provision for such a debate under clause 58(5)(a) and it is for that reason that I urge her not to push her amendment to a vote. While I understand her argument, the amendment is not necessary because we are meeting her concerns by adopting the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister makes a compelling case. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> On a point of order, Sir David. I seek clarification about the amendments tabled to clause 26, although there may be an extremely logical reason for such a grouping. Our amendment No. 95, which would amend clause 29, has been grouped with our other amendments and those tabled by the Liberal Democrats to clause 26. I appreciate that amendment No. 95 would insert something in clause 29, which would relate to clause 26, and that that could be the reason for the grouping, but I thought it would be appropriate for me to raise the issue now so that the Clerk can advise us should something go awry.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue. When we reach that point, I shall have something to say. I am grateful to him for giving us some time to check matters.
<H4><center>Schedule 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning of "offence against a child"</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 49, line 13, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(ee) an offence under section 47 of that Act (actual bodily harm),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All members of the Committee recognise that offences committed against a child are among the most upsetting and worrying matters that arise in our society. I have referred previously to inquiries into the sad and tragic events of child abuse, such as the recent Waterhouse inquiry into events in children's homes in Wales.
<P>
It would be helpful to add the offence of actual bodily harm to the list of offences in the schedule. It would be difficult for anyone to suggest that an offence of actual bodily harm is not serious. During my work at the Bar, I have both prosecuted and defended many people tried, and, in some cases, convicted, of offences of actual bodily harm. The Minister will know from his professional experience how often someone is initially charged with an even more serious offence under section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861--causing grievous bodily harm--or an offence under section 20--wounding--but, because of the evidence, is ultimately convicted of the lesser offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. As the Minister and many other hon. Members will know, that may nevertheless be an extremely serious matter. We were therefore surprised that it is not included in the list of offences in schedule 4. It might be possible to go even further and add common assault to the list, but we have not gone that far. We suggest that the list of offences might usefully include offences under section 47--assault occasioning actual bodily harm--in addition to the more serious offences already listed. If it does not, someone who has been involved in a serious crime will not be subject to the Bill's regime, and that would be unfortunate.
<P>
I do not expect the Minister to accept that the Opposition are right, but we hope that he will take the matter seriously, as he has done for several previous matters, and will examine whether the Government might reconsider it and, perhaps, introduce their own amendment in another place or on Report. We hope that the Government will take it seriously, and we look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I have every confidence that in dealing with such a serious matter the Minister will understand that we tabled the amendment with serious intent, and we hope that he will give it the serious attention that it undoubtedly warrants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The amendments to schedule 4 are important, and the Committee and, in due course, possibly the House will want to discuss them with great care. Schedule 4, in conjunction with clause 24, establishes the circumstances in which a person is deemed to have committed an offence against a child--there is a range of offences--and thus to qualify for a disqualification order. It will help the Committee if I explain the Government's thinking behind the schedule and clause 24. It is necessary to examine the two together, for obvious reasons.
<P>
The common feature of the offences is that the victim is a child. Someone who is charged with or has committed such an offence can therefore be identified as posing a risk to children. The offences are listed in schedule 4, and, as we discussed on the previous amendment, the list is capable of being altered by affirmative resolution.
<P>
We have limited the ban to people who are convicted of one of the listed offences, and who serve a minimum prison sentence. Those two criteria must be seen together, as they form a dual key. We want the ban to be as strong as possible. The aim is that it should always be imposed by the judge unless he specifies in court reasons why the offender does not represent a danger to children. That minimises the chance that it may not be applied in highest risk cases. The offences listed need to be those that would normally carry such a risk, which is why care has been taken to identify those that should be included.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have had to face the issue of proportionality. The ban will prevent the individual from taking part not only in paid work with children, but in a range of activities such as helping out in clubs or school-based activities, including those in which his own children participate. We believe that the ban should be imposed only by a judge, and only for a serious offence that receives a severe sentence. The hon. Member for Taunton and I have exchanged views on proportionality in the Chamber in relation to other legislation. It is a subject that we must have in mind when considering the schedule and the clauses on which it impacts.
<P>
There are two safeguards to ensure that offenders do not fall through the net. If they worked in an area covered by the Secretary of State's bans, they could be banned in a wider range of circumstances than those before the criminal courts, in which the judge can rely on only the details of the criminal offence and any reports. Although other convictions, including ABH if the provision were unamended, might not carry a ban, they would appear on the individual's criminal record. Therefore, they could properly be taken into account before a decision was made to take someone on as a volunteer or employee. Working with children falls under the exception provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, and thus convictions and cautions cannot ever be spent, I am sure that we all agree, in terms of the high standard that we expect from people who work with children, that that should be the case.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> As I hoped, the Minister is dealing with the matter seriously and thoroughly, for which I am grateful. Does he accept my point that offences that end in convictions for actual bodily harm often start as charges of far more serious offences? Does he further accept that ABH can be a serious offence in itself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I accept both those things.
<P>
When we want to expand the list of offences, as is proposed in the amendment, it will be important to approach it on the basis that I have outlined. That basis is the result of extensive consultation with the police, the prosecuting authorities and, importantly, the child protection agencies and organisations most intimately concerned with the day-to-day safeguards that must be put in place to protect children from those who would harm them. We are therefore mindful of the outcome of the consultation exercise and would need to reflect long and hard before adding to the list.
<P>
It is essential that we make sure that the law bears down on those who represent a real risk. We would be in a dangerous position if we took action that weakened the automatic nature of the ban so that courts started to refuse to apply it in certain cases because they did not feel that a continuing risk was likely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I am the first person to intervene in the debate who has not been legally trained, Could the Minister give, now or later, information about the sort of offences that were in the past covered by a conviction for actual bodily harm?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I certainly will because my hon. Friend, who is in this instance perhaps helped rather than hindered by a lack of legal training, has put his finger on an important point. There is a considerable range in the degree of seriousness of assaults covered by the offence of actual bodily harm. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) rightly drew to our attention the fact, based on his experience, that the Crown Prosecution Service sometimes downgrades an offence of GBH to ABH. However, if I grasp my hon. Friend in anger--
<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice </B>(Lewisham, East): Never.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Yes, implausible though that is--and his skin was broken, that would be ABH.
<P>
So there is a range of seriousness involved. Very few cases of ABH are seen by the courts and by judges to merit a sentence of imprisonment or detention of sufficient magnitude--12 months or more--to trigger the disqualification order. In 1998, for example, of 14,869 offences of ABH committed by persons aged 18 or over, only 897 received custodial sentences of 12 months or more. Similarly, only 24 individuals aged 10 to 17, out of the 3,519 convicted, received such sentences. The figures do not tell us whether children were amongst the victims of those offences, but where such assaults are directed towards children, it is more likely to be caught by the offence covered in paragraph 1: cruelty to children. There is no doubt in our minds--and, I am sure, the minds of all members of the Committee--that cruelty to children must trigger an automatic ban. In the main, we can be confident that the  specific offence of cruelty to children would cover the kind of behaviour that those who tabled the amendment rightly hope would be covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand the Minister's point, especially as it relates to the automatic triggering of the provisions. Will he and his officials consider whether there is a way of encompassing the spirit of the amendment, perhaps in a Government amendment? A child who had been a victim of ABH might fall within the provisions, even without a separate charge of child cruelty on the indictment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am coming to the conclusion of my remarks, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with what I have to say. If the offender was already working with children in education, health or the broad social care field, the Secretary of State could ban him for the offence of ABH if his conduct would lead to dismissal or removal from work with children, or appeared to indicate a continuing risk to children. There might be people convicted of ABH and sentenced to a penalty of less than 12 months, or, indeed, more than 12 months, who, because of the circumstances in which the offence was committed, would rightly be banned by the operation of the Secretary of State's authority. For that reason, we have not been persuaded to include ABH in the list. However, I am prepared to retlect on the hon. Gentleman's comments. We shall reconsider the amendment in the light of the consultation exercise, and perhaps gauge the views of child protection and other organisations on the matter. I understand the spirit of the amendment, although I am worried about the problems of identifying, from a range of cases, those that are directed at children. It is a helpful suggestion, however, and I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and other Committee members on the best way to proceed if a change is to be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I thank the Minister for his response, especially his concluding remarks. I welcome the Government's approach. When he writes to me and other Committee members, will he indicate the views of consultees, especially organisations such as the NSPCC? I notice the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) nodding in agreement on that. Further discussion and consultation is welcome--it is always desirable to improve legislation--but it is important that this part of the Bill should be as effective as possible when it is enacted. I have no doubt that this matter will receive detailed consideration in another place, where, as the Minister and other Committee members are aware, there are many Members who have a considerable number of years' experience of dealing with child protection issues. We may therefore be able to make further suggestions in another place or on Report, or there may be further Government amendments. In the spirit of this morning's discussion, I shall not seek to press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 49, line 23, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(1) Any of the offences concerned with the supply of controlled drugs under section 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (restriction on production and supply of controlled drugs)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is not dissimilar to the previous amendment, in that it would add another offence to schedule 4, but, if that is possible, we feel more strongly about this amendment. Surely anyone who is involved in the very serious offence of the supply of controlled drugs should trigger the automatic provisions that the Government want to impose.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Even if the Minister cannot accept the amendment, I urge him to think about it very seriously, as he agreed to do on the ABH issue, and consult child protection organisations. We have not received responses from all such organisations, but I am sure that several will sympathise with the amendment. The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) is nodding and I am grateful for his approval. Within the past few months, members of the Committee will have read in the press about some particularly poignant and tragic cases. I recall one case that took place in Scotland in which, as a result of their own behaviour as both drug suppliers and addicts, the defendants had administered drugs to their own children in the most cruel circumstances possible and, as a result, the children had become heroin or crack cocaine addicts. In the peaceful surroundings of the Room, it is difficult to conceive of the extent of the wickedness of such behaviour.
<P>
I have spent a great deal of time prosecuting and, sometimes, defending in drugs cases. It was one of the areas in my work as a barrister in the criminal courts in which I tended to speciallse, partly because I was working in family law and there was often an overlap between the two areas. I remember vividly some of the serious cases in which I was an advocate, and I am sure that the Minister and other members of the Committee will have had similar experiences in their previous professional roles.
<P>
We have not sought to include the possession of drugs in the automatic triggering provision, but we believe that the supply of drugs is such a serious matter that it should be so included. I should be surprised if the Minister considered that some of his arguments about our previous amendment applied equally to this amendment. I hope that the Minister will incorporate further consultation on it and I urge him and his advisers to think again about our proposal, because few matters are more serious than the supply of drugs. Surely anyone who has been convicted of such a serious offence should be subject to the automatic provisions, such that they cannot be in a responsible position in relation to working with children in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> There can be few incidences of the supply of drugs that are more serious than the supply of drugs to children. That is wicked beyond belief. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath is night to draw attention to the evil that it represents. When there is evidence of the supply of drugs to children, it attracts properly condign and exemplary punishment, and it is right that it should. It is also right that we should take a particularly dim view of those who exploit their position with children to peddle drugs to them. That is a very serious matter and one would expect the law to take it seriously. Under the Bill, a case of peddling by a person who had exploited his access to children is precisely the type of case in which one would expect the judge to impose a ban--where, obviously, the judge has the powers to do so because of the nature of the offence. In a case of the abuse of a child aggravated by the supply of drugs, such as that referred to by the hon. Gentleman--if memory serves, that was a case of child cruelty that also involved the supply of drugs--one would expect the judge to use the discretionary power.
<P>
It is, however, much more difficult--which is the problem posed by the amendment--to arrive at a legally satisfactory and practical scheme to target people for the purposes of a ban, because of the nature of the act of supplying. The evidence, which forms the basis for the Bill, is that drug dealers seldom target the under-18s; they have a much more scatter-gun approach and are out to sell drugs to anyone whom they can lure into buying from them. They do not care how old someone is--which is partly where the wickedness lies.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that someone who has supplied drugs only to adults, on a sufficient scale and with sufficient gravity, would not be the sort of person that one would wish to have influence on children--even though he had not committed an offence directly against children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I wholeheartedly agree. The question would then be how best to ensure that such people do not get the opportunity to work with children. It goes back to the proportionality argument that the hon. Member for Taunton raised and which I have acknowledged. Should it be for those taking the decision about employment or for the Secretary of State, on the basis of the list, rather than the criminal law and a judge, to determine whether someone should be allowed to work in a particular occupation? Some people who have been rehabilitated from an involvement in drugs have gone on to lead honest and industrious lives, including work for voluntary organisations and for health and drug avoidance projects that brings them into positive contact with children and young people.
<P>
Therefore it is a difficult choice. The question for the Committee--it is not a matter about which we are being prescriptive, but one for genuine debate--is whether someone should be subject to an automatic ban imposed by a judge or whether that decision should be left to the Secretary of State and the good sense of the would-be employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I acknowledge the sensible way in which the Minister is responding and I accept his arguments about proportionality. However, although we hope that there is no need for one, should there be another inquiry such as the Waterhouse inquiry, in which it transpired that a person with a conviction for supplying drugs--even if all the supplying had been done to adults; as the Minister said, drug dealers have a scatter-gun approach and will sell to anyone--had been employed in a children's home when the automatic provisions were supposed to prevent that happening, can the Minister imagine what the inquiry chairman would say about that discovery?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and I understand what lies behind his point. However, we must avoid putting ourselves in the position of those responsible for selecting people to work with children. When I chaired a management committee of a church youth club, I refused to employ people with any kind of drug conviction. I took that approach because the youth club took a strong line on drugs. However, that is not what the Bill is about; it does not deal with such matters. It deals with banning people who pose a risk to children from a wide range of activities, including those such as supervision of Saturday football. That difficulty was highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead. We must be clear in our minds about what the ban means; if we followed the line of reasoning in the amendment, someone with a previous conviction for supplying drugs to children or minors would automatically be banned and could not organise Saturday football for his own or other children. Would that be proportional to the risk presented by such people? It is a matter for judgment. Our judgment in the Bill is that that might be going too far.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I do not want to lose the important point that the Minister made earlier on rehabilitation. People involved in such crimes as supplying or using drugs can, after rehabilitation, perform a vital role in the education of young people. A church group such as the one to which the Minister referred may in fact want to take such people on as volunteers, because they know what they are talking about and young people are more likely to listen to them. On proportionality, we would surely all agree that someone convicted of selling alcohol or cigarettes to those below the legal age should not be similarly barred from the whole range of voluntary or employed activities involving children.
<P>
10.15 am
<P>
<B> Mr. Boateng:</B> I will not go down that road. I do not accept the easy parallel that the hon. Lady makes between the drugs covered by the Bill and alcohol and tobacco. She made her point in her own inimitable way and I respect her perspective. Is it the intention of those who tabled the amendment that the undergraduate who sells a small amount of cannabis to friends at a party should receive an automatic ban? That would be the effect if the amendment were accepted. We need to be clear about that and, although I understand and sympathise with the thinking behind the amendment, I fear that it is probably unfeasible to accept it. It would be impossible to draft it in such a way as to identify properly those who are a risk to young people because they are likely to go on to peddle drugs to them and those who are generally in the wicked business of peddling drugs. Therefore, I find it difficult to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I get the impression that the Minister is coming to the end of his remarks. I have more to say in response, but before he finishes, will he say whether he will think about the matter again in terms of consultation, as he did with the previous amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I do not want to put this amendment in the same category as the previous one, because we may arrive at a destination in relation to that amendment that does not correspond to the one that we reach with amendment No. 2. The practical and legal reasons for rejecting the amendment are likely to prove insurmountable. I do not want to mislead the hon. Gentleman that there might be any other outcome of reflection on it. I want no one who reads the report of our proceedings to be in any doubt of the Government's view that everything that can be done must be done to bring to justice those evil people who peddle drugs to children. Everything must be done to ensure that they do not get employment that gives them access to children--there is no doubt about that. The question is whether the amendment is the best way to achieve that, and on that we are not persuaded. However, I will certainly go away and think about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): I want to make some general points about the Bill, with reference to the amendment. I am deeply concerned about the Minister, because anyone who volunteers to be the chairman of the management committee of a youth club is clearly a glutton for punishment, and the judgment of that person must be seriously called into question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I was 24 at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I have a number of points to make. Those of us who have been involved in courts are worried about the complexity of legislation that results from the number of Acts of Parliament on sentencing. We have a duty not to overcomplicate the matter, because it is desperately difficult for judges, magistrates and others to construe legislation when they constantly have to look through different Acts to find the relevant sections.
<P>
It is easy to understand how complications arise. Parliamentary time is precious, and this is a classic example of a Bill that is a little like a number of carriages on a train stuck together under a long title. It behoves all of us to try not to overcomplicate matters. Among other things, a Committee should be guided by representations from outside the House. One of my few pleasures in life is the amount of post that I can throw away in the morning, which is why I open all my own post. Unless someone is sending all my post to the hon. Member for Taunton, which occasionally happens--and sometimes I receive strange letters, which I read only to realise suddenly, with great joy, that they are intended for the hon. Member for West Ham (Mr. Banks)--I have received, at the most, only one or two letters about this Bill. I do not know whether other Committee members have received many representations. That implies that the Family Law Bar Association, the Criminal Bar Association and probation officers' organisations do not regard the Bill with deep or great concern.
<P>
If we were receiving lots of representations from such bodies, we should start to worry. If there are not real concerns, however, a real danger exists that an already complicated area of law will be made even more complicated. In the case of most of the mischief that we are seeking to address, I suspect that powers to deal adequately with such matters are already available to the courts, the Secretary of State or the appropriate authority.
<P>
I want to put in a plea on behalf of all practitioners. Will the Home Office and Lord Chancellor's Department think about how to consolidate legislation relating to sentencing? From time to time, glorious consolidating Bills, such as that relating to Rent Acts, are introduced. A Bill to consolidate powers relating to magistrates courts or Crown courts would be desirable, as practitioners would not have to spend all their time construing many different interrelating Acts of Parliament to work out the law on a particular issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I shall deal first with the helpful intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry). Sadly, I must disappoint him. Although I also enjoy, from time to time, opening my post in order to see how little of it is directly from constituents, and how many glossy annual reports can be thrown away, I have received many representations about the Bill. Having been a practitioner, I recognise what my hon. Friend says about the need not to overcomplicate. However, the fact remains that, especially in relation to this schedule, there is already a list of offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for taking the burden of correspondence. If he has received representations, and bodies are expressing concerns about various aspects of the Bill, it would help if, when introducing amendments, he were to place on the record the fact that such concern has been expressed, whether by the Magistrates' Association, the Criminal Bar Association or another body. The Committee would then be aware of the weight of the representations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Of course, I accept my hon. Friend's point. From time to time, in previous sittings, I have referred to particular organisations. The Minister and Under-Secretary will recall--I think that my hon. Friend had to deal with other matters at the time--that, on a number of occasions, we had lengthy debates about representations from, for example, the Central Probation Council and the Association of Chief Officers of Probation. Extensive reference has been made, on both sides of the Committee, to such representations.
<P>
I shall now turn to the Minister's speech. Despite the humorous remark made by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury, it was a pleasure to know that one thing that the Minister and I share is the fact that we have both been involved in the management of youth clubs. He was right to say that, when he was doing that job--albeit in younger and, who knows, happier days--he took the firm line that no one with experience of drugs should have anything to do with the management of a youth club. I agree. The same applied in the church youth group in which I was involved. It supports my argument about the supply of controlled drugs. When the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead intervened on the Minister he was, in effect, supporting my argument. I accept what the Minister said about proportionality. That must be home in mind, as must the helpful comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> The hon. Gentleman will recall that I referred to the seriousness and persistence of such offences, which would cut out the use by students of cannabis. Does he accept that the amendment would not address such issues, and hence it would help if he withdrew it, so that such matters could be looked at further with a view to incorporating them in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman's contribution is enormously helpful. I was about to make that point. I accept entirely that the amendment is not perfect, which is why I was pleased that the Minister said that he would think again about such a proposal. He was not as encouraging as he had been about the previous amendment, but I am sure that such matters will receive detailed consideration on Report and in another place.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to a constituent of mine who was aged 20 years. Looking for someone else, the police raided his flat and found a quantity of ecstasy tablets that they felt was too large an amount for personal use. My constituent was sent to prison for three years for supplying class A drugs. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that someone in those circumstances, who had no other convictions, should be barred from working with children in any capacity--voluntary or paid?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Yes, I do. The hon. Lady mentioned her constituent. I know nothing about that case and we must be careful not to talk about individual cases. Ecstasy, for which her constituent was convicted, has caused appalling tragedies. As soon as the word "ecstasy" is mentioned, we all remember the tragedy of Leah Betts. We are talking about a club culture in which people have died the first time that they have taken an ecstasy tablet. A better example to make the hon. Lady's point was that cited by the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead, which caused the Minister to refer to small amounts of cannabis.
<P>
The supply of drugs is such a serious offence that it should lead to automatic trigger provisions. Although I accept that the Minister will reconsider the matter to see whether he can incorporate into the Bill a provision in the spirit that gave rise to our amendment, there is no doubt that, as the Bill wends its way through the House, there will be further consultations. As my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury said, I hope that we will hear more from organisations such as the NSPCC and Childline. We know that proposed legislation can be improved during its further passage through the House by consultations, the result of which may not be known by the time that the legislation is debated on Second Reading or in Committee in the House of Commons. I am grateful to the Minister for taking the matter seriously. We all recognise the serious dangers of drugs, particularly in relation to children.
<P>
The Minister and the hon. Member for Taunton referred to the importance of allowing people with experience of drugs at the sharp end to pass on their knowledge to children, to discourage them from becoming involved in drugs. Such people can tell children how they have suffered from the drugs problems, but that they have now recovered. Those serving prison sentences, for example, at Coldingley prison in my constituency have been involved in valuable programmes in which they talk to local schools. Similar valuable programmes exist throughout the country. Such projects can still continue without the visiting speakers being involved in the management of youth groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I see the hon. Members for Lancaster and Wyre nodding. The automatic trigger provisions are intended to stop people being involved in the management of organisations to do with children. It would not stop people who are serving sentences for drugs offences from participating in the valuable visiting speaker programmes. The Minister may want to think about that again. He may want to say that there should be a way of addressing such a serious issue without running the risks. I am not decrying the valuable lessons that can be passed on by people who have served sentences. They should do that in the role of visiting speaker, not by managing youth groups or clubs. I see that the hon. Members for Lancaster and Wyre and for Hemel Hempstead agree with me. We are all aiming to improve this legislation and in the light of the Minister's helpful response that he will think about the matter further, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 4 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 25</center></H4>
<H4><center>Equivalent armed forces offences</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Clause 25 is a parallel provision to ensure that people in the armed forces who are convicted of equivalent armed forces offences are also caught by it. That seems extremely sensible. I was the Government Whip in the previous Parliament--as the Minister may recall--on the quinquennial Armed Forces Act 1996 that deals with service discipline. I have also spoken to a number of other hon. Members on both sides of the House who have been dealing with the current armed forces legislation. The clause also deals with the question of services offences. Representing a military constituency--Camberley is its main town--I am conscious that, sadly, people in the armed forces are occasionally convicted of quite serious offences. It is important that there should be provisions to bring those convicted of offences while in the armed forces within the purview of the Bill, and I welcome that.
<P>
Will the Minister say whether there is any need to look further at the Armed Forces Discipline Bill, which will become law in the immediate future, if the Government have their way? As the Government talk about joined-up government, will the Minister look carefully at the matters that the Government are currently dealing with in terms of service discipline and the way that they would cross over and interlink with the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The clause ensures that members of the armed forces are subject to the legislation, even though an offence was committed while the person was subject to the disciplines of service in the armed forces. The clause also ensures that that applies to members of the armed forces if the offence was committed overseas. That is important in terms of the nature of service in the armed forces. We should be able to identify individuals who present a risk to children across a broad spectrum. Sadly, some of those people exist in the armed forces as they do in other walks of life and the law should recognise that. We are in close and regular contact, both ministerially and as officials, with colleagues in the Ministry of Defence precisely to ensure that government is effectively joined up in that as in other areas and we shall continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that he is alive to this issue. No doubt he will continue that consultation to ensure that if there is a further need to look at the Government's proposals in another Bill, then any consequential Government amendments could be made later.

<B>The Chairman:</B> As clauses 26 and 27 detail the same proposals for different age groups, the Chair will be happy if the debate on clause 26 and the amendments to it swings between the two clauses. Amendment No. 95 relates to clause 29 to some extent, so the Chair will take a relaxed view if hon. Members discuss clause 29 when making their arguments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> This is a long group of amendments, and I am grateful to you, Sir David, for your suggestion on amendment No. 95. When we come to clause 29, will we be able, in the same relaxed spirit, to refer back to amendment No. 95, should we need to? It is specifically an amendment to clause 29.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is perfectly all right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful, Sir David.
<P>
As the Committee will realise from the group of amendments, we seek to delete "either" and replace it with "one". That is purely a drafting matter. More substantially, amendment No. 83 would insert a new subsection (3A), which would state that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The third condition is that--
<P>
(a) the individual is convicted of an offence against a child committed when he was aged 18 or over, and
<P>
(b) the court is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that it is likely that the individual may commit a further offence against a child.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As we sought to introduce a third condition, we had to table drafting amendments so that the clause would refer to "one" of three rather than "either" of two. I hope that what we seek to achieve is clear to the Committee, grammatically and in terms of drafting.
<P>
The provision is valuable. We have talked about this part of the Bill, which we recognise as the important step forward of disqualification. These amendments would toughen up the provisions a little further. We recognise that the Government probably will not be able to accept the amendments as drafted but, in a constructive spirit and given the serious nature of the matters, we hope that the Minister will consider our aim. When we return to the issue in the relaxed way in which you have kindly suggested that we can debate the next few clauses, Sir David, we shall seek to ensure that there are not too many restrictions on the courts when they operate the trigger provisions.
<P>
It is difficult for any court to say that an individual convicted of an offence will commit another in future. We felt that the Bill would be better if the court could say that it thought that there was a risk. On Second Reading, we debated the difference between "will" and "may", which is not simply a matter of semantics in this context. Those of us who have operated in the criminal courts know that it is impossible for any judge or bench of magistrates, when deciding to sentence an individual and considering psychiatric and social inquiry reports, to know exactly what an individual will do after he has served a sentence and been released.
<P>
We want to give the courts a wide discretion when operating what will be, as the Minister called it, a draconian, automatic disqualification provision. If they recognise that someone might be a risk to children, the automatic trigger provisions should come into force.
<P>
At a later stage, we shall consider whether that should happen only when someone has been convicted of an offence meriting custody of 12 months. Recently, some celebrated cases involving, sadly, the use of child pornography have received a great deal of coverage in the media. For example, offences were committed by a pop musician, the former drummer of the Bay City Rollers, Mr. Longmuir. Although Mr. Longmuir's offences were regarded as serious in relation to child pornography, they did not result in a lengthy sentence. They resulted in a custodial sentence, but it was not sufficiently long for the provisions to apply, because of the automatic trigger provisions.
<P>
The courts must have the opportunity to say, if there is a risk that the person involved may commit such offences in future, that it may be appropriate for the disqualification to come into force. That is simply an example that was reported in the press recently. Of course, we do not restrict ourselves to high-publicity matters. The courts should be able to examine such matters seriously, and we hope that the Minister will take the amendments seriously.
<P>
We welcome the spirit of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Taunton. Once again, we all want the Bill to be effective and to protect children properly. We must not lose sight of the big picture in considering detailed drafting amendments. We want to persuade the Government that the matter is worth considering and that the clause might be improved in order to protect more children through imposing disqualification orders on people convicted of serious offences.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that we are also debating clauses 26 and 27 stand part.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Before I came to this place, I thought that Parliament contained too many lawyers. It is at times like this, when serving on a Committee that contains several lawyers who can speak from their experience in criminal courts,  that I feel especially inferior. [Interruption.] I realise that that may be difficult to believe. My only experience in court was presenting guardian ad litem reports in a previous existence many years ago. I am happy to admit that it may be my lack of understanding of clause 26 that has led to the amendments, and I hope to be comforted by the Minister's response.
<P>
Amendment No. 128 relates to clause 26 and adults, and amendment No. 129 relates to clause 27 and juveniles. I understand that clauses 26 and 27 would enable someone to be disqualified if they were charged, as opposed to convicted, of an offence. I find it difficult to believe that that is in the Government's mind, as it would be contrary to both natural law and the European convention on human rights. These are probing amendments to enable me better to understand what the Government have in mind and to put that on record.
<P>
I am afraid that I cannot support the Conservative amendments to change "will" to "may". It is difficult to predict with any certainty whether someone who has committed a particular offence will commit such an offence in future, and much discretion and power will be left to the judiciary in making a judgment on the matter. To specify "may" would make the provision far too broad. It is difficult to say that someone may not commit a particular offence in future. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. So far today we have agreed about many amendments, but not this one.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I shall speak generally on clause 26 stand part, and echo the anxiety about subsection (3), which is the subject of amendment No. 128. My constituency casework file contains a case of someone who was accused of an offence against a child and found not guilty by a court but is still deemed unsuitable to continue his job as a teacher. What might be called residual perturbations are created by education authorities or social services departments, which take the position that there is no smoke without fire and that even if someone is found not guilty of such an offence, the fact that he was charged with it is sufficient cause to protect children from him.
10.45 am
<P>
The difficulty in all our debates has been finding the balance between protecting children and safeguarding other rights that children have. In a recent case in my constituency, for example, a vicious fight broke out between two 10-year-olds in a primary school that had only one male teacher, who is called out to stop such incidents--which, as a burly lad, he duly did. He pulled the boys apart by taking one by the scruff of the neck and the other by the hand. Seeing a golden opportunity to get some loot, one of the parents involved proceeded to charge the teacher with assault. Children have a right to be protected, but they also have a right to have appropriate interactions with, be cherished by and learn from men.
<P>
I object strongly to the general tenor of the statements made by members of the principal Opposition. I wrote down the comment of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath that if someone is potentially a risk, the automatic provision should be triggered. In practice, someone who is charged but found not guilty, even if the case arose through a malicious or malevolent accusation--which I believe to be just as common as assault--still suffers consequences. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman because he may correct my understanding of what he said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman may have slightly misunderstood not only what I said but what the legislation seeks to do. I apologise if this becomes a lengthy intervention, but I wish to reassure the hon. Gentleman. I have had cases similar to that which he described in my constituency. The provisions are intended to cover not cases of malicious allegation, but cases where people have been convicted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> indicated assent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I see the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre is nodding. My point is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I am happy with the Bill in general and with its provisions on people who are convicted. However, I am concerned about what happens when people have not been convicted. I imagine that the Minister will say that my reading of the Bill is wrong, but I share the reservations of the hon. Member for Taunton--although I am not sure that the problem should be dealt with through her amendment--about what happens in regard to people who are charged but not convicted. lt is of course probable, if the probability of getting away with an offence is about 25 per cent., that the population of people charged but found not guilty will contain more potential child offenders than a similar, unconvicted population. However, that does not alter the fact that individuals who are charged and found not guilty have the right to be regarded as not guilty. Children have the right to interaction with and support from the victims of malevolent or malicious accusations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I want simply to reassure the hon. Gentleman; even if the Minister had a lightning conversion and accepted every one of our amendments, this part of the Bill would apply only when people had actually been convicted. I agree with almost everything that the hon. Gentleman said, but it does not apply to the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I am merely reading clause 26(3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The second condition is that--
<P>
(a) the individual is charged.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can understand that, because when someone is charged, a precautionary principle is applied that until the trial, particular care must be taken. However, out there in society there is an assumption of guilt; it is assumed that anyone who is charged with such an offence is not fit to work with children, even if, in the end, the case is dropped because of malevolent intent. I hope that the Minister will put my mind at rest on subsection (3). I should be delighted if he would do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am happy, in responding to the debate--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead giving way, or is the Minister giving his response?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am giving my response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Has the hon. Gentleman finished speaking?
<P>
<B> Mr. McWalter:</B> I am happy to give way. I wanted the Minister to respond to my point, but as he has not done so, I shall carry on.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman is giving way, I am sure that the Minister will want to say something.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I will answer my hon. Friend to his complete satisfaction in my response to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, as I have been aware throughout the debate of an attempt to balance the right of children to have the richest diversity of people to teach them, to protect them and to look after their interests with the need to prevent convicted individuals from having access to them. I was pleased with the debate on schedule 4, which showed that the Minister wanted to ensure that that principle was kept intact. Clause 26(3) as drafted is not as balanced as the usual careful provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I, too, look forward to our right hon. Friend's response to the debate; I am sure that I shall be reassured by what he says, although I may have some comments to make on subsection (5).
<P>
In response to the previous two contributions, my case is that people do not have an automatic right to work with children. Setting a balance is all very well, but the balance must be carefully weighted in the interests of children. The Bill covers a wide range of criminal justice matters, some of which relate to the rehabilitation of offenders, but the clause has nothing to do with that; it is about protecting children.
<P>
There was much well-informed comment in the debate about people's experiences and the qualities that they bring to working with and helping children. But let us make no mistake: people who abuse children, or who have done so, can be among the most devious, dangerous and cunning individuals in society. Children need to be protected from such people, but it is often difficult to protect them.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the deviousness of certain people who we would want to prevent from working with children. Most of those who are convicted or charged with offences that disqualify them from working with children in a voluntary or paid position will be men. I am concerned that, in future, if we get the balance wrong, very few men will be able or willing to work with children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that intervention, because she makes an important point. Working with children is a job for both men and women, and men have an important role to play. If they were prevented from doing so, it would be to the grave detriment of children, who must have both male and female role models.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. Is there not a danger that if we characterise most offenders as being men--I refer to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Taunton--we may overlook the fact that some women also abuse children? The rules must apply equally across both genders, and we must monitor both men and women who work with children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. My fundamental support for this part of the Bill stems from the fact that the clause gives no support to malicious allegations that are sometimes made against people working with children. It does not fail to recognise the difficulties or the need for clear guidelines on physical handling when working with children in stressful and antagonistic situations.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of the suggestion in the Bill that there are people without convictions who may be unsuitable to work with children? That has arisen in part because of the Thomas Hamilton case; he had no convictions, but many thought that the law should have excluded him from working with children regardless of that fact. Some of us are concerned about that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I think that the Minister's clarification will be helpful. I cannot see anything in the Bill that supports the case that my hon. Friend makes, although subsection (3)(b), which qualifies subsection (3)(a), makes it plain that a "relevant order" can be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> made by a senior court in respect of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 an act for which someone has not been convicted. The Bill is concerned not only with catching those who have been found guilty of serious offences, but with ensuring that people over whose handling of children there are significant question marks are properly dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I will, in my response--which I hope will be soon--deal with the points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Lancaster and Wyre and for Hemel Hempstead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I acknowledge the Minister's remarks. I shall move on to my final points. I sympathise with the intention behind the proposed amendments to subsection (5), but I do not support them. They are not helpful to the Bill.
<P>
11 am
<P>
It would be more helpful if the Minister were to agree that it is extremely difficult to predict human behaviour. The court has to decide whether an individual who has been convicted of serious offences--we have debated how carefully the guidelines on serious offences have been drawn--is unlikely to offend again. Human behaviour is notoriously difficult to predict, and some of the individuals whom we are considering are extremely devious and manipulative and will go to inordinate lengths to hide their behaviour and intentions from those who wish to thwart them and to protect children. Clearly, it is right to include subsection (5)--people can make great changes in their lives, and offences can be committed in different circumstances. There could be a considerable lapse of time between a person committing an offence and seeking to work with children. I hope that the Minister will agree that courts should use subsection (5) with extreme caution, and, perhaps, only in unusual circumstances; its use should not be a run-of-the-mill event.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Amess </B>(Southend, West): Again, I find myself in complete agreement with the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. I apologise for my sporadic attendance of the Committee, which is probably a huge relief to some Labour Members. I am a member of other Committees, and I am rather stretched at the moment. However, I am interested in the issues under discussion, which are challenging, deep and sensitive. I have encountered many such issues during my years as a Member of Parliament.
<P>
I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath. It makes sense to widen the court's powers. If someone has been convicted, we must consider whether that presents a risk. It would be sensible to err on the side of caution. Does the Minister agree with that? If he does not, what are his reasons?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> This has been a wide-ranging and useful debate. I was especially grateful for the contributions of my hon. Friends the Members for Hemel Hempstead and for Lancaster and Wyre. There was a constructive tension in their contributions to the debate. The hon. Members for Taunton, for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) and for Surrey Heath outlined the extent of such a grave and serious problem. The risks facing children and the constrictions on their childhood is a disturbing phenomenon. To protect them, we must achieve a balance between their rights and those of adults. We must recognise that part of childhood is having adults who are not part of their family responding to them naturally, not constantly living a life that is circumscribed by adults fearing that contact, however innocent, will lead to allegations being made that might have the most appalling consequences.
<P>
The case referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead rings true, given some of the problems that teachers face today when carrying out their jobs and acting in loco parentis without fear of false and malicious allegations and serious consequences arising as a result. A balance must be maintained. We must achieve proportionality, which will be the basis of my response to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath on behalf of the Conservative party.
<P>
I shall deal first with the concerns of the hon. Member for Taunton and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead. Clause 26(3)(b) refers to a relevant order being made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by a senior court in respect of the act or omission charged against him as the offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision will not impact on those charged, but not convicted, of an offence, save in the most limited of circumstances, all of which relate to mental health and orders made in relation to an individual's mental health. It has nothing to do with charged, but unproven, acts. For the clause to bite, it is necessary that X is charged, is brought to court, is unfit to plead and therefore not convicted, but that an actus reus is found to have been committed and a hospital or other order under mental health legislation is made. It is only in those circumstances that a ban could arise. The clause has nothing to do with charges that do not lead to a court of law having been satisfied that a particular act had justified the charge and the finding.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall be grateful if the Minister will explain where such a provision is spelt out, or is that what is understood in law by the term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a relevant order is made by a senior court?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Yes, and the relevant order is then defined. The relevant order is an order made under the Mental Health Act 1983.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> I think that it would help if that were articulated more clearly on the face of the Bill than it is at the moment. It looks as though the net is spreading slightly wider because of the Thomas Hamilton furore. People were very worried about the lack of conviction, and they want some sort of assurance. It would help if the Minister would say that he will at least give consideration to articulating the link more clearly in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am afraid that here we are in the grip of the parliamentary draftsman. However, I can assure my hon. Friend that no judge will make an order other than in the circumstances set out in the Bill. I hope that anyone reading our proceedings who has an interest in the matter will be satisfied that it would not be possible for a judge to make an order that would have the effect that my hon. Friend fears. We are talking here about a court being required, almost automatically, to impose a ban with very serious repercussions for the individual banned. We are completely satisfied that that is the proper approach. When that ban is not made, the judge should be obliged to spell out why it is not to be made, and why a person is found to be unlikely to commit a further offence against a child. The judge is required to give clear reasons for withholding the ban in those circumstances.
<P>
We think that that approach is right, and we are not persuaded by the arguments made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath that we should extend the impact of the clause and conviction for one of these offences in the way that he suggests, precisely because we believe that extending the ambit of the Bill in the way that is suggested by the amendments would, perversely, weaken it. That is our concern--that it should be as strong as possible.
<P>
Our belief is that these amendments, although clearly well intentioned, would not have the effect that the hon. Gentleman seeks. We are anxious to ensure that we have an effective scheme to protect children, and we believe that the Bill achieves that. The provisions, as drafted, seek to achieve that end by imposing the limitations that are outlined. A ban will be ordered almost automatically only if a term of 12 months or more by way of a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed. Nevertheless, there must be discretion properly applied--for the courts to apply the ban in any event, where they believe that there is a risk and to the extent that it warrants the ban. We believe that it is a limitation that has the effect of ensuring that a Crown court judge, not a magistrate, should impose the ban. We believe that that is right, too, because of the seriousness of the matters and because of the nature of the risk involved. It is also right to ensure that the likelihood of future offending against children is taken into account when deciding whether to impose a disqualification order. That deals with the proportionality point and reflects the proper concerns that have been expressed today by the hon. Member for Taunton and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead.
<P>

<P>
We fear that the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath would fall into the trap outlined by the hon. Member for Banbury. We have<P>
been acutely conscious of the importance of not over--complicating the issues of maintaining an almost automatic ban and focusing the attention of the court on the issue of risk. That is the issue that is so vital to protecting children in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre described.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): I understand the difficulty in getting this balance right. My experience in 20 years on an education committee has been that there is a real concern to get a criminal conviction in disciplinary cases because of the requirements of the law compared with the balance of probability involved in a civil case. There are many occasions when one feels that there is real concern for the future of children in someone's care. Can my hon. Friend give some examples where he believes that the court should not automatically impose a ban when the severe test of a criminal conviction has been met?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall be happy to do that, but as I do so let me reflect on the point that my hon. Friend made about his experience of chairing an education committee. The Bill ensures that in those cases that do not meet the criminal standards of proof or where the sentence is less than 12 months, or those exceptionally rare cases where a judge has said that there is not a likelihood of a future risk to children, it will still be open to the Secretary of State and the local education committee to take a different view and to impose a ban. It is important that that should be the case.
<P>
We all know that important though a judicial discretion is, at the end of the day, it is not a judge who has to manage the local school, but the director of education and the chair of the education committee. I therefore hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will appreciate that while the amendments are well intentioned and there is undoubtedly a need to ensure that the management of schools and children's homes is structured in such a way as to maximise the protection that is available for children, in this instance the balance is best struck by the provisions in the Bill. The safeguards are there, as is a recognition of the different patterns of offending by reference to age and the different degrees of risk involved. The Bill gets the 
<P>
 balance right by putting the argument for exceptional cases. One that springs to mind as a proscribed offence under the Bill is manslaughter of a child. One can imagine instances in which a mercy killing by a doctor of a child in the final throes of leukaemia might be such as to persuade a judge that children were not generally at risk from the doctor in the future, although in order to uphold the law it would be necessary to apply a particular sentence. That example might fall within the exceptions which the hon. Gentleman urges me to illustrate.
<P>
I hope that, with that concluding illustration and the assurances that I gave the hon. Member for Taunton and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead, and an understanding of the points made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, the Committee will accept the clauses as drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I have listened with care to the Minister. We have had a good and perhaps more extensive debate than anyone on the Front Benches anticipated. I welcome the Minister's response although there remain serious issues to which we shall return, perhaps in another place or on Report. There was certainly some common ground between the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre and me, as there was on earlier clauses.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Given the Minister's helpful response I shall not press my amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
