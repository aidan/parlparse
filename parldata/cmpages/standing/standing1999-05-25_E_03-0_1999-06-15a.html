<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 13, leave out `United Kingdom' and insert `European Union'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 25, leave out `United Kingdom' and insert `European Union'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Mrs. Roe, what a great pleasure it is, on the first day of Ascot, to see you chairing our proceedings. If that is a hint as to where, on this sunny day, some of us might prefer to spend an hour or two rather than in this Committee, it is a well intended one. However, you, Mrs. Roe, provide us with some consolation.
<P>
I apologise for the slightly thin attendance on the Opposition Benches. [Interruption.] I now see the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell), over whom I have no control, as last Tuesday's vote indicated. I shall tease him about that in a moment. However, today and tomorrow, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) has the serious responsibility of dealing with the Immigration and Asylum Bill on behalf of the Opposition. He has asked me to pass on his apologies for not being able to be present today.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Colchester has arrived. I wanted to tease him because I was a little surprised to discover that he voted with the Government last week to reverse an amendment that his noble Friends in the other place had supported. Doubtless, he will have the opportunity to explain why the Liberal Democrats are divided on the fundamental issue of discretionary or mandatory referrals. However, they have suffered sufficient punishment recently, and I want to make progress today.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 9 and 12 raise a small question of detail. We have discussed at some length the principle of whether referral orders should be mandatory or discretionary. The Committee decided that they should be mandatory. However, the provision will apply only when a young offender appears for the first time in a court and pleads guilty.
<P>
The amendments raise the question of what will happen if a young offender has already appeared before a court in another European Union country. That can happen. For example, a 16 or 17-year-old might attend a soccer match abroad or become involved in a fracas in a bar while on holiday in Spain. Although I appreciate that EU matters are not necessarily the flavour of the month in the Conservative party or among the electorate, we have to face the fact that such cases are a distinct possibility. The locus of mandatory referral orders is that they relate to guilty pleas on a first-time appearance in court, so what view will the Government take if a young person has appeared before an EU court? We all enjoy the freedom to travel across the continent, so have the Government given any thought to the possibility that such cases might arise? If so, what is their answer?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> Mrs. Roe, I welcome you to the Chair. This is the first time that you have chaired the Committee. I am sure that we will benefit from your firm but fair stewardship.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) referred to Ascot. Our proceedings may have deprived some of us of the chance to spend an hour or two at Ascot this week, but they may also have saved us a pound or two--or even a euro or two.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly said, the amendments would extend the restriction on granting a referral order to a young offender who had previously
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``been convicted by or before a court in the United Kingdom of any offence''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so that it applied to any previous convictions in a court in the European Union.
<P>
We are determined that the referral order should focus on the group that is most likely to benefit--young first offenders. There are two reasons for that. First, we want to provide for early intervention to try to nip in the bud progressive offending behaviour, which worsens with each offence. If young offenders are to be diverted from becoming hardened criminals, it is essential to establish a process to nip such behaviour in the bud.
<P>
Secondly, young offenders who have not been through the youth justice system are more likely to respond to the approach that I have described. They have not had time to learn how to play the system. I talk to young offenders in institutions regularly, and I have found it instructive. Other Committee members may have had the same experience. When those young people are questioned, several things become apparent. For example, the same patterns recur in different offenders. It may seem paradoxical, but many young offenders are brutally honest about the process that led to their current circumstances. They may not be honest in other respects, but they will openly describe their lives and their experience of the criminal justice system.
<P>
I have found several common observations to be true. First, when discussing family relationships, it becomes apparent that many young offenders have never had a steady relationship with an adult male. That has several consequences, but it may not be appropriate to consider them now.
<P>
Secondly, many young offenders have not attended school regularly since they were 11. Some have managed to avoid attending school completely since they were 11. When they were not in school, they tended to learn the ways of the street.
<P>
My third observation has greater relevance to our discussion. If young offenders are asked about their experience of the criminal justice system, they say, almost invariably, that what happened the first time that they were in trouble set the pattern for their offending career. Most of them went to court expecting something serious to happen, only to receive a sentence that was less severe than expected, less relevant to their circumstances and less likely to modify their behaviour. We are trying to deal with that problem. Young offenders learn to play the system. They learn what is likely to happen to them. They learn dodges from their legal representatives, and ways of dealing with their predicament.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the sentiment underlying amendment No. 2 because it would provide that young offenders who had been through a court process in the European Union could not receive a referral order. Unfortunately, practical considerations prevent us from accepting the amendment. The key difficulty is that we do not receive complete information about juvenile convictions from our EU partners. Therefore, we would have to request the necessary information from each member state if we wanted to be certain whether a young offender had been previously convicted of an offence; the hon. Member for Ryedale gave a couple of good examples of that. Obviously, requesting such information would lead to delays in cases involving referral orders, and that might lead to the process becoming unworkable.
<P>
The provision suggested in the amendment may be viable in such circumstances if, in future, we extend co-operation in that field, making the transfer of information between member states more routine. Unfortunately, that is not viable at the moment and is unlikely to be so for some time.
<P>
However, the amendment is well-intentioned. We would be happy to accept it if we could achieve what the hon. Gentleman is seeking to achieve, Unfortunately, however, the practical barriers to that are too great.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. He has obviously perceived the spirit behind the amendment, and has given an acceptable answer. In any event--as he knows--Conservative Members are not entirely convinced that the provision should be restricted to first-time offenders. Given our position, it was appropriate to raise the matter. Having done so, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 1, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or by a court martial'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment makes a similar point to that made in the previous group of amendments; as the Minister said, we are probing the Government's position. It is possible that a 16 or 17-year-old Army recruit may have been in trouble, dealt with by the military police and court-martialled. How will such a person be affected by the provision for the referral of first-time offenders? I do not wish to labour the point, but have the Government considered that possibility? If so, what is their view?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Gentleman explained, the amendment would include court-martial convictions in the definition of previous convictions preventing a young person from receiving a referral order. Once again, our intention is to ensure that referral orders are targeted at those defendants who have not been convicted by a court. As the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) said last week, the youth offender panel makes provision for a process that is more likely to be effective at that stage.
<P>
However, I agree that a provision along the lines of the amendment may be needed. I wish to consider the implications of that with the Ministry of Defence before resolving how to deal with it. The amendment may not quite achieve its intended effect, as it may be flawed by difficulties pertaining to definition. For example, the term ``courts martial'' excludes convictions made by a standing civilian court. We must consider that matter more closely.
<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman's general point is good, and we need to explore it further. If he withdraws his amendment, we shall try to make progress on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. Even if we win the argument, the wordings are not necessarily the most appropriate for the Bill. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to consider the issue further and perhaps table a suitable amendment later. I appreciate that he will have to establish whether that is possible--it may not be. On the basis that the matter may be dealt with on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, leave out lines 23 and 24 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) he pleaded not guilty to one or more of the offences mentioned in paragraph (a) but was convicted of one or more such offences;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With this amendment, we are returning to more familiar territory. If it appears that we are covering the same ground, it is because, when I examined the Bill, I looked at it holistically and some amendments are the consequence of others that were debated earlier.
<P>
Let me explain some background issues. Under mandatory referral, the young offender must plead guilty. However, there is another mechanism whereby a young offender can be referred to a youth offending team and subsequently to a youth offender panel to establish a programme of rehabilitation. That applies when a youth is charged with more than one offence, pleads not guilty to one but pleads guilty to at least one other. Because he has pleaded guilty to at least one offence, he is capable of referral.
<P>
I understand the Under-Secretary's arguments, and if our roles were reversed I could hear myself making the same point--that guilt must be admitted before offending behaviour can be seriously addressed. We have debated such matters numerous times before in Committees over the years. However, for two reasons, the proposal is not that practical.
<P>
Let us consider the example of a punch-up after which several youngsters are taken to the police station and variously charged. Some will be under 18 and others older. In those circumstances, if a young offender is charged with others, guilty pleas are less likely. As we mentioned last week, on legal advice it is likely that they will all plead not guilty although, as the case progresses, some things may be said that more or less amount to an admission of guilt--after which someone is duly convicted. In those circumstances, it seems nonsense to rule out referral to a panel.
<P>
I largely accept what the Under-Secretary said a few moments ago about youngsters working the system and the need to deal with them effectively when they are first brought before the court. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have considerable sympathy with that point. However, it seems odd to say that we have a wonderful new concept and then say, in the circumstances that I mentioned earlier, that we cannot apply the referral mechanism.
<P>
The second point is that a referral to a youth offending team is especially pertinent in these circumstances because this is a discretionary referral anyway. It is not mandatory to refer to a youth offending team; therefore other sentences are available. It is not mandatory that a court make that referral order, so it can use its judgment--no doubt deploying guidance, if any, from the Home Secretary--about whether a young offender is saying that it was he who committed the offence and that he is sorry and will not offend again, and is asking for help to ensure that he does not. I hope that I have made it clear that the amendment admits that, for the moment, we have lost the argument about a straight guilty plea mandatory referral order and no discretion to the court--we shall come in a moment to whether a court should have other powers. We are dealing with the case of a young offender charged with several offences who does not plead guilty to any of them but is found guilty. Given that the sentence is discretionary anyway, we are asking why we should limit the court's ability to make a referral order to circumstances where there is one guilty plea. I genuinely think that incorporating the amendment, or something like it, would benefit the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Gentleman has argued, the amendment would widen the discretion of the referral conditions in the Bill. The courts would be allowed to make a referral where a young person pleads not guilty to one or more associated offences, provided he is convicted of at least one.
<P>
The amendment effectively removes the requirement for there to have been a guilty plea in respect of any of the associated offences. Courts will be able to make a referral order whenever a young offender is found guilty, regardless of the plea.
<P>
We intend a referral order to become the primary disposal for first-time offenders, depending on the nature of the offence, of course. To focus resources most effectively, we believe that it is right to restrict the availability of the referral order to young offenders who have pleaded guilty to at least one of the offences with which they were charged. In relation to our intention, the hon. Gentleman conceded as much in his opening remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I conceded that I understood the hon. Gentleman's point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Yes.
<P>
The Courts should also be able to make a referral order on a discretionary basis when sentencing a young offender for a number of associated offences, provided that he--it is usually a male--pleads guilty to at least one of them.
<P>
Referral orders represent a new approach. Young offenders will be expected to confront offending behaviour. The panel will investigate the factors that led to offending and how they can be overcome. The process will affect the victim and encourage him to consider the factors that led to the behaviour. A constructive approach is far more likely to be forthcoming from a young offender who has already admitted guilt. We know from accumulated experience in the prison system that a key factor in dealing with offending behaviour is that an offender accepts responsibility for the offence. That is a sort of opening point at which to begin serious work with offenders. It is the principle underlying what we are trying to achieve. As I have said, we believe that to focus resources to greatest effect, it is right to restrict availability of the referral order to young offenders who have pleaded guilty to at least one of the offences with which they are charged.
<P>
As I also said, the courts should also be able to make a referral order on a discretionary basis when sentencing the young offender.
<P>
The amendment is a step too far because it would open referral orders to a much wider group. We should wait for the accumulated experience of the pilot arrangements before we seriously consider taking that path. If the pilots based on first-time guilty pleaders work well, and we think that a wider category of offenders would benefit, we would consider using the order making powers to extend the provision. The hon. Member for Ryedale considers such matters sensibly. Given the relationship between offending behaviour and a plea of guilty, I am sure he will agree that it would be wise to wait for the experience of the pilots.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> So far, we have done our homework and, with some accuracy, anticipated what the Government and Opposition Front Bench spokesmen were likely to say. Subsections (3) and (4) vary the description of those to whom the proposal will apply, and I do not argue with that because a Conservative Administration would probably have constructed a similar measure. However, there is a danger that if the clause is left as drafted and the referral order becomes a hard hitting sanction, the young offender will try to avoid it by saying, ``Well, I'm going to plead not guilty to all this. When the case comes up I will be found guilty and put my hand up and say that it was me.'' In other words, the constructive referral would then apply in all circumstances. That is my worry--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that this is rather a long intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I was so rapt at what the hon. Gentleman was saying that I did not notice the length of his intervention.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's argument is that there may be a perverse incentive for some offenders to enter a plea of not guilty in order to escape a referral order. That may happen in some cases; one can never say never, but such a pattern would not necessarily emerge. The point about the pilots is that if that happens, we can deal with it by order-making power at a later date. The wisest thing to do would be to wait and see how the pilots go.
<P>
I may have contributed to the argument by saying that young men sometimes learn to play the system, but the courts and the criminal justice system should deal with that to prevent it from becoming a routine practice. The pilots will show whether that will be a problem, as I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept.
<P>
There are some categories of offender for whom the disposal is likely to be of most benefit, and the pilot arrangements will enable us to ensure that the people at whom the  the new provision is targeted are those to whom it will apply. If the proposal does not work as we intend that it should, or if the pattern that the hon. Member for Ryedale fears develops, we can reconsider it by means of the order-making powers in the Bill, but I hope that that will not happen. We believe that the piloting arrangements in the Bill are about right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, as we have had a valuable exchange of views. In the light of events in the past four or five days, it may well fall to Conservative Ministers to deal with these matters. [Laughter.] The Minister of State laughs, but he will know that there is a common thread running through these criminal justice issues and how they have progressed. We have made it abundantly clear in Committee that we are enthusiastic about the principle of referral orders and panels, and as the Under-Secretary knows, I also made that clear on Second Reading. We are enthusiastic and want the measure to succeed.
<P>
It is the Under-Secretary's responsibility to make a judgment. I understand his judgment, and I am happy to live with it, but it is the Opposition's job to probe some of these points. I repeat that that is precisely what lies behind all the amendments that we have tabled. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 3, line 3, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and (g) whether the offender has previously been subject to a referral order.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment moves the argument on a little because it deals with the situation referred to by the Under-Secretary, and which I mentioned in an over-long intervention, for which I apologise. If the measure is a great success, it may be extended in future.
<P>
Clause 2(3) gives the Secretary of State the power, by regulation, to amend the structure of the referral order scheme, including who can qualify and in what circumstances courts may, or may not, be required to make referral orders. In order to give us some idea of what might be in the Home Secretary's mind, subsection (4) sets out some of the factors that might be pertinent to the changes that he may make in the future.
<P>
For example, he may decide that referral orders are pretty good for under-16s, but a waste of time for the 16 and 17-year-olds who have worked the system and who have managed to avoid being in court. Under subsection (4)(a), the Secretary of State can change the age from, say, 18 to 16. I hope that I have given the flavour of what the Government have in mind. Believe it or not, in view of our previous discussion, the Secretary of State could change the requirement for a guilty plea, under subsection (4)(b), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``how the offender has pleaded''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Interruption.] No, I welcome that.
<P>
The Secretary of State can change the provision to relate only to offences of dishonesty, for example. We have already debated motoring offences, and shall discuss that subject again later. He can consider whether the offender has previous convictions, or how he has been punished previously. An all-embracing final provision in subsection (4)(f) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any characteristics or behaviour of, or circumstances relating to, any personÅ.Å.Å.Åcharged in the same proceedings as the offender''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We can live with that, but there is a glaring omission. The clause does not say whether a referral order has previously been made against the offender. I wonder whether that should be a factor. I accept that subsection (4) is not meant to be inclusive--it does not exclude other possibilities--and that these are only ideas of what may guide the Home Secretary. He may take the view that whether or not a referral order has been made previously is a major factor. Subsection (4)(e), referring to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``howÅ.Å.Å.Åthe offender has been previously punished or otherwise dealt with by any court''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
includes that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I see the Under-Secretary nodding. Referral orders will give a young offender a chance. He will have had a warning and reprimand, and he will already have been in contact with the youth offending team. If he appears before a youth panel and receives a referral order, that will be his final chance. The system may be changed to deal with people who have previous convictions. Therefore, when a court decides whether to make a further referral order for someone who has reoffended, a significant factor to consider will be whether the offender has received a referral order before. If he has, it should consider the outcome. That is important to any amended scheme with a wider application.
<P>
I accept that the list is not meant to be all-embracing. The Bill would be improved if our suggestion were included. Parliament and the courts should be able to consider cases by assessing how a young offender reacted and responded to the chance he was given through referral to a youth offender panel. That should be a factor in considering whether he should receive another referral order at a future date when the scheme is given wider application.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell </B>(Colchester): My view may come as a shock to the hon. Member for Ryedale, but I think that this is a sensible amendment. My vote on a previous occasion was perhaps more a judgment on the quality of his argument than on anything else.
<P>
Liberal Democrats want to see youth offender panels introduced and we want them to be a success. The pilot scheme will be important. There is scope for widening the provision and for making more people eligible for referral, and there should be an opportunity to refer people for a second time. That possibility should be included in the Bill. I hope that the Under-Secretary will take those points on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The amendment, as the hon. Member for Ryedale made clear, would expand the suggested list of issues that might be considered in regulations to amend the group of offenders for whom a referral order may be made. The hon. Member for Colchester supports that aim.
<P>
The amendment would add to the list a specific reference to offenders previously subject to a referral order. Clause 2 sets out the conditions for making a referral order and makes provision for those conditions to be altered by the making of regulations. That provision is included so that, in the light of experience, the group of young offenders eligible for a referral order may be narrowed or widened.
<P>
Subsection (4) sets out the sort of issue that might be addressed by such regulations. As the hon. Member for Ryedale conceded, it is not an exhaustive list, but indicative of the nature of the issues that might be considered in any future regulations. Therefore, it does not rule out other issues being covered.
<P>
I appreciate that if, in the future, regulations were introduced to make referral orders available to a wider group of young offenders, including those with one or more previous conviction, the issue of whether to repeat a referral order would become pertinent. However, as the hon. Member for Ryedale anticipated, that is effectively covered under subsection (4)(e), which states that it is appropriate to consider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``how (if at all) the offender has been previously punished or otherwise dealt with by any court''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's interpretation of subsection (4)(e) is correct. His amendment is therefore unnecessary. His point is covered by that paragraph, and there is no intention to make the list exhaustive. With that explanation, I hope that we will maintain our consensus: we are all seeking the same objective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but I want to tempt him to his feet once more by posing one or two questions. We shall not press the amendment, notwithstanding the support of the hon. Member for Colchester, which is always welcome.
<P>
Does the Minister accept that, as and when the scheme is extended, whether the young offender has had a previous referral order and, if so, its outcome should be a pertinent issue for the court to consider in deciding whether to commit him to another referral order? It should not be a case only of asking what the offender has been given before--probation, a community service order, a combination order and a sentence in a young offender institution--and wondering what the heck to do with him now. That is the round that we have all seen offenders go through, but it is more important and more specific than that. The referral order provides the young offender with a specific chance which, arguably, other disposals do not provide.
<P>
That is why I tabled the amendment, notwithstanding my correct anticipation of the official answer. It is important to send a signal now--we may have sent it through our debate, but I would rather it were built into the Bill--that we regard the response of young offenders to referral orders as an important consideration in deciding whether they should be allowed another chance, as and when the scheme is extended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I respond to the hon. Gentleman with some reluctance because my hon. Friend the Minister of State is becoming impatient with all this consensus.
<P>
On the first part of the hon. Gentleman's question, if we were to expand the group covered by the provision, yes, whether an offender had a previous order would become pertinent. However, other past sentences relevant to the particular offence must also be taken into account. That explains the drafting of subsection (4)(e), whose purpose I tried to explain a few moments ago. At risk of incurring the displeasure of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is now satisfied on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have to be satisfied, given that the Under-Secretary has explained--as I twice acknowledged--that subsection (4)(e) covers the point. However, I still believe that it is important to establish how an offender responded to a previous referral order before making another one, and that that is a more specific and targeted point than how he responded to anything else. We are talking about the future, and considerable consensus on some matters is clear. There may be less consensus about which horse to lose our euro on at Ascot, but that is another matter.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 21, leave out `3' and insert `6'.
<P>
This is a probing amendment to enable members of the Committee to discuss the important matter of the length of the referral order. One of the few discretions given to the court under the Bill's structure is to refer the young offender to the youth offending team, which will subsequently refer the offender to the youth offender panel for a period of between three and 12 months.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have no way of knowing what time scale will be thought appropriate by the courts. Although I am content with the maximum period of 12 months--and we shall debate later how that should be interpreted if young offenders reoffend--I question whether three months is a long enough period to achieve all that which referral orders set out to achieve under clause 8. Other members of the Committee may back me up in my assumption that most, if not all, probation orders are for a minimum of six months, yet the Bill provides for a referral order of only three months.
<P>
Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the action plan order is for only three months. We debated on Second Reading the confusion that may arise between action plan orders and youth offender referral orders, so I shall not labour that point.
<P>
Let us suppose that the provisions are in place now in one of the pilot areas and a youngster is made the subject of a referral order by the court. Given that we are approaching the three holiday months of June to July to August to September, victims, members of the panel and those involved in reparation programmes may be on holiday. Will we achieve all that we want to achieve in three months?
<P>
Clause 8 sets out the terms of the programme. The young offender may be required to make reparation to the victim, attend mediation sessions, undertake unpaid work or service in the community, or attend school or another educational establishment or a place of work. The last two requirements may be more difficult to fulfil during the holiday months. More important, the offender may be required to participate in specified activities, including rehabilitation in respect of the misuse of drugs or alcohol, and may also be required to present himself to persons at various times in certain places. That the programme is fairly comprehensive is not at issue; we approve of it. However, the case has not been made that all its requirements can be achieved in three months.
<P>
I return to my favourite argument about discretion being given to the courts. They could consider that three months is a long enough period in certain circumstances. If they consider that some elements in the programme are essential, they could order a longer referral period. That would be fine if the courts had the discretion to do so and were involved in drawing up the contract. However, they will not have any discretion; they will be required to make a referral order. Nor will they be involved in drawing up the contract, because the youth offender panel will draw up the contract after the referral has been made.
<P>
The young offender is being given a chance to address his offending behaviour so as not to reoffend in future. I question whether three months during which an offender is not caught is long enough to be convinced that the referral order has worked, and that the youth offender panel has achieved all its objectives. Courts will need a great deal of guidance on the period to be set for referral orders.
<P>
The Under-Secretary--and the Minister of State from a sedentary position--suggested that the pilot arrangements were part of an experiment, which could be reviewed later. We understand that. However, I have a lingering doubt about whether three months is long enough. I suspect that we will find that six months is a more suitable minimum period when the application is extended and we return to the matter, for the reasons that the Minister outlined and that we debated. I do not say that as a way of using up another 10 minutes of Committee time in discussion. The issue is genuine, which is why we pressed for debate on it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): The hon. Member for Ryedale again shows that he fundamentally misunderstands the Bill. It is extraordinary for someone who previously argued that some offences are so slight that they should not be dealt with by such means, to better the court's discretion by doubling the length of the period for which referral orders may be made.
<P>
Surely, the Bill should fit particular circumstances. We must ensure that certain offences are handled in certain ways and that the needs of young offenders and the community are properly addressed. As we are discussing the efficient processing of young offenders, it would be extraordinary to prevent a youth court ordering a youth offending team to do a certain amount of work with a young person within three months, and expect it to spin that work out over six months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Gentleman. The amendment is reasonable and is based on sound principles. On an earlier occasion, I argued in the same way as the hon. Member for Ryedale about whether referral should be discretionary or mandatory. However, that should be set aside in our examination of the Bill.
<P>
Twelve weeks is, in all honesty, a short period for getting all the professionals together. I have been involved in this field and know how it works. In some instances, probation officers are unavailable for six weeks at a time. In Merseyside and north Wales, a report will not be made in less than six or seven weeks.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> That is disgraceful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Well, it is true. It may be disgraceful, as the Minister says; nevertheless, it is absolutely true.
<P>
That needs to be borne in mind, as clause 8(1)(b) makes provision for professional mediation; the probation service will also be involved in the provision made under clause 8(1)(c). Will that be cost-neutral? Will we need more resources to get everyone up to speed in three months?
<P>
My third point has already been made: if the panel convenes in the summer months, the option of ensuring that someone attends an educational establishment is not in any event open to it. Although I consider that the court should have discretion, a youngster might think, ``Well, it's only 12 weeks--I'm getting off with a soft option. I'll have to speak to a probation officer once or twice, go to an attendance centre or educational establishment once or twice and that's it--I'll be in the clear.'' No member of the Committee would want to send that message, but the debate should not be dismissed in the way that it is. It is a fundamentally important debate we all want the new, somewhat revolutionary order to work. If it is to work, we must get the whole team together; to do that, we need resources and time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> I think that this is an ``on balance'' question. We are still in the early stages of the experiment and there is an inconsistency in the line put by the hon. Member for Ryedale; in our previous sitting he said that nice boys from nice homes should not be sent to centres, yet now he is trying to double the time for which some of them would be sent there. Three months may not prove long enough, but we should try it out; if three months works, fine, but if, in the light of experience, it has to be increased to six months, so be it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman because I want to encourage him to speak more often, but I wish to make  a point of clarification. My earlier point was that because the referral order would not be appropriate in some cases, the courts should have more discretion, including the ability to impose a fine. I did not say what the hon. Gentleman thinks I said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell:</B> But the courts will clearly have the discretion to say that three months is better than the six months that the hon. Gentleman wants. I can assure him that I will speak when I think that I have something to contribute and not just for the sake of doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Consensus ends here because I must make it clear to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) that his allegation that Labour Members dismiss the debate as unimportant is false. It is a very important debate, which reveal the fundamental misunderstanding of the hon. Member for Ryedale of what we seek to achieve. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) is correct in his analysis of the complete inconsistency of the hon. Gentleman's position--revealed in the contribution of the hon. Member for Colchester. The hon. Member for Ryedale cannot have it both ways--he can try to do so, in the bright aftermath of the false dawn that has arisen on his political horizon, but it will not work.
<P>
We seek to ensure that the sentencing court has enough flexibility of disposal. It will hear the facts, will have the young person in front of it and, on the basis of its assessment of those facts, will make a determination on the appropriate length of the disposal. It is right that it should do so. To say that three months is not long enough is a fundamentally flawed approach to the question that the sentencing court will be required to address. It will want to know that in that three months the youth offender panel can be convened--as it will be--and to have in mind what it knows about the nature of the offence, about the panel's likely approach to that offence and about the person appearing before them. It will be for the panel to effect the appropriate contribution from a variety of sources to make that three-month experience meaningful for the young person involved and ensure that those three months are used to best effect to deal with the offending behaviour.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The sentencing court will have in mind the panel's likely approach. We expect the court to keep abreast of developments in the field, and to have the sort of relationship with local agencies that will enable it to judge what will be available to the panel and the nature of the expertise that will be applied to meet the needs of the young person before the panel.
<P>
The sentencing court should have proper discretion to determine the length of the disposal. Without that, it will not have sufficient flexibility in determining a response appropriate to the seriousness of the offence and to the nature of the young person before it. The primary disposal for first-time offenders who plead guilty will range from responding to relatively minor offences--we heard the definition of ``minor'' of the hon. Member for Ryedale in our previous sitting, about which several Labour Members, and, I suspect, the hon. Member for Colchester, had reservations--to more serious offences, for which custody is only narrowly avoided. Three to twelve months is the right spectrum.
<P>
I should like to respond to a point made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. I am bound to say that six weeks for a report is entirely unacceptable, and that the Government will not accept it. I do not accept that it is a question of resources alone. It is no such thing. All too often, insufficient urgency is brought to bear on such matters. [Interruption.] I shall finish my point. Local agencies do not necessarily always work well together. Through the time limits that we are setting and the targets that we have set ourselves in relation to persistent young offenders, we are determined to ensure that a new note of urgency is injected into the system of juvenile justice. Nothing less will meet the needs of the young people involved or of the public, who are entitled to the safety and security that expeditious disposal of juvenile offenders will provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am sure that we both agree that the probation service does a good job, despite the pattern of closures of district offices in north and mid Wales and Cheshire that I have witnessed day in, day out. I entirely agree with the Minister that this field should have priority for the sake of the young person. However, such priorities are placed on probation officers for cases brought under the Children Act 1989, thousands of which now go through the courts. They are already totally overburdened with them. With the best will in the world, they cannot work more than 24 hours a day, and need far more resources.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I do not mean to be uncharitable, but he comes from a party whose response to problems is all too often ``more resources''. That simply is not on. There may be a need for investment of resources where those resources are linked to outcomes, but the notion that it is simply a question of resources is not borne out by the facts.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the probation service, which is doing well in some areas. Probation officers contribute to public safety and security and to the protection of the welfare and well-being of those for whom they are responsible by ensuring that they do not offend again. That is the best protection for any young person. Some probation officers in some areas are doing a great job in that respect. Others are not doing so well. We have to be up front about that. If all was hunky-dory, we would not be here. If everything worked as it should work, there would be no need for the measures that we are proposing, but the reality is otherwise.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale went on at great length about how six months are needed for the probation service to do the job. Each of us knows--certainly practitioners know--that all too often the probation service has not done the job in 12 months. That is not always the probation service's fault. The question is of mindset and an approach to offending that has lacked rigour in the past. All too often, what has been brought to bear around young offenders has not been designed to oblige them to confront their offending or to require them to address such behaviour, reform and change their ways.
<P>
The point of the disposal is to ensure a spectrum of time to enable appropriate intervention by appropriate agencies. The same agencies will not always work in relation to certain young people. We were given the example of a road traffic offence the other day. I would not expect someone appearing before the panel in relation to such an offence necessarily to have the same agencies present in relation to it as someone appearing before the panel in relation to a domestic burglary, an act of violence or a drugs offence. The panel will be convened on the basis of young people's requirements in terms of preventing reoffending, and for a length of time appropriate to the nature of the offence and the young person concerned.
<P>
For that reason, I am unable to accept the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Ryedale. He referred to it as a probing amendment; he probed and has a response on the basis of which I hope that he will withdraw the amendment. If it were pursued, it would be utterly detrimental to the basis of our intended reform. We would oppose the amendment to our fullest capacity.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Obviously, this debate was worth having. The Minister of State attacked lawyers last Tuesday, and we have now had the pleasure of hearing him attack the probation service at some length. I say to him and to the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre that there is no misunderstanding on our part--I bring the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy into the argument--of what the Government are trying to do. We understand it only too well. That is why so many of our debates and the points that we are raising are clearly hitting the target. Some of these issues have become the subject of disagreement because there is a fundamental disagreement between us about the structure of what the Government are putting in place.
<P>
It is not a misunderstanding of what the Government are doing, but a disagreement with some key elements of their proposals. The answer that we have been given, in effect, is that the period must be three months. Some young people who have pleaded guilty will be under the mandatory nature of the referral order, but had the courts had discretion, they would never have referred these offenders to the youth offending team in the first place. The courts would have fined them, or given them a conditional discharge. The reason for three months, we are told, is that there will be cases when the argument about whether such offenders should go before a youth offending panel will be tenuous. But the courts will have no option.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I cannot imagine on what possible basis the hon. Gentleman constructs that interpretation from anything that has been said by me or my hon. Friends. Will he say what I, or my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre, have said that is capable of withstanding that construction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): It is a mindset.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As my hon. Friend, the usually silent one says, it is a mindset, which is that everything that is done now with first-time young offenders who plead guilty is not working. Nothing is working, so we have to have a new system. We agree that the present system is not working in many cases, and that the new system will bring benefits. I have tried to take a holistic approach, and to consider the matter in the round. I am not picking off pieces of the proposals and asking to alter this or that word in typical parliamentary filibustering fashion. My six-month amendment would make considerably more sense if the courts had discretion in the referral order in the first place, so that only the youngsters who would benefit, and not those for whom it is not necessary, would be referred to the youth offending team and the panel. The courts would equally have the discretion to fine or to give a conditional discharge.
<P>
We are left with the argument that the period has to be three months in case there are those for whom longer would be inappropriate. That is the weakness of the Government's position. If this measure is so important in addressing offending behaviour, our argument is that that cannot be done in three months for the majority of the people to whom both the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary have referred.
<P>
I shall withdraw the amendment only because I think that the Minister of State is right to say that there will be people for whom a longer period is inappropriate. However, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and I have won the argument--the courts will see that in due course--that some people will be referred, and the courts will say that they have to do it because it is mandatory. They will say that although they do not believe that they should refer the offender, they have no choice. Given that they have no choice, the period must be three months.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman consider the fact that perhaps during that three-month programme, in utilising the resources of the police or highways department, the young person who has been convicted of, say, speeding can be dealt with in a way that hits him between the eyes and goes way beyond being fined? Is not that what these proposals are all about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made his point. I have a suspicion that the resources of whom he speaks would rather spend their time dealing with other offenders. However, that is a wholly different issue. The resources of these organisations are, as the hon. Gentleman said, already wafer thin, threadbare. Where are the police officers who should be on the streets, let alone those who would become involved in this type of offending? If the resources were sufficient, they would not be dealing with youngsters caught speeding by a radar trap but with youngsters who took someone's car and then went speeding through a radar trap. We are talking about priorities.
{**P4**}Given the Government's insistence on mandatory sentences, no discretion, and very limited alternatives, I am happy to accept that three months probably makes sense. But I suspect that for the majority of youngsters who will benefit from the sort of contracts set out in clause 8, three months will not be long enough. We are being asked to agree to three months because some young people will be referred to a youth offender team. Frankly, this will be a waste of a resource that could be used elsewhere. We shall have to wait to see what the pilots bring.
{**P4**}The debate has been worth while; it has again made it clear that although there is consensus on much of what the Government are aiming for, there is fundamental disagreement on two key aspects of their plans: the mandatory nature of the referral and the inability to impose a fine on young first-time offenders who plead guilty. We shall see how the scheme works out. I am happy that we have had the debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
{**P4**}Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 3, line 26, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and shall give him a written statement to that effect which explains'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 20, in page 3, line 32, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) On making a referral order the court shall forthwith send to the youth offending team specified in subsection (1)(a) written details of the offence or offences involved, together with copies of any reports and other relevant papers available to the court.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> These are a couple of technical amendments. I hope that the Minister will agree that a little attention needs to be paid to the Bill's drafting.
{**P4**}Clause 8(5) requires young offender panels to provide the young offender with a written record of the contract agreed with him--the terms of the programme dealing with his offending behaviour that is at the heart of the referral.
{**P4**}Clause 3 relates to the making of the referral order by the courts. We consider it vital for the young offender to understand the nature of the order, and what will be expected of him. If there is not that understanding, how will he be able to agree the contract? We shall come to that in a while. We think that the process would be aided if the court were required to give the young offender a written statement of the fact that it is making a referral order, and to outline what it is all about. I agree with the Minister of State that all too often young offenders in youth courts are mere bystanders in a process. I have no argument with his deeply held belief that that is wrong and that we need to do something about it.
{**P4**}Clause 3 does not require the court to give a statement in writing. It states only that the court should explain to the offender ``in ordinary language''. Much explaining in ordinary language already takes place but it passes over the heads of some youngsters. Hence the importance of the amendment.
{**P4**}Two questions came to mind as I prepared last evening for today's debate. First, what do the Government intend? Secondly, is the issue covered elsewhere? It may well be, but I am sure that the Minister agrees that it is important to avoid doubt, confusion and misunderstanding.
{**P4**}Amendment No. 20 is different. It deals with the information that is conveyed to the youth offending team and the youth offender panel after the referral order has been made. Common sense dictates that the youth offender panel will eventually receive details of the offence, including the circumstances of the case and the offender's family background. However, the Bill does not specifically require the court to send the panel that information. The Minister of State is nodding.
{**P4**}When I went through the Bill and tried to test each part of the structure, two bits of the jigsaw seemed to be missing. There may be ways other than amendments Nos. 19 and 20 of dealing with the problem, but I hope that I have explained the amendment's purpose. I am open to persuasion, but I believe that it would be better to include the requirements in the Bill. I commend the spirit of the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Amendment No. 19 is reasonable and helpful. The Minister may claim that its purpose is covered elsewhere in the Bill. I, too, have looked but been unable to find that.
{**P4**}Providing for a written statement is reasonable. As the Minister said in a previous debate, in the past a young person often hid behind his lawyer, who did all the speaking in court and undertook all the advocacy. The young person took a back seat and little interest in the proceedings. He was probably interested in the outcome but in nothing else. Under the new regime, which we all agree will be useful, a written statement would give the young people something to consider in the cold light of day, when they are alone, thinking about the months ahead and what is expected of them.
<P>
The amendment is perfectly proper, and has been tabled for the best possible reasons. The Bill mentions ``language''. I presume that ethnic languages and Welsh, which is my first language, will be catered for. That is a serious point. Many people--I may be one--find it easier to converse in languages other than English. It is essential that the young person is the focus of the process, from the beginning to the end.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The amendments relate to the administrative arrangements that are incumbent on the court when making a referral order. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for tabling the amendments and enabling us to concentrate on the way in which the court should convey information to a young person.
<P>
Clause 3 sets out the information that is to be included in the referral order and requires the court to explain its effect ``in ordinary language'', and the consequences of failing to agree a contract or failing to comply with an agreed contract. Amendment No. 19 would require the court to make the information available to the offender in written form.
<P>
Amendment No. 20 would include in the Bill a requirement for the court to send to the appropriate youth offending team written details of the offences and copies of relevant reports or papers.
<P>
It is crucial that a person who is the subject of a referral order should be fully and precisely aware of what it means. Young people need to know how long the order will last--it will be between three and 12 months--and that they will be required to attend meetings of the youth offender panel. They will also need to know what will happen if they do not attend those meetings. Under clause 3, the court will have to make that clear to young offenders.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale usefully hit on an important point, with which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy agreed, when he said that the Committee should consider how best to convey the information so that it has an impact on young people. The court, as a matter of deliberate policy, tries to ensure that it has the requisite skills to address young people in a way that captures their attention, and that consideration is given to the configuration of the court so that what is said there does not literally, as well as metaphorically, go over the head of a young person. A young offender may take fully into account everything that is said to him by the court but it is equally possible that in the stress of the moment he may not be sufficiently affected by it. For that reason, a written record of what is said is desirable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I do not wish to upset the Minister, who is coming over to our point of view. Although I reinforce what he and the hon. Member for Ryedale have said, there is a danger that we will return to the old system in which the advocate appearing for the youngster takes the court warning and subsequently issues it to his client in some form. The youngster thinks he is bolstered from the effect of the process because there is someone in the front line ahead of him and, regrettably, nine times out of 10, the old form of telling off from the bench or the panel does not work. That reinforces the argument and is what the Minister is now saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am much obliged for the hon. Gentleman's contribution.  He well illustrates some of the existing problems that we want to avoid being replicated in the new system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I reinforce the point made in the debate, about which there seems to be a consensus, that the stress of the occasion may mean that the importance of what is being said may be lost on the young offender. There is another potential problem, especially in a serious case: the fact that the young offender is not being sent to a custodial institution may mean that he thinks, ``Ah, I am not going to be locked up, so that's all right then.'' As the Minister said, that is not all right. In such circumstances, the young offender may have 12 months' hard work to contend with and it is important that he understands that.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It is important that we bring home to the young person the seriousness of his offence and the rigour of the referral order. It is customary for the courts to provide an offender with a copy of any order. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, and other practitioners, will be aware of how, too often--as with bail conditions--it will be handed to the advocate and will not impact at all on the young offender.
<P>
One can see the argument for expanding the order so that it contains the information referred to by the hon. Member for Ryedale and can be given to the young person, whose family and advocate could then explain the consequences of falling outside the youth court. It would then be a continuing reminder of the obligations that have been entered into. For that reason, we are attracted by amendment No. 19. The understandable infelicities in the language can be addressed by parliamentary draftsmen. I hope that with my assurance that we very much accept the spirit of the amendment and that we will return later to table a further amendment to meet the same objective, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I am bound to say that I cannot be at all accommodating with amendment No. 20, which is an overbureaucratic response to circumstances which would be better dealt with through guidelines to the court. There must be swift and effective communication between the courts and the relevant youth offending team and the expanded order that we envisage in the light of our acceptance of the spirit of amendment No. 19 will obviously play a part. There is no reason why a team should not be sent a copy of that expanded document.
<P>
The team will itself be the potential originator of some of the material that may be brought before the court in appropriate circumstances, and we will deal through clear administrative guidelines with the need for any further information that needs to be passed between the court and the youth offending team.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is quite likely in the fullness of time that the team will know more about the young offender than the court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I very much hope that that will be case because the team will have the opportunity to sit with the young person in circumstances that were specifically designed to ensure a clear understanding of the young person's needs and how best to address them. Other information, apart from basic details relating to the offender and the nature of the order, will also be valuable to the youth offending team. Teams will need to know about any ancillary orders, which must be taken into account when the contract is being devised. That is not referred to in the amendment, but would need to be known.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that providing clear guidance on what information is requisite and on the manner in which it should be made available to the team--and, importantly, a time scale--is most appropriate. We are absolutely committed to expedition in these matters and there will be guidance on timing too. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was right in one respect. Timing is important because delay is disastrous to the process.
<P>
I hope that, in the light of the assurances that I have given about the guidance that will be issued, the hon. Member for Ryedale will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This debate has been an important part of the scrutiny process and I am grateful to the Minister for his commitment to consider the provision of something in written form to enable a young offender to understand properly what is being done to him.
<P>
I shall not press amendment No. 19, but shall wait to see wording that is more technically correct. I shall be interested to see how that differs from ours. The Minister referred to one point that we missed out and it might be the mechanism by which we achieve the aim of amendment No. 20, which is to send a written explanation to the youth offending team as well.
<P>
We cannot state often enough, particularly in the early stages before the street lore becomes more commonplace and offenders become aware that they will appear before a youth offender panel, that people will not understand the process. Some of the youngsters will be truants, from poor backgrounds and have low academic ability and there will be an awful lot for them to absorb all in one go. The ability to read and understand the statement is important.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's comments on amendment No. 19. On amendment No. 20, I accept that the Government's proposals will not work unless youth offender panels are given all the relevant information that they need to draw up a contract. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Making of referral orders: effect on court's other sentencing powers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 4, leave out line 14.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 22, in page 4, line 16, leave out from ``him'' to end of line 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Earlier, I said that a number of amendments were drafted that worked in the round. However, I shall not go over all the ground on fines and conditional discharges that we covered last week. We have already touched on that.
<P>
The courts will need flexibility. I suspect that, in the fulness of time, the schemes will be changed to incorporate that. It is highly likely that we shall return to the issue on the Floor of the House, but the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary have had another week to think about my point that there will be cases for which a fine or a conditional discharge are appropriate.
<P>
The amendments were drafted before our discussions on similar issues last week, but we should give some thought to finding a more limited application for fines and conditional discharges. I do not know whether it was the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), but, last week, someone referred to a youngster who had stolen a bottle of milk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> It was mentioned on these Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We had a debate about what to do with a young teenager who steals a bottle of milk, and there was an attempt to create a division, although none exists. I agree with the Under-Secretary; as we left the Committee Room at the end of the previous sitting, the hon. Gentleman said something to the effect of, ``Come on, surely you can't be serious that young offender panels are not relevant to someone who has committed a theft.'' They certainly are relevant, but my point is that not all offences are offences of dishonesty, although they are all offences against society or they would not be offences. How many Members of Parliament--I do not want to impugn the integrity of right hon. and hon. Members--since being elected have gone through a speed trap?

<P>

<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> No. Speak for yourself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> How many have been pursued for speeding up the motorway? Members of Government have been involved in a number of high-profile cases. I shall not labour the point; a referral order is not appropriate for every offence. We must consider a more limited application of the ability to impose a fine or give a conditional discharge, although the amendments will allow us to have another debate on the subject. They are consistent with our earlier discussions; it has been a week since the Minister first heard our views on the subject and I should be interested to know whether he has anything different to say about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I have the distinct impression that the hon. Gentleman is not terribly serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are very serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman is serious about the principles, but I think not about the pressing the amendment. Clause 4 sets out the effect of a referral order on a court's other sentencing powers. It specifically precludes the court from dealing with associated offences in certain ways, for example, by ordering a fine or a conditional discharge. That is consistent with what the hon. Gentleman said when he introduced the amendments.
<P>
The amendments would reintroduce the power of the court to make such orders in respect of associated offences. The crux of part I is that a referral order is a new style of disposal; it is not an ancillary order. For that reason, clause 4 makes it clear that the court cannot pass an additional sentence to a referral order in respect of the offence or any associated offences being considered by the court.
<P>
A referral order is not only the primary disposal; it is also, intentionally, a flexible disposal. For example, it can include financial reparation at the appropriate level, responding directly to the damage done by the offending behaviour. It is likely to be far more effective than a straight fine; common sense tells us that such a flexible approach, if it is carried out intelligently, is likely to be successful.
<P>
As to amendment No. 22, it is difficult to see any practical benefit from ordering a conditional discharge at the same time as a referral order. Compliance with a referral order contract will depend upon a young person avoiding further offending. If the young person offends during the period of the referral order, the court will have the option to extend the current referral order or, more likely, to revoke the order and to resentence the offender for both the original and the subsequent offence. The referral order is, intentionally, the primary disposal for the target group of offenders. It would therefore be inappropriate for the court to make other orders--apart from ancillary orders--in respect of the offence or any associated offence of which the young person is convicted.
{**P4**}I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to establish. He has made it clear that he wishes to return to the matter, perhaps on Report, but for the reasons that I have given--principally that the referral order is the primary means of disposal--I cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are speaking at cross purposes--I may have misunderstood clause 4. The Minister seems to be saying that subsection (4) would allow additional sentences to the referral order. That is not my reading, which is that that provision comes under subsection (5). We are saying that the disposals prohibited to the court under subsection (4) should not include fines or conditional discharges. Our amendments are almost consequential to those that we tabled to clauses 1 and 2. I am not suggesting that fines or a conditional discharge should be given in addition to a referral order--they should be given instead of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If that is the hon. Gentleman's intention, subsection (4) is not the appropriate place to effect it. Either the referral order is a suitable disposal or it is not; if it is not, what the hon. Gentleman suggests as a reasonable sentence would come into play in any case because it would not be given in the context of a referral order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Is the Under-Secretary saying that for subsection (2), which states that--perhaps the Minister will also read it--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The court may not deal with the offender for the offence in any of the prohibited ways''<P>
</UL></FONT>
{**P4**}we should substitute the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may not in addition deal with the offender for the offence in any of the prohibited ways''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
{**P4**}I read the subsection as simply saying that where a court makes a referral order, it is prohibited from doing anything else with it. We are agreed on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I have read the subsection, but the hon. Gentleman's point must be seen in connection with subsections (2) and (4). In that context, the hon. Gentleman is incorrect. As I understand it, the practical benefit that he seeks to add, through amendment No. 22 for example, of ordering a conditional discharge at the same time as a referral order, simply does not apply. Compliance with a referral order is tied to the condition that a young person does not reoffend; if he does, he will be back in court and the previous offence will be taken into account, alongside any new offence. The hon. Gentleman's point is therefore not relevant and his amendment is unnecessary. We will deal with future offending separately, but it will have a bearing on the referral order; the offence from which that order flowed could be reconsidered in the light of further offending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is the way that we envisage it working in practice. I will consider what the hon. Gentleman has said to see whether I have misunderstood what is involved; if the problem that the hon. Gentleman describes exists, I will come back to him, but I do not think that it does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> One of us is wrong; I am not sure who. I suspect that the Under-Secretary is not sure either. I shall not press the point as we have debated it before, but I shall continue to pray in aid the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy because of his vast experience of such matters. The clause is setting out again the structure of what the court can or cannot not do when it makes a referral order.
{**P4**}Other orders can be added to a referral order. Not everything is excluded and we shall debate later what happens when other orders are added. The amendments would allow the court to impose a fine or a conditional discharge instead of making a referral order, not in addition to a referral order. If I have misread clause 4, so be it, but at least we have had the chance to discuss the imposition of fines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It may be of some help to the hon. Gentleman if I explain that clause 4 deals with additional sentences. Subsection (1) applies when a referral order has been made. I hope that that clarifies the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Yes, but the Minister has now stirred the grey matter on another point. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The court may not deal with the offender for the offence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What about other offences? They may not be those that were committed subsequently, but other offences that the person was found guilty of committing as well as the offence to which he pleaded guilty, when the referral was entirely in accordance with the discretionary powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The subsection refers to the offence and, if the hon. Gentleman wants to take the matter further, he should read subsection (3), which sets out under paragraphs (a) and (b) what the court may do in such circumstances. I accept that the set of arrangements is very complex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is ambiguous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not think that it is ambiguous. If both of us go away and read the clause again, the hon. Gentleman will find that I am right and he is wrong. I am sure that he will then withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I should have liked to be  able to say that the advice I received was deficient, but I did not seek any advice because such are the resources of the Opposition that I have had to work through the matter myself and draft the amendments. If I have misunderstood clause 4, I shall not argue that it is ambiguous, but there is certainly scope for misunderstanding. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
{**P4**}Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Making of referral orders: attendance of parents etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 5, line 13, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) Prior to the making of an order requesting the attendance of an appropriate person the court shall give the person an opportunity to make representations to the court'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 24, in page 5, line 33, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) Appropriate persons may also consist of--
<P>
(i) a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt or cousin; or
<P>
(ii) a teacher in loco parentis.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are beginning to make such swift progress that I need to gather my thoughts on clause 5. It gives courts powers to make an order requiring attendance at youth offender panel meetings of parents or guardians, and it is right that it should do so. Subsection (3) provides for a test of reasonableness. I am not sure about the difference between paragraphs (a) and (b), but we will not explore that because it does not affect the purpose of the amendment. What is important is knowing how the court will test and establish what is reasonable. In my view, reasonableness implies an expectation of representations.
<P>
Before a parent or guardian is required to attend--by laying down the law in the sense of ``You will come''--there should be some mechanism or test whereby the parent's circumstances can be assessed. That should happen before the court exerts an order-making power. The court should be told about any difficulties: it may be impossible for parents to attend because the father is a merchant seaman and the mother is also involved in something that precludes attendance.
<P>
I am not trying to reduce the impact of the requirement for parents to attend. I have already stated my agreement with it, but the balance is not quite right between the court's or team's power to do such and such and the rights or entitlements of parents to make representations. The purpose of amendment No. 23 is to allow the appropriate person--the parent or guardian--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an opportunity to make representations to the court''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
about their requirement to attend youth offender panels in difficult circumstances.
<P>
It is also odd that nothing, including the amendment, provides the parent or guardian with the right to attend the youth offender panel meeting--although subsection (7) requires the court to send notice. It remains the case that the Bill is not quite right about the balance between the rights of the parents and the rights of the court. I have no difficulty in itself with the Minister's seeking to advance the courts' rights.
<P>
Let me move on to amendment No. 24. The person asked to attend the panel is referred to in the clause as the ``appropriate person''. That will usually be the parent or guardian but in some cases--though, I fear, many--it may well be the local authority, as the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre would acknowledge. It is important for the person responsible for the day-to-day welfare and supervision of the young offender to be present at the panel meeting.
<P>
Many youngsters have no parents--or no parents on the scene--or useless parents, which is often why they turn to crime. Some young people are looked after by adult relations, perhaps grandparents, which is not uncommon. When there have been successive generations of teenage pregnancies it is very common to find grandparents in charge of youngsters. It could also be an older brother or sister.
<P>
One family in my constituency has been to see me more than once. A girl of about 18 or 19 in that family is looking after a younger teenage brother and sister because of the family's circumstances. It seems to me that these people ought to be appropriate persons for the purposes of legislation.
<P>
Some boys are at boarding school. Their parents may be in the armed forces serving in Kosovo or Bosnia, or somewhere. In such cases a headmaster--even, I am told, the headmaster of Eton--acts in loco parentis.

<P>

<B>Mr. Russell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not only a teacher, or head teacher, who may act in loco parentis? In my constituency, an officer in a cadet movement has taken over de facto the role of guardian. Perhaps the words ``or other person'' might be appropriate after ``a teacherÅ.Å.Å.Å'' in amendment No. 24.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Year after year in Standing Committees, amendments are tabled not to propose that every jot and tittle of what they contain should be in a Bill, but as a means of probing issues and addressing points on which there may have been disagreement about structure--there has been heated debate about this today--or simply to say that the Government have missed a point and that there is perhaps a way of improving a provision. I do not therefore claim that the range of other persons who may be appropriate persons in relation to amendment No. 24 is entirely complete--there may well be others. These are important points. I suspect from the Under-Secretary of State's body language that he may want to say something helpful and kind to me, in which case I shall not delay the Committee further.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The amendments, as the hon. Member for Ryedale said, relate to the operation of clause 5 in respect of a requirement for appropriate adults to attend meetings of the youth offender panel.
<P>
Amendment No. 23 requires the court to allow representations to be made in respect of a person ordered by a court to attend meetings of the panel as an appropriate adult. Amendment No. 24 would extend the definition of ``appropriate adult'' to include wider family members, and even a teacher, in the absence of a parent.
<P>
I am sure that we all agree--the hon. Members for Ryedale and for Colchester have brought their constituency experience to bear on this--that, given the way in which we want the youth justice system to operate, it is important that parents be encouraged to take responsibility.
<P>
Listening to hon. Gentlemen describing their experiences, I was reminded of an incident a few years ago when a parent from an especially deprived area of my constituency, which had many problems, visited me. She asked what help I could give because her son had been arrested for car theft. I asked what happened. The lady replied: ``Well, he was walking up The Hill''--the name of the area in question--''and his mate's car drew up and he offered him a lift, so he got in. Then the police stopped him and he has been arrested. But how was he supposed to know that the Lamborghini had been stolen?'' That is an example of parents not exactly taking their children's offending behaviour seriously.
<P>
The Government have throughout the Bill's passage increased the discretion of magistrates to order the attendance of both parents when it seems reasonable and practicable to do so. On many occasions--perhaps most--that will be the case.
<P>
The Bill provides for that parental responsibility to be exercised by the local authority where appropriate, or by both the local authority representative and the parent. That covers the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale. In cases in which responsibility has been invested in the local authority but the young people are allowed to live at home with their parents or guardians, the court may decide that the parents or guardians' presence would be of value. It was recognised that it will not always be practical for both parents to attend due to family or employment commitments. The hon. Gentleman cited a seafarer as an example. The Bill provides for such circumstances in clause 5.
<P>
If the parent is in court or has otherwise suggested concern about attending a youth offender panel, clearly the court must consider such representations. However, it is a step too far to place a requirement on the court to seek representations before any order is made. That would wholly undermine the objective of parents' involvement. Let us not forget that it is normal practice to require the parents of those under 16 to attend. In the Bill, the court also has the power to order the attendance of parents of 16 and 17-years-old, but is unlikely to do so unless there is reason to believe that they will be a positive and constructive influence.
<P>
I understand the intention of amendment No. 24 but find its practical application rather alarming. In many families, relations other than parents play an important role in a child's life. That is often the case with grandmothers. In my own childhood, I held my maternal grandmother in greater fear than either of my parents. A strong word from her was as good as 10 lectures from my dad. [Interruption.] Obviously the somewhat unusual family experience of members of the Committee--or my own--are causing some commotion. Brothers, sisters, uncles and aunts can play equally important roles in some families. If that is the case, the youth offending team will be advised to invite the family member to attend the youth offender panel meetings. 
<P>
That can be done in accordance with clause 7(4)(b), which is an important subsection. It follows the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Colchester and will, I hope, satisfy the hon. Member for Ryedale. Subsection (4) states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The panel may allow to attend any such meeting
<P>
(a) any person who appears to the panel to be a victim of, or otherwise affected by, the offence, or any of the offences, in respect of which the offender was referred to the panel;
<P>
(b) any person who appears to the panel to be someone capable of having a good influence on the offender.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In my view, that answers the questions raised by the hon. Member for Ryedale in the amendments.
<P>
The two provisions might equally apply to a young offender's teacher. I am sure that other people can think of occasions when a teacher's presence, although perhaps not welcomed by the young people concerned, could throw some light on their behaviour and what would or would not be sensible.
<P>
Inviting such attendance is a different matter from ordering it. Under the Bill, court orders are properly reserved for parents and those who have formal parental or guardianship responsibilities. Grandmothers with formal guardianship may be ordered by the court to attend meetings. Those with no formal responsibility but who nevertheless care for the young people and have positive relationships with them should rightly have the opportunity to attend, but only voluntarily. Given the provisions of clause 7 and my assurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will feel it unnecessary to press the amendment further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> A scurrilous note is circulating on the Government Back Benches to the effect that one should replace youth offender panels with the Under-Secretary's grandmother. I am not sure where the idea emanated from, but I think that I can see the perpetrator.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Unfortunately, my grandmother would have to be exhumed to be able to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> May I also say, Mrs. Roe, that our discussion is being listened to by a group of young people? Young people are central to the Bill and it is good to see them here.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that he should not refer to anyone other than members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I accept that admonishment, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
The concept of parental responsibility, which the Government have strengthened, is central. Only if a child is adopted can one lose parental responsibility. Parental responsibility implies a range of duties to the child. It certainly implies that parents should be present in court if the child faces a charge, and that they should take a full and responsible part in the work of the youth offender panel. As well as strengthening parental responsibility, the Government have taken to heart the importance of parents having control over their children by making parenting orders available under section 8 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>
I raised the matter on Second Reading, but I still do not understand why clause 5(5) should allow the parents of young people who are looked after not to take part in the work of youth offender panels. Young people who are being looked after are more likely to be dealt with under section 20 of the Children Act 1989. They will be merely accommodated, with the voluntary agreement of the parents, which can be rescinded informally at any stage. Even if young people are subject to care orders made under sections 30 and 31 of the Children Act, the local authority is required to involve the parents in all its work with young people. Frankly, the very last group of parents to be offered a get-out clause should be those parents who have difficulty managing their children's behaviour. They should be central to the work of the youth offender panels, whether or not the children were looked after.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The debate has been helpful in adding to our understanding of the Bill's mechanisms for supporting young offenders before panels.
<P>
Before I withdraw the amendment, I should say that I have much sympathy and almost completely agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. I do so simply to illustrate how times have changed. I recall during consideration in Committee of the 1991 Criminal Justice Bill standing more or less where he now stands, arguing with members of his party, who stood where I now stand, who opposed the legislative requirement for a parent to attend a court. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head; he can read it in Hansard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We are now over here and the Conservatives are over there.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is only a temporary arrangement. As the results at the weekend have shown, what goes up must come down.
<P>
We shall need to refer to some of these matters again when we discuss the amendments that I have tabled to clause 7. To be as gracious as possible, the Minister made a good point: although we can encourage and provide for the attendance of other young people, other relations or other people in authority who may have influence, we must be clear when the powers require, as opposed to encourage, attendance. That is why our discussion has been so useful.
<P>
Despite our debate on the requirement for parents to attend, I am still not satisfied that we have received a full explanation of how the courts will be able to judge what is unreasonable unless representations may be made. However, we shall discover that through the experiment.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that the crucial factor is whether, given a family's likelihood of being more of an impediment, is whether, it is considered that the parents would play a positive and constructive role. They may even be part of the problem, and need to be dealt with separately, rather than through young offender panels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not disagree with that. Section 5(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The court shall not under this section make an order requiring a person to attend meetings of the youth offender panel''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
if to do so would be ``unreasonable''. However, I am not clear about the mechanism by which reasonableness can be determined. Whether it is reasonable to require the parent to attend is quite separate from whether it would be advantageous to the process to do so, as we shall discuss when we consider the amendments to clause 7.
<P>
The question also arises of whether parents have a right to attend youth offender panels--
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Certainly not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman says ``certainly not''. If the child is 12 or 13 years of age, and the parent is told that under no circumstances may he or she attend a youth offender panel, I worry that the Government may find themselves in difficulty in due course. However, I do not want to be out of order or to prolong the debate; we shall discuss that when we consider clause 7.
<P>
It has been helpful to explore the mechanism that can be used to encourage and make good use of the attendance of other influential people. With that thought, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 6, line 9, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A)(a) The youth offending team shall not appoint to the youth offender panel--
<P>
(i) any police officer involved in the prosecution of the young offender.
<P>
(ii) any person who appears to the youth offending team to be a victim of, or otherwise affected by, the offence, or other offences, in respect of which the offender was referred to the panel, or
<P>
(iii) any magistrate who made the order referring the young offender to the youth offender panel.
<P>
(b) No magistrate who is a member of a youth offender panel shall preside in any youth or other magistrates court to whom a young offender is referred by that panel.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important amendment that will enable us to examine the make-up of youth offender panels. Clause 6(3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a panel shallÅ.Å.Å.Åconsist of at least''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
three members, although there may be more that. Subsection (3)(a) states that ``one member'' will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appointed by the youth offending team from among its members''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Youth offending teams are to be established under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>
Subsection (3)(b) makes provision for ``two members'' to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so appointed who are not members of the team.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I will leave discussion of who those members may be and how they will be appointed until the clause stand part debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 61 focuses on the members of the panel to be appointed by the youth offending team. Such a team will consist of magistrates and police officers. There is no difficulty with those people being an important element of the team, although it may be queried whether that will be so. Such team members will be drawn from the wide range of those involved in the youth justice and criminal justice system.
<P>
Therefore, under subsection (3), it is possible that a magistrate or police officer may be appointed to the youth offending team from the youth offending panel. We must address whether such a magistrate or police officer being involved in a case concerning a young offender who is referred to the panel is a good thing.
<P>
I use that as a conjectural example. On Second Reading, I mentioned that, as a former member of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, I witnessed the youth justice system in Boston, Massachusetts operating on more than one occasion. As a result, I can appreciate the logic of the common thread that is created when a police officer befriends a young offender, gives him support and encouragement, and shows a concern about his welfare and future that no family member has ever shown him before. A magistrate may, conceivably, be in a similar position.
<P>
Such a person may, in such circumstances, be seen as a good influence. Therefore, I accept the argument that the police officer who arrested the young fellow, brought about his prosecution and encouraged him to plead guilty should be part of the youth offender panel seeking to address his offending behaviour.
<P>
However, another side of that argument lies behind the amendments and the Minister and Under-Secretary will be aware of concerns expressed about it.
<P>
If the police officer involved in the prosecution takes a more draconian and hard-hitting view, he could, if appointed a member of the panel, seek to impose a disproportionate and coercive regime of punishment on a young offender that was wholly unsuited to the panel's objective.
<P>
We are therefore left with three choices, I put it in a conjectural sense, as it is important to have this debate. At one extreme, we could leave things to chance. Some good may come of that, but in some cases things may go horribly wrong. At the other extreme, as the amendment says, there is the risk of a punitive, coercive response from, say, a police officer. I have been one and my son is one; I know the mindset, to use the Minister of State's phrase. I can see a police officer on the youth panel getting hold of a tearaway and giving him a hard time, which may be appropriate, but may well not be. We should rule that danger out in the Bill.
<P>
The alternative is perhaps a middle way, and I do not know what the Government have in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell:</B> The third way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I would not say that. It might be a middle way of giving guidance to youth offender teams on who they appoint to youth offender panels. That gives rise to an argument about how the administration of youth offender panels will work in practice. The Minister will be aware that there has been criticism from some penal reform groups that it is wrong for youth offender panels to be administered by youth offender teams.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That was my question when I read their submissions. Either I do not understand their point or their point does not stack up. I do not believe that it stacks up. That is another consensus that the Minister of State will be relieved to hear about: we do not intend to run with Justice's argument that the team should not administer the panels. It makes a great deal of sense that it should. However, I am not clear how the Government intend to get round this problem.
<P>
An even greater problem arises in relation to magistrates, if a magistrate deals with a case and says ``Right, we will send you to a youth offender panel'' and the young offender gets there and discovers that the same magistrate is on the panel. All the magistrates that I know are very good people, so I cast no aspersions on any magistrate. However, it is not right or proper for the magistrate who sentences to be part of the realisation of that sentence.
<P>
The final thread of the amendment seeks to avoid the prospect of a young offender who is referred by the panel back to the court discovering that the magistrate sitting on the bench to determine his fate is part of the youth offender panel that had said to him, ``We think you are such a terrible tearaway and so uncontrollable that we shall send you back to the court so that it can deal with you again''. That creates a serious risk of coercion.
<P>
With your agreement, Mrs. Roe, I shall terminate my remarks now and, in the few seconds remaining, allow the clock to reach the hour of 1 o'clock, so that the Minister can reply when we return.
<P>
It being One o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
