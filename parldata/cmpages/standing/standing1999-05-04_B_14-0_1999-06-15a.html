<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): We now come to inheritance tax. Clause 92 is the dog that did not bark because it is narrowly focused on a specific scheme which has been used to avoid inheritance tax. Some commentators had expected the Government to introduce a more substantial change to inheritance tax and in the run-up to the Budget a number of articles predicted that the Chancellor would make major changes. The Financial Times stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Accountants and tax advisers think IHT could be a top target for Brown in the March 9 Budget. For one thing, Labour was vocal about reforming IHT in opposition but has so far done nothing in government."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That fact that the Government chose not to make major changes to inheritance tax came as a surprise to some people and it would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether the Government have decided not to make substantial changes to inheritance tax and have dropped suggestions made when they were in opposition, or whether we can expect to return to the matter in future Finance Bills.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to deal with the Lady Ingram case, which involved a simple scheme in which children were saved from having to pay inheritance tax on their parents' home. The freehold was transferred to the children and a leasehold interest was retained by the parents with the right to live in the property remaining with the leasehold. The Law Lords held that that was legitimate tax planning and not deliberate tax avoidance because it made use of the existing law. It is not a loophole as such, and the clause extends the scope of inheritance tax, but we accept that it was not the intention that such a scheme should be successful, so we do not oppose the clause.
<P>
The clause is narrowly drawn and not many people would have been able to take advantage of the Lady Ingram scheme, but there is concern--some might say an opportunity, depending on their profession. Accountants have identified the fact that it would be possible to exploit a variation of the Lady Ingram scheme and gain the advantage of not paying inheritance tax. That was described in an article in The Tax Journal in which the author suggests that there is still scope for estate planning by use of gifts to the spouse of the donor. He states that the provisions in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, which the clause amends,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"only catch benefits reserved to the donor and not those reserved to his spouse and"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under new section 102A(3) of the 1986 Act
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in order for a right to be significant, it must entitle or enable the donor himself to occupy the property. This has the consequence that if the lease of the property is granted to the spouse of the donor alone, then, as the right, interest or arrangement in respect of the lease does not entitle the donor to occupy, it can only be significant if it can be said to 'enable' the donor to occupy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear what "enable" means. It could be argued that the donor lives in the house only on the sufferance of his spouse who, if she changes her mind, could throw him out at any time. Therefore, as he has no right to occupy the house, there is no attached interest and the clause will not affect the judgment that inheritance tax is not payable. It will be interesting to hear whether the Government agree with the professional view that the loophole will not be closed and inheritance tax will continue to be avoided.
<P>
A number of commentators have raised concerns about the provisions as they affect gifts involving an undivided share in land. When the provisions for gifts with reservation were debated in 1986, the late Sir Brandon Rhys-Williams obtained assurances from the Minister, which are worth quoting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Is it not the case that if a man dies, his legacy goes straight to his wife, which does not incur inheritance tax, and then to his sons or daughters, which does incur inheritance tax? Surely passing the freehold to the spouse has no effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not understand how the scheme works. I have every sympathy with him--I got there only after considerable time and with the need to put a number of wet towels around my head. The freehold is passed to the children, where inheritance tax is payable, but the leasehold is retained by the person living in the house. The intention of clause 92 is to prevent the donor of the freehold from retaining the right to live in the house while ensuring that children do not avoid heritance tax. The professional adviser's point is that if the freehold was given to the children but the leasehold interest went to the spouse, so that the donor had neither the freehold nor the interest, the scheme to avoid IHT might still apply. It is the freehold passing to the children that is relevant. This is an accountant's view of how it might be possible to get around the provisions. We shall be interested to hear the Paymaster General's opinion on that.
<P>
We seek clarification on gifts that involve an undivided share in land. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), who was the Minister when this matter was originally debated, said in response to Sir Brandon Rhys-Williams:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it may be that my hon. Friend's intention concerns the common case where someone gives away an individual share in land, typically a house, which is then occupied by all the joint owners including the donor. For example, elderly parents may make unconditional gifts of undivided shares in their house to their children and the parents and the children occupy the property as their family home, each owner bearing his or her share of the running costs. In those circumstances, the parents' occupation or enjoyment of part of the house that they have given away is in return for similar enjoyment of the children of the other part of the property. Thus the donors' occupation is for a full consideration.
<P>
Accordingly--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is important--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I assure my hon. Friend that the gift with reservation rules will not be applied to an unconditional gift of an undivided share in land merely because the property is occupied by all the joint owners or tenants in common, including the donor."--[Official Report, Standing Committee G, 10 June 1986; c. 425.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That assurance has been relied on ever since. However, the clause will apply a new set of rules covering gifts of an undivided share of land, which will supersede the statement that was made when the original provisions were debated. Several commentators have asked the Paymaster General to say whether the assurance given in 1986 will still apply under the clause. We hope that she will confirm that.
<P>
We do not oppose the clause's main thrust, but we have one or two concerns that we would like the Paymaster General to address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I support the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale). Apparently, hardened civil servants were crying into their cups over the lenient way in which the Government approached inheritance tax this year. We hope that the results of last week's election, which were so disastrous for Labour Members, will not force them into an old Labour bunker, from which they will use old-fashioned socialism to attack all forms of capital. Instead, they should realise that, if we are to have a modern economy, such taxes should be treated with greater leniency and understanding.
<P>
As we shall discover when we debate stamp duty, all capital taxes are capricious, and this one is no exception. I want to highlight the point made in the Inland Revenue's notes on the clause, which state that the gift with reservation rules
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"also apply to the case where the donor actually receives some benefit, say under some informal arrangement with the donee."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would like the Paymaster General to comment on two contrasting cases. First, let us imagine an old lady who owns a house that is worth £800,000 and an attached cottage that is worth £200,000. She gives the house to her daughter's family and moves into the cottage. Upon her death seven years later, the family inherit the cottage. Will the Paymaster General confirm that, in such a circumstance, no inheritance tax would be payable--that the first gift would be outside the period for potentially exempt transfers, and that the second gift would be under the threshold at which inheritance tax applies?
<P>
Let us imagine a second house next door that is worth £1 million, but which has no annexe.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Just a minute. Let us imagine that the old lady who owns the house gives it in its entirety to her daughter, but continues to live in an upstairs room and share one or two other rooms with her daughter's family, until she dies seven years later. Will the Paymaster General confirm that, in such a circumstance, inheritance tax of £300,000 will be payable on the transfer of that property when the old lady dies? Under the gift with reservation rules, the transfer would be deemed to have been made at the time of the old lady's death, even though it was transferred seven years earlier.
<P>
Why should the first family, who do not get on very well with the old lady, who consequently moves next door, escape inheritance tax, but the second family, who get on so well with the old lady that they are happy to share a house with her, suffer a tax bill of £300,000?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Given the hon. Gentleman's scathing remarks about the Labour party's lack of understanding of the public, does he understand that the average property in constituencies such as mine is worth £60,000? In such constituencies, properties that are worth £200,000 and £1 million do not enter into the equation.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I entirely agree that we should not waste two pages of the Bill on cases that are very rare and where the tax question is quite capricious. The Bill should deal with real people, rather than chase taxation in arcane ways.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I am glad that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford welcomed the clause; I think that he said that the Opposition were not intending to vote against it. I am happy to respond to the points that he raised.
<P>
The clause introduces changes to the inheritance tax provisions on lifetime gifts where the donor reserves or receives any material benefit in relation to the gifted asset. This is often referred to as a gift with reservation. The recent House of Lords decision in the Lady Ingram case has shown that the existing inheritance tax rules on gifts with reservation do not work as envisaged.
<P>
The changes aim to ensure that taxpayers cannot reduce the inheritance tax value of their assets by making gifts of land while effectively continuing to enjoy the land as if they still owned it. The changes apply to gifts of interests in land made on or after 9 March 1999 and, in the main, restore the tax position to what it was intended to be before the House of Lords ruling.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked a question regarding transfer to spouse. I am sure that he will accept that the finer details of hypothetical cases are not always appropriate for discussion across the Committee. None the less, he asked whether it would qualify as a taxable reserved interest if one's spouse simply let one live in what used to be one's own house. He quoted an article in which it was suggested that cases similar to the Lady Ingram case could still arise. The aim of the Bill is to try to control such informal arrangements, but each case would have to be examined as it arose to test against the rules that currently apply, both with regard to potentially exempt transfer provisions--PETs--and to gifts with reservation.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman went on to ask a question about undivided shares, quoting the undertaking given to Sir Brandon Rhys-Williams in 1986.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon) : On that point, will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make the point, he may find that I answer  his question. If I do not, of course I shall be happy to give way.
<P>
The question was: what is the purpose of appending new section 102B to the Finance Act 1986? Does it apply to the gift of an undivided share in land? The answer is yes. The original owner can give away part of his or her property as an undivided share, in a way in which the recipient and the donor become part-owner-occupiers, side by side. This will be tax effective, as it is under existing law, so long as there is no attempt to frustrate the intention of the clause or the rules set out in existing inheritance tax legislation. Everyone will be able to use the property to which they are entitled and everyone will pay their fair share of the expenses.
<P>
In the past, the Inland Revenue has issued guidelines, and the Country Landowners Association has sought clarification on the matter. The advice that the association has been given still holds good. That should help to answer any queries on undivided shares.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Before the Paymaster General leaves the point about an undivided share in land, will she confirm that the undivided share means the equitable interest of a tenant-in-common in land?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The definition in the new section relates to joint owners. It is unnecessary to provide any separate definition of the term "undivided share" as it takes its normal meaning under general law.
<P>
Yes, the comments of Sir Brandon Rhys-Williams in 1986 still hold. The new rules are the same as the old ones on undivided shares. The clause deals narrowly with the specific point of dividing an interest, arising from the Lady Ingram case. It is designed to protect the revenue base and to return the law to the way in which everyone assumed our inheritance tax law operated before that House of Lords ruling. I hope that the Committee will support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have just one small point that I hope the Paymaster General will clarify. The case to which I shall refer is hypothetical, but relevant to our agricultural industry. Let us suppose that a partnership occupies a farm, including a farmhouse, and that Mr. and Mrs. A and their son and daughter-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. B, occupy the farmhouse and the farm. Let us suppose that they occupy under a newish tenancy but the farm is owned by Mr. A. A fair rent is payable by the partnership. However, it is not a farm business tenancy, but an old tenancy. The partnership pays its fair proportion of the upkeep of the farmhouse and the farm generally. Then there is an assignment, conveyance or transfer of the farm to the son, Mr. B, but the partnership continues to occupy the farm and the farmhouse. So Mr. and Mrs. A and their son and daughter-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. B, continue to occupy the farmhouse. Will the Paymaster General confirm that such circumstances will not be caught by the provisions of the clause? Can she assure the Committee on that point?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall not be tempted to answer the complex proposition put to me by the hon. Gentleman, but I shall be happy to look into the issue that he has raised and write to each Committee member. The clause deals narrowly with the operation of a gift with reservation and the point at which a gift is made and, therefore, comes within the inheritance tax PET provisions. I am afraid that I lost track of all the As and Bs in the hon. Gentleman's example, but I shall be happy to look into that detailed point and respond to the Committee. The clause introduces a narrow change with regard to the specific case that arose as a result of the House of Lords ruling, and leaves the position on inheritance tax on gifts as it was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am entirely happy with that response from the Paymaster General. I appreciate that my question cannot be answered by an off-the-cuff reply. I am glad to hear that the clause is supposed to have a narrow impact. Opposition Members will be glad to know that it does not impact on perfectly ordinary and straightforward transactions that have been entered into for many years.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> When the Paymaster General answers the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), I should be grateful if she would also respond to my point. The second case might have been solved in the past by the Lady Ingram scheme, which raises a valid issue.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He did raise two points, and I had intended to answer both. The second slipped my mind during my reply. On the example of a cottage and a house, he asked whether there would be an IHT hit--to put it crudely--against the house if the owner were to live in the cottage and give away 100 per cent. of the house. As no interest was retained in the house, there would be no IHT hit and the gift arrangements would apply. I would be happy to respond to his point in more detail.
<P>
On the donor's claims to give away the house if he still lived there, that would come within gifts with reservations, as the donor might continue to benefit even though the interest had been given away. That is the issue raised by the Ingram case. I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's point carefully and return to the matter if my response has not gone far enough. Even if I have put the current position on the record, I shall write to him and other Committee members as confirmation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): The debate has concentrated on agricultural land and residential property. However, the reservation of benefit rules apply to all kinds of other situations. It is a perfectly normal commercial situation to give away the freehold of a property subject to a lease. Will the Paymaster General confirm that, in such a situation, where the property diminishes in value as the term of the lease expires, it would not be hit by the clause?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman will see that that relates to the Lady Ingram case, where a leasehold is created out of a freehold, and the freehold is given away. Under the new arrangements, the interest must be separated into freehold and leasehold, and a period of seven years must elapse between the separation of those two interests. If the freehold were subsequently given away as a potentially exempt transfer--or an entire gift--that would be accepted as a proper gift. The clause only affects land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I congratulate the Paymaster General on her clear form this morning. Transitional arrangements also apply whereby partial inheritance tax, or a lower rate of inheritance tax, is paid for seven years. Will the Paymaster General explain whether the partial or lower rates of inheritance tax apply after, for example, three or four years? Under normal inheritance tax rules, the full amount of inheritance tax would not be payable.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Nothing changes in terms of the liability to inheritance tax. The change is in relation to whether a gift is really a gift, or whether any benefit is derived by the donor even though land has been given away. The clause has a narrow focus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Paymaster General elaborate further on the question that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford put to her right at the start of this debate? It would help the public to know what the Government's plans for this tax are.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor keeps all the tax system under review. Where he believes that it is appropriate to make changes, he will no doubt do so, as he has done in the past.

<P>

<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> This clause relates to the requirements that are placed on personal representatives when they report on an individual's estate at the time of his death.
<P>
There is some disagreement among the professional bodies about the necessity for the clause. Several commentators have raised concerns, to which I will come and with which I hope the Minister will deal. One accountancy firm told us that it was in any case, part of its due diligence to establish and include in its reports what gifts were made during the seven years. I would, therefore, be interested to hear why the Government have felt it necessary to introduce the explicit requirement on personal representatives in clause 93. Do they feel that there has been a problem in the recent past with representatives not providing information about lifetime gifts that were made in the previous seven years? I have talked to a few of the professionals, and it appears that practice differs on the issue.
<P>
As I said concerns have been raised about the new requirements, particularly the burden that they will place on professional personal representatives. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This provision imposes an onerous and imprecise obligation upon personal trustees."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It says that it is not sure what is meant by "fullest inquiries" because that would depend on the nature of the estate. In addition, the use of the term "exact value" appears unrealistic. The Paymaster General will already have seen those comments from the ICA, so I hope that she will be able to respond to them in her reply.
<P>
In its comments on the clause, the Law Society raises several specific questions about precisely how the new requirement will be applied. It gives the example of the chargeable transfers that took place during the previous seven years being so small that, even when they are added to the estate, there is still no inheritance tax payable--whether or not those transfers have to be identified and reported. Alternatively, the transfers might be large enough to fill the whole nil-rate band, in which case the tax on the estate can be computed without going into the details of them. In that case, would it still be necessary to report in detail?
<P>
It would be helpful if the Paymaster General could say a little about how the clause will be put into practice and respond to the specific concerns that have been raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): I should like to follow up the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) cautioned one of my colleagues earlier by saying that average house prices in her constituency were only £60,000. She therefore implied that Conservative Members were expressing views on behalf of the very rich, as opposed to those who are more modestly endowed with capital or assets and are represented by Labour Members. Given the inflation engendered by the pre-1979 Labour Government, many people living in modest properties in the southern half of the country could easily find themselves involved in inheritance tax. So far, people have been quite lucky--I believe that 98 per cent. of estates do not pay inheritance tax. The operation of the lifetime gifts arrangement is clearly of interest even to people of modest means who are not particularly sophisticated in the way in which they keep records of their financial activities.
<P>
Although the Paymaster General may not be able to let us into the Chancellor's thinking on the future of inheritance tax, can she give us a little comfort by telling us that the Government have no plans to review the operation of the lifetime gift system, at least during this Parliament?
<P>
Subsection (3A) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the fullest enquiries that are reasonably practicable in the circumstances".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the paymaster clarify how that applies to people who do not operate in a sophisticated world with accountants, advisers and lawyers, where the personal representative may be a relative who has to supply certain facts upon the death of an individual? Such a person may not have been in any way involved in helping the deceased to keep his or her records. For example, the deceased may have been obscure about the gifts that he made, preferring to do so in a reclusive way. Can the Paymaster shine a little light on that?
<P>
I should be grateful if the Paymaster could provide a commentary on subsection (3B). As I understand it, the subsection merely replicates existing tax law in this area. However, it may be some time since the area was probed. The Board of the Inland Revenue acquires substantial powers under the subsection, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Board may from time to time give such general or special directions as they think fit for restricting the property to be specified in pursuance of subsection (3) above".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Paymaster tell us how often the Board of the Inland Revenue has used those powers, and how people know that "from time to time" that kind of instruction or direction has been given? The subsection has the potential effect of setting up a mini case law on how the matters in clause 93 are dealt with.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause extends the information that is to be provided by personal representatives of estates in their inheritance tax return. Personal representatives must put together an account of the estate, and pay tax accordingly, before they can obtain a grant of probate to administer an estate. As part of that, the relevant inheritance tax account form like the previous estate duty form, asks for details of lifetime gifts made by the deceased in the seven years before death. Personal representatives have generally complied with that requirement, but the Inland Revenue has recently been advised that they cannot be obliged to do so. The clause therefore puts into legislation the practice that has occurred, and seeks to underpin with legislative support the fact that it is a practice that has occurred to date. The Government believe that it is appropriate for the requirement to be clearly stated in legislation.
<P>
For deaths occurring on or after 9 March 1999, the return must include details of any chargeable transfer made by the deceased in the seven years before death. The form already asked for that information, but the request was not underpinned in legislation. The clause simply ties up the issue, and I am sure that it will be welcomed.
<P>
Several questions were asked about the information that personal representatives would have to supply and whether we were asking for an unreasonable amount of information. It is not unreasonable. The information is directly relevant to establishing the extend of personal representatives' own inheritance tax liability. Hon. Members want to know what "fullest inquiries" meant. The Committee will accept that it is impossible to be prescriptive about what that phrase means. Clearly, personal representatives must take their duty seriously, and they do. The phrase already exists in other legislation with which everyone has lived for many years with no real difficulties in practice; although clarification is being sought, the phrase already operates.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford raised questions that had been asked by a number of professional bodies with regard to personal representatives' ability to provide all the necessary information. As is the case with other tax returns, personal representatives will be asked to make a return to the best of their knowledge and belief. They should fulfil that obligation faithfully, which they do. No one expects them to achieve the impossible--we do not expect them to be mind readers. We expect them to discharge their responsibilities. The Inland Revenue accepts that personal representatives will not always know of gifts made by the deceased and that their reasonable inquiries may not uncover such information. That is a fact of life. Committee members should not be unduly worried about the phraseology because it already exists and works. Of course, it must be reasonably applied.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked a question that the Law Society had posed about whether full details of chargeable gifts known to exceed the threshold would still be required even when tax on the estate could be computed without going into further detail about those gifts. Even in those circumstances, personal representatives would be expected to provide full details, not least to protect their own position, given that they are secondarily liable for any tax that remains unpaid by the donee, who is primarily responsible for any tax on gifts that becomes chargeable from 13 months after the date of death. It is wholly appropriate, therefore, that that situation should continue.
<P>
Earlier, I dealt with a question regarding an extra compliance burden on the taxpayer. I stress for the benefit of the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford that taxpayers are already expected to keep adequate records for tax purposes, so donors are not being required to do any more than is already asked of them.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) returned to the ability of personal representatives to ascertain details of all lifetime gifts. I repeat that the phrase "fullest inquiries" has been used in previous legislation and is the current practice. It must be applied reasonably in terms of what the Revenue would expect personal representatives to do. As is the case for other tax returns, personal representatives will be asked to fulfil their obligations by making a return to the best of their knowledge and belief. We will not be asking the impossible of them. The provisions cover the excepted estate, allowing executors to obtain probate without making a detailed IHT return. As tax professionals know well, we are trying to reduce compliance burdens.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of all the professional representations made, although some referred to aspects of the clause, only that of the Institute of Directors formally suggested a need for changes to it. The measure is reasonable--the obligations on personal representatives are clear, and practice will be underpinned by legislation. I ask the Committee to support the clause.

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am most grateful for what the Minister said, but unfortunately she forgot to answer one of my substantive questions. I sought guidance or assurance about the future of lifetime gifts, which are central to the operation of the clause. At the risk of a negative response, I shall ask whether she could reply to that point.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall not try your patients, Mr. Cook, by trying to read the mind of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or to forecast future actions. I have made clear how the Government expect this aspect of the legislation to operate. The right hon. Member for Fylde is always tempting--[Interruption] I shall rephrase that. The hon. Gentleman never tires of trying to tempt Ministers to go down paths that they should avoid. I am not about to comment on what the Chancellor might do in future; the present legislation is clear.
<P>
Question put and agreed to
<P>
Clause 93 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 94</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to call for documents etc</center></H4>
<P>
Mr. Whittingdale: I beg to move amendment No. 228, in page 65, line 6, leave out 'such an' and insert 'the'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 229, in page 65, line 26, after 'him', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or are covered by professional privilege.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 248, in page 66, leave out lines 9 to 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The three amendments that we have tabled to clause 94 are all narrowly drawn; it may be wildly optimistic of me but I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to accepting them. 
<P>
It might help if I say something about the clause before dealing with the amendments. The clause concerns the power of the Revenue to require a person to provide information, so long as it is specified. Previously, a special commissioner has had to give consent in advance before such a power could be exercised. The clause reverses that: the Revenue will no longer have to go to a special commissioner, but the person affected will have a right of appeal to a special commissioner.
<P>
Why was it felt necessary to make that change? What practice has occurred that necessitates that small strengthening of the powers available to the Revenue? In what way might those powers be used more widely than previously? Have the Government estimated the incremental yields associated with the implementation of the new provisions? Having raised those general points, I urge the Minister to consider the three small changes that the amendments propose.
<P>
The first amendment would leave out "such an" and insert "the". The Minister will have recognised that that suggestion emanates from the Law Society, which stated in its submission on the clause that it is concerned that the Revenue's powers in the Bill are too wide because if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any person has delivered or is liable to deliver an account...may be required 'to furnish the officer with such accounts or particulars as he may reasonably require'".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Replacing "such an" with "the" would specify more directly which account must be delivered.
<P>
Our second amendment also stems from the Law Society and would insert the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or are covered by professional privilege".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That addresses the concern that has been raised by the law Society that the existing powers could require the accountable person to produce information in relation to which he is in a position to claim legal professional privilege. That serious concern should be considered; at the very least, the Minister should clarify the Government's position on it.
<P>
Our third amendment covers the right of appeal. There will be a right of individual appeal to the special commissioner if he or she believes that the Inland Revenue should not have the documents being demanded or that its powers are being used unfairly. Previously, there was an additional right of appeal to the High Court, but that is removed by the clause. Amendment No. 248 would remove the subsection that denies individuals a right of appeal to the High Court and restore the existing position.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to those three points and explain why the Government believe it necessary to introduce the new powers.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I hope that, once I have given a full response to the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, he will accept that the amendments are unnecessary. If he decides to press them, I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist them.
<P>
The clause introduces a simplified procedure for the Inland Revenue to seek information. The Revenue will not require prior approval from the special commissioners before asking for information, as is required under existing powers. The new right to seek information is balanced by restricting the new power to a narrower class of people--executors and others who are already responsible to the Inland Revenue for an estate's tax affairs. Anyone at the receiving end of a request for information has a right of appeal before obeying the notice.
<P>
On amendment No. 229, the new information power would extend to documents covered by professional privilege because the new provisions apply only to accountable persons, broadly executors and others, who are already required to deliver an inheritance tax account. If a practitioner submits the account of an estate, rather than acting as an adviser, it is only right that he or she should be subject to the same requirements as anyone else tendering an account. Moreover, anyone who delivers an account has a duty to do so to the best of their knowledge and belief, based on available information. If a professionally qualified executor has information that would otherwise be covered by professional privilege but is relevant to the account, he must have regard to it, and it should accordingly come within the scope of the Revenue's information powers. So the Revenue's information powers relate to the relevant person and the specific information that is required in order to settle the IHT account.
<P>
The new provisions largely mirror the information powers already used for other taxes. They received recent parliamentary attention under the previous Government for the purposes of self-assessment, for which they are also used in the same form. On that bases, amendment No. 229, tabled by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, is unnecessary because the powers are clearly defined. If the hon. Gentleman cannot accept my assurances, I shall ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 248 would reinstate the taxpayer's usual right of appeal to the High Court against a finding by the special commissioner that the Revenue's request for information was reasonable. As drafted, the Bill excludes the right of appeal. Again, that is modelled on information powers in the Taxes Management Act 1970, specifically those introduced by the previous Administration with regard to self-assessment. These rules have been scrutinised recently and were judged to be reasonable with regard to self-assessment. The same points as those the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford made on inheritance tax arise for self-assessment. When the Conservatives were in power, they rightly reached the same conclusion as we have reached now on these powers.
<P>
The information that will be sought is for the completion of proper and accurate returns under IHT regulations. The provisions allow the Revenue to seek information and allow the recipient of the request for information a right to appeal against the request to a special commissioner. Once the commissioners have decided that the Revenue's request is reasonable, there is no further avenue of appeal to the High Court against the issue of the information notice. Of course, as elsewhere in the tax system, there are rights of appeal on how the information is used. There are good practical reasons for such provision. Clearly, the Revenue cannot do its job without information, none of which is originally in its possession. Therefore, there must be a method by which it can seek information. We have to strike a balance between allowing people to appeal against the Revenue's right of information and allowing them to obstruct the settlement of an account by spinning out appeals that are without merit. 
<P>
We believe that the involvement of a commissioner, but not the High Court, at that stage in the procedure strikes an adequate balance. The accountable person is to provide information only; he is not expected to pay cash. If cash is in question and tax or penalties are involved, a full right of appeal is available. The issue is narrow and relates specifically to the provision of information.
<P>
Given the practice that is mirrored elsewhere in the tax system, I hope that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford will accept that his amendments are unnecessary. I have taken time to explain the precedents. The provision has not been plucked out of thin air.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 228 reflects the Law Society's concerns. Those should not be a problem in practice. The clause allows the Revenue to seek information from people who have to render an inheritance tax account on aspects of a deceased person's affairs. That can involve various people. The personal representative's obligations are wide ranging and cover the deceased person's estate and gifts in life, but other people may be concerned with limited aspects of inheritance tax, such as the donee of a lifetime gift or the trustee of a trust in which the dead person had an interest. In theory, there is a chance that people will receive a notice on aspects of the dead person's affairs about which they know nothing. However, self-interest alone gives the Revenue a good reason to direct its inquiries only to people who are likely to be able to answer them. We want to speed up the settlement and reduce the amount of work that the Revenue and the taxpayer must do to achieve compliance.
<P>
If, by some strange accident, the Revenue directs a notice to someone who is ignorant of that aspect of the deceased's affairs, then there is a right of appeal. Ignorance would be a decisive ground for resisting a notice from the Revenue. In those circumstances, it would be daft for the Revenue to pursue someone for information that he has not got. We should be able to apply the provision on a reasonable basis as reasonable people, accepting that the system has operated well and that the requests will not cause it to go wrong. As I said, we want to speed up the settlement and reduce compliance problems.
<P>
Against that background, it would be more complex than suggested in the amendment to cut the Revenue's scope for inquiry in order to meet a theoretical problem without also limiting the provision's proper use in a real and damaging way. The amendment would make the Revenue's job harder. The likelihood of the wrong people receiving notices would increase. The procedures make for a simpler way of dealing with the information. I hope that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford accepts my assurances on how the powers will operate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I must confess to being a little disappointed. I had hoped to match the record of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), who persuaded the Government to accept his amendment. Obviously his powers of persuasion are greater than mine.
<P>
I am reassured to some extent by the Paymaster General's response. She argued that the amendments tabled at the suggestion of the Law Society are unnecessary. The fact that the Law Society thought that it would be helpful to make the clause more explicit shows that not everyone agrees with the hon. Lady, but she has said that she will not be persuaded, and we shall not press the matter further.
<P>
On the question of the right of appeal, the Paymaster General set out in some detail how rights of appeal to the High Court will apply at every other stage of the process, and stated that it is only in a narrow area that the special commissioners will be the ultimate authority in the matter. Nevertheless, that will be the removal of a current right of appeal.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> These are new powers, with a right of appeal to a commissioner. When an application has to be made to a commissioner for the issue of information, all those rights of appeal will still be in place. It is only with regard to the new information powers that the point of appeal is to special commissioners and not to the High Court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I understand that and, in the main, I accept it. Although we are disappointed that the Paymaster General is not willing to accept our amendment, we shall not press it further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Penalties</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I do not wish to delay the Committee much longer on this part of the Bill. However, it is worth commenting on clause 96, which will considerably strengthen the penalty arrangements for misdemeanours under the inheritance tax provisions. Professional bodies have expressed concern at this proposal, and the Law Society has stated that it deems the new penalty levels "excessive". The Paymaster General, in her response to the proposed amendments to clause 94, drew attention to the Taxes Management Act 1970. The Law Society points out that the penalties applicable under the clause concerning requirements for inheritance tax will be greater than those applicable under the Taxes Management Act for the taxes covered by that legislation.
<P>
The Law Society suggests that there should be an equalisation of penalties across the various tax laws. It voices a concern that, if the penalty regime is to be made as tough as the clause proposes, it might make it difficult for professional representatives to protect themselves against dishonest fellow personal representatives, in that it might be impossible to recover the penalty at the new level from the estate assets. That could lead to a disincentive for professional personal representatives to act in the administration of estates. I am not sure how widespread a problem that could become, but the fact that the Law Society felt sufficiently strongly to voice the concern in its submission suggest that the Government ought at least to respond to it. 
<P>
Will the Paymaster General therefore explain why the Government have decided to increase the penalties by an amount considerably greater than those that apply in respect of other taxes, and will she address the concern expressed by the Law Society?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I should like to follow the line of analysis advanced by my hon. Friend the Member of Maldon and East Chelmsford. Will the Paymaster General explain how the new penalty levels were arrived at? In the light of her knowledge of Customs and Excise, will she compare and contrast the proposals before us with any similar requirements to provide information? What is the penalty regime in such cases?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The inheritance tax penalties have remained unchanged since they were introduced in 1974. The purpose of the clause is to update the maximum penalties for non-compliance with existing inheritance tax rules in respect of the information and documentation of accounts. It will also impose penalties for failure to comply with an information notice issued through the new procedures under clause 94. The revised amounts are generally in line with those in other parts of the tax system and will apply from the date of Royal Assent of the Finance Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked whether IHT penalties for the giving of incorrect information will exceed those imposed in respect of income tax and capital gains tax. The answer is no: the quantum of penalty envisaged in the legislation is merely the ceiling. In practice, the level will not differ from that imposed in  other tax areas.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde asked me to compare and contrast the proposals with similar requirements. I have chosen to compare and contrast penalties in respect of self-assessment, because I know that that is an area with which the right hon. Gentleman, who was a Minister in the previous Government, is familiar. The penalties are comparable and they read across. We are updating penalties that have been in place for a very long time to bring them into line with penalties elsewhere in the tax system.
<P>
I have many pages of text that describe how the penalties read across. I could read them into the record, Mr. Cook, but I shall not try your patience by doing so. However, I am happy to provide the right hon. Gentleman and other Committee members with that information. I can assure the Committee that the provision merely brings penalties in respect of inheritence tax proposals into line with the rest of the tax system. Given that they have not been amended since 1974, that change is long overdue.

<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move amendment No. 225, in page 69, line 8, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(1A) Subsection (1) above shall not apply unless either--
<P>
(a) at least one of the parties to the instrument is resident in the United Kingdom at the time it is executed; or
<P>
(b) the instrument is executed in the United Kingdom.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following:
<P>
Government amendment No. 208.
<P>
Amendment No. 249, in schedule 12, page 127, line 29, leave out from 'executed' to end of line 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clauses on stamp duty are so incompetent that we tabled a batch of amendments on Thursday evening that would change the provision substantially. The provisions reveal a Government in confusion, and are causing considerable problems outside this House. We shall debate those points in more detail when we consider clause 100.
<P>
Clause 97 is an anti-avoidance clause, which seeks to prevent avoidance by executing documents abroad, which keeps them outside the United Kingdom stamp duty net. However, it has been drafted so widely that circumstances are covered that I doubt were meant to be included. For example, let us consider two overseas bodies that transfer a UK patent from the one non-UK body to the other. Several years later, that document could be brought into the UK to try to enforce the patent through the UK courts. Stamp duty is payable at that point. As a result of the clause, however, several years of interest will also have to be paid.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It does not seem reasonable that the foreign assignee company should have to pay interest in the UK. We suspect that this is only one of many typical examples, and believe that this provision should be limited to cases where one of the parties to a transaction is UK resident."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Directors is also worried about the clause. It has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"While the main target of this measure is deliberate deferral of stamp duty by keeping instruments abroad, it will also bear unfairly on some persons who execute instruments abroad for perfectly good reasons (for example because the parties are abroad) and then have to bring the instruments to the UK for the purposes of litigation which was not foreseen at the time of execution."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"this measure is a remarkably blunt anti-avoidance instrument. It should be more precisely targeted."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the purpose of amendment No. 225. It requires that one of the parties should be a UK resident for the provision to bite.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 249 relates to schedule 12, which introduces the new penalty and interest regime for late payments of stamp duty. It is unclear whether the Stamp Office is up to speed with business developments. Is it aware that many property developments require a developer to secure an agreement to enter a lease before the development is begun? Such agreements are often executed more than six months prior to the completion of the development and the lease. Proposed new section 240(2), which will be inserted into the Finance Act 1994 by schedule 12, will charge interest on stamp duty due on an agreement to enter a lease 30 days after the execution of the lease or six months after the execution of the agreement, whichever is the earlier.
<P>
If, for example, a developer wanted Marks and Spencer in a new development, not only would an agreement with that company be entered into before the completion of the building but before the foundation stones were laid. It is therefore totally unreasonable to require interest on stamp duty on that agreement to be paid six months after the agreement to enter into the lease. That is why the British Property Federation points out that the developer may need legally binding agreements before he can start the development and obtain the necessary finance, and that the new rule will particularly affect agreements where the lease will not be granted for a considerable period. It will also particularly affect conditional agreements for a lease. In those circumstances, if the condition is not fulfilled, the stamp duty is not even repayable as a result of the measure.
<P>
The Government seem to have taken on board that point in their amendment. It is the first of many amendments that the Government have tabled to deal with the fiasco that the Finance Bill, as originally drafted, would create. [Interruption.] Labour Members may scoff, but it is wrong to produce a Finance Bill that is so jam-packed with errors. It reveals that the Government do not know what is happening in the real world of business. They have submitted a raft of amendments on the latest possible date--giving the industry only three days to consult--and they expect the Committee to accept the amended provisions without any criticism of the Minister who presented the Bill in the first place.

<P>

<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I am delighted to see the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in the Committee Room this morning. I was in a state of anxiety last night because I thought that he would not appear today. I can exclusively reveal to the Committee that the hon. Gentleman was mentioned yesterday in a radio programme, "Money Box Live". A lady rang in about a case involving the CSA. It was a complex matter, and the presenter advised her to see her Member of Parliament. She said, "Yes, I'll go and see that Nick Gibb immediately." So, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for actually being here. My joy at seeing him was, however, mitigated a little by his opening remarks about the amendments.
<P>
Again, the hon. Gentleman seems to have had a severe attack of amnesia. He forgets what happened to the 1996 Finance Bill, but my hon. Friend the Paymaster General will remember well. The previous Government had to table something like 200 amendments just a couple of days beforehand. Of course, the hon. Gentleman was not a Member of Parliament at the time. No doubt he was penning furious letters attacking the Conservative Government in the Bognor Regis Gazette, or whatever his local newspaper is called.
<P>
I would be delighted to see copies of those letters. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> We now see why we are in such dire straits. The Financial Secretary spends far too much time listening to "Money Box Live", which is obviously the Government's main source of inspiration for its financial polices.
<P>
There were errors in the 1996 Finance bill, and the hon. Lady is right to draw the Committee's attention to them. Does she not agree, however, that if we are now in a similar situation, after a change of Government, this Government have learned nothing about how to draft and consult on complex clauses such as clause 97?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to hear "Money Box Live"; what was said in the programme was reported to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Hearsay.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is not quite hearsay. I will not, however, tempt you by pursuing the issue, Mr. Cook.
<P>
I hope that the right hon Member for Fylde was not attacking "Money Box Live", a programme that is much appreciated by many people. I did not raise the subject to criticise the previous Government--far from it. I simply wanted to show how spurious the point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was. However, I digress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Irresistible. As a former Whip, I will of course give way to the Conservative Whip.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Kidding aside, does the hon. Lady not agree that the Bill was originally a bit of a shambles.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Minister's defense is to pray in aid past problems, and agree that things occasionally happen in that way. In the light of that, will she retract her criticism of the drafting of previous legislation and acknowledge that these are complex matters, but that lessons should have been learned from the past to prevent the same problems from recurring?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> All that I would say to the right hon. Gentleman is that we are dealing with complex and technical matters. People and bodies outside the House watch our proceedings. The Government listen, and when representations are made to us we will of course examine our legislation. My point is that it reflects no credit on our deliberations to advance artificial and spurious arguments.
<P>
Under the new interest regime, interest on late paid duty runs in all cases from 30 days after execution of the document. It is fair for interest to be charged on late payment of tax in respect of a charge that may have arisen a long time previously. The new interest rule is clearly set out.
<P>
The purpose of the new rule is to stop an abuse of the system, of which a few people make use. The possibility of deferring tax without interest is not available to ordinary taxpayers who pay their tax on time when buying a house or flat. It would be absurd to allow non-UK residents to continue to play the system in that way.
<P>
Amendment No. 225 would significantly undermine the new stamp duty compliance regime. It would allow non-UK residents to execute an instrument abroad, transferring United Kingdom land or other assets, and to pay stamp duty free of interest if they used a document in the UK at a later date. That cannot be right. It would offer an avoidance route, which I am sure would be readily exploited. I have no hesitation in recommending that the Committee reject amendment No. 225.
<P>
Government amendment No. 208 changes the way in which interest is charged on stamp duty on an agreement for a lease. Section 240 of the Finance Act 1994 provides that where an agreement for a lease and the subsequent lease document are presented for stamping at the same time, the penalties for late stamping on the agreement operate by reference to the date of the lease. New section 240 of the Finance Act 1994, which is inserted by paragraph 4 of schedule 12 of the Bill, would have resulted in interest starting to run no later than from the date six months after the execution of the agreement for a lease. The purpose of the six-month limit was to prevent taxpayers from delaying payment of the duty on the lease by relying on the agreement and not taking out the lease for an extended period.
<P>
The British Property Federation and other bodies have made representations about the provision. They were concerned that there could be a substantial interest charge on the duty on an agreement for a lease where there is a long interval between execution of the agreement and of the lease itself. The bill could require the payment of duty on a lease of a large commercial development before the building is completed, or an interest payment when the duty is paid later. That would be unfair in many bona fide commercial deals, where a lease agreement can pre-date commencement of the lease by several years. The Stamp Office is not aware of any cases in which the provision has been used to defer payment unreasonably, and I am persuaded by the reasoned case that has been made by the representative bodies. In recognition of the difficulties that could arise, we propose that the six-month rule should be dropped so that in such cases interest will run from only 30 days after the execution of the lease itself in the same way as for any penalty that is chargeable. I commend Government amendment No. 208 to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 249 would have the same effect, but I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman--I am sorry, the hon. Gentleman, although who knows what may happen in the forthcoming reshuffle?--will forgive me if I prefer parliamentary counsel's drafting to his own. He must be a little disappointed that the Government's amendment was tabled three days before the Conservative Amendment. However, I am glad that he has followed on our coat tails.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Lady managed to receive reports about "Money Box Live". I am looking forward to being "that Nick Gibb" who will be helping my constituent with her difficulties.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that the Opposition were raising artificial and spurious points about the shambles of this section of the Bill--[Hon. Members: "No."]--yet by tabling Government amendment No. 208, she is accepting our arguments. To respond to her point about the three days, if one takes into account weekends and printing delays, the two amendments were probably tabled at the same time. I certainly had not seen the Government's amendment before tabling amendment No. 249, which addresses points that have been raised outside the House for debate in the Committee. Those points are not artificial and spurious; neither are the many other points that we will raise during the debate. The fact that the hon. Lady denied, in answer to a perceptive question, that the Bill, and this part of it in particular, is a shambles, when the Government have tabled 33 amendments--four of which were not selected for debate because the Government had tabled them as, in the technical phrase, wrecking amendments to their own Bill--reveals that she is not being as candid with the Committee as she should be.
<P>
This part of the Bill is a shambles. We will spend some considerable time listening to explanations of the 33 amendments that the Government have tabled in order to give the Bill a semblance of decency. However, as the Government have accepted amendment No. 249, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 225.

<P>
(b) the instrument is duly stamped, and
<P>
(c) the repayment is of an amount then repayable.
<P>
In that case the relevant time is 30 days after the day on which the instrument was executed or, if later, the date on which the amount was lodged with the Commissioners.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment enables the Inland Revenue to add interest to a repayment of money placed on deposit against stamp duty. New section 15A(2) of the Stamp Act 1891, which is inserted by clause 97, enables the taxpayer to avoid incurring interest charges by lodging with the Inland Revenue an amount in respect of duty on a particular document. That facility is unlikely to be used very often, but it is likely to be useful when there is uncertainty about the level of duty--for example, when a valuation has to be made. The amendment ensures that if the amount lodged proves to be excessive, interest can be paid on the resulting repayment.
<P>
The payment of interest in such circumstances is very much in the spirit of clause 98. The excess money will be repaid, together with any interest due, when the instrument has been duly stamped. Interest will accrue from 30 days after the execution of the instrument or from the date of deposit, if that is later.
<P>
I think that the amendment, which accords with the spirit of clause 98, will be widely welcomed. I commend it to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister explain why this provision was not included in the Bill as originally drafted?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes. When the Bill was originally drafted, it was not appreciated that a specific statutory provision would be needed to cover the particular circumstances about which I talked. We considered the matter again and we feel that the amendment adds clarity; an express statutory provision ensures absolute certainty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am intrigued by the Financial Secretary's words. She said that this issue "was not appreciated" when the Bill was originally drafted. A Bill such as this do not appear out of the ether. It is the result of explicit instructions to parliamentary counsel. The drafts go backwards and forwards between those giving the instructions and those who draft the Bill. Given the 300 years' worth of tax history in this area, could the Financial Secretary say why that appreciation was not there? I am a little worried that it raises a question about Ministers' depth of knowledge in this matter.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Despite my grey hair, I have not been there for all those 300 years of tax history. As the right hon. Gentleman will know, with all legislation--not only taxation legislation--there are always occasions when one looks to the provisions of the statute for interpretation. The instructions from parliamentary counsel to the draftsmen were to draft the measure in the way intended. As legislation proceeds through Parliament, it is kept under review. On further reflection, we thought that there might possibly be a lack of clarification and that express statutory provision was needed. That is why we are acting.
<P>
I thought that Opposition Members might have appreciated the fact that the Government constantly look at legislation during its parliamentary passage to seek to improve it in a way that taxpayers would warmly welcome. I have been disappointed, but the time is only half-past 12 and the day is yet young. Perhaps Opposition Members' tempers will improve later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Mr. Cook--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will recall that he must stand when speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Thank you, Mr. Cook. No discourtesy to you was intended.
<P>
Can the Minister explain another inconsistency in commencement dates? The measure in clause 98, referring to interest payments on the payment of stamp duty, does not commence until 1 October 1999. The more important clause that follows, which introduces the main changes to stamp duty, comes into immediate effect as of the date of the Budget. Why are the measures in the two clauses not coterminous?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The choice of 1 October is to allow practitioners to become accustomed to the new regime--we have allowed lead-in time for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for that explanation, but will the Minister explain what will happen to transactions made between the two dates?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The words "the commencement day" mean what they say--the new regime will operate from 1 October. Before that, the previous regime will be in force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The main changes to stamp duty will have taken place by 1 October, but no interest will be paid on overpayments of stamp duty in the interregnum.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes, that is correct.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
N
<P>
N + E
<P>

N is the average market value of the non-exempt investments over the relevant two-week period, and
<P>
E is the average market value of the exempt investments over that period.
<P>
(3) In this paragraph "exempt investment" has the same meaning as in section 99(5A)(b) of the Finance Act 1986; and "non exempt investment" means any investment that is not an exempt investment.

<P>

<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> New clause 6, new schedule 1 and the consequential amendments are designed to replace clause 100 and schedule 19. May I begin, Mr. Cook, by apologising to you and to members of the Committee for having tabled such a large group of related amendments. The matter is extremely complex, as I am sure the forthcoming debate will establish. As my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary stressed in relation to clause 98, the amendments are the product of extremely helpful representations from the industry and consultation that has taken place between it and the Inland Revenue since publication of the Bill. Although the measures are complex and technical, they represent the Government's willingness to listen and to seek and take expert advice. They also enable the Committee to fulfil its proper function of scrutiny and improvement of the Bill. In replacing clause 100 and Schedule 19, we have taken the opportunity not only to deal with the specific problems that the industry raised about the original clause and schedule, but to begin to spring clean a set of provisions relating to stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax, which date back to the Stamp Act 1891. That was the last occasion on which stamp duty provisions were consolidated. We are dealing with very old, as well as very technical, provisions.
<P>
The new clause and the new schedule, together with the consequential amendments, remove the existing stamp duty regime for dealings of units in unit trusts and replace it with a new regime. The new regime is based largely on the Budget proposals, but includes a number of improvements made as a result of representations by the unit trust industry.
<P>
It may help the Committee if I begin by explaining the problems with the existing stamp duty regime that we sought to address in establishing the new regime. Because the current charge is to stamp duty, there is a requirement that individual documents be physically stamped. That places an unnecessary administrative burden on unit trust managers and inhibits the introduction of electronic trading.
<P>
Furthermore, the existing regime is very complex. To claim a refund of stamp duty, unit trust managers must show that a proportion of the fund's assets have been realised as a consequence of the surrender of a unit. That can be difficult for the trust managers to chronicle properly, and creates difficulties for the Inland Revenue in policing the regime.
<P>
A more recent problem is that the legal effect of the current regime has been cast into doubt by the recent court case of M and G v. the Inland Revenue Commissioners--and the associated case involving Schroder--which suggested that all that is needed for a refund of stamp duty is for a unit to be cancelled on surrender. That decision would have the perverse effect that unit trusts could avoid any stamp duty simply by cancelling all units surrendered and creating new ones for all new investors, rather than reselling units. There is no reason why stamp duty should effectively be made optional for those who trade in units when it is not optional for those who trade directly in shares. That simple principle is at the heart of the matter. Because of the problems caused by that decision, we decided that it is necessary to act now.
<P>
The charge that will arise under the new regime will be to stamp duty reserve tax rather than to stamp duty. That means that it will no longer be necessary to have documents physically stamped, which will pave the way for the electronic trading of units. The basis of the new regime is a 0.5 per cent. SDRT charge when units are surrendered. That is the same as under the old regime, and equates to the 0.5 per cent. charge when shares are transferred directly between two investors. The new clause, new schedule and related amendments provide that where in a two-week period, beginning with the week in which the surrender takes place, there are more sales to new investors than surrenders, the 0.5 per cent. charge stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady mentioned the two-week period. What was the period before, and why was it changed?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The original clause and schedule provided for a two-month period--a longer period--in which the surrender of units could be followed by their resale to new investors. The industry has made persuasive representations that the two-month period was too long, and that it would create too much administrative complexity for unit fund managers when tracking sales costs that were consequent upon surrenders. We have therefore substantially reduced the two-month period to two weeks.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the provision is to allow the units that are surrendered to be matched by a sale to a new investor within a short period. Once the surrender takes place and is followed in a short period by a new sale, it should be subject to a Þ per cent. charge in exactly the same way as the transfer of an ordinary share between two investors.
<P>
On the other hand, where there are more surrenders than sales to new investors--again, within the two-week period--the Þ per cent. charge is reduced by the extent to which surrenders are greater than the sales to new investors. That is achieved by multiplying the SDRT charge by the number of sales to new investors over the number of surrenders. The effect of that is, quite correctly, that SDRT is charged only on surrenders that are matched by sales to new investors. That gives the correct result because, where surrenders are not matched by sales to new investors, there is no effective transfer between investors. All other things being equal, the trust will have to sell some of its underlying assets as a result of the drop in the number of units in issue. The total size of the fund will shrink. The sale of those underlying assets will normally attract a stamp duty or an SDRT charge in their own right. Therefore, the provision prevents a double charge from arising.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister explain why she did not want the matching formula to be applied on a daily basis?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Of course. It was suggested that the matching should be done only on a daily basis. The difficulty with that is that it would give rise to potentially extremely serious avoidance of the tax. The surrender might not necessarily be followed by a sale to the new investor within the short period of 24 hours. Indeed, it would be easy for fund managers to ensure that the sale did not take place within 24 hours, but perhaps a little later.
<P>
Different unit trusts have different practices as regards how quickly underlying assets are disposed of in response to the surrender of units. However, the two-week period strikes the right balance between our initial proposal of a two-month period, which we were persuaded was too long, and the one-day period, which would effectively give an exemption by the back door where there was no case for an exemption. That is because of the principle that I outlined under which a surrender that is followed by a sale should be treated in exactly the same way as a sale that takes place directly between one investor and another.
<P>
The aim of the regime is to create a broadly consistent approach between dealings in units and securities. However, not all securities are chargeable to stamp duty. For instance, most bonds and overseas shares are exempt. Clearly, therefore, where unit trusts are able to invest only in securities that do not attract stamp duty or an SDRT charge, there will now be no charge on dealings in the units of those trusts.
<P>
Following on from that point, many unit trusts invest in both chargeable and non-chargeable securities. In that case, a unit trust will be able to claim a reduction in the SDRT bill that arises under the new regime. That reduction will be equivalent to the proportion of securities that the trust owns that are not chargeable to stamp duty. Again, we are following through the principle that the stamp duty or the SDRT charge that arises on direct transfers of assets should be matched by appropriate charges on dealings in units.
<P>
The new regime may seem complex to members of the Committee--I certainly needed a wet towel as I struggled to get to grips with the technicalities. However, the regime arises from our desire to create fairness between dealings in units in unit trusts, which are open-ended bodies, and in shares in ordinary trading companies, which are closed bodies. Certainly in administrative terms, the new regime is a significant simplification over the old regime. Unit trust managers should already have all the information that they need to make returns to the Inland Revenue easily available for their own business needs.
<P>
The new regime as introduced by the new clause and schedule will maintain a broadly consistent approach between dealings in units and dealings in shares. It will also be more straightforward to administer and will pave the way for the electronic trading of units. I therefore commend the new clause, the new schedule and the consequential amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I thought that we would be dealing with just one incompetent Minister--the Financial Secretary--but it seems that today we must deal with at least two incompetent Ministers. The Economic Secretary apologised for tabling a large group of amendments, which is one thing, but there has been no apology for the fact that that large group was tabled only on Thursday evening, giving the rest of the country and Committee members a mere Friday and a weekend in which to scrutinise them. She said that she had had to apply a wet towel in understanding them, but I wonder when that wet towel was applied--was it when she found herself having to move the amendments, or was it before the Bill was published, when the provisions were initially drafted? The original provisions are so full of misunderstandings regarding the way in which the industry works that I do not believe any attention was given to them before the Bill's publication.
<P>
Clause 100, together with clauses 108 and 109 and schedule 19, has been completely rewritten by the amendments. The whole stamp duty section of the Bill is a complete fiasco. The clauses as originally drafted demonstrate a total misunderstanding--and an absence of a basic knowledge--of the unit trust industry. For example, the Bill refers to the nominal value of unit trusts, when it is common knowledge that they do not have a nominal value. There is also reference to the price that a unit trust might be expected to fetch on the open market, when unit trusts are in fact priced according to a Financial Services Authority regulation formula.
<P>
Furthermore, there is an unworkable period of two months before the stamp duty charge can be calculated on sales and redemptions, and a misunderstanding of the type of investment that the funds undertake. Why, for instance, did the Bill originally exempt foreign unit trusts but not foreign equities? Why were there no pro rate provisions before the amendments were tabled for funds investing in mixed investments? There was also the inadvertent abolition of the group relief exemptions and exemptions for certain family transfers.
<P>
It is easy for Ministers to blame the Stamp Office for that catalogue of incompetence, but it is Ministers themselves who must ensure that there is a proper understanding of the industry to which the legislation that they seek to pass relates. Late on Thursday evening, the Government tabled 10 pages of detailed amendments. They were consulted on between Monday and Wednesday last week--that is the extensive consultation process about which we heard from the Minister. That might be an acceptable time scale if we were talking about simple changes to simple legislation tabled by a Minister with a track record of competence on the issue, but we are not. This is a highly complex matter involving a very specialised industry: the industry's view is that there was not enough time.
<P>
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, or AUTIF, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe that the proposed amendments are defective,"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is not talking about the Bill but the amendments to it, which have been tabled after consultation--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in particular in the area of the definition of chargeable securities and certain in specie redemption."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There are a number of areas where the industry either does not understand the Revenue's intent or disagrees with it, but there has been no time for discussion or for representations to be made."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
AUTIF is backed up by the Institutional Fund Managers Association.
<P>
As so often with this Government, we are expected to approve legislation while still awaiting the corresponding regulations--for example, those on open-ended investment companies and on the accounting, payment and record-keeping requirements. Despite having no detailed regulations, the industry is still expected to implement its systems and have them up and running by the Government's implementation date, which is 6 February next year--a mere eight months away. When will those regulations be finalised? Assuming that they will be finalised in September, the FSA has still to draw up the rules based on those regulations. Moreover, from autumn this year, the financial services industry will face a systems change freeze leading up to the millennium, which will extend up to 31 January.
<P>
That leaves just six days for the industry to implement these measures. How can the Minister think that that is a realistic timetable? The Government's response is to say that the concern can be dealt with by manual changes. That again reveals an ignorance of the industry--manual changes would raise enormous compliance issues as they rely on systems being automatic and not subject to error. The area is highly regulated and, according to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, its concerns and those of the industry are shared by the Financial Services Authority. AUTIF reports that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Managers are, therefore, likely to find themselves in an impossible position of trying to satisfy the requirements of the law, and in the process falling foul of the regulators."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In effect, the Government are encouraging a diminution of the highest investor protection standards by imposing an unnecessarily tight timetable. Our amendments, therefore, reasonably seek to postpone the implementation from 6 February 2000 to 2 July 2000--the first Sunday of that month.
<P>
In their amendments, the Government have managed to remove some of the most glaring errors from their original proposals, for which the industry and members of the Committee are grateful. Problems of concern to the industry remain, and I want briefly to bring them to the attention of Ministers and the Committee.
<P>
The first problem in the amendments is to be found in paragraph 12 of new schedule 1, which introduces new subsections 5A and 5B to section 99 of the Finance Act 1986. That section relates to the exemption from stamp duty reserve tax of unit trusts that do not invest wholly in United Kingdom securities, and defines what constitutes such and exempt investment. A final condition for exemption is given in 5B (a) (i):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is not an investment on the transfer of which ad valorem stamp duty would be chargeable".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to AUTIF, that will cause a potential problem for funds investing in foreign security. Although foreign securities are not chargeable investments, a transfer of such security between UK-resident individuals would attract as valorem stamp duty. The Government may argue that the Revenue would not take that view, but that is how the legislation is worded. The Revenue would be given the option to interpret it more harshly and thereby, in effect, withdraw the exemption from duty from foreign security transfers. Will the Minister explain why subsection 5B(a) (i) is included and give a response to AITIF's concern? Is the problem a consequence of overhasty drafting? 
<P>
There is also concern about subsection 5A(b), which provides that a chargeable security does not include a unit under a unit trust scheme if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"under the terms of the scheme the trust property can only be invested in exempt investments."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why is the provision so prescriptive? A trustee might permit wider investments, but the trust might invest only in wider investments. Why should such unit trusts not be regarded as exempt securities? I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to that point. The Government may argue that that is the existing law, and that the Revenue does not agree with me. However, the legislation arises from the case, to which the Economic Secretary referred, that went against the Revenue's view, and is surely intended to avoid ambiguities in future.
<P>
The next concern of the industry relates to paragraph 7 of the new schedule. Originally, the Bill contained the absurd position that funds that invested entirely in exempt funds would be exempt from stamp duty reserve tax, but that there was to be no pro rate relief for funds investing in a mixture of exempt and non-exempt funds. That position is put right by the amendments, but there is still a problem where the funds carries out an in specie redemption, which is what happens when a fund sells an investment, and instead of distributing cash, redeems to the unit holder the actual shares held in the fund. If the fund carriesout an in specie redemption that is not precisely pro rate with the investment assets held by the fund, the whole redemption is stamped at Þ per cent. Without any other possibility. Will the Economic Secretary explain why that is the case, and respond to the industry's concerns?
<P>
The third area of concern is the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That phrase, in paragraph 3(2)(a) of new schedule 1, defines market value. Why is reference made to the open market when it is clear that unit trusts are priced according to FSA regulations on the basis of the market value of the underlying investment?
<P>
Another concern expressed by the industry is that where a unit holder sells his units without selling them back to the manager, there may be a double charge to stamp duty reserve tax. The most common transfer of that type would be a transfer between custodians' nominee accounts. The double charge seems to arise from paragraph 1 of new schedule 1, which says that there is a charge to stamp duty reserve tax on the surrender of a unit as defined, but the definition seems to include third party transfers.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The main legislation on stamp duty reserve tax, which is in the Finance Act 1986, says, in section 87, the stamp duty reserve tax is payable on all transfers of chargeable securities--which, under section 99, includes units under a unit trust scheme. Section 90, as amended by the Bill, exempts transfers to or from managers, but it does not exempt transfers between unit holders. Therefore, it would appear that third party transfers are also chargeable under the Finance Act 1986.
<P>
This issue has been badly handled.  I look forward to hearing the Economic Secretary's response to the industry's concerns, and hope that she will have the humility to accept the revised implementation dates set out in the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): The other day, I had occasion to pick up a copy of an accountancy in-house journal, in which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was prominently featured in his regular column--including a photograph in which he looks much younger and has much more hair.  This morning, he should try to keep his  hair on, because his remarks about my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary were intemperate.
<P>
I have some concerns about the amendment, and want to ask one simple point of clarification. Will the pro rate relief for funds holding exempt investments, in the amended schedule 19, apply to funds holding foreign securities?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I take a different view of the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which I thought was excellent. It was an outstanding depiction of all the problems created by the Government in these clauses. In his technical grasp of the issue, my hon. Friend showed a great deal more expertise than Ministers do. I shall make a few points in support of his speech, and seek clarification from the Economic Secretary.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that the intention behind the clauses was to avoid double taxation. However, that has not been achieved, because if there is a simple surrender of units--the hon. Lady may correct me if I am wrong--stamp duty will be payable on the surrender, but in order to finance the surrender of the units, there must be a sale of the underlying securities, on which stamp duty will also be payable. The Government might be trying to prevent some element of treble taxation, but there is still double taxation. That can be contrasted with the circumstances of in specie surrender.
<P>
We welcome the fact that the Government have proposed rules to take account of in specie surrender, but it is incongruous to have double taxation in the event of a simple surrender but not in the case of in specie surrender. In both cases, there would have to be a sale of the underlying shares. That goes to the heart of the difficulty of trying to apply a tax that is more than 300 years old to the new world of electronic trading. One can only assume that in saying in the explanatory notes that the new regime would be more straightforward to administer, the Board of the Inland Revenue was demonstrating its sense of humour. Everything that we have heard from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds confirms that the matter is complex.
<P>
It is not clear why the measure has to be introduced now. We understand that the Government are worried about a possible loss of revenue, but in response to a question asked in May this year, they made it clear that there had been no loss of revenue, even after the recent court judgments. The revenue is still between £35 million and £40 million a year. However, there has been a change in the gross number of units that are claimed against, which may reflect changes in the way in which the unit trust industry interprets legislation. The amount of revenue from the source has been consistent. Clauses that deal with the level of stamp duty will allow us to explore whether it is realistic to expect this stamp duty to continue to be a source of revenue.
<P>
My hon. Friend made it clear that there was a contradiction between the deadline being imposed by the Government and the requirements of the Financial Services Authority. It is simply not good enough to ask the industry to deal with the changes in a manual system when FSA compliance requires a systematic response. Without that response, the FSA may impose severe penalties on unit trust managers.
<P>
It was wrong of the Government to allow such a short time to debate the amendments, which came to the knowledge of the industry only mid-morning last Friday. As you will be aware, Mr. Cook, any amendments for consideration today had to be tabled before the close of parliamentary business in mid-afternoon on Friday. That left only a few hours in which to table amendments. I congratulate my hon. Friend--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is not the first time that an electronic device has rung in Committee. Will someone please locate it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I think that it is in the bag of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey).
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall deal with it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman should extract the offending device and switch it off. I warn hon. Members that my colleague, Mr. Butterfill, although a kindly man, may not be as tolerant as I am when he chairs the Committee this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I well understand your dissatisfaction, Mr. Cook. I am sure that your message will be passed on so that in future, if the hon. Gentleman is still a Member of Parliament, he will appreciate the conventions of the House.
<P>
To return to the issue of the tight timetable, I congratulate my hon. Friend on his success in tabling his crucial amendments in a few hours within the deadline. I shall complement his remarks by referring the Government to the changes suggested by AUTIF. In paragraph 12 of new schedule 1, proposed new subsection (5A)(b) of section 99 of the Finance Act 1986 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"under the terms of the scheme the trust property can only be invested".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
AUTIF would like that to read: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the trust property is only invested".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would change proposed new subsection (5B)(a)(i) and (ii) so that they would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(i) it is not an investment on the transfer of which ad valorem stamp duty would be chargeable and it is not a security, or
<P>
(ii) it is a security and it is not a chargeable security".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
AUTIF believes that that would help to clarify their meaning. 
<P>
Proposed new subsection 5B(b)(i) states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"cannot be invested in such a way",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but should read "is not invested" in such a way. This goes to the heart of our complaint about the Bill, becuase it contains so much that can be interpreted either in one way or in another. The lack of clarity in the Bill's wording is a contradiction of the Government's undertaking in their code of fiscal stability, which promised clear legislation. We are again being denied that, and I hope that the Government will have the good grace to correct that matter before Report.
<P>
In paragraph 5 of the new schedule, it is open to interpretation whether relief will be provided as intended. Will the Minister clarify whether the phrase used in paragraph 5 (1),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The amount of tax chargeable...shall be further reduced",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is to be interpreted in a permissive way or a prescriptive way? Our advice from AUTIF is that if the Inland Revenue were to interpret it in a prescriptive way, it would not have the intention of providing the relief justifiably sought by the industry.
<P>
I echo AUTIF's comments regarding the timetable to which they and we have been subjected by the Government's lack of preparation on these provisions. The association states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This is not a sensible way to legislation in a complex technical area."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There will already be a later deadline before the provisions come into force. Why could the Government not have engaged in more extensive consultation in the first place? Perhaps the period between Budget day and the first publication of the Bill would have been sufficient, but to give us just a few hours to consider our response to such complex proposals is totally unrealistic. Ministers need a great deal of education on the requirements of one of the country's most important industries.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I regret the tone in which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton introduced his amendment. As I said when I moved the new clause and the new schedule, this group of amendments is the product of consultation with the industry on the original clause and schedule. It has not been dumped on the industry with no time for discussion. The amendments were tabled last Thursday, as soon as they were ready. I would have been delighted to have been able to table them earlier, but they deal with technical issues and we wanted to make sure that we had got them right. It seemed right to table these technical amendments in Committee--rather than leaving them until Report--thus maximising the time available for hon. members and those outside in the industry to examine them, and make sure that we have got them right.
<P>
I had assumed, when moving this series of changes, that Opposition members would have been familiar with the history of the previous Government's attempt to change the law in this area. That is why I did not draw the Committee's attention to it in my opening remarks. However, in view of the hon. Gentleman's attitude, I shall explain the background to this matter, because it is nonsense to suggest that it is a new issue on which we have spent only a couple of hours' reflection.
<P>
The previous Government introduced their own proposals for a new SDRT regime for units and unit trust schemes, which they then abandoned. They introduced them in November 1996, the last Budget day of the previous Government. They proposed a new regime, designed to simplify some of the complexity and uncertainty of the existing regime.
<P>
In January 1997, they published the Finance Bill and announced a proposed reduced rate in return for abolition of the repayment within the present regime. On 6 February, in the Finance Bill Standing Committee, they withdrew the proposal in response to criticisms from the industry, including the bodies to which Opposition members have referred.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In February 1997, the industry asked for time to come forward with its own proposal, and the Government of the day were prepared to accommodate that request. In a press release announcing the withdrawal of the clause a written answer and on several occasions in Committee, Angela Knight, the then Economic Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we will expect the industry to come forward with proposals which are capable of dealing with the criticisms made of the present regime while continuing to raise the same revenue as now."--[Official Report, 6 February 1997; Vol. 289, c. 678.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In Committee, during the debate in which the clause was withdrawn, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We initially had representations from the industry asking for changes at the end of September last year"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is September 1996. She continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I met with its representatives at the end of November when they welcomed the new regime. They then wrote to us at the end of December suggesting that, as it stood, the clause could cause problems for some of their members. In January they asked for the regime"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
she means the old regime--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to be kept. When I confirmed to them that I would drop the clause that they had originally requested, I received a letter of thanks."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The industry must come to an agreement about the changes it would require while ensuring that we keep the same tax revenue as before."--[Official Report, standing  Committee B, 25 February 1997; c. 471.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The matter has been debated by Ministers and officials for well over two years. However, the industry has failed to put forward proposals that would deal with the old scheme's complexity, while protecting the revenue base. Therefore, we have done the job instead. Although the original proposals in the Bill would have put in place a simplified and workable scheme, we were again happy to listen to the industry and to improve the scheme further.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> To summarise the Economic Secretary's point, she is not to blame for the incompetence in the original draft of the Bill; the industry and the previous Government are.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am afraid that a new word has been added to the English language to describe the speaking of rubbish. What used to be described as "gibberish" should now  be called "Gibberish".
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has missed the point. Our proposals would have been workable. They would have protected the revenue base and put in place a simplified regime to deal with the problems that the previous Government, of whom the hon. Gentleman was a supporter, identified but were unable to put right.
<P>
The industry failed to come up with an alternative, despite committing itself to doing so two years ago. Nevertheless, we have listened to further representations from it and improved the regime that we sought initially to put in place. Those changes have been welcomed by the industry. M and G, which brought the case that has given rise to some of the difficulties, wrote to me on 11 June, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Let me say that we welcome...the principle of the changes... the willingness of the Stamp Office to make constructive and welcome concessions"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the effective exemption in respect of securities not subject to stamp duty...the proposed regime will be more straightforward."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has provided expert advice on these changes, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Thanks to the Government's concessions the...proposals...are now manageable. This is good news for our clients and the UK funds industry...Today's amendments, which address a number of key issues raised by the PricewaterhouseCoopers group, ensure the changes to the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax are delayed...This gives the industry more time to prepare...we welcome the way the Treasury and Inland Revenue have listened to the concerns of our clients and have made important concessions in a number of areas."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Is the Minister saying that this is not a total shambles that had to be rescued, but more a case of new Labour, new clause?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying hard. the original clause was good; the new clause is better.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised a number of other points. The Inland Revenue and the Financial Services Authority will produce further regulations, and officials in both bodies will consult the industry on the details. The delay in the introduction of the new regime until the beginning of February next year will provide plenty of time for that consultation. Not only will the necessary regulations be in place in good time, but unit trusts already have all the requisite information to make returns under the new regime. In light of the industry's persistent attempts to hang on to the old regime and delay any improvement or replacement by a simplified new regime, it would be absurd to delay the new regime even further, which is the purpose of the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Minister says that the new regime will be more user-friendly for the industry. Will she confirm that it is intended to be revenue neutral? Will she also confirm that to delay the new regime until July next year should, therefore, have no revenue consequences for the Government? Given the industry's latest representations--and the widespread knowledge of the difficulties that the millennium is causing for systems--will she explain why it makes sense to press on with an inoperative deadline, which the industry is having difficulty in meeting?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> On the issue of the revenue base and the reason for pressing ahead with the change, I shall make a point that I was going to make later. Net stamp duty receipts in respect of dealings within unit trusts were £34 million in 1996-97, and £38 million in 1997-98. In 1998-99, the figure in the first half of the year was £30 million, but in the second half of the year it fell dramatically to £7 million. There is a danger that, as a result of the uncertainty created by the M and G court case judgment, unit trusts--if the law remains unchanged--could. avoid paying virtually any stamp duty. In order to prevent parts of the industry from treating the tax as optional, and to protect the revenue base, we cannot allow the matter to remain unresolved. We have accepted the industry's representations that the introduction should be delayed beyond the initial date of October this year. We briefly considered the possibility of an introduction on 1 January next year, but the millennium bug problem made that undesirable. We therefore decided on a starting date at the beginning of February next year. Although the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is sceptical about the matter, he admitted that, within the regulatory regime, returns can be made manually if necessary. The industry already has the information that it needs for management purposes. We are simplifying a complex tax and modernising an out-of-date regime, but we are also making structure of the regime correspond in a more straightforward way with what we all believed it was before the M and G case.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised technical drafting points. The phrase "nominal value", which he used with some scorn, has been removed. We now refer to "nominal". The provision for market value has been changed to reflect the technical concerns of AUTIF. As for foreign securities, foreign trusts were, and still are, exempt. On foreign shares, relief has been given for the first time in the context of unit trusts. I am pleased to clarify the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North. In line with the purpose of pro rata relief in new schedule 1, the definition of exempt investment includes foreign shares.
<P>
As for in specie redemptions, when an investor exchanges units in a unit trust for a basket of shares that are proportionate to the trust's investment, there is no fundamental change in the nature of the investments that are held. However, when an investor receives other shares in for example, just one company, when the unit trust invests in a range of companies, there is a change in the underlying nature of the investment and there should be an SDRT charge, just as there would be with any other change of investment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford feared that there would be a double charge for some in specie redemptions. Again, where underlying assets are transferred to the unit holder in proportion with the underlying assets of the fund in exchange for his units, there is no need for the trust to sell underlying assets as a consequence of the surrender. Therefore, there is no possibility of a double charge arising. A single Þ per cent. SDRT charge will arise, and that is only right.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked why the exemption will apply only if the trust cannot invest in chargeable assets. The exemption will apply on a pro rata basis by reference to the assets that are held.
<P>
We have responded to a long-standing concern in the industry, which was shared by the previous Government, about the inadequacy and increasingly complex and out-of-date nature of SDRT. Unlike the previous Government, we have succeeded in producing good provisions in the Finance Bill. In response to the constructive and practical suggestions of some sections of the industry, for which I am grateful, we have improved the regime that we wanted to implement.
<P>
I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, but if it is not, I shall ask my hon Friends to vote against it. I commend new clause 6, new schedule 1 and the associated consequential amendments to the Committee. I also ask the Committee to vote against clause 100, so that we can replace it with the improved provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Economic Secretary's confusion is now complete. I hope that we will not be as confused by this complex issue. She mentioned a potential loss of revenue. The confusion is caused by the Government's need to change the law to protect the revenue and their longer-term programme to alter the system by which the tax is collected. By mixing the two, they have got into a muddle. The proper response would be to make a minor amendment to the existing law until the next Budget and Finance Bill, when they could introduce a proper system to deal with the industry's concerns. That would be a grown-up way of dealing with the problems that have been created by the way in which the Government have tackled this technical matter.
