					<a name="07060614000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
important to some 11 million people in the country, and I am pleased
that it received a broad welcome from both sides of the House. Its
principle is clear: the Concessionary Bus Travel Bill will extend the
geographical scope of free off-peak bus travel for older and disabled
people throughout England. It builds on the Government&#146;s earlier
work on concessionary travel. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>In 2001, the Government guaranteed half-fare concessionary travel
off-peak services within an eligible person&#146;s local authority
area. Since April 2006, they have made such travel completely free. The
Bill goes even further and will make off-peak free bus travel available
anywhere in
England.</div>
					<a name="07060614000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
taking the opportunity to put in place a flexible framework that will
allow changes to be made to concessionary travel arrangements in the
future. Subject to funding and practical arrangements being agreed,
there could be mutual recognition bus passes throughout the United
Kingdom in the future. We retain the power to extend the scope of the
national concession to other modes, such as trams and local rail
services or to other groups of people. The Bill is an important part of
the Government&#146;s work to promote social inclusion. I am sure
that all members of the Committee will continue to welcome its
principles, and I hope that we can resolve any matters of disagreement
or concern quickly.</div>
					<a name="07060614000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The programme motion proposes
that the Committee can meet twice today and similarly on Thursday. It
will allow for a full and proper discussion of each part of this
relatively small but important Bill. The motion was introduced in my
unavoidable absence due to circumstances beyond my control, thereby
proving that Ministers, despite what they think, are sometimes
completely dispensable. It was agreed happily by the Programming

							<b class="B">Paul
Rowen:</b>
						 Thank you, Mr. Bayley. It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship. Like the Minister, I welcome this
Bill. It extends provision and continues what the Government started 12
months ago, when they introduced free concessionary bus fares in
localities throughout England and Wales.</div>
					<a name="07060614000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 7, 31, 32 and
35 seek to broaden the definition of an eligible journey. In her
opening remarks, the Minister alluded to the fact that the Government
may, at some future time, extend the provision. However, we would like
to see that written in the Bill so that we have a clear commitment over
a period of time. Also, given the fact that the Bill applies only to
England and Wales and that there are different arrangements in other
nations of the UK, we would like to see some clarity. In particular, we
want the provision extended to trains, trams, ferries and community
transport.</div>
					<a name="07060614000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will use
community transport to illustrate one of the faults in the current
scheme. Eighteen months ago, a bus operator in my constituency decided
to withdraw a service. The passenger transport authority decided in its
wisdom to put a dial-a-ride community transport scheme on that route
and not another subsidised bus. That has been a source of great upset
to pensioners in Deeplish. Although they can use their concessionary
bus pass on a bus, there is no bus in their locality and they have to
pay 50p for the community transport scheme. In our view, we should
extend the provision to that service. I know that the Minister will say
that passenger transport authorities and local authorities have their
own resources to make that provision now, but we would like that
enshrined in the Bill along with a clear Government commitment to
extend free travel to those modes of transport.</div>
					<a name="07060614000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading, some hon.
Members asked why the Isle of Wight is going to get some of this money
when it provides no buses. If the amendment is accepted by the
Government, the ferry service that goes to the Isle of Wight will be
eligible for the
provision.</div>
					<a name="07060614000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
want to tighten the definition of what is and is not provided. For
example, at the moment we think that open-top tourist buses could be
eligible. However, as they do not fall within the normal definition of
public transport, we do not think that they should be included in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07060614000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also want to
see some provision made with regard to what we mean by
&#147;bus&#148;. Clearly, the ideas of limited stock or a fast sort
of coach does not come within that provision. I hope that the Minister
will accept that. She has said that the Government retain the power to
introduce such proposals. We would like to see a clear commitment
written into the Bill to enable that to
happen.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>

						<a name="07060614000349"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): Thank you, Mr.
Bayley. It is an honour and privilege to serve under your chairmanship.
As the Minister and the hon. Member for Rochdale have already said,
this is a small but none the less important Bill. Like the Minister, I
welcome the general cross-party consensus in support of the Bill, which
was made clear on Second Reading. We are here to consider some of the
nuances and, perhaps, one or two elements that can be tidied
up.</div>
					<a name="07060614000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal
Democrat amendments have the superficial merit of exploring and
tightening the definition of &#147;eligible service&#148;, but the
problem is that they would involve a huge cost to the Exchequer of up
to &#163;300 million, considering some of the current estimates, and
they have been tabled without any knowledge of demand, uptake, usage
and cost. That is clearly one of the great advantages of the amendment
tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends. The Minister will have
to agree that our amendment is reasonable and sensible&#151;it would
compel the Secretary of State to conduct a review of the modes of
transport in the concessionary scheme two years after it commences.
Given that the Minister has already said that flexibility is her
watchword, I am sure that she will want to include that flexibility in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07060614000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike the
Liberal Democrats, we have chosen not to table amendments extending the
scheme at this stage, because, as it has been made clear not only by
the Minister on Second Reading but in Committee in the other place, the
current projected costs are considerable. My Conservative colleagues
and I want to make it clear at the earliest opportunity that we are not
in the business of making unpublished spending commitments. The
amendment would not allow the Minister or any of her colleagues to make
that mischievous accusation against us, although, of course, we know
that she would not dream of doing that. However, two years in, it will
be far clearer what the costs of the scheme are, as it is currently
defined, what the take-up rates are and whether an extension of the
scheme might be funded and might increase the aim of aiding social
inclusion.</div>
					<a name="07060614000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that certain groups of disabled and elderly people would benefit from a
wider application of eligible services. A great many elderly and
disabled people live in rural locations in which the most effective
method of providing a convenient eligible service will not be the
bus&#151;it will be provision of community transport, whether a
minibus or taxi. The current scheme will allow access to concessionary
fares only if the local transport authority commissions a bus service
to those areas. In many cases, that will be economically unsound and
environmentally irresponsible, yet those are exactly the elderly and
disabled residents for whom this Bill was designed. There is a paradox,
because on one hand the intention is to enable the elderly and disabled
to have a better quality of life, to be socially included and to
participate more fully in their communities, but, on the other hand,
the funding will be allocated only to those who can have an eligible
bus service, meaning that it will prevent such people from getting
it.</div>
					<a name="07060614000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">For many elderly
and disabled people who live in Sheffield, Nottingham and Manchester,
for example, the best service will be not the eligible bus service, but
the tram. Let us also consider those with handicaps 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>and impairments, for whom door-to-door services would be not only
medically advisable, but socially inclusive. That may also apply to
those who access higher rates of disability living allowance and to
autism sufferers, for
instance.</div>
					<a name="07060614000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider those who regard ferries as their everyday local transport. On
Second Reading in the other place, much was made of journeys by ferry
in Scotland. I want to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for
Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), who forcefully argued that
access to the benefits of this scheme for his residents would
necessitate the ferry from the Isle of Wight to the mainland being
included where it is absolutely necessary to access specialist medical
help that is available only on the mainland. Of course, for Londoners
in many cases the tube, not the bus, will be the local transport
choice.</div>
					<a name="07060614000294"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The Minister will
retort that this scheme does not prevent local authorities from going
further than the national scheme. She will also retort on cost. I
welcome the fact that the Bill allows a continuing discretion for local
authorities to offer travel concessions on other forms of transport as
an enhancement of the statutory minimum. However, such local discretion
will receive no national compensation, so other local services will
have to be cut or local council tax will have to be increased to pay
for a sensible local extension to the
scheme.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07060614000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="07060614000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities are currently under tight funding constraints and cannot be
expected to absorb the costs of local discretionary extensions.
Redefining eligible services to include community transport, trams,
trains and ferries would enhance the access to transport and social
inclusion for the elderly. That is one of the primary motives behind
the Bill and a forceful argument for making it a Government
responsibility.</div>
					<a name="07060614000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Lord Davies
of Oldham stated that it would cost an extra &#163;300 million to
redefine eligible services to include trains, underground, trams and
ferries, which is a very large sum. The noble Lord split the cost into
its constituent parts. He attributed &#163;250 million to trains,
&#163;15 million to trams, &#163;25 million to community transport,
and nothing to ferries. I concur that &#163;15 million for trams and
&#163;25 million for community transport are large incremental sums,
but out of a total cost of &#163;1 billion, which the Government say
they are providing, an extra &#163;40 million, after a proper review,
consultation and consideration, might be viewed as a sensible use of
public moneys.</div>
					<a name="07060614000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
of the retorts that we will hear from the Minister in a minute militate
against accepting the amendment for review. They would carry weight
only if the amendment were to include in the Bill a wider definition of
eligible services. On the other side of the coin, in two years&#146;
time we may need to reconsider some of the services that are currently
possibly eligible. For example, such services include securing free
rides on open-top buses and short coach journeys from Heathrow to
Victoria. Local authorities in the areas from which the journeys
commence could face enormous financial burdens. It may well be that
after a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>
						proper review we would concur that such services
should be withdrawn from the definition of eligible service.</div>
					<a name="07060614000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is sensible to ensure that
local authorities and the Government have the opportunity to put right
any malfunctions of the concessionary scheme that become apparent after
it has bedded down. It is sensible to allow the Government the
opportunity to review the primary motivation of this Bill, which is
currently being enacted by the tightly drawn definition. If the primary
motivation of the Bill is not being served by the current definition of
eligible services, then it is only right to redraw that definition.
Therefore, amendment No. 15 puts in the Bill a requirement for
reassessment after two years of operation. It is an entirely sensible
and rational amendment, and I look forward to the Minister concurring
with
me.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
John Leech</b> (Manchester, Withington) (LD): First, may I
also welcome you to the Chair this morning, Mr. Bayley? I am
sure that we will have an excellent time in Committee, and hopefully we
can deal with the amendments and clauses in a speedy
fashion.</div>
					<a name="07060614000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I add my
support to the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Rochdale in relation to the extension of the national concession to
other modes of public transport? I want to mention two brief points.
First, although free bus travel for the elderly and the disabled is
very welcome, some parts of the country have introduced other modes of
transport for sections of regular journeys. For example, part of the
journey from New Addington to Croydon used to be on a bus, but that
service has now been replaced by the Croydon Tramlink. If we do not
have a free service for the elderly and disabled on that section of
that route, how will those people access the free transport that they
are entitled to? Secondly, the Mersey crossing forms part of journey
from Birkenhead to Liverpool. Surely, there is a very strong case to
suggest that those journeys should be included as part of the free
scheme? </div>
					<a name="07060614000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for other
modes of transport supporting and enhancing bus services, if we do not
have free services on other modes of transport, bus services will then
be in direct competition with existing services, such as Metrolink in
Manchester. We should really be looking at integrating the services
rather than setting them up in direct competition. Surely the best
option is for people to use one or the other. By including the other
forms of public transport within the concessionary scheme, there would
be no need for the operators of bus services to try to take passengers
from the other modes of
transport.</div>
					<a name="07060614000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point concerns accessibility. Unfortunately, some areas do not have a
bus service. If we do not have an alternative form of transport for
local people, those in the most remote areas are likely to miss out on
the free transport. In areas with bus services, those services are not
necessarily accessible by certain disabled people. By including
community transport and dial-a-ride utilities that provide door-to-door
services, we will be making services accessible to the most vulnerable
people in such
areas.</div>
					
					<a name="07060614000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000351"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b> I understand that hon. Members have some concerns
about the existing definition of eligible services for the purpose of
concessionary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>travel. I have been hopeful that the information provided in my letter
of 23 May to you, Mr. Bayley, which was copied to members of
the Committee, has assisted in providing some clarity about the
existing
definition.</div>
					<a name="07060614000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
made it clear on Second Reading that the Bill is about extending the
geographical scope of the statutory minimum concession to guarantee
that older and eligible disabled people can access important services
outside their local authority boundary by bus for free. It is a major
step forward and one of which I am extremely proud. It has also secured
the commitment of unprecedented levels of funding from the Government.
The Bill is not about extending the concession to other forms of public
transport such as trains, trams, community transport and ferries at
this time. However, I re-emphasise that we are not ruling out further
improvements in the future. The Government certainly have an excellent
track record on concessionary
fares.</div>
					<a name="07060614000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 7
proposes a regulation-making power to change the definition of
&#147;eligible journey&#148; to allow the Secretary of State to
extend the statutory concession to other modes. It would not actually
extend the mandatory concession to other modes. Clause 8(1)(b) already
allows the Secretary of State by order to amend part 2 of the Transport
Act 2000 to extend the national concession to other modes of public
passenger transport. The amendment is therefore without purpose. It
would neither require anything to be done nor give us the power to do
something that we cannot already
do.</div>
					<a name="07060614000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
addition, under the Transport Act 1985, local authorities have the
discretion to offer a range of travel concessions on other forms of
public transport and many do. The Bill preserves the flexibility for
local authorities to enhance the statutory minimum to reflect local
priorities and circumstances. From the amendments, I detect an obvious
concern about the definition of eligible services. I hope that I can
reassure members of the Committee about such matters, as I believe that
such worry is somewhat
misplaced.</div>
					<a name="07060614000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 31 proposes that the definition of &#147;eligible journey&#148;
excludes services that are primarily for the purposes of tourism.
Amendment No. 32 would provide powers for the definition of eligible
services to exclude services that have limited stops or that are not
primarily local services. I assure the Committee that the amendments
are unnecessary. The power already exists under regulations made under
section 146 of the Transport Act 2000 to change the definition of
eligible service in response to developing requirements. The current
regulations are detailed and stipulate broadly that a service must be
sufficiently accessible to the public, have stops that are 15 miles
apart or less and have stops that are situated at locations where they
are likely to be used by the
public.</div>
					<a name="07060614000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 15 proposes a review of the definition of eligible services after
two years and a report to be laid before Parliament. I would accept the
principle that policies should be properly evaluated. We will, of
course, review how the national bus concession is working after
implementation in April 2008, including the definition of
&#147;eligible service&#148;. However, as I have already said, we
already have the power to change the definition of &#147;eligible
service&#148;, so I cannot see the need for such an
amendment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>
					<a name="07060614000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 35 would amend
section 93 of the Transport Act 1985 to
provide</div>
					<a name="07060614000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;flexible
alternative forms of concession, including for use on community
transport&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07060614000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities already have powers to offer a range of concessions on all
modes of public passenger transport, including travel tokens and some
community transport, and many have already decided to offer those. The
Government have no plans at present to extend the statutory minimum
concession to other forms of public transport or community transport or
to include travel tokens. Any decision to extend the national statutory
entitlement would have to be fully
funded.</div>
					<a name="07060614000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
I explained on Second Reading, and as Lord Davies of Oldham explained
in another place, it is difficult to estimate how much it might cost to
extend the scheme to other modes of transport, but we are talking about
significant sums. As has been mentioned in various debates, early
estimates from the Department suggest that extending the concession to
rail alone would cost an extra &#163;250 million per year, with
another &#163;15 million a year to extend it to trams and a further
&#163;25 million a year to extend it to community transport. Those
costs could be a lot higher, depending on take-up. We are not currently
in a position to commit further funding to concessionary travel. We
need carefully to consider our spending priorities not only in this
area, but overall, and I urge Opposition Members to do the same. It is
about not only the availability of further resources to fund the
scheme, but making the right decision. That involves fully considering
the potential impacts in consultation with those involved to avoid any
unintended
consequences.</div>
					<a name="07060614000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
community transport, for example, although there are arguments for
extending concessions to dial-a-ride and other flexible services, many
local authorities already do that. However, making it a mandatory
requirement is a significant step and would require consideration of a
number of issues. I urge Opposition Members to consider whether the
sector could meet the extra demand that would be generated, what the
impact would be on local bus services, particularly in rural areas, and
what extra burdens&#151;particularly administrative ones&#151;would
be placed on the voluntary
sector.</div>
					<a name="07060614000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
explained, the Government have already delivered significant
improvements to the statutory minimum scheme in stages. In 2000, they
introduced the first statutory minimum concession for older and
disabled people&#151;half-price, off-peak travel within local
authority areas. We are now discussing the introduction of free
off-peak bus travel anywhere in England from April 2008. That means
that the Government will be spending around &#163;1 billion a year on
concessionary travel to improve the mobility and well-being of older
and disabled people. We would not even have the luxury of talking about
further extensions without the steps that the Government have already
taken.</div>
					<a name="07060614000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
indicated, older and disabled people currently qualify for a third off
most rail journeys, as the Department for Transport requires train
operators to participate in the senior and disabled person railcard
schemes. In addition, there is a half-price coach travel scheme. Until
the full impact of the introduction of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>
						new national bus concession has been evaluated for
effectiveness and cost it would be premature to extend the scheme
further. With that in mind, I hope that the hon. Member for Rochdale
feels able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> The previous amendments were probing amendments,
but, in my view and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester,
Withington, these go to the heart of what is missing from the Bill. We
would like the Government to implement various provisions in the
amendments, particularly those relating to access for disabled
people.</div>

					<a name="07060614000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
28 would ensure that someone&#146;s concession permit is clearly
marked with the fact that they are disabled. It would also enable a
person to go with them if they require a companion to accompany them.
That is vital. We know that many disabled people feel anxious when
using public transport. Having a companion travelling with them for
free would be a valid, welcome concession for disabled people. We are
not talking about huge sums. Many disabled people are not able to use a
bus. This matter can be properly discussed with the Disabled Persons
Transport Advisory Committee. Where there is a need for disabled people
to go door to door, use of a dial-a-ride scheme is required. Extending
the scheme to include those people would be valuable and
useful.</div>
					<a name="07060614000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill does
not allow someone who is mentally ill to be recognised as disabled.
That is a serious omission. Under amendment No. 10, anyone classed as
suffering from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>of the Mental Health Act 1983 would be considered as a disabled person.
We are not talking about huge numbers of people or a huge extra cost
involved in introducing the Bill. Nevertheless, many mentally ill
people feel quite aggrieved, because they have a disability that is
recognised by the medical profession, yet we are not according them the
same right&#151;because it is not a physical disability&#151;that
we are according other disabled

							<a name="07060614000358"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> Like the hon. Member for Rochdale, I am concerned
about the definition of a disabled person, particularly with regard to
people with mental illness. The current definitions are not adequate
for the Bill. Let us consider the amendments that were tabled in the
other place. When the definition of disablement was being more tightly
drawn, the amendment stated in relation to mental health that
it</div>
					<a name="07060614000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(g) would be defined
as having a mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term
adverse effect on his ability to carry out day-to-day activities in
accordance with section 1 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as
amended, or</div>
					<a name="07060614000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">(h) would, if he
applied for the grant of a licence to drive a motor vehicle under Part
III of the Road Traffic Act 1988, have his application refused pursuant
to section 92 of that Act...otherwise than on the grounds of
persistent misuse of drugs or
alcohol.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060614000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would have
had the benefit of clarifying and putting into the Bill those eligible
and, in particular, the difficult group of eligible people who suffer
from mental health
issues.</div>
					<a name="07060614000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that an individual&#146;s chance of recovery and reintegration into
society would be aided by access to community health teams, mental
health drop-in centres, therapy and counselling. Many such services
rely on public transport and therefore access to them would be aided by
concessionary travel. Eligibility for such concessionary fares could be
a major contributor to mental illness recovery. Most of those who will
qualify for concessionary travel and have mental health issues will do
so owing to part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. That Act said that
there were five categories of people who should and would be refused
licences were they to apply. The second category is severe mental
disorder and, under that category, a number of people with mental
health problems will qualify for concessionary travel, but not
all.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>
					<a name="07060614000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many people with mental health
issues still hold a driving licence, even through fluctuating mental
illness. Although that illness may make driving impossible at times,
they will still hold a licence, but they should be entitled to
concessionary travel. It is important that the definition of an
eligible person is more exactly specified than it is under the
Transport Act 2000. The Minister might sensibly agree to review what
extra definition could be considered, particularly with regard to
mental illness. I look forward to her response. I hope that she will
reflect compassionately and carefully on those with mental health
issues. If the Committee does not consider that it has received an
adequate response, I am sure that it will want to revisit the
matter.</div>
					<a name="07060614000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The thrust of
the Bill on Second Reading and today concerns the benefit of social
inclusion. Clearly, the position of carers is an oversight. Many
elderly and disabled people will only be able to use the provisions of
the Bill and access public transport if their carer can do so. As it
happens, many hon. Members will be taking part in activities next week,
it being carers week. It will highlight the fabulous work of carers. I
should welcome the Minister making positive remarks about what she
might do. She has already accepted the principle of a review of
eligible services. Perhaps she will now accept the principle of
extending concessionary travel to carers, given their invaluable work
that improves the quality of life for the elderly and disabled. I look
forward to her responding positively to my
comments.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to members of the Committee for
raising what I believe to be important issues. I am well aware that the
intentions behind the amendments are extremely sound but, as I have

allows response to changing circumstances. It is premature to consider
extensions when the Government are still introducing the national bus

with considerable flexibility to offer more than the statutory

concessions to additional groups, such as companions of disabled

taxis or community
transport.</div>

are enhancing the national scheme. I am not aware of any local

<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>that hides its light under a bushel. Although we are straying now, I

						Hon. Members
will know that the Government have sought to provide local authorities
with more freedom and flexibility to choose how they use their
resources so that they can best reflect local priorities. That approach
is both welcomed and supported by local government. I hope that all
hon. Members would agree that the Government have done a great deal to
improve the well-being of older and disabled people who are among the
most vulnerable in our society. I hope that the Committee will forgive
me for reinforcing the point that from April 2008 the Government will
be providing around &#163;1 billion of funding each year for
concessionary travel in England. It is a major public spending
commitment of which we are rightly proud. The extension from the local
to the national entitlement alone involves substantial new money of up
to &#163;250
million.</div>
					<a name="07060614000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The costs
associated with the amendments are significant. The money, of course,
will have to come from other areas. When Opposition Members seek
spending commitments, I urge them to consider the impact of

It is also about practicality, delivery and capacity, so I would put it
in that context.</div>
					<a name="07060614000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Report in another place, Lord Davies of Oldham provided the
Department&#146;s initial estimates of the annual cost of extending
the concession to companions of disabled people and to people with
mental disorder, as well as providing free travel on community
transport. Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 would provide free travel on
door-to-door transport. The cost of community transport alone was
estimated as at least &#163;25 million a year.</div>
					<a name="07060614000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 27
would provide free travel for companions of disabled people, at an
extra cost of some &#163;10 million a year. Amendments Nos. 10 and 12
would extend the national concession to people with a mental
impairment, at an extra cost of some &#163;50 million a
year.</div>
					<a name="07060614000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those costs are
purely indicative and could be much higher depending on the eligibility
definitions used, take-up, the extra concessionary travel generated,
the switch from other modes, travel behaviour and the amount of
additional capacity required. The existence of all those inter-related
factors makes estimates of the cost very difficult. We are not ruling
out extensions in the future, Mr. Bayley, although you will
understand why I am not in a position to make commitments now.
</div>
					<a name="07060614000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
I said to the hon. Member for Shipley, our concerns are not confined to
resources. The amendments also raise important practical and
administrative points. On the issue of free travel for companions, for
example, there would need to be a robust and fair system for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>assessing eligibility against whether a disabled person required the
assistance of a companion to travel on journeys on public transport
services. There could also be issues around fraud. Who would qualify as
an accompanying companion? Would it be a nominated person as specified
on the pass, or a considerate fellow
passenger?</div>
					<a name="07060614000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Providing
free travel on door-to-door transport for those people who cannot
access mainstream bus services, as suggested in amendments Nos. 28 and
29, again throws up a number of difficult and complex practical issues
that I urge the Committee to consider seriously. For example, how would
this ability to access be defined and assessed? Who would do the
assessing and what would the arrangements be for appealing against such
determinations? Could the community transport sector meet the extra
demand generated from such a change? How would that largely voluntary
sector regard the extra administrative burdens placed on it? What would
be the impact on existing rural bus
services?</div>
					<a name="07060614000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless we
have answers to those questions, via consultation with stakeholders and
the relevant experts&#151;in other words, those who are directly
affected and concerned&#151;the Government will not be able to accept
the amendments. To do so would risk unintended consequences and higher
costs to the
taxpayer.</div>

Bill is about providing for some 11 million people up and down
the country. I hope that the hon. Gentleman welcomes that and the fact
that the Bill also allows the flexibility for local arrangements to be

the mind and those with mental health problems who would be refused a

those with mental health difficulties are excluded.</div>

definition of disability, but this amendment would go way beyond the
original thrust of the Bill. By giving the reserve power to extend, we
would wander into the area of at least doubling the cost of the
Bill&#146;s provisions. There is already flexibility at local level,
as we have seen in London, for concessions to be given to those in
full-time education or those under 16. Even by giving the Secretary of
State the power to change matters by regulation later, we would extend
the principle of the Bill well beyond what we discussed earlier and,
secondly, the cost implications would require a substantive Bill in
itself. I am troubled by the

Merron:
						</b> Amendment No. 11 provides that the Secretary of
State may by order extend the national concession to people aged 17
years and under, and those in full-time education. As I said earlier,
the Transport Act 1985 provides local authorities with the discretion
to offer more than the statutory concession to their residents. Indeed,
many authorities already go further than the statutory minimum and
there is free travel for young people in a number of areas. There is no
reason why the costs of any discretionary enhancements should affect
the provision of statutory entitlement. The funding is separate.
Central Government are providing funding for the national concession,
whereas local extensions are to be decided and funded locally, in line
with an authority&#146;s overall financial priorities. However, in
terms of national extensions to the concession, hon. Members will be
pleased to hear that I am fully behind the principle of flexibility in
the Bill, giving the Secretary of State the power to respond to
changing circumstances in future. That provision runs through the Bill
and it already allows the Secretary of State to make the extensions
that hon. Members opposing the amendment
envisage.</div>

						Clause
8(1)(a) allows the Secretary of State, by order, to amend the Transport
Act 2000 and the Greater London Authority Act 1999 to extend the
national concession to other groups of people. The
particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>groups who can be added are set out in the Transport Act 1985. Those are
the same groups to whom local authorities can choose to offer
additional concessions using their existing discretionary powers.
Maintaining a consistent set of clearly defined groups of people helps
to avoid confusion about eligibility. I can confirm that the groups set
out in the 1985 Act currently include people aged 16 or under and
people aged 17 or 18 who are in full time education. In addition, the
Secretary of State may, by order, amend the 1985 Act in future to
include further groups of people, such as
students.</div>

for the national concession has been conservatively estimated at the
considerable sum of &#163;500 million plus a year. As with other
extensions, the actual cost could be much higher than the estimate,

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000396"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The amendment is fairly simple and helps to
clarify which standard should be used as and when</div>
					<a name="07060614000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a permit issued pursuant to
subsection (4)&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060614000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
issued in the form of a smartcard. The Minister has already accepted
that as and when it is technically possible&#151;perhaps at the start
of operation&#151;the permit issued for travel will be a smartcard.
Like most Committee members, we are grateful to her for circulating the
consultation documents about the shape and the look of the permit last
week.</div>
					<a name="07060614000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
has a number of advantages. In the Bill as it currently stands, there
is some ambiguity in the specification of the proposed national
smartcards. The Bill does not specify the form that the smartcard
should take. That would not be a problem were it not for the fact that
a national standard in smartcard technology already exists and is known
as the ITSO standard. Detailed specifications were published in 2004
under Crown copyright.</div>
					<a name="07060614000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my view, the lack of rigid
specification theoretically allows the Government to deviate from the
ITSO standard, which would be a senseless waste of the significant work
already completed in introducing the scheme. As the Minister has
already said, local authorities will continue to have input into the
development of the card
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07060614000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Government support the implementation of smartcards of this
specification and that they have been working to develop the scheme.
Therefore, formalising that intention is important to provide clarity
to the local authorities whose duty it will be to deliver that scheme
on the ground. That is the import of amendment No.
17.</div>
					<a name="07060614000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 18
goes to the heart of the concern of many organisations, local
authorities and transport authorities that not enough regard has been
given to fraud and fraud prevention. Permits that contain photographs
and security devices are important, and a first step. They will prevent
the casual, opportunist fraudster, but they will do little to deter
organised and illegal
use.</div>
					<a name="07060614000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concessions are
already in use in London. London authorities have worked hard to reduce
and to prevent fraudulent use. For example, Oyster card technology 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>allows a card that is reported lost or stolen to be switched off
immediately. The amendment aims to enable travel concession authorities
across the country to prevent
fraud.</div>
					<a name="07060614000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
would be required to specify that a national database of cards be set
up and maintained. The ITSO technology would then allow lost or stolen
cards to be disabled. Unless that happens, there is no way of knowing
whether the cards that are being used are stolen or fakes. Given the
extension of the scheme, the potential for fraudulent use beyond the
locality of a principal or sole residence is massively increased. The
only way to prevent such fraudulent usage is the maintenance of a
national database and a current hot list of lost and stolen
cards.</div>
					<a name="07060614000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
national list to be effective, each travel concession area must provide
information, which would be protected by the Data Protection Act 1998
and only used on a need-to-know and access basis. It therefore follows
that each travel concession area would be required to maintain and
supply a list of basic details. The cost of that would be minimal, if
anything, as all the information will be necessary and will have to be
offered as proof of eligibility for the concessionary travel
permit.</div>
					<a name="07060614000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">London
councils have raised a particular concern with regard to fraud. The
freedom pass is used in conjunction with a separate photo identity
card. Most of those are issued at post offices, which is popular and
convenient for the elderly. However, the new national standard permit
will contain an embossed photograph, which means that the post office
will no longer be able to issue it. Application forms will have to be
sent away. Not only will that increase costs, but it will increase the
chance of fraudulent use and application. Amendment No. 18 would
require the Minister to consider fraudulent applications and use, and
to specify arrangements for prevention by travel concession
authorities. The cost indications are minimal, yet the protection
offered to the public and the concession authorities would be
substantial.</div>

							<a name="07060614000397"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I support the amendments tabled by the hon.
Gentleman, particularly amendments Nos. 17 and 18. I want to speak
about amendment No. 33, which is tabled in my name. Local authorities
and passenger transport authorities operate a variety of schemes, and
if we have a national scheme it is important that we have a common
technology and a common modus operandi. Specifying the ITSO standard in
the Bill is, in our view, an important step in ensuring that we have a
genuinely national scheme.</div>
					<a name="07060614000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 18 deals with
fraud prevention. Like the hon. Gentleman, I believe that the
Government&#146;s proposal of an embossed photograph will not be
convenient for elderly people. Although it is not ITSO compliant, the
scheme as it operates in London at the moment is an excellent example
of a scheme that is convenient to use but has a database that enables
fraud to be reduced. The fact that the photo ID can be obtained at a
post office is convenient for many people. The scheme that the
Government propose would not enable that to happen, as the application
would have to be sent away and people would have to wait. The Oyster
card can be obtained at a variety of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>local outlets and because the database is a national one, if the Oyster
card is stolen, it can be switched off and cannot be used.</div>
					<a name="07060614000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">In moving forward, we need some
common agreed standards. There needs to be a national database to
ensure that cards issued in one area cannot be used elsewhere if they
are stolen. An ITSO standard, a national database and ensuring that the
relevant authorities work together will allow us to ensure that that
happens.</div>
					<a name="07060614000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
deals in particular with the effect in London. Although the Government
have agreed that people can continue to use their existing cards in
London until 2010, that is merely moving the problem forward. The
machines that are used by Transport for London are not ITSO compliant.
They will all have to be replaced and a new system will have to be put
in place. Clearly, there is an additional cost in that. Amendment No.
33 would make the Government sit down with Transport for London and the
London boroughs to agree a way forward to ensure that the London
scheme, which is better than that which operates elsewhere in the
country, is ITSO compliant and that the additional costs are not all
borne by Transport for London or the London boroughs. That is
important, and we need to ensure that the excellent scheme that
operates in London continues. However, there is a way forward that is
agreed by discussion, so I hope that the Minister will support the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000398"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b> This group of amendments is linked to the issuing
of passes. It deals with three specific issues: requiring that all
passes are ITSO smartcards; specifying arrangements for fraud
prevention, and ensuring adequate funding for London to issue passes. I
will deal with each amendment in turn to ensure that I address fully
the separate but interrelated issues that they raise.</div>
					<a name="07060614000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, amendment No. 17
recommends that we should make the pass an ITSO-compliant smartcard.
This is not the first time that such an amendment has been debated.
Speaking on behalf of the Government, Lord Davies addressed the point
on several occasions in the other place. It is difficult to see how we
can state more clearly the fact that although we absolutely agree with
the intention of the amendment, which is to encourage the increase of
smart ticketing, we fundamentally disagree that putting an obligation
in the Bill is the practical or sensible way to achieve what we all
agree would be a desired outcome.</div>
					
					<a name="07060614000318"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07060614000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have stated
many times our commitment to smart ticketing and to the ITSO
specification, which we see as vital to ensuring the interoperability
of smartcards throughout the country. We recently published a
consultation document, to which the hon. Member for Wimbledon referred
and which Committee members were in receipt of last week, that clearly
sets out that our preferred option for the specification of passes is
for them to be ITSO-compliant smartcards. However, it is wholly
unnecessary to have such a requirement in the Bill. Proposed new
section 145A(5) of the Transport Act 2000 provides for the
specification of the permit in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>regulations. As I have already indicated, our preferred option is to use
that power to specify that passes will be ITSO-compliant
smartcards.</div>
					<a name="07060614000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Primary
legislation is an inappropriate place to address such technical issues.
Regulations are the appropriate place to deal with such matters, and
that is where we intend to deal with them. There are still practical
and technical matters that need to be fully considered before we can
specify the necessary requirements. Furthermore, we must consider the
implications of specifying the requirements of the passes in primary
legislation. Even the most minor of changes, such as the change of the
name ITSO, would require amendments to primary legislation. I am sure
that that cannot be the intention of the hon. Member for
Wimbledon.</div>
					<a name="07060614000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 18 proposes that the Secretary of State be required to specify in
regulations arrangements for fraud prevention. Again, I cannot agree
with that suggestion. Fraud prevention is, without any doubt, an
important part of a workable scheme. We also believe that smart
ticketing will do much to prevent fraud, as we have already seen in
those areas where it has been implemented. Issuing smartcards already
requires the creation of a database containing details of cards that
have been issued to concessionaires. Smart ticketing brings with it the
ability to deactivate cards reported as lost or stolen. A lot of
technical work is being undertaken to lay the foundations for
interoperable smart ticketing in England, and indeed the UK generally.
An effective method of hot-listing lost and stolen cards is an
important part of that work.</div>
					<a name="07060614000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the national concession
will continue to be administered at a local level from April 2008, the
most effective solution to fraud lies in ensuring effective
communication at a local level, rather than introducing another
national level of bureaucracy, which will further complicate matters.
The issue of how to combat fraud effectively is one that we visited
many times during the development of our proposals. The concessionary
fares working group and the operations and technology sub-group, both
of which contain representatives of travel concession authorities and
operators, have debated at considerable length the most effective fraud
prevention measures, including in areas that will not have smart
ticketing from April 2008. The matter is also covered in our
consultation document.</div>
					<a name="07060614000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Travel concession authorities
and operators clearly share our strong motivation to minimise fraud,
since fraudulent travel has serious financial implications for both
parties, as well as for the Government. We therefore do not believe
that it is necessary or desirable to specify fraud reduction
arrangements in regulations; rather, practical, workable solutions
should be developed by those who are best placed to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07060614000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 33
appears to be intended to ensure that London authorities receive the
funding necessary to issue cards to the national specification, and to
ensure that they can be used as smartcards on London buses. Although
the amendment as drafted relates to the provisions dealing with the
reserve free travel scheme, I assume that it is intended to apply
generally, and not just in those circumstances. Again, I understand the
motivation for such an amendment, but can assure hon. Members that it
is entirely unnecessary. The Secretary of State already has the power,
and has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>stated his intention, to make appropriate payments to ensure that passes
in London&#151;indeed, in all of England&#151;meet the national
standard.</div>
					<a name="07060614000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have continually stated their commitment to funding new
burdens that are imposed on local authorities&#151;I am happy to
restate that commitment. We recognise that the issuing of passes to a
national standard represents a new burden and have repeatedly stated
that it is our intention to pay a grant to cover all reasonable new
cost burdens associated with the issuing of passes. The power to pay
such a grant exists under section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003.
As I have said, and as is set out in the recent consultation paper that
is available to all Committee members, we recognise the unique
situation of London and have taken account of that in our
planning.</div>
					<a name="07060614000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
neither cost-effective nor practical to require London to issue
ITSO-compliant smartcards forApril 2008. That is why we are
proposing that existing freedom passes will be re-stickered with the
national logo for April 2008, so that bus drivers throughout England
will recognise a Londoner&#146;s entitlement to concessionary bus
travel.</div>
					<a name="07060614000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Our
proposals state that concessionary travel passes in London must meet
the national standards fromApril 2010. However, we recognise
that issuing cards to the national standard in 2010 will represent a
new burden to London and we have stated that we fully intend to pay a
grant to cover it. We also fully realise the need for a migration
strategy for London. The intention of specifying that passes must be
ITSO-compliant smartcards is to lay the foundations for interoperable
smart ticketing for all of England and, ultimately, the UK. London is,
of course, a vital part of
that.</div>
					<a name="07060614000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To
reassure hon. Members, in May 2006, the Mayor of London and the
Secretary of State for Transport agreed that the Oyster network would
be made interoperable with ITSO smartcards. A technical solution to
achieve that is under development. We are involved in a continuing
dialogue with London councils and the Local Government Association to
determine the nature of the new burdens that will be borne by London
and the most appropriate basis on which to pay the grant. The way in
which the amendment is drafted suggests that the Secretary of State
would make such payments only under the reserve free travel scheme. I
assure the Committee that we intend to pay a grant to cover
London&#146;s new burdens whether or not the free travel scheme is in
operation.</div>
					<a name="07060614000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
I trust that I have demonstrated clearly that the amendments, despite
being tabled with the best of intentions, would not achieve their aims
of promoting the spread of smart ticketing or of ensuring that a
workable system is in place for April 2008. On that basis, I hope that
hon. Members will not press the amendments to a
Division.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
reassurance, particularly on amendment No. 18 and the discussions that
are taking place about fraud prevention. On amendment No. 17, Ministers
often say that regulations are the most appropriate method of dealing
with things. Far too often, Ministers do not want to include things in
Bills, but I accept her contention that were the amendment to be
accepted, it might require primary legislation if the name of ITSO 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>were changed. Although, if I am lucky, I may bring it back on Report, on
that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<a name="07060614000400"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I do not propose to detain the Committee for
long, particularly as we have had a chance to debate in detail a number
of aspects of the clause. The substance of the clause provides for any
qualifying England-resident pass-holder to receive concessionary travel
on an eligible journey on an eligible service. We have gone into some
depth about eligibility and who would qualify.</div>
					<a name="07060614000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, subsection (8) allows
the Secretary of State to issue guidance about what constitutes sole or
principal residence, and it is intended to provide a consistent
approach. The guidance will be issued should the Secretary of State so
desire. Surely the Secretary of State should issue the guidance before
the enactment of the Bill if the consistency that is explained in the
explanatory notes is to be achieved. For instance, if an elderly person
has two residences in a town and a coastal resort, which is the
principal residence? Under previous council tax regulations, it might
have been clearer, but will it be the capital gains tax principal
residence, where they spend most time, or where they have their driving
licence or passport registered? All may be different.</div>
					<a name="07060614000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4) includes the
phrase,</div>
					<a name="07060614000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appears to the

authority&#146;s area&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07060614000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">which, again, is ambiguous and open to
interpretation. Will the Minister clarify the Secretary of
State&#146;s intentions? If she cannot reassure us today, perhaps we
can return to the issue on Report.</div>

Merron:
						</b> I am glad to speak to this clause stand part
debate. Under section 145 of the Transport Act 2000, an eligible person
is restricted to free off-peak local bus travel within their local
authority area. The clause changes the provisions affecting England and
enables eligible England residents on production of a travel concession
permit to travel free on off-peak local bus services on journeys
beginning anywhere in England other than on the London bus network. The
national concession is secured on journeys beginning on the London bus
network under changes that clause 6 makes to the Greater London
Authority Act 1999.</div>
					<a name="07060614000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
now, people aged 60 and over and disabled people will be eligible. The
definition of travel concession permit now includes passes issued to
eligible London residents, so that for the first time Londoners will be
able to benefit from the concession outside London. I am sure that hon.
Members who represent constituencies outside London will look forward
to welcoming Londoners who use their bus travel passes.</div>
					<a name="07060614000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition of
&#147;eligible journey&#148; in new section 145A(2) of the 2000 Act
will mean that operators of eligible services within London but not
beginning on the London bus network&#151;that is, eligible London
permit services&#151;must for the first time offer the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>concession. Currently, operators of those services are not required to
offer any concession, although some may do so
voluntarily.</div>
					<a name="07060614000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Hon.
Members will be aware that a travel concession authority must issue
permits to elderly and disabled people &#147;residing&#148; in its
area, which is a point that the hon. Member for Wimbledon raised. New
section 145A(4) secures the provision that a travel concession
authority outside London must issue permits to elderly and disabled
people whose &#147;sole or principal residence&#148; is in its
area. I can confirm to him that following consultation with local
authorities, we fully intend to offer guidance to assist local
authorities in that regard.</div>
					<a name="07060614000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change is made to promote a
more consistent approach to pass issuing throughout the country. New
section 145A(5) secures a power for the Secretary of State to make
regulations about what a permit issued outside London will look like.
The provision is again to ensure that the appearance of cards
throughout the country can be standardised in an agreed form that bus
drivers easily
recognise.</div>
					<a name="07060614000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulations
can also be used to require the introduction of smartcards. The
provision mirrors a power in relation to passes issued to London
residents under the Greater London Authority Act 1999. The provisions
of section 145 of the Transport Act 2000, relating to Wales, have been
restated as newsection 145B, which is referenced in schedule 2
to the Bill.</div>

						As before, a
person can give up the national concession in exchange for other

						</b> The purpose of clause 2 is to amend the
definition of the travel concession authority as defined by section 146
of the Transport Act 2000. Currently, the definition includes
non-metropolitan district councils, county councils and passenger
transport executives, but the clause will extend it to the London
authority and the Isles of Scilly. So far, so good. However, there are
no eligible services on the Isles of Scilly. The intent behind the
clause is that eligible residents of the Isles of Scilly could access
eligible services on the United Kingdom
mainland.</div>

two questions for the Minister. There are no eligible services on the

desirable, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>residents need to get to the mainland. As we explored
in our discussions on the previous clause, what is
the rationale behind excluding from the Bill services that allow access

Rowen:
						</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the
clause and to ask the Minister about the paragraph concerning the Isles
of Scilly. I am sure that she is aware that under equivalent
legislation operating in Scotland, if someone is travelling from, say,
the Shetland Isles to the mainland, the ferry journey is eligible,
which allows them to access bus journeys on the mainland. The Bill does
not provide for a similar extension of services for residents of, for
example, the Isles of Scilly, where there are no bus services. Clearly,
they cannot use their concessionary bus passes on the ferry. I hope
that she accepts that a concession similar to that granted in Scotland,
under which people can use ferries to get to buses, might offer a
welcome extension for residents of places such as the Isles of
Scilly.</div>

services on the Isles of Scilly, the addition, in subsection (3), of
the Council of the Isles of Scilly as a travel concession authority
will require the council to issue passes to their residents for use on
the mainland, under new section 145A(4). That will ensure that elderly
and disabled residents of the Isles of Scilly can, on production of
their passes, like everybody else, travel for free on off-peak local
bus services anywhere in England. The Council of the Isles of Scilly is
at liberty to make arrangements with a mainland council, such as
Cornwall county council, to issue passes to residents on its behalf. It
might be worth pointing out that we will deal with issues concerning
the Isles of Scilly when we come on to amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 and

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000407"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in
clause 3, page 3, line 25, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) Two years
after the commencement of this Act the Secretary of State shall conduct
a review into the reimbursement of operators by travel concession
authorities and shall lay before Parliament a report setting out his
findings.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07060614000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is in our opinion another entirely sensible one. It is far
from clear that operators will receive the correct reimbursement. The
experience of the 2006 concessionary scheme has shown considerable
disagreement arising in a number of areas between local authorities and
bus operators about the level of reimbursement for carrying
concessionary fares. The Government have stipulated that reimbursement
should be on a no better off, no worse off basis. Yet there is some
dispute about what exactly that should mean. The Transport and General
Workers Union, for instance, has already said that it thinks that the
concessionary scheme has provided a source of subsidy for already
profitable bus operators. However, the 60-odd appeals by operators to
the Secretary of State over the reimbursement arrangements would
suggest otherwise.</div>
					<a name="07060614000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is, of course, from the very profits that bus operators make that
reinvestment is made in new upgraded vehicles. The evidence for that is
clearly that the average age of buses on the street has fallen by more
than a third since deregulation. Several bus companies claim that the
compensation that they receive from the travel authorities for
operating concessionary fare schemes does not cover the full operating
cost, and takes no account of depreciation or capital costs. They
argue, further, that in all too many cases their recompense is given,
not negotiated. Hence the appeal procedure.</div>
					<a name="07060614000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reimbursement on a no better
off, no worse off basis is in reality an extremely difficult balance to
achieve. After all, the marginal cost to an operator of carrying a few
extra passengers is virtually nil. One could almost make a case for
saying that for carrying one extra passenger on a concessionary fare,
the operator would need no reimbursement. However, when, as is likely
under the Bill, numbers are likely to reach the point at which extra
vehicles must be bought and extra drivers hired, the cost becomes
considerable. At that point, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>
						should not the authority be responsible for not only
the operating costs but the extra capital
costs?</div>
					<a name="07060614000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">A review of the
systems put in place by travel concession authorities after two years
of operation would allow the Government to establish whether costs were
being borne fairly between authorities and operators. That would
further enable the Government to establish best practice and to advise
travel concession authorities on how to improve efficiency and to
achieve savings. It would allow the Government to re-examine the no
better off, no worse off approach, to consider the capital costs
element, and to ensure that operators apply best practice in their
delivery of their service to the concessionary passenger. It would also
allow an examination of procedures, and reassessment of the
concessionary fare reimbursement levels.</div>
					<a name="07060614000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2008 scheme will involve
many variables and unknowns. There is unlikely to be a perfect forecast
of the levels of reimbursement necessary to operators. Therefore, a
review after two years of operation is not only desirable, but
essential if the Bill is to be seen as fair and equitable to both
providers and operators.</div>
					
					<a name="07060614000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000408"></a>Mr.
Leech:
						</b> We are happy to support the amendment. It is vital
to ensure that the system of payments to operators works effectively.
The added complication of widening it to a national scheme will no
doubt make it more complicated. Ultimately, we want to see the swift
implementation of a smartcard system that allows direct payments to
operators, so that no local authority is better or worse off under the
payments scheme.</div>
					<a name="07060614000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we reach the next amendment, I am sure that the hon. Member for Tyne
Bridge will explain how the existing scheme has caused Tyne and Wear
PTA serious trouble. We therefore need a review after two years, but we
also need to look at a smartcard system in the longer term to ensure
that payments for every single journey go directly to the
operators.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000409"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The amendment proposes that, two years
after the commencement of the Act, a review be carried out of the
reimbursement of operators by local authorities. Of course, I accept
the principle that policies should be properly evaluated, and we will
naturally review how the national bus concession is working after
implementation in April 2008. However, the amendment looks at just one
particular aspect and is not
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07060614000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
is already a procedure in place by which operators can appeal to the
Secretary of State if they consider that they are being unfairly
reimbursed for carrying concessionaires. Any formal review of
reimbursement arrangements would conclude that a wide variety of such
arrangements was in place, and that would reflect the different
discretionary concessions and local circumstances around the country. I
therefore see no real need for the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07060614000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
existing arrangements, authorities must balance their desire to secure
value for money from their dealings with operators against the risk of
appeal should their arrangements leave operators worse off. Although
there is inevitable variety in the way in which those principles are
applied, they remain the most appropriate and fair. Indeed, we have
already set up a reimbursement task group involving local authorities
and bus operators to look at improving the existing process.</div>

						</b> As a former Government Whip and a loyal

under the Bill, so I make no apologies for taking a little time to
refer to them and to suggest some possible solutions.</div>
					<a name="07060614000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the time of the
Chancellor&#146;s announcement of free off-peak bus travel after 9.30
am for pensioners and disabled people on local buses only, Tyne and
Wear had a half-price travel system for pensioners and disabled people
on buses to a maximum of 50p after 9 am; a 50p fare on Tyne
and Wear Metro, the Tyne ferry and Northern Rail, and concessions for
children and students. It was a popular and well used system. Indeed,
the concessionary travel take-up by the elderly alone amounted to some
75 per cent. of eligible riders. It is the largest outside of London,
which is 80 per cent. and way above the average in England of 49 per
cent.</div>

					<a name="07060614000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000421"></a>Mr.
Clelland:
						</b> Yes, indeed, and the welcome new move forward
will have a similar effect on ridership. Some 36 million bus journeys a
year are subsidised under the current scheme in Tyne and Wear. It was
estimated after the Chancellor&#146;s announcement that the
additional cost to the Tyne and Wear passenger 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>transport executive of free local travel would be &#163;20
million a year. The Minister said that the Bill applies only to buses
and not to other modes of transport, but matters are not quite that
simple.</div>
					<a name="07060614000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Tyne and
Wear, we have the publicly owned and run Metro system. At the time, it
had a charge of 50p to the eligible concessionary travellers.
If we had left it as it was, it would have meant that buses would be
free, but that it would cost 50p to travel on the Metro. That would
have had two effects: first, it would be unfair to those who rely
heavily on the Metro to travel from the east end of Newcastle into the
centre. They would have had to pay, as opposed to people in the west
end of Newcastle where there is no Metro who would have had free bus
services. That could not be
tolerated.</div>
					<a name="07060614000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
such a system would have had a detrimental effect on the Metro itself.
If there were a charge to travel on the Metro, but buses were free,
people would obviously be tempted to move their mode of travel from the
Metro to buses. Bus operators would be tempted to compete with the
Metro, and they would be receiving the benefit of the additional public
subsidy, while the Metro system would suffer from the loss of
ridership, something that a Labour Government would not want to
encourage.</div>
					<a name="07060614000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 28
November 2005, my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and
Kensington, North (Ms Buck), then a Minister at the Department for
Transport, wrote to hon. Members saying
that</div>
					<a name="07060614000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we are providing an
extra &#163;350
million&#148;</div>
					<a name="07060614000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">to finance the
scheme. &#147;We&#148; was used rather riskily because it was not
the Department for Transport that was providing the money. The
Government were providing the money through what was then the Office of
the Deputy Prime Minister, which we now know as the Department for
Communities and Local Government. It was to be distributed through the
revenue support grant
mechanism.</div>
					<a name="07060614000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">By the way,
there was no attempt at the time by the Department for Transport to
negotiate anything in return from bus operators who were already
receiving &#163;1.3 billion a year in public subsidy. The local
government revenue support grant system is not fit for the purpose of
distributing the money. Calculations on the basis of population are
okay for most services, but not for the particular service that we are
discussing. It does not take account of the high levels of use, low car
ownership and higher dependency on public transport in areas such as
Tyne and Wear.</div>
					<a name="07060614000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tyne
and Wear was told to expect &#163;12.7 million from the formula grant
system, which was &#163;7.3 million short of the estimated cost of
introducing the new scheme. Meetings with Ministers and civil servants
were to no avail and we were told that it was impossible to correct
that anomaly through the revenue support grant system. I thought that
that was a rather curious argument because the education system already
has a system for financing schools on the basis of bums on seats. I
still do not know why we cannot have such a system for public
transport. The result was that in 2006-07, &#163;2 million had to be
taken from Tyne and Wear passenger transport authority balances. There
were cuts in secured bus services, which was rather bizarre as it meant
that we were saying to elderly and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>disabled people, &#147;There is a new free travel scheme, but the
services on which you most rely&#151;the subsidised, secured
services&#151;will have to be withdrawn in order to pay for
it&#148;. There were cuts in subsidies for students and young people,
which was unpopular with elderly people, who felt that they did not
want the advantage of free travel if it was at the cost of cutting
travel for young people and students. Indeed, some elderly people
feared that when they travelled on buses there may be some backlash
from young people as a result. Thankfully, our young people are more
sensible and that has not happened.</div>
					<a name="07060614000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the situation in
2006-07. During 2007-08 there will need to be further adjustments to
continue the current scheme. In total, by the time we get the national
scheme in 2008, it will have cost Tyne and Wear&#151;one of the
poorest regions in the country&#151;some &#163;9 million to run the
Government scheme up to the introduction of the national
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07060614000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was one of
the first people to call for a national scheme. Indeed, days after the
Chancellor&#146;s announcement, I suggested to him that the scheme
should be extended nationally because the way it was being proposed at
the time was nonsense. I welcome the increased flexibility, but, if the
same formula for distribution is to be employed, which the Bill
suggests is the case, the funding problems will remain. I still have
not given up hope that some way will be found to refund Tyne and Wear
the &#163;9 million that it has lost over the past two
years.</div>

						</b> Thank you, Mr. Bayley, for that
guidance. I was just about to come on to the amendments. However, I
will just say that, unless the &#163;9 million is refunded,
when the national scheme to which the amendments refer starts next
year, Tyne and Wear will be starting not from a level playing field,
but from a &#163;9 million shortfall.</div>
					<a name="07060614000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I understand
that in Scotland and Wales the system of funding for subsidised travel
is not through local authorities, but directly from the Executive.
Amendment No.20 proposes a similar system for England. It is a specific
measure and the funding would be directly targeted to where it is
intended, so that the full costs to the transport authorities are met.
Under the current system, it is nonsense that some councils can have a
surplus from the funding and use that for purposes for which it was not
intended while other authorities, such as Tyne and Wear, have serious
shortfalls. Amendment No. 20 would deal with that
anomaly.</div>
					<a name="07060614000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the event
that shortfalls do occur in future, amendment No.6 would limit the
damage to local authorities. I admit that the figure of &#163;500,000
is somewhat arbitrary and I accept that I would not get away with an
amendment that said that every single penny had to be accounted for;
that just would not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>possible. However, &#163;500,000 seems to be a reasonable figure. If
such a measure had been enacted from the beginning, Tyne and
Wear&#146;s losses would have been &#163;500,000 and not the
&#163;7.3 million which we had to subsidise, which would have been
far more manageable. The introduction of the national scheme is
welcome, but it will result in an increased take-up and a change in
passenger and operator behaviour that cannot be predicted. It will mean
higher costs, particularly in areas where public transport is already
heavily used and where increased usage is being encouraged.</div>
					<a name="07060614000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
accept that those two amendments are sensible and practical and that
she agrees that they should be incorporated into the Bill. This is a
Government initiative and it should be underwritten by the Government
in case of any losses for the local authorities
concerned.</div>

							<a name="07060614000424"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I listened with great interest to the hon.
Gentleman. I wish to speak to new clauses 4 and 5. New clause 4 deals
with the review of funding allocation arrangements, and new clause 5
seeks to have an annual statement of funding, and the method of
funding, laid before Parliament. The new clauses go to the heart of
what the hon. Gentleman just said, and it is important to address them
in conjunction.</div>
					<a name="07060614000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions deal in different ways with the funding for the scheme,
which is giving concern to local authorities. There are two aspects to
funding: whether enough money will be available&#151;that is, whether
the quantum sum provided will be sufficient to cover the
cost&#151;and the mechanisms by which funding will be given to local
transport concession authorities and thereafter to operators, and
whether the mechanisms will be seen to be
equitable.</div>
					<a name="07060614000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
5 deals with the broad aspect of funding&#151;the quantum sum
available&#151;and how the monies will be made available. The
question of whether the sum provided for the scheme will be large
enough to cover costs goes to the heart of the scheme. If it is not,
the scheme cannot
proceed.</div>
					<a name="07060614000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The annual
statement is key. The Government have provided initial funding for
other schemes but then after a period not provided the year-on-year
increases to ensure that local authorities are properly compensated. It
is likely that demand will increase under the scheme. When the local
concessionary fare scheme was introduced last year, demand increased
substantially. In fact, it would be fairly ridiculous if it did not.
One of the reasons for providing such schemes is to facilitate access
to transport. If demand did not rise, access would not be facilitated
and the whole intent of the Bill would be lost. We have clear evidence
that take-up is increasing, and that those who take up the scheme use
the pass more
frequently.</div>
					<a name="07060614000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is the issue of cost increases to the bus industry. They have
consistently outstripped general inflation. Bus fares are rising above
the retail prices index, and industry costs have risen some 7 to 9 per
cent. per annum over the past three years. That is due not only to fuel
costs but in part to extra costs imposed by the EU and by health and
safety regulations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>
					<a name="07060614000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The need for a statement on the
method of delivery of funds is also key. The proposed scheme has
ramifications for the method of delivery in all areas. In some specific
cases, extra provision needs to be made. The proposed system for
reimbursement is via the local authority block grant to district and
unitary councils. The first problem is that those councils are not in
all cases the travel authority. There is no requirement or guarantee
that the district or unitary authorities will pass on the sums that
they receive to the travel authority. Secondly, the block grant is a
relatively crude instrument. It cannot measure and therefore be
responsive to the key thing in the Bill: the number of journeys
made.</div>
					<a name="07060614000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
danger that in areas where high-quality, improving services for
concessionary bus travel are well promoted, demand will increase much
faster and the authorities could be penalised financially. If that were
to happen, local authorities would have only two mechanisms for dealing
with a shortfall in funding: they could raise council tax or cut local
services.</div>
					<a name="07060614000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition made it clear on Second Reading that there is considerable
scope for some authorities in so-called hot-spot or honey-pot areas to
find themselves heavily out-of-pocket. The funding for the 2006 scheme
was shown to be insufficient even when based on relatively static
residents over-60 figures. As nationwide eligibility for over-60s is
being established in the Bill, the potential for error and for a
shortfall in funding to some authorities will be hugely
exacerbated.</div>
					<a name="07060614000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 5 would oblige the Secretary of State to make an annual
statement to Parliament on the total sum of central Government funds
made available to local authorities in the previous financial year for
the provision of bus services, and the funding of concessions on those
services. Moreover, it would oblige him to set out the method by which
such funds were made available. That approach has two major advantages.
First, it would highlight the continuation of the Government&#146;s
tendency to take credit for their policies while passing some, or
indeed a substantial amount, of the cost on to local authorities. Given
that the doubling of council tax in the past 10 years has hit the
elderly and those on low incomes hardest, it is an issue that should
concern us all. As my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris
Grayling) said on Second
Reading:</div>
					<a name="07060614000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no point in giving our pensioners free bus travel if they just have
to pay the bills through their council tax
instead.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 14 May 2007; Vol. 460,
c. 414.]</div>
					<a name="07060614000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The annual
statement to Parliament would allow local authorities to demonstrate
the degree to which the Government are actually providing free bus
travel, and the degree to which the Government was making the
authorities pay. In short, the new clause would create accountability
on whether the Government are providing enough. The Government cannot
will the end if they do not will the means. Under the new clause,
accountability would be clear.</div>
					<a name="07060614000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second benefit of the new
clause is that it would throw some light on the calculations that have
resulted in Ministers often telling us that total funding for the
implementation of the Bill will be &#163;1 billion. The 2006 scheme
was afforded &#163;350 million of Government money; the 2008 scheme
will be afforded an extra &#163;250 million. The other
&#163;400 million to which the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>Government refer in its calculation of &#163;1 billion must be and is
being provided in myriad guises. Some of those guises such as the bus
service operator grant, the rural bus subsidy grant and the block
grant, the problems of which I have already explained, are difficult to
nail
down.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07060614000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07060614000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order that
we can be certain that Ministers are being as generous as they
claim&#151;I am sure that they are&#151;it is vital that they set
out exactly how the sums that they talk about are being distributed.
New clause 5 would ensure Government accountability for their actions.
Will the Government&#146;s proposed &#163;250 million extra in the
first year be enough for the scheme? Will the Government provide enough
total funding in successive years, and will they deliver the funds to
those who are actually providing the services? New clause 5 is sensible
and necessary.</div>
					<a name="07060614000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 asks for a review of the arrangements for allocating funds
necessary for the reimbursement of operators to local authorities. In
Lords Committee, the overwhelming view expressed was that of unease.
There was also substantial unease among local authorities because of
the experience of the previous scheme, and they expected that there
would not be enough money for the 2008 scheme and that the money would
not be properly targeted to the correct authorities. The new clause
deals with that latter aspect of the matter. It would allow for a
review of the funding allocation arrangements two years after the
commencement of the 2008
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07060614000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will take
some time for the true extent of the take-up and cost of concessionary
fares to become apparent. It is certain that in the transition and
initial take-up period, some authorities will be underfunded. The
review would go hand in hand with the annual financial statement
established by new clause 5, and it would provide the basis for
authorities to appeal against their funding
allocation.</div>
					<a name="07060614000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government may say that the Bill amends section 149 of the Transport
Act 2000 to require transport concession authorities to reimburse
operators for providing the national concession or for journeys
starting in their areas, and that the current legislation requires the
operators to be no worse and no better off for carrying
concessionaires. It is still not clear, however, that that will be able
to take account of hot spots, where journeys start, which exact
journeys are the responsibility of particular local authorities and how
local authorities will seek compensation from one
another.</div>
					<a name="07060614000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the other
place, Lord Davies stated:</div>
					<a name="07060614000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are confident in
broad terms that the &#163;1 billion that
we</div>

					<a name="07060614000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will be sufficient to meet all
demands&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 8
January 2007; Vol. 688, c.
GC25.]</div>
					<a name="07060614000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Funding needs
to follow the passenger, and the Government have not yet made it clear
exactly how that will happen. The new clauses would provide the
mechanism by which to ensure that it is clear that funding is following
the passenger and how the allocation of the funding is working. If the
Minister shares the confidence of her colleague Lord Davies, she can
show that by accepting the new clauses. The clauses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>are of such importance that although I will listen carefully to the
Minister, I intend to press the matter to a
Division.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000425"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> As the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge stated earlier,
the introduction of the local concessionary bus scheme had a number of
unintended results, although some hon. Members warned the Government at
the time about what was likely to happen. The use of the block grant
and/or the revenue support grant as a mechanism for funding is, as
anybody who has been involved in local government will know, a
notoriously unreliable and inaccurate means of funding local government
for the services that it
provides.</div>
					<a name="07060614000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Tyne Bridge spoke about a shortfall of &#163;9 million
that affected Tyne and Wear. The London boroughs have estimated that
the actual cost to them of the basic concessionary travel scheme was
&#163;100 million, yet they received only &#163;53 million.
Clearly, there is a huge shortfall. As the hon. Gentleman said, such a
shortfall can only be met by increasing council tax or cutting services
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="07060614000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">All hon.
Members support concessionary bus fares, but we want to ensure that the
scheme, when operating, delivers what it is said that it will deliver.
Anybody using concessionary buses should able to do so without
affecting other services. It is clear that where huge numbers of people
are travelling to a tourist destination&#151;London, for example, or
Blackpool, Scarborough or York&#151;the revenue support grant, which
calculates the number of people in the local authority area, is not the
best means of delivering a fair recompense for the additional
costs.</div>
					<a name="07060614000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If
we are to have confidence in the operation of the Bill, full costs have
to be reimbursed. I do not wish to see a nationally administered
scheme, as has happened in Scotland. The local authorities&#151;the
passenger transport authorities&#151;should continue to have
discretion to provide additional services or concessions that would not
be available under the national scheme. However, the basic scheme must
provide full compensation. New clause 2, which is similar to the
amendment moved by the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge, ensures that full
costs are reimbursed. It will ensure that all the local authorities
introducing measures under the Bill can do so while ensuring that other
vital services will not be
compromised.</div>
					<a name="07060614000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 also deals with capital costs, which we discussed earlier. The
Minister has reassured us, with regard to London, that she will provide
a grant to meet the additional capital costs of replacing the Oyster
card and the freedom pass for London. We do not know what the total
capital cost of introducing the scheme throughout the country will be.
The new clause would ensure that there is a contingency scheme, making
sure that local authorities and passenger transport authorities can bid
into that concession for the costs that they have incurred. I hope that
the Minister can provide some reassurance about those issues, because
although we know that there will be increased usage, we cannot predict
what it will be. We need to ensure that local authorities, and
particularly those where there are tourist destinations, are fully
recompensed for the costs that they
incur.</div>
					<a name="07060614000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, I asked the Secretary of State whether he would be willing to
meet a cross-party 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>group of local authorities affected by this scheme. There is huge
concern about what the additional cost will be in, for example, London
and Blackpool, because there are no figures on how many 60-year-olds
visit those destinations. I therefore fail to see how the Minister can
give an assurance that the full costs of the scheme will be reimbursed
to the local authorities affected. That can be done retrospectively, by
putting a commitment in the Bill to reimburse the full costs. Relying
on the block grant will once again ensure that there are winners and
losers, and I suspect that this time round there might be more winners
than losers.</div>

							<a name="07060614000426"></a>Tom
Levitt:
						</b> I am grateful to you for calling me,
Mr. Bayley. The county council in Derbyshire has implemented
the existing scheme to a greater extent than required by its minimum
legal responsibility, in that the scheme is available during the
evening rush hour as well as throughout the rest of the day
from 9.30 am onwards. However, we have experienced a problem
recently, which I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will address, about
the way in which the bus companies are claiming back money from the
local authority. That has meant that the half-price scheme, which
previously ran before 9.30 am, can no longer be operated. It appears to
many that the bus companies have, in effect, put a stranglehold on the
local authority, by insisting on a greater level of payment&#151;a
couple of million pounds is being talked about&#151;in order to
continue to provide the above-minimum scheme upon which Derbyshire has
embarked.</div>
					<a name="07060614000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
question, which relates to the reimbursement of operators, is this: can
we make absolutely clear the basis on which the reimbursement takes
place in order not to have bus companies making extreme or exorbitant
demands on local authorities? In the Derbyshire case, those demands
have resulted in a lessening of the service that was previously
available, albeit not in the concessionary fares window from
9.30 in the morning onwards, but in the concessionary fare scheme that
operated before 9.30, which is no longer possible because of the bus
companies&#146; demands on the local
authority.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07060614000427"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b> We return in this clause to the important issue of
funding for local authorities. I am happy to tell the Committee that I
agree with the sentiment that local authorities should be adequately
funded by central Government for the costs to them of administering a
mandatory concession. After all, it is Government policy to fund new
statutory burdens fully. However, I say at the outset that it is in all
our interests to get things right. There is no underhand plan to try to
deprive anybody. The scheme is popular and will benefit 11 million
people, and we want to get it right. I can confirm to the Committee
that that is why we are paying so much attention to
it.</div>
					<a name="07060614000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government are
providing up to an extra &#163;250 million of funding a year
for the new concession. The hon. Member for Wimbledon asked for a
calculation of the &#163;1 billion a year. I confirm that the figure
for getting to the full-fare national scheme is &#163;250 million,
which is new money for 2008, and that the figure for moving up to the
full-fare local scheme 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>was &#163;420 million, while the figure for moving to the initial
scheme&#151;that is, the half-fare local scheme&#151;was
&#163;400 million. I hope that that is helpful but, as I have said, I
am always happy to provide any further
information.</div>
					<a name="07060614000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
confident that the &#163;1 billion will be sufficient. There is
indeed no mention of the funding of concessionary travel in the Bill,
but for good reasons. Circumstances change, and flexibility needs to be
built into the legislation to enable future improvements to
concessionary travel to be made as efficiently and effectively as
possible. It would be neither appropriate nor wise to lock ourselves
into a particular approach now, when the important issue of funding is
being considered and discussed across government and
beyond.</div>
					<a name="07060614000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
20 and new clause 2 propose a direct annual revenue grant to fund
authorities. It is important to recognise that the freedom and
flexibilities provided by the unhypothecated formula grant are
generally supported by local authorities. Indeed, local authorities
have long argued against having their hands tied by hypothecated
funding schemes, and if I did not listen to them, I am sure that hon.
Members would be the first to criticise
me.</div>
					<a name="07060614000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Concessionary
fares reimbursement is only one of the many obligations that
authorities must meet from their council tax receipts and from the
funding provided by central Government through the formula grant
process. I am aware that the Local Government Association strongly
supports a specific grant for the extra funding for the national bus
concession, at least temporarily. We are considering the merits of
temporarily distributing the extra money through an unhypothecated
specific grant. We need to be clear, however, that such a move would
break from the policy of greater freedom and flexibility in funding,
which is generally welcomed by the local government
community.</div>
					
					<a name="07060614000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07060614000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure hon.
Members that we continue to talk to the LGA and to the concessionary
fares working group, which consists of representatives of all tiers of
local government, about methods of distributing the extra money,
including the option of a specific grant. I hope that that reassures
the hon. Member for Rochdale about the level of consultation that we
are undertaking in addition to the regional roadshows, nine of which
have been held around the country in recent weeks, to talk directly to
local people.</div>
					<a name="07060614000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 would require all the funding for the statutory concession to
be distributed by direct annual grant, which would mean that existing
funding for concessionary fares would have to be extracted from the
formula grant system. I am not sure whether that is the intention of
the new clause, as there is little support for such an approach.
Moreover, the LGA and our concessionary fares working group support the
idea of the current funding staying in the formula grant. They are all
too well aware of the council tax turbulence and fiscal uncertainty
that would result from the transfer of existing funding from the
formula to a specific grant. With great respect to hon. Members, I can
see little point in introducing something that local authorities do not
want.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>
					<a name="07060614000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Treasury, the Department for
Transport and the Department for Communities and Local Government are
carefully considering the merits of different funding mechanisms for
statutory concessions. We are aware of the feedback from our working
group. I referred earlier to the nine regional roadshows that my
officials recently completed, to which all local authorities were
invited. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge that Nexus
representatives were present, and I am sure that he will wish to speak
to them about how useful it was. According to the feedback that I have
had, it was extremely
valuable.</div>
					<a name="07060614000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we get our approach right. We will continue to talk to
interested parties in the coming weeks before coming to a view on the
mechanism for the extra funding. The new clause is misplaced. If we
decide that a specific grant is the right option, we will formally
consult local authorities on the formula for distributing the specific
grant. In any case, there is no need for the Bill to oblige the
Secretary of State to fund concessionary travel as proposed by the new
clause. The Secretary of State already has the power to fund local
authorities for concessionary fares by direct grant, if he wishes. It
would be inappropriate to require the use of such a funding mechanism
in perpetuity without consulting all those with an
interest.</div>
					<a name="07060614000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rochdale expressed his dislike of funding for concessionary
fares coming from revenue support grants, but local authorities have
long argued for non-ring-fenced, single-pot funding. That is what the
Government have provided, and that approach has been generally
welcomed. New clause 2 would specify that a contingency fund be set up.
The extra funding of up to &#163;250 million a year for the national
bus concession is based on a number of key assumptions, which include
the generation of an extra 100 million journeys and a pass take-up of
85 per cent. Those are generous assumptions, because in some regions of
England, pass take-up is less than 60 per cent. The &#163;250 million
figure also includes a contingency allowance to recognise the
difficulties of allocating money on a formula basis. We are confident
that the extra funding is sufficient to cover the extra costs to local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07060614000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wimbledon raised the point that he was concerned about
demand increases leading to higher costs and fare increases. I
reiterate that the extra funding includes moneys to address
uncertainties, and we have taken into account fare inflation in our
calculation.</div>
					<a name="07060614000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
also sensitive to the issue of set-up costs. Earlier in Committee, we
said that we would provide extra funding in addition to the extra
&#163;250 million a year to pay for the extra costs associated with
implementation, such as the issuing of new passes. We are discussing
the figures and the mechanics with the LGA and the concessionary fares
working
group.</div>
					<a name="07060614000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
addition, proposed new subsection 149A(2) in new clause 2 proposes that
a contingency fund be established to fund any unforeseen costs of the
mandatory concession. Again, as previously, I am sure that the
amendment is well intended. However, it is not practical or
proportionate. How do we define unforeseen costs? That is a rather
tricky task that will create its own bureaucracy, because every local
authority will be incentivised to make a claim and there will be no
balancing provision that such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>claims must be reasonable. The amendment erodes the incentives for local
authorities to negotiate cost-effective schemes with operators and to
manage overall costs effectively. That has happened in Wales, where
local authorities pass on the full cost of their schemes to the Welsh
Assembly. As a consequence, the total cost of the Welsh national scheme
has been increasing significantly year on year. I am sure that the
Committee will agree that we cannot sanction such an
approach.</div>
					<a name="07060614000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing
arrangements contain appropriate checks and balances to ensure that
public funds are spent wisely. They include an incentive for local
authorities to reimburse cost-effectively by a fair amount and a right
of appeal for any operator that believes it has been disadvantaged.
Although the system is not perfect, it is fair to the taxpayer and
operator alike.</div>
					<a name="07060614000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal for guaranteed funding carries with it the risk of unnecessary
expenditure incurred by local authorities and bus operators going
beyond what is fit for purpose. It is crucial that we get a good deal
for the taxpayer. Giving an unconditional commitment, as requested, to
fund any cost does not provide that. As I have said, extra funding
already includes a
contingency.</div>
					<a name="07060614000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
same arguments apply to amendment No. 6, which specifies that the
Secretary of State must reimburse local authorities when they incur a
deficit of more than &#163;500,000 as a result of reimbursing
individual operators. Under section 31 of the Local Government Act
2003, the Secretary of State already has the power, with the consent of
the Treasury, to make grants to local authorities to cover their
expenses. Therefore, the amendment would add little. In addition, I do
not find it helpful to introduce arbitrary thresholds with the
potential to distort local
negotiations.</div>
					<a name="07060614000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 proposes yet another review&#151;in this case of the funding
arrangements for local authorities. As the Committee has heard, we have
embarked on a great deal of consultation with local authorities and
other interested parties about all the issues surrounding the
implementation of the national bus concession. We will continue fully
to consult local authorities in line with existing statutory
requirements. The Department for Communities and Local Government
already has in place a well established annual process for consulting
local authorities, both informally and formally, about the formula
grant distribution. I see little to be gained from adopting this
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07060614000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
5 proposes that the Secretary of State makes a statement every
financial year about the amount that is made available to local
authorities and the method of distribution. Again, I see little benefit
from that. There is already the yearly local government finance
settlement that sets out central Government&#146;s funding of local
authorities. That settlement does not, and cannot, earmark different
sums for different purposes for the very good reason that the funding
is not hypothecated. That is generally welcomed by local government,
because it makes it clear that local government is responsible for
choices on local spending
priorities.</div>
					<a name="07060614000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Referring
to the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge,
there was indeed a problem in Tyne and Wear in respect of Nexus, which
I was very glad to meet in recent months. Following consultation, the
formula grant was adjusted to reflect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>support for disabled people and the needs of areas in which the take-up
is likely to be high. That benefited not only Tyne and Wear, but all
areas that had a higher than average number of residents who were
disabled. The measure reduced the shortfall by about &#163;7
million.</div>
					<a name="07060614000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
make the point that extra funding was given to the metro to reflect the
unique circumstances in Tyne and Wear. &#163;1.7 million was made
available last year, and also this financial year, to cover the
financial impact on the
metro.</div>
					<a name="07060614000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">With all of
those points in mind, I hope that hon. Members will agree with me that
the amendments are unnecessary and that the lead amendment will be
withdrawn.</div>

							<a name="07060614000428"></a>Mr.
Clelland:
						</b> I listened with interest to what the Minister
had to say. I readily acknowledge the support that Tyne and Wear has
had from the Department for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>Transport to enable it to extend the free travel service to the metro
system, and we are very grateful for that. Nevertheless, the shortfall
was as it was, regardless of all the efforts that were made by the
Minister and others in the interim. I heard what the Minister said
about the flexibility in the Bill and the fact that funding mechanisms
are still being discussed. I was particularly interested to hear that
she believes that amendment No. 6 is unnecessary because the Secretary
of State already has that power, and I look forward to his exercising
it to deal with those losses at Tyne and Wear. Perhaps between now and
Report, we may be able to have some serious discussions as to how that
might be done. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
