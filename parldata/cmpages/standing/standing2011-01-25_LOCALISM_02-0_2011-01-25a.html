                           </em> Good afternoon, my name is Richard Capie and I
am deputy chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Housing. We are
the main membership organisation for housing professionals, whether in
the private sector, housing associations or local authorities, right

                        <p class="tabbed">In relation
to the Bill, I would say that our membership has been open to reform,
both in the housing and planning systems. In particular, it has
articulated a willingness and an enthusiasm for reform of the social
sector previously. However, we have significant concerns about some of
the clauses that are being taken forward in the Bill, in particular on
some of the flexible tenancies that are on offer in the social sector,
on the ability to change the terms of a tenancy at the end of that
tenancy, and on the housing revenue account. We also have concerns
about the discharge of the homelessness duty into the private rented
sector, not over whether that might be a positive solution for
supporting people with options, but over whether we have sufficient
quality and provision in the private rented sector at this time,
particularly in the light of changes and reforms to the housing benefit
system, as was discussed in the Lords
yesterday.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000010">&#160;</a>

Shelter. I have a number of things to say. With the greatest of respect
to the Committee, we have significant concerns about the consultation
process that has led to this reform, and about some of the work done
behind the reforms and the lack of an impact assessment. We are most
interested in discussing a possible change to the discharge of the
homelessness duty into the private rented sector, without there being
any significant or meaningful regulation of that sector, which offers
some real challenges to very vulnerable
families.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000011">&#160;</a>

worklessness and incentives to work, and will create a bureaucratic

National Housing Federation, which is the trade body for all the
housing associations in England. I will try not to repeat what
colleagues have said. First, on planning—as far as I understand
it, the guiding thinking behind the planning issues in the Bill comes
from the Conservative party’s work on open source planning,
which starts from—and has right at its centre—a
presumption in favour of sustainable development. In an environment
where we need all the help we can get to build the new homes that we
desperately need, it seems to us that a presumption in favour of
sustainable development should be in the Bill, and not just in the
planning framework, and we will argue in favour of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000013">&#160;</a>

Brent Private Tenants Rights Group. As the name of our organisation
implies, our main interest is the private rented sector and the impact
that the changes in the Bill, most notably the discharge of duty to the
private rented sector, will have. The Committee needs to be very aware
that we are talking about a sector that is currently largely
deregulated. With the forthcoming reductions in housing benefit, there
will be increased demand for the lower end of the sector in terms of
the rent levels that might be covered by housing
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000017">&#160;</a>

give a quick example from my borough, if the current housing benefit
claimants were able to acquire all the properties in the lower 30th
percentile, that would leave another 4,000 current claimants with no
accommodation that was affordable in the borough. If you talk about
increasing the pressure by placing more and more families that are
largely dependent on housing benefit into the sector, where landlords
anyway predict further growth from non-claimants—yesterday, I
read that 46% of landlords plan to increase rents due to demand in the
coming year—we are looking at some very real problems. If I may
briefly

                           </em> That is interesting. We are supportive of some
tenure reform measures. What our membership have expressed quite
clearly, however, is nervousness that if someone’s circumstances
improve, they would be required to exit the tenancy. There is a
willingness and an enthusiasm to look at things such as changing the
terms of the tenancy for the existing property; for example, if
someone’s circumstances manifestly improved, they could be
charged more rent or supported into shared ownership to realise some
aspirations on home ownership, if that was what they wanted. However,
there is a lot of nervousness about the idea that if someone’s
circumstances improve, they would be forced to leave the
property.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
concern is twofold: first, the administrative burden of managing such a
property, and, secondly, the community impact of the idea that someone
who has got on in life and taken advantage of the fact that they have a
sub-market rent and a stable home is disincentivised for being
successful. The person who acts as a role model in the
community—the one who has got on with things—is, in
effect, forced to leave the community. You get what we have termed
“the revolving door of poverty”, which is something we
are concerned about.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000026">&#160;</a>

concerns will be that this just creates a disincentive for people to do
well in communities because of the pressure they will be under and the
changes they face. In particular, having a random two years to get
people back on their feet and to change their lives around—with
the movement away from schools, communities and support networks, while
constantly putting a whole range of other things that exist in
communities under threat—would be a real challenge for many
people with whom we work. It would be a huge social change for them.

the overwhelming problem is lack of supply, the critical thing is how
we use what supply we have most effectively. If you get the job, you do
better for yourself and the inevitable consequence is that you lose
your home, it is not going to work very well. If there is a
relationship between landlord and tenant that says, “As your
circumstances change, it may be possible for us to help you find
something that meets your new circumstances more closely”, that
is fine, but an arbitrary cut-off could potentially bring significant
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000029">&#160;</a>

worked in the private rented sector for more than two decades, I have
seen the effect of the introduction and evolution of shorthold
tenancies. Now the vast majority of tenants have shortholds. I have
also noticed that people do not relate to their homes in the same way,
because they do not know how long they are going to live there. They do
not invest their own money in making it look nice or doing minor
repairs and improvements. Even though tenants may be in the same home
for many years, the very fact that they could be forced to move at any
time, through no fault of their own, can create all sorts of stress and
makes it very difficult to plan—getting children into school, or
moving them just before exams, as frequently happens, and so on. There
are many
disadvantages.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000031">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Also,
although we like to think that social landlords are in the main more
responsible than private landlords, they are not perfect. If private
tenants have a shorthold, they do not campaign or exercise their
rights, because if they do, they risk losing their home altogether.
That to me is a major liability, which should be thought about very
carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000032">&#160;</a>

obvious fact that the comprehensive spending review settlement for
housing full stop represents a significant cut. The affordable rent
model itself is seen as pretty problematic. There is an idea of having
rent flexibility for a narrow range of the portfolio, but the modelling
that we have carried out in relation to disposals and actually using
affordable rent shows that its impact would be fairly negligible. In
particular, there is concern about the interrelationship with some of
the welfare reforms being put forward, especially universal credit and
the limits on housing benefit. If we are looking at the revenue subsidy
taking the strain to support new supply, there will be limitations,
certainly from a private funding model. Some associations might be able
to exploit this in some markets, but there will be real limitations. It
is not a long-term, sustainable model. Having said that, there is an
appetite to look at rent flexibility, but we are just not convinced

in the past 15 years? Do you think that one of the reasons behind that
was the regional spatial strategies and our regional planning system,

producing the

land and to bring land into the market to provide new housing in a way

planning framework to see whether things could be done better. Having
said that, we must appreciate that planning does not operate in
isolation. It is linked to things such as the availability of cheap
mortgage finance, which is obviously a key issue now in relation to
supply. If we look at the 2008 to 2011 round of the CSR, we had a
record settlement that enabled us to get over the

about the lack of consistent methodology for assessing planning need in

local authorities about how they assess that local housing need, and

last year, we built the smallest number of new homes since 1923 is a
consequence of the credit crunch, the collapse in the housing market,
the fact that a lot of the major developers had real struggles, and the
real difficulty of the availability of mortgage finance. That will be
made worse by the significant cut in capital investment for new
affordable housing. Transfer to this revenue-funded basis might allow

which I do not have a very strong view, there should be some proper
mechanism—and this is what I really care about—for

Minister has decided that he wants to go for the TSA having a role as a
backstop consumer regulator. The Government have proposed that there
will be a tenant panel standard, whereby all associations will be
expected to set up tenant panels to get a channel of tenants,
basically, representing tenants’ interests both with the housing
association and with the regulator. Although it is very early
days—the legislation has not gone through and the standard is
yet to go—I am expecting and hoping that the tenant panels are a
most effective mechanism for representing the needs of all tenants, in
the event of something going wrong in the relationship between tenants
and housing associations. All the evidence I have so far is that
housing associations are up for the new regime. It is very early days
to make a judgment about how it all works. Within the pattern of

that usually happens at the first point. It is important to protect
that right for somebody who has a complaint or dispute that needs

We will see a revolving door, with people constantly being in

lacks, if the Government wish to go down this route, is any licensing
or regulation of the private rented sector. It will see a greater
dispersal of very vulnerable people into the already least regulated
sector. One of the Government’s first moves was to remove any
agenda in the Rugg review or any desire to put more regulation into the
private rented sector. That is a mistake. If the Government were
willing to consider further regulation, particularly in London or areas
where that was going to happen, it might have potential. Some of the
types of property and landlord will potentially put very vulnerable
people at risk. That is not the answer. You need to do more than this
measure to make it a viable proposition.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000068">&#160;</a>

to the idea of being able to discharge that duty into the private
rented sector, with the caveat that you can ensure that you are putting
somebody into settled accommodation in a well managed, well run private
rented sector. As Campbell said, one of the issues that we
have—and I think it is a wider housing policy issue—is
around our expectations of the private rented sector, given that it
will house an increasing proportion of our population. Certainly, if we
are going to enable people to discharge that duty into the private
rented sector, there need to be greater powers or better regulation in
the local authority area. It is also timely to review this nationally
again. It is not a case of more regulation; it is a case of what better
regulation for that sector looks

the view that there is a hidden social housing sector that has

housing benefit to landlords, where there is no control of the quality
of service provided by those landlords, other than, marginally, in
houses in multiple occupation. If I have a general plea speaking as
Anthony Mayer—not as the chairman of the TSA—I would say
that it will be interesting to see whether the Localism Bill or any
other housing Bill can be used as a vehicle to consider, as they have
done very well in Scotland, the opportunity for Government and society
to look into the hidden social housing sector. Through that a greater
degree of protection could be given to people who are very poor, on
housing benefit, in the private sector and who, by and large, are
completely marginalised in terms of the attention that the Government
give

could have a discussion on how you would begin perhaps to put people
into the private rented sector, with decent regulation to ensure
standards. This summer, Shelter exposed the activities of rogue
landlords working in this area, exploiting tenants repeatedly in
terrible conditions. We do not want to see a return to that, so some

30% of the private rented sector in any one area will be
available under the proposals because the Government have made it clear
that that is the rate at which it will be paid. All those people who
are being discharged will go into that—the bottom 30% in any one
area. The Government are acting on the heroic assumption that landlords
will put their rents down. We have seen no evidence from landlords or
anyone else that rents will go down. Everything would suggest a
marketplace with

shown us none. We are fearful that a lot of these assumptions are based

authorities—not on the homelessness side of
things—provide an awful lot of advice and support, and help
settle people into good quality private rented accommodation as part of
their wider housing responsibilities. There is a strong platform where
it is taking place. The number of people who will be settled if this
clause is accepted will probably be relatively small, because it will
be contingent on what good quality sustainable lettings in the local
area are actually available. As Campbell said, the amount of property
that is available to settle somebody is falling.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000078">&#160;</a>

consumer prices index adjustments to housing benefit over
time—we know that that proportion of the market will be further

evidence in the Social Security Advisory Committee, for example, which
looked at the impact of the housing benefit changes, highlighting that
this will be very problematic in terms of the role that housing benefit
will play in the private rented sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000079">&#160;</a>

the kind of downward pressure on private rents? Certainly, we have not
seen any evidence from DWP that that will be the case. The latest data
coming from landlords suggest the opposite, which is that private rents
are going up as people who would usually be among the 100,000 people
who secure a mortgage, but who cannot do so just now, are renting
because they cannot buy. There is additional pressure on private rents,
and those prices seem to be going up rather than

willing to reduce their rent, but they will offer accommodation that is
of such poor quality and so badly managed that, notwithstanding the
increased demand, they will not get people other than those reliant on
housing benefit to take it. It will, therefore, drive standards down
rather than up. In addition, local authorities, because they cannot
find anywhere locally to discharge their duty, will place families
further and further afield to fight the demand on those new places. The
local authorities bordering our own borough, where they can see that
coming, are already worried about rents going up there. You will push
people further and further out as demand drives rents up. Not only
that, of course, but once you remove people from their roots and their
informal support networks, you actually place more expense on the local
authorities where they end up—on the schools, the health
services, the social services and so on. It does not actually save
public money, because it will cost more elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000081">&#160;</a>

the regional spatial strategy, to my mind you were effectively arguing
for the status quo and arguing that allowing local communities to
design might not lead to any house building—but certainly not
enough. Bearing in mind that we had some evidence this morning from
councils and the LGA who were telling us that local communities know
what they need and want to build it, but they want the right thing in
the right place, are you arguing for the status quo or another
option?<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The second
question relates to that and is addressed to anyone on the panel. As a
result of what the Government are proposing, do you think there would
be an increase in house building beyond the last couple of years? The
lack of house building is not just a feature of the last year or two
during the recession; it has characterised the past 10 years. That goes
way beyond the recession, despite what has been mentioned. Do you think
there will be an increase in house building on these plans, or do you
have another option?<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000085">&#160;</a>

Orr:</strong>

regard to planning. I think that the fundamental issue with planning is
not about systems and structures—it’s not about whether
PPS3 works or doesn’t work—it’s cultural. It is
whether planning is fundamentally seen as development control, which it
has been, or whether it is seen as a kind of active, creative
engagement with local communities that asks what the community needs
and how we as planners can assist in delivering that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000086">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I think that
ideas such as the new homes bonus and the proposals in respect of
community right to build are very interesting. There is not enough
evidence yet to say whether they will be, in themselves, sufficient to
generate the kind of new supply that is necessary. We are absolutely in
favour of discussing all that, but it has to be based on a presumption
in favour of sustainable development. If we don’t have that, we
will not see the new supply. The only time that there was a significant
increase in house building over the past 10 years was in the 2008 to
2011 period, particularly in the early part before the impact of the
credit crunch had really kicked in. Housing associations and others
were able to build more affordable homes, because there was additional
capital investment. That was the one time that we got close to the
200,000 limit. Planning is very important, it is not fundamentally
about the planning process; it is much more about the planning culture.
That’s not just an issue for planners; it’s an issue
about local political
leadership.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000087">&#160;</a>

the moment local authorities may discharge their duty to the private
sector when the family agrees that it is a good idea, and for some it
is. What worries me are not the most vulnerable groups, but those
families that are more mature and in work but are forced into the

that. We continue to be worried about two things. The first is forcing
people into any one tenure against their will. That goes back to the
discussion that we had earlier about the incentive for people to feel
generally that they are stable in one place and can build a life in
that community, and that they are not being disincentivised to stop
working because they may lose their home. The general point remains,
regardless of the group. If, as the Government propose, you would face
a review of your income and your circumstances every two years, it does
not create an incentive to build a long-term future in that place. You
would have constantly to consider your options about what you choose to
do in that area. I think it is the same problem as we had
before.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000093">&#160;</a>

reforms, the propositions in the universal credit—the

The key thing is that there needs to be consistency between that
particular move in welfare policy and what you are trying to achieve in

that there is a clear definition of suitable private rented

that families are placed not only somewhere where the rent is covered
by housing benefit, which, as I said before, will be no mean feat in
itself, but somewhere that does not keep them on housing benefit for
the rest of their life because they could never afford those rents if
they come off it. That poses enormous problems, which I do not think

represented a ward in Gateshead for 27 years that has about
a third of its property in the private rented sector, so it is
something that I am quite familiar with. I see a particular problem
where a number of properties may have been bought recently for a
buy-to-let process, and I cannot see any mileage in terms of rents
coming down, because, from my understanding, mortgages have not
depressed massively in the recent past. How will landlords manage to
bring rents down if they are determined to keep a particular level of
rent in order to pay the mortgage? That is the first

of our concerns with the proposals, particularly on a two-year

system to monitor regularly details of

whole range of records about what they are doing and assess that. You
will need a set of people to make those assessments. How that would be
done is not clear from the legislation and what is happening. David and
others may have more detail on that, but that is our concern with the

sector in this country is such that you are actually right; most
landlords are not big institutional landlords. There are lots of
mum-and-dad landlords who make decisions based on quite variable
financial circumstances. We may see some marginal adjustments. For
example, if someone has a really good tenant that they like and want to
keep and if the cost to them of a void after getting that person out
was high, they might make a decision to accept a bit of a hit in terms
of rent. The reality is, however, that you are not going to make a
long-term financial decision based on that. That is why you may see
some movements, but at a very marginal level. The volatility that
exists in our sector is largely to do with the nature of the landlords
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000110">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of the monitoring of circumstances, that was something that came
through as a very clear message when talking to our members about
this. As I said, people are open to looking at
flexibility in tenancies, but there is recognition that this is a
fundamentally different ask of people in relation to housing
management. There are also the changes that are coming through in
relation to the housing benefit adjustments including, for example,
knowing who of your tenants has been on jobseeker’s allowance
for 12 months or more, because of the risk that they will get 10% of
their HB cut. There are many landlords out there in the social sector
who are frantically running round trying to profile their tenants,
because that information is not there. Ensuring that you know the
changes in someone’s circumstances in the level of detail
required, if, for example, there was only a two-year cycle, would be
very difficult and, potentially, quite an administrative burden for
people in relation to housing management. At the same time, if you have
something like a review over a five-year period, that is a slightly
different proposition, but two years is far too
short.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000111">&#160;</a>

impact assessment should have been published by the Department in
advance so that many of us could make more detailed and proper analysis
of what we are doing. Many of us are making suppositions based on a
lack of evidence of the impact that the Government have brought about.
Of course there are reforms in here that could bring benefits. Some of
them we welcome; some of them we would like to see. Some of them are
sledgehammers to crack nuts, and we would love to work with and bring
positive amendments to the Committee and to the

concerns about revenue streams coming in, particularly to housing
associations, as a result of changing tenure and rent levels. We also
heard concerns about development and whether it will happen, because of
the proposals in the planning element of the Bill. Are you picking up
any concerns at all from lenders, as a result of some of the areas of
the Bill that seem not to relate to each other and, generally, are
slightly
destabilising?<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000117">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The risk profile in respect of lending into the
housing association sector will change. If lenders perceive that the
risk is greater, then the cost of money will increase—that is
fairly basic. The present position is that it is still possible for
housing associations to access money at relatively fine margins. A THFC
bond earlier this week was at 5.4% all in, which is a very good price.
So, there is institutional appetite. However, kind of following what
Campbell says, with so much of this there is so much change in the
relationships of one bit to the other—all of the parts are
moving at the same time—so it is very difficult to pin this down
and say, “Right, we’ll hold that steady, and what would
be the impact of this change or that change?” We are trying to
change everything at once. I think that at the moment the lenders are
saying that we like the risk of investing in housing associations, but
that risk profile looks like it will change, so we need to wait and see
what it looks like. My guess is that it will probably mean that there
will be some additional costs to
finance.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000118">&#160;</a>

new homes. What characterises subsidised houses? Answer: subsidy. Where
do we get the subsidy from? You can get it from selling assets and
bringing some cross-subsidy; you can get it from capital
subsidy from the public purse; or you can get it
from revenue subsidy. We are changing that balance, so it should still
be possible to build the new homes. But if the consequence of that
change is that some rents are £250 where before they were
£85, it changes the relationship between landlord and tenant,
and the relationship that the tenant has between benefit and
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000120">&#160;</a>

provides certainty and confidence for both developers and communities,
and one that facilitates the delivery of much-needed homes. There are a
number of elements in the Bill that are welcome; however, several
issues are of concern, such as the lack of reference to the presumption
in favour of sustainable development and its definition, the lack of
linkage to the new homes bonus as an incentive to authorities to
deliver homes, and a reliance on secondary legislation and regulation
for much of the operational
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000125">&#160;</a>

interesting, because the planning system there bears some relation to
some elements of the Bill—and the only UK developer with a
significant business that operates in a different planning system
outside the UK. My overall view is that we do not find it difficult to
support the principle of localism, and we certainly do not find it
difficult to support the principle of change to the planning system.
Most of our reservations centre around the scale and time of transition
risk from an old to a new system, which we believe will impact
negatively on planning permissions in the short term, and therefore on
housing delivery. The issue is how you can mitigate that impact, not
necessarily to change the end result massively, but to make sure that,
in getting there, we do not throw the baby out with the
bathwater.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000126">&#160;</a>

experience of dealing with local authorities for the past year, that
local councillors might not have the abilities to take on board the
more free-thinking aspects of the Bill to gain the most advantage from
it. As it stands at the moment, they have lived in a regime for many
years, and there are many advantages of the Bill that they will just
not grasp, or which they will take a long time to grasp, on both the

                           </em> Sure. The first issue that I commented on,
and an issue where you need to focus on mitigation, is the transition
period. There is a whole series of significant issues; local
authorities, neighbourhoods, parish councils, the development industry,
planning officers and chief executives of local authorities—the
whole system—are used to one way of doing things, which does not
work hugely well, and needs to adapt. That will take a massive amount
of
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000130">&#160;</a>

view is that we should have some kind of safety net through that
process—a regular test to make sure that the provisions are
broadly working, as people adjust. Having a time scale for
implementation, to make sure that people are given time to adjust to
that process, is critical to ensuring that there is not more damage
caused in the short term than there are gains in the long term. Our
argument all the way through discussions about the localism agenda and
planning has been that there should be some sort of transition
arrangement, and measurement of what the planning progression is on a
local level, how local communities are adapting,

are more detailed elements in the Bill that will be most difficult to
move through the transition, particularly down at the local

moment, when local authorities are struggling to meet their existing

concepts further, and therefore take longer to adjust to, are phased in
over time, when some of the basic principles are better
understood.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000132">&#160;</a>

issues. They may seem a little out of left field, but they are not. On
referendums, there is a fairly low level of requirement to start the
process, which is easy to get into. As I read the Bill, the consequence
of it might be a 12-month-plus delay. I do not very much welcome that,
if it relates to planning and planning content. It is a matter for a
future order, and I would beg the Secretary of State to make an order

regional spatial strategies, which is a high profile issue, and that
removes one layer of the planning system. However, the Bill then
introduces neighbourhood planning frameworks, so we are effectively
removing one tier and replacing it with another. The number of hurdles
that must be considered in order to navigate the planning process and
deliver housing remains effectively the same. There are certainly
issues with the RSS and housing numbers; the assistance and housing
delivery was only one element of it. The neighbourhood development
plans can potentially introduce a plethora of issues, but at an
extremely local and detailed level. The burden on the house building
industry—the cost and investment of resources in order to
deliver houses—potentially remains the same. So the opportunity
for the Bill to reduce some of the delay and cost burden and to
stimulate housing delivery, in terms of an actual process, remains the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000139">&#160;</a>

There is an equal amount of culture change that must take place on the

Pete Redfern. My experience is that many parts of
the development industry are already accepting that change and are
moving ahead with it; is that your experience of how the industry is

local planning authorities on these issues—issues such as the
private rented sector, and all sorts of new initiatives that will
provide more open-market housing and affordable housing, while also
providing additional revenue streams for the local authority in the
round. I think that people in local authorities have yet to get their
minds around what the very good parts of this Bill can deliver. Local
authorities have been staid in the way that they run for so long that
those parts will be difficult to bring to the fore. We may get the bad

starting to adapt well. The culture change must be significant, but it
will happen. The culture change around PPG3 10 years ago was
significant—though probably not as marked as this—and it
happened. My concerns around culture change are that it is much harder
for Government institutions to change; they can be elected or, in some
instances, not elected, or do not currently exist in a lot of cases,
and it is much more difficult for them to change—they do not
have the resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We already
find with the existing system that one of the key brakes is the level
of planning officer skill and availability in order to get things done.
That will become more difficult for local authorities as we go through
the economic constraints of the next few years. They will need to
resource an extra, much bigger tier of the iceberg below the surface.
It will take a long time for culture change to happen. We have had not
just 10 years, as I heard mentioned in a previous session,
but at least 30 years of a development control based planning system.
The culture change is massive. It will take a long time for people to
adapt and get the balance right. But yes, the industry itself will
probably change more quickly, because it will adapt to what it needs to
do to make the system

                           </em> The first point is that there is an element
in the Bill about community consultation. We do it all the time,
anyway, so that is not new. That is also quite costly and
time-consuming, but we pick up the tab for that in any case, and I do
not imagine that that will be any different, going
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000148">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
on the issue of the right development in the right place, one of the
tests of a neighbourhood development order—and, by definition,
the neighbourhood development plan, too—is that it should not be
contradictory to the strategic local plan policy. But I did not see,
unless I missed it, the definition of strategic. We are not changing
the current planning system, in terms of development plans, so we have
core strategies and allocations documents. I see
“strategic” as perhaps being the core strategy. That
means that the local development plan will be mainly about the
allocations—where the detailed allocations
go.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000149">&#160;</a>

need quite a bit of important knowledge about viability and
developability—all those tests that currently sit within
PPS3—to make proper informed decisions about that. That is not
beyond the wit of local neighbours—far from it—but an
educated process has to take place, because there has to be an
understanding that you cannot just build anything anywhere at any time.
There is a price to pay. The bottom line has to be viability. I start
and end with viability. I want that writ large in anything that goes
through because, without viability, development does not happen. You
can have the best system in the world, but if it is not predicated on
viability, development does not happen. It is very important that there
is an educated process and viability throughout the whole
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000150">&#160;</a>

on about the pre-application consultation? We would all agree that we
already subscribe to best practice. The majority of our developments
are preceded by good-quality public engagement. In terms of the
minutiae of the Bill, there is a reference to developers having regard
to advice from local authorities. Local authorities have myriad
guidance notes on community engagement and what they consider to be
good practice within their areas. A slight concern is that,
potentially, what one local authority considers to be good practice
could get bigger and bigger and become a hurdle to the proper delivery
of development.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The second
small element, just to dwell on the minutiae of the Bill, is that there
is then a duty to have regard to comments and responses made by the
community and by specified persons. We would all subscribe to best
practice and seek to do it, but often the responses are not
similar—one person would like a flat roof and someone else would
like a pitched roof. I would like to see that qualified in some way, so
that it is “due regard”,  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 80<a class="bkMark" name="Column80">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and so that there is some rationale, because to have regard to every
comment would be impossible for development, which is a dynamic thing.
Design is very often a matter of personal taste, anyway. I would ask
Members to have regard to that small element.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000152">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
neighbourhood plans, and understanding the desire to engage the
community, I would reinforce Roy’s comment that plans sit within
a hierarchy. The Bill seems to make reference to the hierarchy
remaining, as in having regard to the local plan, but it is not clear.
That goes back to one of my opening comments, which is that there is a
concern that much is left to regulation and secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
there is a lack of clarity in the Bill on how neighbourhood plans would
actually work. For them to sit within a local plan framework and be
consistent, a core strategy would already have to have evolved. That
means that it would already have to have started identifying locations
for development. As neighbourhood development plans will not be
required by statute, an authority will have a difficulty, in that it
will not be a level playing field. They cannot plan to a certain level
and then see if neighbourhood plans develop. They have to start either
specifying where development will go, or not. In which case, what is
the purpose of a neighbourhood development plan? Does community
engagement not revolve around the authority engaging in a more holistic
and in-depth manner through their local
plan?<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000154">&#160;</a>

30 years was backward-looking. We have had a control-based
system for at least 30 years. A reference forward—this is my
view, and it is not based on any science—is that it takes 10
years for this sort of change to be really
effective.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">National
Government have a big role, and to be frank, one of the areas in which
the industry has struggled over the past nine months is being
comfortable with how that culture change has been effected. You need to
send clear, consistent signals about what is going to happen. The speed
with which regional spatial strategies were withdrawn, for instance,
sent the wrong signal, although to be fair, the speed with which the
details of the new homes bonus were released in the autumn helped to
counterbalance that somewhat. During that period I was having a very
active dialogue with local authorities, and you could see that
affecting their views of the direction in which things were going.
After the attempt to change RSS policy overnight, people shut up shop,
not because they were anti-development but because they didn’t
know where things were going. Yet when they started to receive the
mitigating messages about the new homes bonus and that direction,
people opened up and started to understand. So it is about having a
clear communication strategy, making it consistent, giving people a
chance to adapt and having proper consultation—all the standard
basics.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000157">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Partly picking
up on another element of your question, and partly referring back to
the previous question, we as an industry do a lot of consultation at
the moment. The one thing on which I wouldn’t necessarily agree
with my two colleagues—I don’t think they will object to
my saying this—is that the quality of it is not necessarily
brilliant. There are a number of reasons for that. It is a relatively
new process.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The quality
of consultation is far better in Scotland than it is in England,
because it has been an effective part of the system for longer. It has
taken the industry time to adapt to what has been a relatively low-key
level of consultation, and it has taken local authorities a long time
to adapt. It is not an easy process, and time is very much the key.
Consultation isn’t that easy for the public as a whole, either.
There isn’t a body to engage with. One of the fears, which must
be taken seriously, in terms of how national Government deals with it,
but also how the Bill goes through, relates to the ability of a very
small element of a local community to control the process without
having the overall social and economic well-being of the local
community at heart.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000159">&#160;</a>

clear messages should be given, almost to tell local communities what

answers, but telling them what good-quality consultation looks like.

                        <p class="tabbed">Having heard
the tail end of the previous discussion about rents falling, I would
very much concur: I can’t see that happening at a point when the
availability of capital is low and house prices are still relatively
high. The only meaningful long-term solution involves a greater degree
of housing supply, because that brings down the overall cost of
housing, whether for private owners or the rented
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000166">&#160;</a>

said, but as I said earlier, we are a property company, not just a
house builder, and we have a very large commercial portfolio that we
retain in all aspects of development. So we have been doing private
rented ourselves for the last two years. It is about economics: if the
land is at the right price, I can rent houses at about social housing
rent levels—is it called the local housing allowance levels? We
can make that work and give us a yield that we would find acceptable on
a return, but that is not giving it to another investor; that is doing
it ourselves, because we have the cash to do it. We would work that
model and we continue to work
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000169">&#160;</a>

I want to pick up with Roy Donson about writing the presumption in

people in the past, a lot of people from the development world felt
that in the 1980s when there was a presumption in favour of
development—the Nick Ridley presumption—that was
advantageous. As I recall, that was not in primary legislation; it was
in the guidance. If it worked then, without being in primary
legislation, why is it necessary to have a provision in primary
legislation now, provided it is defined in a sensible way in the
appropriate guidance or secondary
legislation?<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000170">&#160;</a>

point in with the earlier question. It is one of the signals that
national Government can change. We have talked a lot about cultural

the national planning framework and a lot of the other elements. It is
the chance to make a statement. That is why it is important; it is not
so much about whether it is in primary legislation or guidance. It is
where it carries weight and having it early. It is saying that there is
a real commitment to a positive presumption. That is why it is

Without the Bill, with the status quo, it would probably be somewhere
around six years before you saw the industry producing at the same
level. With the Bill, I would estimate longer, because I think the
transition will slow things down. Plucking a year out of thin air, that
would be more like seven or eight years. It will make a difference to
the speed of planning permissions, but it will be slow. It will not be
slow because of the industry’s ability to build. It will be slow
because of mortgage and planning permission availability.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000180">&#160;</a>

active sites the industry is operating from at the moment is running at
about 20% below the peak. That is all down to the planning system now;
it is very little to do with our ability financially to start sites.
Even if the market and mortgage availability were the same, that
slowing down of planning permission—which I am not putting down
to the Bill, but a whole series of factors over the past few
years—will still take a long time to catch
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000181">&#160;</a>

There are three elements in the delivery of housing. I think most of us
would agree that there is certainly the capacity; most of us are
underusing our resources at the moment. The liquidity in the market and
mortgage availability is certainly an issue, as is the planning system.
The biggest element is that in any change—

arrangements—as an industry we make short, medium and long-term
investment decisions. When uncertainty arises and when we have
concerns, whether or not they ultimately mature into positives that we
can embrace, in the interim those short, medium and long-term
investment decisions are put to one side or slowed down. A hiatus in

flow of consent coming through the process to maintain and grow
business. I fear that we will reach a point, in about three
years’ time, when what we have currently on the stocks runs out,
where in fact we have not got that supply coming through. That is the
big challenge. That is the sort of transition that Pete and Jennie are

supply and housing requirements now that the RSS targets are to be
abolished. How are we to ensure that the necessary level of homes is
delivered? PPS3 has a multitude of documents that we can refer to. You
referred to the 240,000 homes from Kate Barker, but PPS3 asks us to
review strategic housing market assessments and household projections,
which now sit at around 232,000—just 8,000 short of Kate
Barker’s aspirations—but which one is an authority to
use? You can have a spreadsheet of any number of housing targets that
one should seek to achieve or, if you do not want to use the word
“target”, of housing need that needs to be accommodated.

consents and houses on the

keep track of the time here. I have this fear. For many years when we
did have higher supply it was, as mentioned in the last session, in the
affordable housing sector. The open-market sector has been relatively
steady for many years, although it has gone down in the past three
years. To get to the higher levels, if the provision of affordable
housing has to rely on the open market to provide them, the subsidy has
to come from the open market either by a higher land value or a lot
less planning gain. It has to come from somewhere; you cannot have it
all. It has to add up and to be financially viable.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000187">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would hate
to think that for the next 20 years housing developers will be doing
nothing but going into planning offices with viability and talking
mathematics with planners. I do not know, but I fear that, because
every developer’s margins and requirements are different. The
increase has to come through more land being on the market. The amount
of it that is allocated for certain categories of affordable housing
will then have a value that attaches to that, which will enable the
affordable housing to be provided at a profitable level for the
developer. That is the only way that the numbers will go up, in my
opinion. When that is in place, I think that they could go up quickly,
because we will have to build a lot more to get the
margin.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000188">&#160;</a>

presumption written in, but I don’t think there is a need for
the third party right of appeal. With the combination of the
neighbourhood planning and the consultation process, you have ample
opportunity for the neighbourhood or local view—or the objective
view, if you want to put it that way—to be well heard. You have
to remember that the planning system operates on the basis that
decisions are made in the public interest. If you make a decision in
the public interest, set against community consultation and
neighbourhood planning, there is no need for a right of third party
appeal.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000190">&#160;</a>

                           </em> May I add a couple of statistics to that? I
will give the same answer. Last year—we were reviewing the
statistics this morning, which is why they are clear in my
mind—we had a 94% success rate on appeals. The average time for
an appeal was nine months. Effectively the process of appeal delayed
the average site that went through that process by three quarters of a
year. Only one in 20 of those delays had legal merit. That is the
nature of the appeal process, and it always has been. Our success rate
has always been very high, but it is a significant delay.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You have to
remember that that nine months is often on top of five or six years of
planning negotiation and process. If you take out nine months of
supply, that is 150,000 houses. That is not slowing things down, but
taking things out of the system, which will impact on the next three or
four years. If you include an additional right of third party appeal
for somebody who does not have to justify any economic interest in the
site, you just create an extra opportunity for significant unjustified
delay. If there was a higher success rate, if the outcomes were 50:50,
it might be a justified position, but the number of successful appeals
in that way is very
low.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000192">&#160;</a>

                           </em> If I may, I will pick up on the assets of
community value. We hear the assets of community value described as
pubs and post offices—things that are in existing, formal,
community use. There is a desire to protect them, so we can understand
the provision. We accept that that has gone into the Bill relatively
late in the drafting and that therefore there is not an awful lot of
detail. Our fear is that it has huge potential for abuse. It is a
little like the third party right of appeal. It grants the potential
for a significant delay by someone who has no genuine interest in the
site. In theory, as drafted, it could give someone the right to stop a
site with planning permission from being sold. That creates a huge
additional delay in the process. I think this comment was made earlier,
but, in particular, it restricts a developer’s ability to put
financial risk into a site, when they could have that sort of delay
imposed on them relatively arbitrarily. If its operation is tightly
defined and clear cut, we can see how it achieves its purpose, but at
the moment it is very wide-ranging and loose in theory.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000194">&#160;</a>

                           </em> My concern about the CIL and the
infrastructure is very simple. I understand the CIL and the
infrastructure that it will provide. It quite clearly reads that they
want developers to provide sufficient funds for maintenance and
management of that new infrastructure. That will not apply
retrospectively to all infrastructure. If it is left to the local
authority to determine what level or how many years of commuted sum
will be required to maintain roads, street lights, or whatever the
infrastructure is, the amounts will be enormous. If somebody wants the
commuted sums to be in perpetuity—for 80 years—there will
be nothing left in the viability to provide any infrastructure. The
maintenance is currently paid by everyone, through rates and council
tax, so the new people will presumably have sufficient money to fund
the maintenance and ongoing costs of the new infrastructure. I cannot
see that you can put 80 years’ costs to the developer and get
any
housing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012717000001">&#160;</a>

I am not clear what you mean by “resourcing of
neighbourhoods”.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000195">&#160;</a>

Redfern:</strong>
                           </em> The definition was particularly about the
relatively low bar of local community membership of a neighbourhood
forum that you initially needed. There is the fear, which was mentioned
earlier, that you could have someone with no real local interest coming
in and almost taking over the decision, without really getting a lot of
community support behind them.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000196">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
resourcing, the concern is not so much that we would pay for the
planning process—the point has been made that, effectively, we
do that already, and to be honest, I think we can manage
that—but that there is no neighbourhood structure with which to
engage, or to consult. There is no elected structure; the quality of
skills and resourcing in any neighbourhood forum under this system will
vary enormously. So, you are actually giving a formal role on some big
decisions, which impact on significant social issues locally, such as
affordable housing—significant financially for the developer in
the local community—to a very unclear group, who will need
resources. I made the point before about planning officers, and how
their lack in certain areas at the moment is a key brake on the
process. Think of how much more difficult that can be if you are
actually engaging with local neighbourhood forums that have no formal
resourcing at all. That is a huge issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000197">&#160;</a>

communities, let us talk about the higher level first and work down.
Engaging with them in a positive way, and, as an industry, being forced
to explain to people what we bring that is positive and justify what we
bring that is negative, because we understand that the things we do
have positive and negative impacts, and why the balance is
right—I think that is a healthy thing. My fear, when you take
that down to a level that does not exist for engagement at the moment,

question about what we are looking at, at the moment. I think you will
have to be far more engaged and far more clued up about the sensitive
issues locally, as well as about the positives that local communities,
local politicians and local planning officers are looking for, which is
a healthy thing. That is why we can support the basic principles of
where it can go. I commented before that I have been visiting local
authorities over the past few months, and I have seen about 25
different chief executives and chief planning officers. To be honest, I
did not spend anything like as much time on that process a year ago. It
is a healthy thing, and there are definitely positives in
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000216">&#160;</a>

in which the commercial firms that succeed are those that manage to
reorientate themselves rather than try to wangle allocations in a
regional plan through intimate knowledge of the regional
bureaucracy—those who have a freer relationship with local
authorities and communities. Do you expect companies such as yours to
be typical in moving to that world, in that behaviour will change to
reflect it, or do you expect a change in the pecking order of
companies? Do you think that, in 10 years, those companies that relied
on imposing developments on communities, in spite of local wishes, will
acquire a toxic reputation and be supplanted by those that have a more
community-based approach? Will there be replacement or will the current
incumbents learn?<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000219">&#160;</a>

slightly different approaches and be slightly more or less successful
at implementing them, but, yes, one would expect the names on the doors
of the people who successfully make the process work to change. I think
that we cannot get away from the fact that things will be lost on the
way. There will definitely be a slow-down in that process, but, in
doing so, you put pressure on people to perform differently. The
industry is very pragmatic and pretty responsive in changing the
system—sometimes too responsive, and that needs to be watched
carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000220">&#160;</a>

you go back to PPG3, no one in the room would be unaware that the
industry built too many apartments in 2006-07. That was not because we
desperately loved apartments or even because we necessarily made more
money on them, but because we were reacting to a planning system that
made high-density schemes far more likely to win planning permission.
To a degree, we have to react to the environment we are in. There is an
awfully high risk of unintended consequences, which is why we are
pushing on things such as the community assets and other elements. We
can see what is trying to be achieved with some bits, but people react
in different ways and make it work for them to some extent. In general,
yes, the provisions in the Bill mean that the successful developers
will be those who engage more effectively, persuade people that they
are bringing something positive to the community, understand what the
community wants and focus on it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000221">&#160;</a>

little gain in that time. We could lose one or two of the companies

Redfern:</strong>
                           </em> It depends how you measure brownfield
development. The number of actual housing units—I use that term
to encompass apartments and housing—has gone up dramatically
over the past 10 years, and PPG3 has been a big driver of that. The
number of acres of brownfield land that has been used relative to
greenfield land has gone up, but not as significantly. So I do not
think that the Bill will lead to a reduction in the number of
brownfield acres as long as the cost load, to which Alan referred, is
not so great, because they are the sites that are most sensitive to
viability issues. I do not think that it inherently favours either
brownfield or greenfield. I think that you will inevitably see the
number of housing units built on brownfield land reduce, because the
densities driven by PPG3 were unsustainable, but that is going to be
true whatever the planning system is. It is neutral
overall.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000225">&#160;</a>

                           </em> If I may comment on brownfield development, it
is one part of development that Harrow Estates are particularly
interested in. The changes to CIL are something that we want to
welcome. The opportunity for a percentage of that to cascade to the
local community is very important, but one of the elements of CIL, in
the way that it is applied to brownfield sites, is that the flexibility
for authorities to take into account viability to ensure that
brownfield sites can  still be delivered is a question mark
that needs to be looked
at.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000230">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Brownfield
sites tend to be in more sustainable locations, and one should hope
that, certainly in the geographical and locational elements of the
definition of sustainable development that we are all seeking,
brownfield sites should do well and be welcomed by local communities as
a form of regeneration. Regeneration, however, is lacking in the
vocabulary of the work that we have seen coming through in the past six
months. It is not factoring highly, and my concern is that if there is
no understanding of the difficulty that is applied to brownfield sites,
both in terms of viability and location, and of how CIL, section 106
and other elements could act in an unexpected way, the ability to
deliver brownfield sites would reduce, and, therefore, the need for
greenfield release will
increase.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000231">&#160;</a>

authorities in which I operate is going to propose moving green belt
boundaries under the new regime. It is moving them in the area of least
demand in the whole county. They will not need a new homes bonus in

to suggest that it is insufficient to actually make them in the more
affluent areas of south Manchester and north Cheshire. They are not
going to change their mind for the sake of £1,500, or whatever
it is. They will not have development. We could end up giving the new
homes bonus to areas that would build houses if there was any demand,
in any event, without the bonus, and in fact it will not be sufficient
to create houses where affordability is probably the
worst.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000233">&#160;</a>

which I would like to have the opportunity to expand on this afternoon,
first, we are very keen that neighbourhoods should not be seen as just
residential neighbourhoods. There are neighbourhoods in this country
that are predominantly commercial or of very mixed use. We would like
to explore how we can adapt the localism agenda to ensure that
commercial and business activity—people who own business
property and occupiers—have their voice in determining
neighbourhoods.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000243">&#160;</a>

neighbourhood planning work, providing more incentives and improving
how we deliver infrastructure are all important themes of the Bill. Put
briefly, my concerns are the same as Liz’s on the role of
business and other groups in neighbourhood planning. There seems a
great emphasis on residents—those who live, or want to live, I
think was the phrase she used. Those who work and do other things in
neighbourhood communities need to have a role, too. I am interested in
the mechanics of neighbourhood planning, such as tests of soundness,
examination and the relationship with the local plan. In the review
that I referred to, one of the things that we looked at was a series of
tank traps post-planning permission, and it seems that the designation
of land of community value, if not dealt with properly, is potentially
another tank trap that can be abused in order to stop development at a
very late
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000256">&#160;</a>

members account for 80% of all houses built in any one year. It is nice
to know that a lot of you are aware of one of the statistics that we
put out in our press releases that last year saw us build the lowest
number of homes since 1923. It was not meant to be a badge of honour.
We are facing a housing crisis, and any change to a system must ensure
that we can deliver more houses through the system, and that involves
planning. We therefore need a system that is pro-growth,
pro-development and removes barriers rather than erecting mazes of
different processes—hurdles for people to continually jump. We
need to strip back everything and ensure that we focus on what is
important in a housing crisis—the delivery of
housing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000258">&#160;</a>

Penfold:</strong>
                           </em> I will pick up the land of community value
point. It is slightly analogous to the village green designation
process. It is a perfectly proper process. It is important to consider
whether an area is a village green, certainly when someone is promoting
or proposing a development on that area of land. Similarly, land of
community value such as a post office needs to be properly considered
through a process. In my review, the responses to our call for evidence
were from people saying that calls for village greens were coming in
when the bulldozers were moving on to the site. No one had even raised
the issue throughout the planning process. It was clearly just being
used as a tool. Two or three registered social landlords responded to
that effect, and they were doing the development.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000261">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am talking
about delays to the building of affordable housing late in the day,
intended just to disrupt development. Whether or not land is of
community value needs to be considered. There must be a mechanism for
considering that at an earlier stage in the process. I am referring to
the ability of someone to come in at a late date and raise such an
issue. Perhaps I have misread the Bill, but the ability of someone to
act in that way could be
harmful.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000262">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am thinking of referendums as well. I heard what was said earlier about
their not being binding, but would a planning authority really want to
go ahead and make a planning decision with a referendum on a particular
proposal hanging over it, given that that might delay the decision? So
again, if there is to be a referendum on a planning
application—I would prefer that there was not—it needs to
happen at a sufficiently early stage not to disrupt the process and
impose more delay on development which is, in many cases, much
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000263">&#160;</a>

Whitaker:</strong>
                           </em> We made very similar points to those which
Mr Penfold has made. I was quite surprised by Greg Clark’s
response to the previous speaker about how the community right to
challenge wasn’t going to be applied to
planning—surprised, because I don’t read that in the
Bill. We believe the planning system is already a very involved process
anyway. It is quite a complicated process, but within it are a whole
load of checks and balances that allow people to participate in it. It
allows people to make their representations; it allows people to make a
balanced decision about what is the best thing to do. You can never
please everybody all of the time: in a case of two sides there will
always be someone who doesn’t like the decision. If that is 5%
of the population and they decide to challenge either the development
plan process or the planning application process, then I don’t
see anything in the Bill that stops them from doing that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000264">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
that the referendum is not mandatory on the local authority, but it
will be a very brave authority that says, “No, we have taken
that decision; we are not going to reassess it.” Even the delay
of holding the referendum to see whether people want to support that
process or not fills us with fear. Planning is a very long process
already; we don’t want to make it even longer by being open to
the referendum right to challenge at all turns.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000265">&#160;</a>

right to challenge—the right to challenge to run local authority
services? We understand that CLG will consult on which services are
going to be excluded from that, as well as on the procedure to be
followed. The NFA is very interested in the idea that council tenants
have the right to challenge local authorities over the running of their
housing services and the ability to bid to run these themselves. That
would be based on the ALMO model, with tenants setting the strategic
direction and saying what services they want and how they want them to
be run. So we would ask that housing is on the list of those things
that attract the community right to

                           </em> I think it is quite difficult to change
people’s attitudes towards development; we have been trying for
a long time to get people to accept more development. I disagree that
the top-down process was indeed top-down. The regional strategies went
through a full public inquiry. I attended most of those nine regional
inquiries. There was a lot of challenge, a lot of debate, a lot of
people were asking questions about where the evidence had come from.
That evidence is still there and it will still be there. In my opinion,
very few people will be able to show that in their area the evidence
base does not support the kind of housing requirement that was
eventually put into a regional spatial
strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000270">&#160;</a>

for housing. One reason why people have objected to housing is that
they get the pain but they do not get any gain. I am trying to tease
out in what ways people can be much more accepting of a development,
when they see that they will get something for their community and do
not just have more congested roads and more crowded doctors’
surgeries or
classrooms.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000271">&#160;</a>

development is pain with no gain. Housing development is, in itself,
necessary infrastructure that this country needs. We need more housing,
and people have to face the fact that we need more housing. The age of
first-time buyers is going up and people are staying at home far
longer, which is not the best situation for us, as an economically
strong country. Therefore, we need to move people’s views from
housing as a polluter to housing as necessary infrastructure in its own
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000272">&#160;</a>

is slightly different from the house builder’s business model.
We tend to invest and build for the longer term, and we build and hold.
We have good examples of developing good relationships with local
communities, where we can really have grown-up conversations about
those sorts of things. I have to say that section 106 agreements play
an important role in those conversations, because local communities
want some payback, which is not unreasonable. We end up doing some
environmental improvements stretching beyond our site, which benefit
local communities, and none of us has a problem with that. We get
involved in some community facilities and we work with those local
communities. I have experience of representatives of local communities
getting up at planning committee meetings and saying, “We
welcome this development. We want this development to
happen.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000273">&#160;</a>

will not mention any of them by name, but you probably all know who I

probably not fall into that bracket. If there is going to be a really

sort of communities and developments you are planning. I will not
comment specifically on what Andrew has said, but a lot of my
members—Adrian’s company is one of them—are
interested in creating communities, and not in slapping down 500
houses. They are actually interested in creating something that is not
just the homes, but the infrastructure around them. The way they go
about doing that is often a matter of language and of how it is
presented to local communities and local people. They should not come
in and say, “Here’s my plan—take it or leave
it,” but, “This is what we have it in mind to
do—what do you think? Now, let’s actually engage in

                           </em> I think transition is the key one. What do
you do when you move from a regional spatial strategy target into using
your own evidence base, or a different evidence base that I have
suggested will come up with a pretty similar answer? At the moment, we
are fearful because we have seen a number of authorities say they think
the number should be lower. They have no evidence base; they just start
from a position of wanting a lower number. We know why they do that. It
might well be because they don’t think they are going to get the
infrastructure. That is what we have seen.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Only a couple
of local authorities have said, “We want more housing round
here”—and they are indeed in the north-east. We have seen
a lot that have said, “We have got a strategy; we were perfectly
happy with our strategy through the regional strategy and we are going
to carry on with that.” That tends to define the north-west
region. The regional strategy process in the north-west was a lot more
positive than it was in, say, the south-east or south-west, where it
was far more
adversarial.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000282">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have only seen the numbers go down and that is our fear. Therefore, it
will take a few years for people to create the evidence base, do the
housing needs tests and housing market assessments, to see that the
numbers in the regional spatial strategy reflected people’s
requirements and desires—their strategy as a local authority for
growth, for change or for no change. The evidence base is there. Under
the new process, an evidence base will take two years to come
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000283">&#160;</a>

heard some people in the last session say they were not frightened of
the process. They believed that people who are positive and want to do
things will do so no matter what the process—they will do it
almost in spite of the process. Unfortunately, we are seeing people who
are using change as a very negative tool. Therefore, you can make
positive statements such as, “As a country we are pro-growth, we
are pro-development,” but things aren’t changing
radically. You still have to produce a development plan for an area;
you still have to have an evidence base. All of those things are
important to ensure we don’t end up with a hiatus or policy
vacuum.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000284">&#160;</a>

my question is a follow-up. Let us take the difference of opinion about
regional spatial strategies. I suggest that one big hold-up that
constantly happened in terms of your definition of the 5% was that the
5% were often people in the particular neighbourhood, who knew nothing
about the spatial strategy, or even the local development plan, until
the notice was put on the lamp post down the road. Suddenly a furore
built up, councillors were brought in and there were all those delays
that developers constantly talk about.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000285">&#160;</a>

are right; that is how people did feel. Don’t forget that
regional strategies did a lot more than just have housing numbers in
them. They actually looked at a much wider area than local, which
people generally are very poor at doing. We are all very
self-interested. We all like protecting what affects us and when we

value. I take the point about determining whether a property is of
community value early in the game, because quite often a local
community might come to the opinion that property is of some community
value depending on the nature of the planning application that
confronts them. You might have two buildings of exactly the same
dimensions being proposed: one a nursing home, which is fairly neutral,
but the other a bail hostel. If a bail hostel was proposed in your
community, it might be automatically determined that a use had been
found for that land as a community asset and of community value to
avoid getting a bail hostel. Do you confront those sorts of problems on
a regular basis?<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000289">&#160;</a>

are usually resolved through the planning system. Often you will have
something in a site that is designated as being of community value. You
would have to prove to the local planning authority that it would be
provided again elsewhere—that you would put something back on
the site that was of equal value; or that you would put something into
the local community that might be of equal value. Planning is actually
quite good at dealing with those sorts of things.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000290">&#160;</a>

me that there is a danger of unintended consequences here, because I
don’t think that this “land of community value”

enabling local people to get involved in the ownership and control of
assets of community value. It seems to me that there must be a way
through this, if we can say that planning is actually quite good at
dealing with the issue broadly. This narrow issue of who should own it,
if it is to be retained, can be dealt with separately but somehow
parallel with planning. I have not really thought it through enough,

there to do strategic planning. There is no remit for them to do
strategic planning, but they can choose to do so if they want to. One
would hope that they would all want to, because some of these things
require that they think in that way. Obviously, the infrastructure
providers themselves will still need to come forward for
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000295">&#160;</a>

most positive things about planning for the future is that you know
where future development is going to go, and therefore you can plan the
infrastructure. That addresses the problem that you suggested there
was, namely that development happened without the infrastructure coming
forward. If we plan in little pockets without a long-term plan, we
won’t be able to make that investment in long-term
infrastructure; we will just make very small investments in a very
small, localised way. We will never take the big decision to put in a
big water pipe, because we are expecting a lot of
development.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000296">&#160;</a>

major structure through the IPC on one side; we are all relatively
comfortable with that. I agree with Andrew that stuff can be done at
local authority level; that is fine. We are worried about the
in-between position, not because we carry a candle for the regional
level of planning—counties or whatever—but simply because
the duty to co-operate under the Bill, to put it bluntly, seems
spineless.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000297">&#160;</a>

with cross-boundary infrastructure, it will actually happen, and that
the duty to co-operate is not just a tick-box exercise; it
shouldn’t be, “Well, we wrote to the local authority next
door and it never replied”—tick, carry on. I appreciate
that the problem is difficult. Can we put a financial incentive
alongside the duty to co-operate that comes from having done the right
sort of cross-border consultation on bigger-than-local infrastructure?
Or perhaps there could be a penalty, but I suspect that an incentive
would appeal more to Ministers. I think this is an important issue for
the development

to earlier comments. Liz was talking about builders wanting to build
not just houses, but communities. The ward that I represented had an
electorate that went up from 7,000 to 11,000 over 20-odd years, and my
experience was that the builders just wanted to build houses,
preferably on greenfield sites. Despite that large increase in the
number of big housing estates in the ward over those years, there was
not a single shop or pub, or anything other than houses, on those
estates. Apart from a bit of section 106 money for a play area, which
was then usually removed when the kids ruined it, we got very little.
The issue that sprung to mind is the 7,000 empty properties that exist.
It is difficult in a

is about the coming together of a number of different agencies, and if
some of those agencies are not doing what they should do and specifying
what is needed, you probably cannot blame others in the private sector
for taking advantage of that. A proper degree of
local planning will yield the sort of mixed communities you want. There
is good development and there is bad development. Good development
provides a proper, mixed community with shops, leisure facilities and
the right transport infrastructure. That is what I like to think the
good guys whom I represent actually do well. Local authorities have a
big role to play in taking a firm view on what sort of development they
want to see, and working with the developers to deliver
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000300">&#160;</a>

homes back into use. You are absolutely right; I would have no problem
with any strategy that you bring forward to bring empty homes back into

cannot house the generations of the future solely in the empty houses

will mean different things in different areas, won’t it? In some
areas, the viability of the housing will be so low and so marginal that
the amount of money coming from CIL will be relatively
modest—the way that works will be tested through the CIL
process—and there may be very large infrastructure requirements,
too. Perhaps “meaningful” does not mean very much in such
areas, because the money that there is, which will be relatively
modest, will have to go into the infrastructure to ensure that the
development happens at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000304">&#160;</a>

past three years, since we started talking about it. The premise of CIL
is that the amount to be collected is calculated in relation to the
infrastructure that is needed in an area. It is not necessarily massive
infrastructure; it could include community centres, schools, nurseries
and other such things. So one hopes that the infrastructure plan for an
area, which in turn dictates the level of CIL provided by the
developers, would be of benefit to the communities in which development
is to take place. Otherwise, one would wonder why
the infrastructure was being built in the first place. It has to
benefit
somebody.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000306">&#160;</a>

am quite hopeful, and I understand where Ministers are coming from in

communities without having to siphon off too much from the top, thereby
damaging the ability to deliver that infrastructure simply to give a
handout to the community. If it is a small amount, fine, but if you
take a whole lot off the top, you might diminish your ability to
provide the infrastructure that you worked out was needed in the first
place. We need to explore how to do this, and how to do it so that we

back to incentives. Some acknowledgement that incentives, as a tool,
can be adjusted would be useful. So, if Andrew’s problem does
arise, and there are issues about the amount of housing needed for the
country, and we see evidence that housing waiting lists are growing and
there is more homelessness and so on, there has to be an ability to
adjust and to modify the approach. It seems to me that incentives are a
way of doing that, potentially, and there ought to be an
acknowledgement and recognition of that through this

                           </em> We welcome the HRA reform; it is the only game
in town, and there is no other option but that. However, we had been
led to believe that there would be a full and final
settlement, but the Bill seems to leave the door
open for revisiting the matter in the future. Whether there was going
to be further distribution of debt would be a real issue for a lot of
authorities, which did their 30-year plans on the basis of what was in
the original
prospectus.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is something around capital receipts; the original prospectus said that
authorities would keep the capital receipts, but what is happening at
the moment is that they are saying it would be for the life of the CSR
period. Then the receipts would be split between Treasury and the local
authority. We suggest that there ought to be an assumption that they
would be returned to local communities, unless an order is agreed
saying that the Treasury will keep some—that would be for
subsequent CSR
periods.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000329">&#160;</a>

there is security of tenure. Like Liz, we manage housing and
communities, and we manage communities in which a lot of our tenants
need a lot of support in order to sustain the tenancy and their place
within the community. Security of tenure has an enormous effect on
someone’s access to health, education and all sorts of other
things. If housing is not secure, then everything else seems to be at
stake. That is not to say that there might not be some areas where
niche products are needed, and where a short-term tenancy is all that
someone needs, but that is for a specific group of people. For most of
the people that we house in council-owned properties, security of
tenure is absolutely key to work,
education—everything.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000330">&#160;</a>

comments about the business community needing more of a voice. I became
a local councillor in the area in which my business was situated. I
realised that the business community is traditionally unrecognised and
under-represented in terms of a local authority connection. If you
consider their contribution to the well-being of a neighbourhood in
employment provision, community life and character, not to mention the
CSR, many community events and voluntary groups would not exist without
local business support. I would like to explore how you think local
businesses and their contribution could have a greater voice, and how
their contribution to localism could be enhanced. For example, in my
community I set up a local business forum. Could we could set aside
planning for a moment and look at other ways?<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000331">&#160;</a>

can do this, and I am very grateful for the Minister’s interest
in this aspect of the Bill. We have promised Mr Clark that we will look
at pilot areas where one might try to devise a commercially-based
community. We have an interesting model for this already in the
business improvement districts. Leaving aside the planning issues, we
might try to model some of this concept of a commercial neighbourhood
around the business improvement districts. If you took even a smallish
town, a large chunk would be the high street, with shops, perhaps
business units behind that, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 103<a class="bkMark" name="Column103">&#160;</a>
                           </div>some residential streets beyond—it will be a very mixed area.
Under the plans set out in the appropriate schedule, only residents who
pay council tax can band together to bid to become a neighbourhood
forum. So why should we not have businesses, perhaps in conjunction
with residents, being able to bid to become a neighbourhood forum? The
corollary of that is that when you get to a referendum, these
businesses ought to have a vote. So perhaps provision should be made
for business rate payers—although I would like to go further
than business rate payers because a defect of the bid legislation is
that property owners do not have a vote. Sometimes property owners can
be hugely valuable as catalysts for making a neighbourhood work. Look
at the New West End Company, where the business owners drove the
company not, initially, the occupiers. That is our vision for how this
could be created. There could be a wide range of these sorts of things.
Mr Howell and I have talked about the Slough
trading estate—could you have a commercial neighbourhood that is
a large trading estate that determines its own future in accordance
with the strategic objectives of the local plan? It seems entirely
practical.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000332">&#160;</a>

in favour of sustainable development. It is interesting that it figured
significantly in the growth White Paper. It was mentioned in the
foreword and referred to as being a key plank of improving the planning
system and making sure that it was not a barrier to growth. What we
have ended up with in discussions about the Bill is the suggestion that
somehow the presumption in favour of sustainable development is merely
a default position when a local authority has failed to produce a plan.
It seems to me that we are not making the most of a concept that, if we
could define it—and I agree that definition of sustainable
development is an interesting problem—is something we would
presume would be allowed, rather than presuming it was allowed only
when there is no local plan. We could consider including some reference
in the Bill—and we will put an amendment forward to Mr Clark and
his colleagues—to the concept of sustainable development
underpinning development and the national planning policy framework of
the different levels of development, right down to neighbourhood. We
think it would be far more effective if we could at least get it
knobbled, if you like, in the Bill, so that it is up there for
everybody to
see.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000335">&#160;</a>

Whitaker said earlier—his view that people are involved in the
planning system now. That is true, but, under the current system,
consultation is the sort that asks either yes or no to a development;
it does not engage people. In the last session, we heard from volume
developers and house builders that they are moving to a process of real
engagement, because they see a competitive advantage in it. They have
been backed by Adrian and Liz. Clearly, one element of the incentives
argument is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 104<a class="bkMark" name="Column104">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that incentives are not only about cash, but about the level of
engagement. The first question is whether you agree with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000336">&#160;</a>

get the feeling that the HBF is being left behind in all of this, and I
wonder whether that is because you are reflecting the difference
between the volume builders, who may or may not be your members,
and small and medium-sized builders, who probably
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000337">&#160;</a>

point. The HBF is certainly not being left behind, and we certainly
represent all types of developer, including all the people whom you had
sitting here in front of you in the last session. You might not agree
with everything that I say, because you do not necessarily like what I
say, but that does not mean that it is not representative of what the
industry does. The industry will change, and it will do whatever it
needs to do to build houses, because it is a house-building industry
and that is how it makes money, and it will continue to do

whether the existing planning system, or any planning system, is one of
engagement or consultation, you can always do things much better. I
actually think that we had started moving towards an engagement
process, and it can be helped by all sorts of things. We have recently
gone through a consultation on whether planning application fees should
be set locally. We think that you should open up the entire debate to
considering whether the development process should be funded in a very
different way, because, with this engagement with local communities,
the actual submission of the planning application is going to be a tiny
part of the whole development process. We liken it to a golf swing,
where the actual hitting of the ball is a tiny part, and if you do not
get the grip, the backswing and the follow-through right, you will play
a bad golf shot, even though you hit the ball perfectly. Substituting
hitting the golf ball for the planning application, it is a tiny part
of the development process. You are right that we have to get the
backswing, the follow-through and all of this right. We have to engage
people at all those
stages.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000339">&#160;</a>

difficult to engage with everybody. I heard what Alison said. You have
to ask all the right people; you cannot just ask the decision makers.
It depends who the decision makers are. If we start changing the
decision makers, you can bet that we will start talking to different

raised earlier. Are we not seeing a trend of more collaborative working
in local government? If you take the area that I represent in the black
country, the authorities there are co-operating on a several different
issues—sometimes across the political divide. They are already
doing it. Is there any particular reason why they should not,
therefore, take their strategic planning responsibilities seriously?

further.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000342">&#160;</a>

it and that petty squabbles do not get in the way. It is not unknown

slightly view from Liz. There is a danger that the Government
over-regulate the duty to co-operate. You have to allow local

to come together and create their own ways of working. I suspect that
if they do not want to work together, however much Government insist on
it, they will spend all their time resisting doing so, and you are

not because central Government were saying, “You must do it in

said in her introductory remarks that we have not touched on, which is
the national planning policy framework. I would like to hear her views
on that. What is the role of that framework? Should it be detailed
guidance, which is primarily for those people who are developing or
considering schemes in a planning authority, or is it a public
document, which is designed to give a broad thrust of the overall
purpose of planning policies? I am far from clear—I see some
cosmetic virtue in the latter; I see a much more practical virtue in
the former. There is a risk of the two being confused and I would
welcome your
views.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000346">&#160;</a>

push down as much as possible to local neighbourhoods and, in some
cases, local authorities. I do not have a problem with that. Generally,
however, in the analogy with business, it is best to delegate
activities to their lowest level of performance. You still need a
framework at the top, which the management textbooks used to call the
tight-loose theory. You work out the small amount of tightness that you
need to keep at the centre and you write it down, enforce it and do
it—there is no negotiation. Everything else, you shove
down.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000347">&#160;</a>

think that the national planning policy framework will be a very taut,
tight, statement of what you want to achieve, and then everything else
will be shoved down. That makes the planning system and how it handles
sustainability very clear. It would be clear on what is required to
handle the assessment of housing need, and then how that is actually
done would be sent down to the lowest practical level.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000348">&#160;</a>

measures, but will the witnesses think at a broader level? Andrew
Whitaker discussed the pressing need for homes and how, in our history,
development has been a positive contributor to what Britain is today.

experienced a rising tide of resistance to development. Why? What are

                           </em> There has been a sense that development has
been imposed on local people. It is always dangerous to generalise
about such things, because there are some good examples of where
development has happened, has worked, and local people have welcomed
it. In many cases, however, it causes a feeling of imposition on local
communities. They feel that it is development that they do not want,
they did not ask for and they did not vote for, and there is a reaction
against that. In my note, I said that regional government is often seen
as an arm of central Government. So the situation is seen as central
Government imposing on local people. That imposition also includes us
as developers—we have to take it on the chin. The best
situations are where we work with local authorities and communities to
get around the feelings of imposition, and developments
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000352">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think a lot of the concerns are about the
provision of adequate infrastructure, particularly in  the
context of the regional spatial strategies. Frankly, some areas had a
cast-iron argument against them because, in general, there was
inadequate funding of  the infrastructure that was needed to go
with it. That concerned pretty basic stuff, such as water supply and
road transport systems.<a class="bkMark" name="11012668000356">&#160;</a>
