am pleased to hear that you had a good weekend, Sir Nicholas, although
I learnt from my television screen on Sunday afternoon that it seemed
to be more rainy in the north-west than the weather that we were
enjoying in southern England. It might not have been so in
Macclesfield, but it certainly was in
Wigan.</div>
					<a name="08051350000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be pleased to know that the debate will be short, unless
the Minister has something startling to say. The amendment is a simple
probing amendment, and I make no claim to authorship. It would clarify
a small technical point to which an outside professional body has drawn
attention and make it clear that an interest in possession otherwise
than for a fixed term could include a defeasible life interest. I have
no great axe to grind one way or the other on whether a defeasible life
interest is included in the Bill, but I understand from outside
professional bodies that its drafting leaves them in some doubt whether
a defeasible life interest is included or excluded. We therefore
considered that it would be helpful to have definitive clarification
from the Minister. I do not in all honesty believe that the Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>needs to be amended if the right hon. Lady can simply clarify the point
for the benefit of the professionals who are
interested.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000306"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):
						</b> Well,
here goes! Amendment No. 26 operates on the part of the schedule that
determines when entrepreneurs relief is available to trustees. It
seeks, in particular, to make it clear that a beneficiary with a
defeasible life interest in an interest in possession trust may qualify
for relief. I hope that I can demonstrate that the amendment is
unnecessary, although I appreciate the spirit in which it has been
moved. I am aware of the debate among interested parties about whether
a defeasible life interest would be considered an interest for a fixed
term and, hence, excluded from the entrepreneurs relief. I assure the
Committee that the fact that a defeasible interest may be terminated at
some point does not render it an interest for a fixed term. More
fundamentally, the amendment does not provide a definition of
defeasible life interest, so it would fail to provide the degree of
clarification that it may be intended to achieve.</div>
					<a name="08051350000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have provided the help that the hon. Gentleman was seeking and that,

Hammond:
						</b> Clearly, Macclesfield and Wigan are miles apart,
Sir Nicholas.</div>
					<a name="08051350000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 27 and 28
address a more substantive issue than the previous amendment. They
would amend the wording of new section 169K of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which deals with the associated disposal of
assets that have been used in connection with the business of a
partnership or a company, the interest in which is being disposed of by
the individual. In order for an associated disposal to be eligible for
entrepreneurs relief, two conditions have to be met. I particularly
want to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to condition B, which
will be inserted by new section 169K(3), which states:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>
					<a name="08051350000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Condition B is that the
individual makes the disposal as part of the withdrawal of the
individual from participation in the business carried on by the
partnership or by the company or (if the company is a member of a
trading group) a company which is a member of the trading
group.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has been
described as the lock, stock and barrel approach to the disposal of
associated assets. The assets must be disposed of as part of the
individual&#146;s withdrawal from participation in the
business.</div>
					<a name="08051350000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
point, which I hope the Minister will begin to clarify and to which we
might return later, is that the definition is rather vague. What does
&#147;withdrawal from the business&#148; mean? Presumably it does
not mean simply the sale of the shares or of the partnership share, or
ceasing to be employed in the business, because if it did it would say
so. It has to be a more complex concept, and there is concern that it
is not clearly defined. The point of withdrawal from the business will
be important in determining whether the proceeds of the sale of an
associated asset are eligible for taper relief, so I suspect that that
will be the source of some future legal clarification in the courts if
we do not get it right and make absolutely clear the precise meaning of
withdrawal of the individual from participation in the business. Does
it mean on the same day, in the same month or in the same year? Does it
mean that at the time the individual undertook the first action, he was
planning in his mind the second action as some kind of package concept?
Is it a motive test? Those are important questions.</div>
					<a name="08051350000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">My understanding of the Bill is
that an individual could not withdraw from the business, whether it is
a company or a partnership, and dispose of the asset at a later date,
because that would not be part of his withdrawal from the business. The
Minister might tell us that there are certain cases in which
withdrawing from the business and disposing of an asset at a later date
would constitute part of the withdrawal from the business, but we need
some clarity on what those circumstances will be.</div>
					<a name="08051350000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall suggest a couple of
examples. Let us suppose that somebody owned farm land that was farmed
by a partnership of which he was a partner or by a company in which he
was a shareholder, and that he chose to dispose of his interest in that
partnership or company. He made that known to his partners or
co-shareholders and they were unable to raise the financial wherewithal
to buy his interest in the asset&#151;the farm land&#151;that is
used in association with the business&#151;so he allowed them to
continue to use the asset, perhaps while they tried to raise the
finance to buy him
out.</div>
					<a name="08051350000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can envisage
many similar scenarios, for example a GP in a GP partnership who wished
to retire and cease to take an active role in the partnership, but
whose partners were unable at that time to buy out his interest in the
separately held asset&#151;the premises in which the partnership
operated. Partners in a small accountancy firm might be in the same
position. One can think of many examples where the interest in the
property will be retained until either a new partner joins the
partnership or a new shareholder brings capital into the company, or
the existing partners and shareholders are able to raise the capital to
buy out the associated
asset.</div>
					<a name="08051350000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that the Minister explains what is intended here&#151;whether there
is an intentional barrier 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>to an asset used in association with a business being eligible for taper
relief and if so, to what extent that barrier is intentionally erected.
The Committee needs to know whether there are other cases, which the
Minister has not signalled, where there would be intentional barriers
to taper relief being available&#151;in other words, a defect in the
way the provision will work. The group of amendments simply remove the
requirement for a disposal to be part of
withdrawal.</div>
					<a name="08051350000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
debated whether any business asset should be eligible for entrepreneurs
relief and the Minister made it clear that as a matter of policy that
was not the Government&#146;s intention. I do not seek to reopen that
debate. The group of amendments requires that the disposal be made
subsequent to the individual&#146;s withdrawal from the business.
That would not cover a situation wherein somebody continuing the
business could sell the asset and benefit from taper relief, but it
would cover a situation wherein somebody who is withdrawing from the
business can retain the asset, allow it to continue to be used in the
business and then obtain taper relief on its subsequent sale.</div>
					<a name="08051350000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is tempting to think of the
asset always as land or buildings, but it might be plant and machinery,
or intellectual property. The individual who is exiting might own the
patent upon which a manufacturing business is built, or a brand name
which the company will continue to use in trading. It is not uncommon
that a business needs to establish continuity by continuing under a
trade name or a brand image, even if it will not be allowed to do so
indefinitely.</div>
					<a name="08051350000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
qualifying requirement in subsection (4) is also amended to require
that when the asset is disposed of, it has been in use during the
preceding year for the purposes of the business. It will need to be
owned by the individual claiming the entrepreneurs&#146; relief and
to have been in use in the business, but the individual himself will
not need to have been engaged in that business. That is the soft exit
provision, which will allow a partner who is retiring in circumstances
where his partners cannot buy out the asset to avoid cratering the
business by insisting on a third-party sale. There are real practical
reasons for such a provision and I hope that the Minister can clarify
what the Government&#146;s intentions are and how in practice we can
avoid some of the pitfalls that I have
outlined.</div>

							<b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): My contribution will be brief,
and it follows on from the points made by the hon. Member for Runnymede
and Weybridge. Where a partner withdraws completely and can dispose of
every asset immediately and fully, one would imagine that they would be
able to benefit from the release. However, in the case that within the
same financial year&#151;this is not uncommon in small
businesses&#151;the business runs into difficulty and the individual
is called back on a paid or consultant basis, have they breached the
rules? Have they fully withdrawn, and will they still receive the
relief that they initially anticipated receiving on withdrawal,
although they have been called back in extremis? That is an important
point. People have contractual obligations not to re-engage with
another firm, but they may be called back to assist the partnership.
Would the relief still apply in those
circumstances?</div>

point, which I shall address in a moment. I can confirm that on Sunday
afternoon, Liverpool, Wavertree, was deluged with what appeared to be a

a particular event that was taking place in Wigan, much to the

gardening as I was, it being otherwise good weather.</div>
					<a name="08051350000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 27 and 28 would alter the rules governing the disposal of assets
associated with a business. In particular, they would remove the
requirement for associated disposals to be made alongside the
withdrawal of an individual from the business in question. As such,
they would dilute the targeting of entrepreneurs relief.</div>
					<a name="08051376000001"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are unnecessary.
In constructing schedule 3, the Government have deliberately focused
entrepreneurs relief on individuals who are disposing of all or part of
their business.</div>

disposal occurs as part of the overall process of withdrawal, either
before or after the material disposal of shares or partnership
interests. We have not imposed intentional barriers to entrepreneurs
relief&#151;that was never our objective. What we have deliberately
focused on, however, is the provision of relief to individuals who
withdraw from participation in a business. The eligibility criteria are
not meant to replicate criteria for the old taper relief. It depends on
the facts of the case, but it is possible for someone to withdraw from
a business and make an associated disposal at a later date. If the
disposal is linked to the withdrawal from participation, the individual
may receive relief. We need to take a fair view of the case based on
the
facts.</div>

						</b> What the right hon. Lady says sounds reasonable
in general terms: there will be an opportunity for a case to be made,
case by case, and the outcome will depend on the case. However, she is
saying that no one will ever be sure. Will there be a pre-clearance
regime, whereby someone intending to make a disposal and a subsequent
associated disposal can obtain Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
pre-clearance, so that that the disposal, in the circumstances that
have been defined, will be eligible for entrepreneurs relief? There was
a pre-clearance authorisation procedure under taper
relief.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000315"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I do not believe that to be the case. Clearly, an
application for relief would be made. The case would have to be
presented as I have described. There will be occasions when the facts
of the case merit relief and other occasions when they do not. It is
not fair for someone effectively to convert a business asset into an
investment by holding on to an asset after 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>leaving the business. The rules are flexible, as cases vary, so they
need to cater for that. The key point, however, is that asset
disposal&#151;the disposal of shares or shares in a
partnership&#151;where relevant in the cessation of the business is
all part of one overall event or process. I have accepted that the
disposal does not have to take place all at one immediate
moment.</div>

							<a name="08051350000316"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The right hon. Lady said a moment ago that it
would be unfair for a retiring partner or shareholder to be able to
convert an asset into an investment asset and then secure taper relief
on it. That will not happen, because of the provision that the payment
of rent disqualifies someone from entrepreneurs relief. My examples
were deliberately constructed to present examples where the partner,
out of consideration as it were for the other partners or his
co-shareholders, was prepared to leave an asset in the business, rather
than destroy the business by insisting on selling it to a third party.
He would not receive rent, so it would not be an investment because of
the Bill&#146;s provisions on
rent.</div>

							<a name="08051350000317"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I believe that I am right in saying that the hon.
Member for Gosport raised that issue when we began to debate
entrepreneurs relief, and we will discuss it in greater detail in the
next group of amendments&#151;I hope that I will then have something
to say that gives some comfort to the hon. Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge. The key point is how and why the assets are being disposed
of. In response to the hon. Member for Dundee, East, if a partner
withdrew and sold everything, but was called back in the circumstances
he described&#151;I accept that that is not uncommon&#151;they
could still qualify for relief, if the facts of the case merited it. If
a partner came back as an employee or consultant, that, too, would not
prevent application for relief. There is some scope in the arrangements
for the kind of case described and for application to
HMRC.</div>
					<a name="08051350000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would allow some individuals to withdraw from active participation in a
business, but to continue providing assets to the business. As I said
at the outset, I believe that that dilutes the targeting of the relief
and is therefore undesirable. We do not believe that such a scenario is
a desirable target for the benefits of entrepreneurs relief in general.
The amendments would have the perhaps unintended consequence of
restricting entitlement in cases where a business ceases trading, but
the individual only disposes of their share of the business at a later
date. Under the current rules, an associated disposal may qualify at
the time that the business ceases, and the amendments would prevent
relief from being due in such
cases.</div>
					<a name="08051350000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">One final point
on the clearance procedure, about which the hon. Member for Runnymede
and Weybridge asked, may help. There is no clearance procedure beyond
the normal procedures for engaging with the tax office. The facts
cannot be determined in advance, but the issue was not a problem with
retirement relief. There is no reason to think that it would be a
practical problem
now.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000318"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The right hon. Lady is right that the matter must
be determined on the basis of the facts. My understanding of the
pre-clearance regime under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>taper relief was that the facts were set out by the taxpayer or his
advisers. In effect, the scheme that was to be undertaken was set out,
and HMRC gave a pre-clearance on the basis of approval, subject to all
the matters set out in the taxpayer&#146;s statement being carried
out. If the taxpayer deviated or the facts changed, the pre-clearance
would be void. However, the fact that it all hinges on what happens
does not mean that it is impossible to obtain pre-clearance. If it
were, the whole concept of a pre-clearance regime would fall
apart.</div>

to think carefully about his remarks and examples. I believe that the
advice that I have been given is correct, but I want to test it against
his remarks. I do not believe that the amendments are necessary for the
reasons that I have explained. They would dilute the targeting of
entrepreneurs relief. We will discuss a related issue under the next
group of amendments, when we will examine this matter further, so I
hope that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08051350000320"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> I am not merely disappointed, but quite alarmed
by what the Financial Secretary has said. I thought that she would
explain how somewhere in the obscurity of the schedule, it was
perfectly clear that a disposal at a later date in the circumstances
that I outlined would be eligible for entrepreneurs relief. In fact,
she has left me more concerned than I was at the beginning of the
debate. She says that she is confident that her advice is right, but it
is not clear what that advice is. I still have not heard whether a
disposal a year or two years after an individual withdraws from a
business, in the circumstances that I have set out, would be eligible
for entrepreneurs
relief.</div>
					<a name="08051350000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must avoid
two things in this Committee. First, we must avoid creating more
uncertainty in our tax system. The eight months since the pre-Budget
report and the changes to the capital gains tax regime have been
characterised by lack of certainty and clarity, which is hugely
damaging to business interests. The thought of introducing complicated
provisions, which are clouded with uncertainty as to what would, and
would not, be allowed, and in what circumstances, and which apparently
are not capable of being subject to a pre-clearance regime, fills me
with horror.</div>
					<a name="08051350000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may be
wrong, but I anticipate that on leaving the room after this sitting, I
will hear from various professional bodies that they feel the same way.
They will agree that there is a degree of uncertainty, which is
becoming greater as the Financial Secretary attempts to answer the
questions that are raised. I am very concerned about this issue. She
has rightly observed that the next group of amendments touches on a
similar area, but it is in this area that I wish to stand in the ditch.
The next group of amendments merely pushes the envelope still
further.</div>
					<a name="08051350000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Financial Secretary consider the following proposal and perhaps clarify
the issue in the next debate? If there is no pre-clearance regime, if
the provision is woolly because decisions will be made on a
case-by-case basis, and if she cannot answer specific questions at the
Dispatch Box about whether or not the examples I have given will
qualify, for the sake of clarity will she consider giving an assurance
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>HMRC will publish specific guidance, with examples, showing cases where
it would normally be expected that a disposal of an associated asset,
after the withdrawal of an individual from that business, would be
eligible for entrepreneurs
relief?</div>

					<a name="08051350000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we
must avoid inadvertently&#151;I assume that this has been done
through inadvertence, not malice&#151;creating a situation in which
the withdrawal of an individual from a business leads to the collapse
of that business, because the other individuals are not in a position
to acquire an asset that he holds and which is used in association with
the business. That is not an uncommon structure, and it would be a
disaster if we inadvertently created such a
situation.</div>

							<a name="08051350000333"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> New section 169P of the TCGA 1992 deals with the
restriction imposed in respect of the disposal of an associated asset
that has not been used entirely for business purposes throughout the
period of ownership, or where rent has been received for the use of
that asset. Although I touched on the provision in relation to the
previous group of amendments, in this case, the situation is one where
the asset during the period prior to cessation of or withdrawal from
the business has been used not wholly for business purposes, or where
rent has been received. The classic example used in such tax cases of
an asset used not wholly for business purposes is that of a farm with a
residential farm house on it. There can be no issue in principle that
where an asset is used partly for non-business purposes, some form of
apportionment must be made. That is a fair approach.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>
					<a name="08051350000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is that there is no
starting date for the period over which apportionment must be made. The
wording appears to apply to a period beginning with the date when the
asset is first acquired. That means that relief will be denied in some
cases where common sense suggests that it should be available. The
amendment suggests a start date&#151;not quite plucked at
random&#151;of two years before the start of this tax year.
Therefore, previous use of an asset would be disregarded provided that
it has been in business use for the past two years and remains so until
the point of disposal. The two years mirror the taper relief regime
requirement. The measure is not susceptible to manipulation or
avoidance strategies, as it is dependent on what happened in a previous
period&#151;the last two years. For the purpose of the clause, there
is nothing that anybody can do now to change the status of an asset to
claim some advantage. I hope that the Minister will respond to that
substantive point.</div>
					<a name="08051350000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second problem in proposed
new section 169P, is found on page 126 of the Bill, where four tests
are set out. Tests (a) and (b) are defined by reference to the period
in which the asset is in the ownership of the individual. Tests (c) and
(d) are defined by reference to the period that the asset has been in
use in the business. They are different tests, and it is easy to
envisage&#151;again, using the farm land example&#151;an asset that
may have been in use in a business for many years, but that may have
been owned by the individual in question, perhaps through inheritance,
for a significantly shorter period. There is an issue about those two
different tests. </div>
					<a name="08051350000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">If,
for any part of the period that the asset has been in use in the
business, the individual has not been involved in the carrying on of
the business, or if for any period rent has been received, relief is
proportionately denied. For example, in a farming business where the
land is owned separately, if the individual inherits land but the land
has been in use in the business for a longer period, entrepreneurs
relief will be partially disallowed. It appears that even if the asset
has always been used in the business, he will only be entitled to
relief for the fraction of the gain that represents the fraction of his
period of involvement in the business out of the total period of use of
the asset in the
business.</div>
					<a name="08051350000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us put
this into numbers. Let us say that a piece of farm land has been used
by a farming business for a hundred years; if the current generation or
individual inherited the land and became involved with the farming
business five years ago, he would be entitled only to five
one-hundredths of the gain eligible for entrepreneurs
relief&#151;that is how I and others outside the House read the Bill.
I cannot believe that Ministers intend that. If there is some obscure
provision that makes good this problem, I am sure that the Minister
will tell us. Again, we need to hear what is policy and what is
potentially a query or question mark around the drafting. Is it really
the Government&#146;s policy that if farm land has been used for a
hundred years in association with a business, but the individual
currently making the disposal has only been involved in the business
for five years, only five one-hundredths of the gain are
eligible?</div>
					<a name="08051350000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
where relief has to be apportioned, either because of the rental test
or because of the ownership or involvement tests, there is a just and
reasonable test for apportionment. To be fair, there are some bases for

<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>what is just and reasonable set out in new section 169P(5), but we need
a commitment from the Minister to publish HMRC guidance about how the
tests will apply. The tests set out in subsection (5) are vague, to put
it mildly. They do not say specifically that every case will be a pro
rata apportionment; they simply say that regard will be had to the
various factors&#151;length of time held and the period of
involvement. We and practitioners need to understand how regard will be
had to those factors and what formula will be applied. The Bill does
not make that
clear.</div>
					<a name="08051350000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are also a couple of issues in relation to amendment No. 34, which
would deal with the rental issue by deleting reference to receipt of
rental as a disqualifying characteristic. We understand that a property
letting business is not in itself a trading business, but where the
asset is used for the purpose of an associated trading business, it
appears to be different. As the Minister will know, the acquisition of
assets from outside the business to be used in conjunction with the
business was positively encouraged by the taper relief regime, which
allowed taper relief for such assets. An asset that is acquired and
financed separately and let to a company or a partnership is a vital
part of the financing strategy of many small businesses. It allows
flexibility if partners change or if not all practising partners are
able to invest in the asset.</div>
					<a name="08051350000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem with the proposed
new section is that its impact is retrospective. Even if the
arrangements were changed and rent stopped being paid now, the lack of
a start date, which I referred to earlier, means that that asset will
forever be caught by the provisions. That needs to be considered very
carefully in the context of how it undermines the financing
arrangements that are often used in small businesses and of how it
introduces added
complexity.</div>
					<a name="08051350000260"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

					<a name="08051350000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the document
published to support the Budget note &#147;Capital Gains Tax: Relief
on Disposal of a Business (Entrepreneurs&#146; Relief)&#148;,
example 6 set out an a situation in which Mr. R has been a
member of a trading partnership for several years. He leaves the
partnership and disposes of his interest, realising gains of
&#163;125,000, all of which qualify for entrepreneurs relief. He also
sells the partnership office building, which he owned outright but let
to the partnership, realising a gain of &#163;37,000. I hope that the
Minister picks up on that point, because it is from the
Treasury&#146;s note. The note
states:</div>
					<a name="08051350000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
disposal of the office building is &#145;associated&#146; with
Mr. R&#146;s withdrawal from the partnership business, and
the &#163;37,000 gain therefore also qualifies for
entrepreneurs&#146; relief (assuming there is no restriction on the
amount of gain qualifying for relief as a result of non-qualifying
use).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
phrase in brackets suggests that the non-qualifying use is the payment
of rent, but I suggest to the Financial Secretary that the term
&#147;let to the partnership&#148; ordinarily implies that it was
let for rent. The example given in the Budget note is at the very least
extremely confusing, because it states that where the building has been
let to the partnership, relief will be available unless there is a
non-qualifying use, but the Bill states that any letting in the normal
sense&#151;for rent&#151;will disqualify that asset entirely.
Perhaps the Minister will consider those points and our concern about
how that provision will distort and undermine 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>financing structures commonly used in small businesses and once again,

Kennedy:
						</b> The group of amendments would relax the
conditions under which entitlement to entrepreneurs relief for
associated disposals may be restricted. Those restrictions apply where
an asset was only partly deployed for business use or where the asset
or individual was involved in the business for only part of the
qualifying period. Amendment No. 33 would apply those restrictions by
reference to the situation after 6 April 2006, effectively disregarding
anything that happened earlier. The hon. Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge argues that we should effectively write off everything that
happened before April 2006. However, where an asset was only partly in
business use, we believe that it is right to restrict the relief, and
that is part of how the relief is targeted. I shall address his point
about rent received in the past shortly.</div>
					<a name="08051350000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 34 to 37 would
remove one of the restrictions entirely so that receiving rent for the
use of an asset would not prejudice entitlement to entrepreneurs relief
on that asset. When considering the extent to which an asset was used
for business purposes, it is right to restrict the relief if the
conditions for an associated disposal were only partly met. Where an
individual receives rent for the use of an asset, the amount of
entrepreneurs relief should be restricted. Where an individual is
receiving rent in exchange for the use of an asset by a business, that
is more akin to an arm&#146;s-length investment and is not an
appropriate target for relief.</div>
					<a name="08051350000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the restrictions
involve looking back over the entire period of ownership of an asset,
which could involve substantial periods before the introduction of
entrepreneurs relief in April 2008, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed
out, and I acknowledge that that is considered by some to have
overtones of retrospection. Amendment No. 33 seeks to mitigate that
element by taking out of account that period of ownership before 6
April 2006.</div>
					<a name="08051350000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
restriction in cases where rent was paid for use of the asset has also
attracted adverse comment for a second reason. Receipt of rent, whether
at a market rate or otherwise, did not result in any restriction on the
availability of business asset taper relief on disposal of the asset in
question. I acknowledge the concerns voiced by the hon. Gentleman. I am
aware that the approach under the Bill differs from the taper relief
treatment of assets provided in exchange for rent. The amendments would
deal with that point by removing the restrictions altogether, but that
approach is not
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08051350000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, the hon. Gentleman has touched on a legitimate concern regarding
the receipt of rent, so although I do not believe that his amendments
are the right way forward, I undertake to consider his case for
disregarding rent received before April 2008 when assessing entitlement
to entrepreneurs relief. The hon. Gentleman asked if guidance will be
available. It will be, and I shall invite HMRC to publish draft
guidance for consideration before we discuss the matter on Report, or
sooner if possible.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
thank the Minister for making that concession in relation to the
amendments, but I want to know the Government&#146;s thinking. Part
of our confusion arises from the fact that we do not quite understand
the Government&#146;s intentions, given the various changes in taper
relief and the desire to simplify the capital gains tax and related
regime. What is their thinking in introducing the additional level of
complication caused by working out the reliefs? Can the right hon. Lady
explain in a couple of sentences why the Government are trying to drive
forward such a complicated
proposal?</div>

							<a name="08051350000336"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> As I said in my opening comments, our intention
was to consider the individual at the point at which the claim for
relief was sought. The involvement of that individual was the focus of
the work on the proposals. However, I acknowledge the criticism that
the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made of the example in the
explanatory note. I will seek to clarify the matter for consideration
on Report. The purpose of the proposal was to make sure that
entrepreneurs relief was targeted in the appropriate way as intended
when we set out the reasoning behind it. I shall return on Report to
the genuine concerns expressed by the hon. Gentleman today. I hope that
he accepts my response in the spirit in which it is intended and
acknowledges that it would not be helpful at this stage to press the
amendment to a

matter of principle, she wishes to exclude assets when rent is being
received, but that she might be persuaded that the retrospection
implied in the drafting of the Bill would be unfair and unreasonable,
at least in some cases. I am grateful to her for taking that on board.
I just hope that when we discuss the Bill on Report, other matters will
not drown out consideration of such important details and that we shall
have a proper opportunity to scrutinise the Government&#146;s

							<a name="08051350000339"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>As we have had several debates on schedule
3, I would not rise at this stage if it were not that some issues have
arisen since amendments were tabled. I would like to run through those
five&#151;or perhaps six&#151;points now, in the hope that the
Minister will be able to comment on them.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>
					<a name="08051350000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
overall concern that entrepreneurs relief has been lifted from the old
retirement relief. That system had become complex and, at the time it
was abolished, had begun to throw up problems. It appears that some of
those problems have been imported into the entrepreneurs relief. May I
ask the Minister to consider whether the restriction on personal
companies is appropriate in a world where the limited liability
partnership is available as an alternative business structure, and is
not subject to any such restrictions? Are the Government pushing
entrepreneurs towards the limited liability partnership route? That
would be the effect of the different treatment of partnerships and
companies. People who expect to have equitable interests below
5 per cent. would be strongly advised to go down that route,
where they would not be subject to a disqualification&#151;which they
would be in a company&#151;for holding less than 5 per cent. That
seems inequitable. Unless the Minister says that there is a deliberate
strategy to encourage certain types of business to go down that route,
it looks like a careless failure to update the dusted-off retirement
relief to reflect that alternative business structure, which was not
available when retirement relief was
operating.</div>
					<a name="08051350000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then there
is the whole or part of a business test for a disposal, which is
distinct from taper relief, where all business assets were eligible.
That test, which also applied in retirement relief, is difficult and
problematic and is likely to lead to complex disputes and probably
litigation.</div>
					<a name="08051350000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second issue is transitional relief. Why did the Government set their
face against at least a transitional&#151;perhaps five
years&#151;lifting of the many restrictions on reliefs? Instead, they
forced a mad scramble for the exit door, with sub-optimal outcomes for
both the economy and individuals, which left many aggrieved. Would be
vendors who could not get it done in time for the abolition of taper
relief are yet another group looking forward to the opportunity to give
the Government a good kicking in a general
election.</div>
					<a name="08051350000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
point relates to proposed new section 169I(6)(b) on page 120, line 42.
The requirement to be an officer or an employee is iniquitous because
it does not mirror the provisions in respect of limited liability
partnerships. The Government should reconsider that. If they have a
principled objection to investors who are not involved in the
day-to-day running of the business benefiting from entrepreneurs
relief, the provisions for the disposal of interests in limited
liability partnerships are defective. The practical effect is that an
investor taking a role in a limited liability partnership will be
entitled to entrepreneurs relief on the disposal of his interest, while
an investor in shares in a company, if he is not an officer or employee
of that company, will not be entitled to entrepreneurs
relief.</div>

Field:
						</b> I am following with great interest what my hon.
Friend says. Does he not think that the measure runs entirely counter
to the Government&#146;s intention in the Legal Services Act 2007?
Limited partners, for example, have a number of outside investors
coming into law firms who are seeking to develop their business
overseas and have an outside investment. My hon. Friend&#146;s point
is not simply an academic issue&#151;it is something that is likely
to have practical relevance in very short
order.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000341"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right, and he has much more
knowledge than I in that field of legislation. A theme is developing.
The Minister has not been particularly forthcoming in clarifying
matters, but I am seeking to understand why on the one hand there is a
clear Government policy decision to encourage one type of behaviour and
discourage another, while on the other, what we actually have is vague
drafting, a lack of clarity or the use of provisions from old,
redundant legislation, which will give rise to unintended consequences.
If we know that the Government intend a consequence and we do not like
it, we can have a political debate, but I suspect that in many areas,
it is not that the Government have deliberately set their face against
an outcome, but have inadvertently created a trap into which some
classes of entrepreneurs may accidentally fall.</div>
					<a name="08051350000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition do not advocate nominal directorship, and I have said so
already in the course of our proceedings. It would be bad legislation
if we created an environment that drove people who are passive
investors to become notional employees or officers of a company, simply
for tax relief purposes. I would like confirmation that that is also
the Government&#146;s view. At present, there is no provision to
allow the sale of an asset used in a business before the individual
withdraws. We have discussed in relation to one of the amendments a
circumstance in which the asset is sold after the individual has
withdrawn from the business. What about the real-world scenario, where
an asset is sold before the individual withdraws? For example, a farmer
who is merrily farming his 100 acres is made an unrefusable offer by a
developer who wants to buy four acres for an enormous sum of money.
That is probably unlikely in present market substances, but let us
imagine another day when the sun is shining. Having made the decision
to sell that piece of his holding, the farmer decides that he can
retire and wishes to sell the remainder of the farm. In those
circumstances, he would not be entitled to relief on the initial sale
of the land, which may be by far the more valuable asset with a bigger
capital gain, but will be entitled to relief only on the subsequent
sale of the remainder of the farm. Perhaps the Minister will confirm
that that is the case, and whether she thinks that it is proper. I draw
attention to proposed new section 169I(8)(b), because if that farm was
operated by a partnership, the partners would be able to dispose of
that land and obtain the benefit of entrepreneurs relief. Sole traders,
however, are once again disadvantaged.</div>
					<a name="08051350000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">A point made
by the Law Society&#151;I am not an expert on trusts&#151;is that
many trustees carry on business. There are strong reasons why trustees,
particularly those controlling trusts that comprise farmland, may wish
to continue business. Under the Bill, trustees are eligible for
entrepreneurs relief only if the asset is used by a beneficiary of the
trust in the carrying-on of a business by the beneficiary. There are
also very tough restrictions on the ability of trustees to obtain
entrepreneurs relief on the disposal of shareholdings. Why is
entrepreneurs relief not routinely available to trustees when carrying
on a business in their own
right?</div>
					<a name="08051350000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
concept of a disposal being part of the withdrawal of an individual
from participation in a business is far from clear. Those who make a
living dealing with these matters think that there is scope for endless
debate and that it is inevitable that there will be litigation on what
constitutes a withdrawal. Would the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>Financial Secretary come up with a crisper definition of the term
&#147;withdrawal from business&#148; that ordinary unadvised
entrepreneurs can understand? We must bear in mind the fact that the
maximum value of entrepreneurs relief is &#163;80,000. We are not
talking about large-scale corporate disposals with the involvement of
lots of high-powered lawyers and accountants. In many cases we are
dealing with entrepreneurs who will have the benefit of relatively
straightforward advice from the local auditors and accountants whom
they routinely use. With that, I have concluded the exhaustive list of
points that needed to be made about schedule
3.</div>
					<a name="08051350000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000342"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I had hoped to have a very brief debate on
schedule 3 stand part, if any. The hon. Gentleman has raised some new
matters, but I do not accept that entrepreneurs relief is simply a
rehash of retirement relief. It shares some of the same features, but
it differs in a number of important respects. For example, there is a
shorter and simpler qualifying period and there is no minimum age for
qualification.</div>
					<a name="08051350000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
earlier debates on the schedule, we discussed why there were no
transitional provisions. A period of notice of the changes was given
when the announcement was made at the pre-Budget report, although I
accept that entrepreneurs relief was not announced until January. There
has been a period of consultation, and people had time to act if they
wished to do so. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked why
there was an officer or employee requirement, and said that that would
unfairly influence behaviour in an unwelcome way. I reiterate that
relief is targeted at people who have a full stake in the business.
Partners have that stake. External investors in companies do not
participate in the same way, and so are subject to an extra employee or
officer test. It is not our intention to encourage the creation of
artificial partnerships. As I have said, I will monitor the progress of
entrepreneurs relief. The hon. Gentleman asked whether passive
investors will simply become officers of the company. The officer or
employee test is a pragmatic way to check active participation in a
business. As I have said, passive investors have other tax advantage
options open to them, such as the enterprise investment
scheme.</div>
					<a name="08051350000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked why we should have personal company rules, and whether
all new businesses will be set up as limited liability partnerships as
a result. Businesses will continue to be set up in a variety of ways
for a variety of commercial reasons. Tax, including the availability of
entrepreneurs relief, will be just one factor that people can take into
account in deciding on the business structure that is right for them.
The differences between the capital gains tax rules for partnerships
and companies reflect their different natures. As far as entrepreneurs
relief in companies is concerned, the requirement to hold at least a 5
per cent. stake in the company strikes a fair
balance.</div>
					<a name="08051350000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked why there is a test on the disposal of all or part of
the business. That is part of the targeting of relief on people who
withdraw from a business. Entrepreneurs relief is not intended to
replicate the taper relief. As I have said repeatedly, entrepreneurs
relief is aimed at entrepreneurs. If relief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>is to be extended to trustees who hold shares in the same company, it is
right that the individual beneficiary should have a direct stake in the
company, as well as being directly involved in the business as an
officer or employee of the
company.</div>
					<a name="08051350000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed the definition of &#147;withdrawal from
participation&#148;. I do not think that it is difficult to define. I
am sure that the hon. Gentleman is right about lawyers seeking to argue
the case, but the provisions in the schedule complement the simplified
capital gains tax regime with focused tax relief for entrepreneurs.
Taken together, that major reform of the capital gains tax regime will
deliver a system that is more sustainable and straightforward for
taxpayers, while remaining internationally competitive. Having answered
as many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions as I can, I hope that
he will allow schedule 3 to go forward under a fair
wind.</div>
					<a name="08051350000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000343"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The genesis of entrepreneurs relief took place in
the panic reaction to the tidal wave of anger that followed the
announcements in the PBR. If Treasury Ministers have learnt one thing
over the past seven or eight months, they should be trying to soothe
people who are angry. The Minister has just told the Committee that
people had a satisfactory period of notice, because they knew what the
new rules were since the PBR last year. However, they did not know what
the new rules were at all, because Downing street was briefing within
24 hours that there would be some kind of U-turn on the announcement in
the pre-Budget report. No one knew where they stood until January. Even
then, the level of trust in Government announcements was so eroded that
people were still not confident that they understood the system. The
right hon. Lady said that people had had the opportunity to act if they
wanted to, but I can tell her that that statement will provoke anger
among many people who have tried and failed to exit businesses before
the cut-off date for taper relief, having had to wait until January to
see what the final shape of the regime would
be.</div>
					<a name="08051350000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister told
us that the structure of the relief was designed to reflect the fact
that shareholders enjoy full participation in a business, and that
investors in a company do not. I am afraid that that just reinforces
the prejudice among Conservative Members about the Government not
understanding how smaller and medium businesses work. In practice,
limited liability partnerships and limited companies are now
alternative structures, which can be used in most cases for the same
purposes in setting up a business. There is no difference in fact, and
now a clear tax advantage is being given to the limited liability
partnership, which in itself sends a
signal.</div>
					<a name="08051350000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed with the Minister&#146;s response in the stand part
debate. She has said that she will return to schedule 3 on Report, and
I am grateful that she will do so. We are happy to engage in any
discussions between now and Report, so I shall not ask my hon. Friends
to vote against schedule 3 at this stage of the Bill&#146;s

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): Sir
Nicholas, what a great pleasure it is to serve under your
chairmanship&#151;this is my first opportunity to speak during our
proceedings. I am delighted to learn that the sun was shining over the
fine county of Cheshire at the weekend&#151;long may that continue.
The sun was also shining over the fine county of Hertfordshire on
Sunday.</div>
					<a name="08051350000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to take the opportunity to make a few remarks on the
Government&#146;s policy on inheritance tax and the provisions
contained in clause 8, with the details set out in schedule 4. We have
tabled a number of amendments about those details, which I will address
when we reach that point.</div>
					<a name="08051350000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative party welcomes attempts to address the issue of the
increased burden of inheritance tax. In 1997-98, 3 per cent. of estates
paid inheritance tax, but according to the most recent figures, that is
now up to 6 per cent. Research for Scottish Widows showed that
37 per cent. of households are now worth more than the inheritance tax
threshold. The average detached house price last September was
&#163;326,000&#151;above the then threshold for inheritance tax of
&#163;300,000. The average house price may have changed since then.
None the less, inheritance tax is a concern for a far wider group of
people than was the case not so long ago. In my constituency,
relatively modest properties in towns such as Rickmansworth,
Berkhamsted and Tring&#151;attractive towns, I would
concede&#151;are well above the inheritance tax threshold. There is
great concern about inheritance tax and it would be churlish for us not
to welcome the move of allowing the nil-rate band to be transferred
between spouses and civil partners, as clause 8 and schedule 4 would
permit.</div>
					<a name="08051350000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not everybody
welcomes those provisions. In <i class="I">The Guardian</i> of 12 October, Polly
Toynbee was most critical. I am sure, Sir Nicholas, that like me you
read Ms Toynbee&#146;s articles with great interest. She
stated:</div>
					<a name="08051350000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
was more than a horrible humiliation for the Prime Minister. This was
the week that social democracy ebbed away in
England.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, she
makes a clear distinction between what is occurring with the devolved
Administrations in Scotland and Wales, and what is happening in
England. She went on to describe inheritance tax as &#147;a Labour
talisman&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051350000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a recent pamphlet, the Fabian Society described the announcement of the
Government&#146;s policy on the issue
as</div>
					<a name="08051350000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a profoundly
depressing moment for those interested in fair
taxation&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051350000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
share that view. We think the fact that inheritance tax now applies to
a much wider group of people is unfair. There is consensus that there
is a role for it, but to apply it to relatively modest homes and
estates seems wrong. When inheritance tax hits ordinary families in
ordinary homes, it is right that it is reformed.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>
					<a name="08051350000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we do agree with some
of the criticisms made by the likes of Polly Toynbee and the Fabian
Society. The policy was a response to the Conservative party&#146;s
policy on the matter, and the announcement by my hon. Friend the Member
for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) in Blackpool on 1 October, about
raising the threshold for inheritance tax to &#163;1,000,000. The
Fabian Society paper describes the Prime Minister&#146;s
&#147;panic-stricken failure&#148; to stand his ground, and the
pre-Budget report as a &#147;panic-driven
surrender&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051350000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
letter to <i class="I">The Guardian</i> on 15 April 2008 by various notable

					<a name="08051350000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government&#146;s
retreat in the face of a rightwing challenge over inheritance
tax&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051350000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter was
signed by 14 Labour MPs, including one Parliamentary Private
Secretary. I know that Parliamentary Private Secretaries are not
necessarily all expected to support Treasury policy these days, but it
is striking that there was such distrust and opposition from Labour
figures to the policy. I note, however, that none of the signatories to
the letter is serving on the Committee&#151;members have clearly been
selected with some care.</div>
					<a name="08051350000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer again to Polly
Toynbee&#146;s article of 12 October when she wrote about the Prime
Minister. It is an important point because it gets to the motivation of
the policy under clause 8 and schedule 4. She
wrote:</div>
					<a name="08051350000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;But
when Cameron threw &#145;phoney&#146; at him in Prime Minister's

his election funk, but &#145;phoney&#146; will stick because his
comprehensive spending review smacked of panicky, comprehensive
cowardice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The criticism
was that the move was tactical, and it was reiterated this weekend by
the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers) in an
article in <i class="I">The Sunday Times</i>, in which he
stated:</div>
					<a name="08051350000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the
past year far too many decisions about tax have been taken to try to
secure a tactical advantage. This has led to some damaging mistakes.
Whether in relation to the changes to inheritance tax, capital gains
tax, the treatment of nondoms or the abolition of the 10p income tax
band, the whole approach has been about political
positioning.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many

The inheritance tax policy was wise, as was the raising of the
threshold. The policy responded to the legitimate concerns of a large
number of people. It was to be fully funded by introducing a levy on
non-domicile people within the United Kingdom. I do not regard the
matter as an either/or approach. As for the 10p rate, we will all hear
a statement about it later today, and we have called on the Government
to reopen the Budget. We shall learn this afternoon precisely what they
propose to do.</div>

to that precise
point.</div>
					<a name="08051350000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
issues that has been disputed is when the Government decided to
introduce a transferable nil-rate band. There was an exchange on 6
November 2007 in the House of Commons when the Leader of the Opposition
raised that very question with the Prime Minister, and
said:</div>
					<a name="08051350000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;look me in the eye
and tell me that you were planning to reform inheritance tax before our
party conference. Can the Prime Minister look across the Dispatch Box
and just say it?&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Prime Minister gave a clear response:</div>
					<a name="08051350000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The answer is
yes&#151;unequivocally yes...All the records will show it, under
whatever rule they are released under the Freedom of Information
Act.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 6 November 2007; Vol. 467,
c. 33.]</div>
					<a name="08051350000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
press release on 8 November, two days later. It was certainly presented
in such a way that it seemed the Government had made the decision to
allow a transferable nil-rate band before the Conservative party
conference in October 2007. In examining when the Government made that
policy decision, it is worth looking at the Treasury press release of 8
November. It
states:</div>
					<a name="08051350000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have records of officials considering the proposal on January 9
2007.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is very
clear. There was consideration on 9 January, no doubt in the
run-up to the Budget of 21 March 2007. It is notable that,
although that Budget set out thresholds for 2010-11 for inheritance
tax, there was nothing on the transferable nil-rate band. Indeed, the
press notice that was issued alongside that Budget states that the
reason behind detailing the threshold for 2010-11
was:</div>
					<a name="08051350000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
continue to provide a fair and targeted system, with certainty for
families&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051350000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
that was the position in March 2007, it would appear that there was no
intention at that point to pursue this proposal, although it had been
looked at.</div>
					<a name="08051350000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 27 July
2007, the new Chancellor received the paper detailing proposals on the
transferable nil-rate band. To be fair to him, on 20 August 2007 he
confirmed that the proposal was under discussion. I do not know what is
significant about 20 August 2007, other than that it was the day after
the publication of an article by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton
criticising inheritance tax and dropping what could be described as a
fairly broad hint that a Conservative Government would look at that
matter and that there may be proposals on the way. We are aware that
the Chancellor was looking at these proposals at that point.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>
					<a name="08051350000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 3 September 2007, the
Chancellor received further advice on the proposals and on 5 September
he asked officials to work up final proposals. I hope that I am giving
a fair account of what happened. Then, we learn, subsequent detailed
costings followed before the pre-Budget report set out all details on
inheritance tax reform on 9 October
2007.</div>
					<a name="08051350000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was rather frustrating. The Treasury letter was quite detailed on how
the policy was developing, but it is rather like a detective thriller
with the last chapter ripped out. On 5 September the Chancellor asked
officials to work up final proposals. Then we heard little more than
that there were various costings. I will come back to the point about
detailed costings. We did not receive the detail. We did not learn
unequivocally&#151;to use the Prime Minister&#146;s
word&#151;that the Treasury had decided to implement the policy
before 1
October.</div>

the Government adopting this approach. It is significant that the hon.
Member for South Derbyshire, who is an extremely reasonable man,
concedes that point, but the Prime Minister does
not.</div>

noon</div>
					<a name="08051350000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth exploring how the policy formulation worked in this case. To
be fair to the Government, there was a reason why further details were
not provided. According to the Treasury letter, information was
identified as falling into the exemption to disclosure set out in
section 35(1) of the Freedom of Information Act, which relates to the
formulation or development of Government policy when it is not in the
public interest to disclose that information. Imagine the frustration
that Ministers must have felt if vital evidence proving that the
decision was made before 1 October was there, but officials declared
that it was not in the public interest to release the documents and
validate the Prime Minister&#146;s words, particularly
given  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>the widespread scepticism of the media about the Government&#146;s
claims that the decision was entirely unrelated to the Blackpool
announcement.</div>
					<a name="08051350000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">The
Times </i>on 11 October, referring to the original drafts of the
pre-Budget report,
stated:</div>
					<a name="08051350000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is understood
that inheritance tax did not feature... But when Gordon Brown
received polling data for marginal constituencies on Saturday afternoon
everything changed. The Prime Minister shelved plans for an election
and a decision was made to change the direction of the Pre-Budget
Report. With no election, Labour could neuter the Opposition by
pinching the very policies that had given the Tories a poll bounce in
marginal seats... The Chancellor and officials spent long hours on
Sunday rewriting the speech. This process continued through much of
Monday. Out went stamp duty and other tax cuts: in came inheritance
tax.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
were television reports on that particular Sunday. Jon Craig of Sky
reported that a number of Treasury civil servants arrived at No. 11 at
6 pm</div>
					<a name="08051350000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in what looked

						</b> Order. I am a very kind and caring Chairman. The
hon. Gentleman is making a fascinating and entertaining speech, but it
is not entirely relevant to the clause before us. Can I give him some
advice? He is going a little bit too wide. If he could come back to the
clause itself, the whole Committee would be very
grateful.</div>
					<a name="08051350000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000356"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I am grateful for your advice, Sir Nicholas. I will
stay off the leisure wear or otherwise of Treasury officials, but I
should like to make one brief point on the freedom of information
request on the formulation on this policy. Section 35(1) of the Freedom
of Information Act 2000 was the reason why further details as to when
the policy decision was taken were not revealed, yet section 35(2)
states:</div>
					<a name="08051350000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Once a
decision as to government policy has been taken, any statistical
information used to provide an informed background to the taking of the
decision is not to be regarded... as relating to the formulation
or development of government
policy&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051350000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is that
significant? It is significant because we were told that a number of
costings were prepared by Treasury officials. If any decision was made
to implement the policy before 1 October, any costings subsequently
produced could have been released under section 35(2). The Committee
may draw its own conclusion from the fact that they were
not.</div>
					<a name="08051350000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to
make a number of observations, raise some concerns about these specific
provisions and explore at greater length the issues contained in the
amendments concerning the various groups that do not benefit from the
nil-rate band. It is worth observing that the transferable nil-rate
band relates only to married couples and civil partners, so the
divorced and unmarried will not be able to benefit from those
provisions. In other contexts, the Prime Minister has effectively said
that recognising marriage within the tax system discriminates against
children of single or unmarried parents, so I would be grateful to know
whether the Financial Secretary believes that the tax system should
recognise marriage in the way it does 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>within the provision on the transferable nil-rate band and whether that
principle could and should be recognised more widely.</div>
					<a name="08051350000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, another group of
people who are excluded by those provisions are siblings, and there
have been recent cases in the European Court of Justice and the
European Court of Human Rights in which siblings have addressed that
issue with regard to inheritance tax. Will the Minister shed further
light on the Government&#146;s position on that and on whether there
is an argument for recognising the position of siblings in those
circumstances? There is also the point about whether that helps all
spouses, which we will explore in a moment. The amendment that relates
to estate duty is particularly important, and we will come back to
that.</div>
					<a name="08051350000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
married couples and civil partners are already able to benefit from the
existence of nil-rate band trusts. If a couple have been properly
advised, they could already benefit from a transferable nil-rate band.
I do not know whether the Financial Secretary has any information on
the extent to which nil-rate band trusts are already used, but she
probably needs that information to assess the cost of that policy. If
transferable nil-rate band trusts are in widespread use, the cost of
the policy will be somewhat reduced, but the number of people
benefiting from the change would perhaps not be as great as has been
presented. I will be grateful if she looks at that
point.</div>
					<a name="08051350000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the issue of the administration of the policy. In many
circumstances the transferable nil-rate band could be used in cases
where a spouse has died some years ago, but in those circumstances it
might be difficult for the surviving spouse or their heirs to locate
all the necessary documentation. That point was raised on the
&#147;Money Box&#148; programme on 3 May&#151;I am not sure
whether the Minister heard it. It highlighted that the relevant form
for benefiting from the nil-rate band states that it must be
accompanied with the death certificate, the marriage certificate, the
will, documents relating to the grant of representation and any deed of
variation. Of course, the marriage and death certificates might be
available from the Public Record Office, as the Financial Secretary, to
be fair to her, will probably point out. The will and grant of
representation will be held by the courts in some cases, but not in
all. That raises the question of how the new policy will be enforced:
will it be a light-touch regime, or will Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs rigorously enforce the requirement to produce all of those
documents?</div>
					<a name="08051350000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">A related
and ongoing point is that the better the record keeping, the more
easily the policy can be implemented. Will there be any attempt to try
to publicise the requirement to retain records? Having introduced the
policy, we do not want to find individuals running into difficulties
because they cannot locate all the documents that they need to use the
new rate band. There could be a considerable number of years between
the death of the first and the second spouse; I am sure that the
Minister will agree that that is a legitimate concern. Guidance as to
how HMRC wishes to deal with that matter will benefit the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08051350000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, we will raise our concerns and scrutinise the policy, but
we recognise that it is an attempt, for whatever reason, to deal with
inheritance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>tax and the fact that far more people are hit by it now than was once
the case. In that sense, we welcome it, but we question why the
Government have introduced it. As the hon. Member for South Derbyshire
pointed out, political considerations may have played more than a small
part in that&#151;not his phrase but, I think, the implication of
what he was saying. If we have succeeded in taking the Government in a
particular direction, we are certainly pleased about that. We have
various questions about how the policy will be administrated and will
be grateful if the Financial Secretary can address those
matters.</div>
					<a name="08051350000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051350000357"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I will not detain
the Committee for very long, because this is a fairly simple and short
clause. We all know that inheritance tax is a tax on transfers of value
on death and also on certain lifetime transfers. It was introduced way
back in 1984. In a previous life I was involved in it, and to think
that it was 24 years ago seems amazing. When someone dies, their estate
is chargeable to inheritance tax. The clause and the provisions in
schedule 4 insert new section 8A into the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 to
allow a surviving spouse or civil partner to benefit from the unused
part of the IHT nil band of their
partner.</div>
					<a name="08051350000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, the first &#163;300,000 is chargeable at a nil rate and the
excess value is taxed at 40 per cent. The amendments mean that in
future the remaining partner could pass on &#163;600,000 free of
inheritance tax on their death. On that basis, we support widening the
exemption so that families can increase the chance of exempting the
family home or their estate from IHT. However, there are a couple of
aspects that we would like some clarification on. We seek the
Minister&#146;s reassurance on issues brought to our attention by the
Association of British
Insurers.</div>
					<a name="08051350000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under new
section 8A(5), is the amount of nil-rate band that can be claimed on
the death of the surviving partner limited to one marriage? What
repercussions will that have for the taxpayer? Does the amendment to
the penalty provision applicable when someone provides incorrect
information make the person making the claim liable for any error, even
if it was the deceased who gave that misinformation or lied on the
original claim? Those are interesting and technical points, which I am
sure the Minister will be able to give some reassurance on.</div>
					<a name="08051350000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point, which has been
touched on by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, is in
respect of those people who may have already paid some of the old
estate duty because a spouse died a very long time ago, and are now
liable for inheritance tax because they will not be able to claim the
nil band. I think that one of the amendments to the schedule addresses
that issue. It is an issue for a relatively small number of people, but
I think that it will be unfair, even with those few people, if we do
not address that. I will leave my remarks about that aside, but,
overall, we are supportive of the clause and hope that we can address
those other aspects in the discussions on the
schedule.</div>

							<a name="08051350000358"></a>Mr.
Field:
						</b> I confess that I support anything that mitigates
the effects of inheritance tax. Therefore, although elements of the
proposal are slightly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>unsatisfactory&#151;I agree with a number of the comments made by my
hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire&#151;it is a step
in the right direction. I appreciate that now is not the time for a
long discourse on inheritance tax&#151;I see you nod sagely, Sir
Nicholas&#151;but one of the biggest problems about inheritance tax
is that some of the wealthiest do not have to pay it, because they are
able to order their affairs over many years with lifetime
trusts.</div>
					<a name="08051350000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
biggest concerns, as my hon. Friend said, is that so many people now
find themselves subject to inheritance tax as a result of rising house
prices. Part of the difficulty with that is that there is no
opportunity for such individuals to mitigate the effect during their
lifetime. Their main home is obviously the place in which they have to
live. Such people regard themselves as being asset-rich but cash-poor,
and they are not in any position to mitigate that. Although at one
level it might warm the Minister&#146;s heart to know that 6 per
cent. of estates pay inheritance tax, dare I say that it is often the
wrong 6 per cent. that pay?</div>
					<a name="08051350000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can
argue&#151;I could understand such an argument, although I might not
entirely agree with it&#151;that if we are to respect the idea of a
life well lived, very wealthy people should be able to pass on certain
things at their death. The worry is that the tax affects more than just
middle England in our constituencies, Sir Nicholas. I note that there
is great sun here in London, along with that in Cheshire and
Hertfordshire. It is a coincidence that Hertfordshire, and, technically
I should say Chester and west Cheshire, are two of the only counties in
which I have lived outside London.</div>

Thankfully those political memories are well in the past, which is just

North.</div>
					<a name="08051350000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for North-East Hertfordshire has raised some legitimate
concerns. First, there is the sense of injustice felt by siblings
living together, or unmarried couples whose relationship is of long
standing, who will not qualify for any benefit under the nil-rate band.
I hope that the Government will give some thought to that problem, not
necessarily within the context of this year&#146;s Finance Bill, but
perhaps in the years ahead to ensure a just settlement.</div>
					<a name="08051350000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am particularly concerned
about paperwork, particularly where the two relevant deaths are many
years apart. I speak from my own experience as executor to my late
father&#146;s will some 17 years ago&#151;I have no idea where
those papers are now. We would like some reassurance that there will be
a soft-touch approach by HMRC to such cases because, I hasten to add,
if someone like myself has not got hold of those papers, I suspect that
many others will have found that various papers have been mislaid,
perhaps during two, three or four different moves. I hope to get some
reassurance that no great rigour will be expected in that regard, and
that the evidence will be straightforward and easy to obtain from any
beneficiary.</div>

important elements mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000361"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
has said, clause 8 introduces schedule 4. There is a tax-free allowance
or a nil-rate band levied on the estates of the deceased that takes the
first part of every estate out of charge. Any excess is charged at a
marginal rate of 40 per cent. As previously announced, the threshold of
the individual nil-rate band for the current financial year is set at
&#163;312,000. It is set to increase in future years&#151;to
&#163;325,000 in 2009-10 and to &#163;350,000 in 2010-11. In
addition, the inheritance tax legislation includes an exemption for
transfers of assets to a spouse or civil partner. Many people use this
spouse exemption to leave everything they own to their surviving spouse
or civil partner without triggering an inheritance tax
charge.</div>
					<a name="08051350000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
announced in the pre-Budget report build on the long-standing spouse
exemption. Under the new rules, if any nil-rate band remains unused on
the death of the first spouse or civil partner, it may be carried
forward for use on the second death instead. That means that if none of
the nil-rate band is used up on the first death, the nil-rate band for
the second death will be doubled. In 2008-09 it may be possible to
exempt up to the first &#163;624,000 of a widow or widower&#146;s
estate from inheritance tax, and, on the basis of the planned increase
in the nil-rate band, that amount will rise to &#163;700,000 by 2010.
That ensures that the heirs of all married couples and civil partners
will be able to benefit from both partners&#146; individual nil-rate
bands, without the couple needing to have undertaken complex legal and
financial planning. The change will reduce the number of tax-paying
estates. For 2008-09 the Government estimate that only about 4 per
cent. of deaths will give rise to an inheritance tax
liability.</div>
					<a name="08051350000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked a number of questions. I will
try to deal with each in turn, particularly the pertinent
questions&#151;I will not be drawn down any of the other lines of
debate, Sir Nicholas. The inheritance tax powers relief reflects the
formal rights and responsibilities that marriage and civil partnership
relationships necessarily entail. The hon. Gentleman asked about
siblings: he will be aware of the European Court of Human Rights
judgment in the case of Burden <i class="I">v. </i>United Kingdom. We welcomed
that judgment, which recognised that cohabiting couples are not in a
comparable position to a married couple or civil partnership for the
purposes of inheritance tax.</div>
					<a name="08051350000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about documentation, as did the hon. Member for
Cities of London and Westminster. This is a valuable relief, so it is
right that individuals have to provide relevant documents to support
their claim. We are aware, however, that where the first death occurred
before the 2007 PBR announcement, the estate may not have retained all
of the relevant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>documents. That is why in such cases HMRC guidance requires in support
of a claim only copies of documents that can be obtained from public
sources. I assure the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire that
HMRC has already published guidance on its website about the documents
that should be kept and that information is also included in the pack
that people receive when they are dealing with the estate of a deceased
spouse or civil
partner.</div>
					<a name="08051350000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
reduces the number of tax-paying estates by about 40 per cent., to only
4 per cent. of estates. Those are the facts, irrespective of what other
commentators may claim. The number of tax-paying estates in 2008-9 is
estimated to be about 23,000. More broadly, the measure provides the
certainty and reassurance of a double allowance for 12 million married
couples or civil partnerships.</div>
					<a name="08051350000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change
ensures that heirs of all married couples and civil partners will
benefit, without the couple needing to have undertaken complex legal
and financial planning, as I have said. The costs were scored as normal
in the PBR and Budget reports and, for the Committee&#146;s
information, they are costed at &#163;1 billion in 2008-9,
&#163;1.2 billion in 2009-10 and &#163;1.3 billion in
2010-11.</div>
					<a name="08051350000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall asked about occasions when there had
been more than one marriage or civil partnership. The transfer is
limited to one extra nil-rate band for a good reason: it is a pragmatic
step to prevent any one individual accumulating a large allowance. We
consider that one extra nil-rate band is sufficiently generous. It
hardly needs saying that that is sensible, but it was worth it for the
humour.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000362"></a>Mr.
Breed:
						</b> I thought that may be the case. It is a matter of
balancing the benefits of a large number of allowances against the
disbenefits of a large number of
wives.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000363"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> We will simply nod at that. The hon. Gentleman
also questioned the penalty provisions. We will return to those
in the debate on amendment No. 64, when I will give further
details.</div>
					<a name="08051350000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will provide welcome simplification and reassurance for millions of
married couples and civil partners. The hon. Member for Cities of
London and Westminster talked about those who are asset-rich and
cash-poor and who believe that their ability to demonstrate a life well
lived in having a benefit to pass on to their families was being
undermined. He described the effect of the rise in house
prices.</div>
					<a name="08051350000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well over a
year before this measure was announced in the pre-Budget report, I met
a constituent in Liverpool, Wavertree who had worked as a joiner for
Liverpool city council for the whole of his working life&#151;more
than 40 years. Early in his life he had married and he and his wife
bought the house that they lived in for the whole of that period. They
bought the most expensive home that they could afford. It was a large,
comfortable family home. It was not a huge dwelling and by London terms
was perhaps relatively modest; none the less, they kept that home and
cherished it throughout their married life.</div>
					<a name="08051350000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the man came to me he was
angry and distressed because he believed that the value of the property
had risen to the point where his family would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>not benefit from the relief from inheritance tax. It had done precisely
what he hoped it would do when he bought it: it was the only thing of
value that he had to pass on to his family. I felt a huge amount of
sympathy for the case that he made. For that reason, I believe that the
measure that we are making is a good one. I believe that it will be the
cause of enormous relief to many families across the country who have
seen the value of their homes increase in the way that I have just
described and for whom it is the only benefit that they can leave to
their
families.</div>
					<a name="08051350000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that having heard the debate, notwithstanding the questions
that have been raised, the Committee will agree to see clause 8 stand

							<a name="08051350000364"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I am grateful for the right hon. Lady&#146;s
remarks. The example that she gave of the joiner who had worked all his
life demonstrates why there are concerns about inheritance tax. She
expressed that very clearly and I am glad that she takes a similar view
to my party, as opposed to that of Ms Toynbee and the Fabian Society. I
will not dwell on that
point.</div>
					<a name="08051350000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for the right hon. Lady&#146;s remarks on administration, paperwork
and documentation. I hope that in the implementation of this policy
HMRC will pursue the approach that she has outlined of not requiring
documentation that will not be easily available from public records.
She touched briefly on the question of recognition of marriage within
the taxation system. The Conservative party supports that principle.
There are other taxes where a stronger case could be made for such
recognised, but I think that it should be recognised. We note that, in
principle, the Government support that view in the context of
inheritance tax, if not
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="08051350000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise if I missed the point about the number of nil-rate band
trusts in existence. I am not sure whether the Government have it, but
the number is relevant when working out the actual cost of the policy
to the Exchequer. When making the announcement, the Government did not
particularly acknowledge the number of families that would benefit from
the arrangements in the immediate aftermath of the pre-Budget report. I
did not spend a great deal of time on the matter earlier, but in a
period of rising house prices&#151;although, admittedly that is not
the case at present&#151;it may still be worth while for married
couples to have a nil-rate band trust, and they are likely to continue
to do so. However, the significance of the policy to the Exchequer and
to a number of people will depend on whether they already have such a
trust in
place.</div>

than could be said of the Prime Minister on 6 November 2007,
when he unequivocally stated that the Government had been planning to
take such action before 1 October. The Committee will be pleased to
know that I shall not expand on that point. We shall not oppose clause
8 because it is a step towards dealing with a serious concern that
affects many people. It is not as big a step as we would want, but we

							<a name="08051350000367"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I shall start with amendment No. 61. Traditionally,
and in the majority of cases, an inheritance tax charge is triggered by
the death of an individual. At that point, there will be a charge on
the estate under section 4 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. However,
there are other circumstances in which a charge may be triggered, such
as in the event of a lifetime transfer&#151;a potentially exempt
transfer that turns out not to be exempt because it happens within
seven years of the death. Let us consider circumstances in which person
A makes a gift in, say, 2005, dies two years later and can no longer
benefit from the provisions of potentially exempt transfers. In
assessing the tax payable, it is necessary to look back at those
gifts.</div>
					<a name="08051350000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful if the Minister confirmed my understanding of the
arrangements. Is it the intention that the transferable nil-rate band
will be available for both the estate on death and for any lifetime
gifts? The Law Society has expressed concern that the drafting of the
proposals is not as clear as it could be. I draw attention, in
particular, to the provision that states:</div>
					<a name="08051350000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the purposes of the charge to
tax on the death of the
survivor&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051350000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is possible
to construe that as relating simply to the charge triggered by death in
relation to the estate, not the lifetime transfer. I have acknowledged
that such interest has been shown by the Law Society, and its proposed
clarification when referring to the purposes of the charge to tax on
the death of the survivor is to
state</div>
					<a name="08051350000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or additional tax
on or by reason of&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>
					<a name="08051350000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">the death of the survivor, thus
unambiguously incorporating the lifetime transfer. It would be unfair
if the transferable nil-rate band should not extend to a gift made by
the surviving spouse in his or her lifetime, and I do not believe that
the Government intend that it should
not.</div>
					<a name="08051350000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051350000368"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman posed the
example of a person who makes a gift in 2005, whose death two years
later ensures that it does not qualify for the saving provisions. Is it
not the case that all that has happened there is that the saving
provisions have not applied and that therefore there is a death and an
associated inheritance tax situation to deal with? There are not two
situations, there is just one: the individual does not benefit from the
rules that they tried to benefit from because they died too
soon.</div>
					<a name="08051350000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000369"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman&#151;I think.
He may help me to explain my point. In the case of a gift that does not
benefit from the transferable nil-rate band, it is possible, although I
do not want to press this interpretation too hard, that the benefit
gained from the transferable nil-rate band would only apply with regard
to the estate on death, and not with regard to a lifetime gift. I do
not think that that is the Government&#146;s
intention.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000370"></a>Stephen

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000371"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> No, I do not think that it does. If there is an
ambiguity, it is that the element of the estate that was given away in
the lifetime of the surviving spouse may be liable for inheritance tax,
where as if the nil-rate band of the deceased spouse had been included,
that would not be the case. That is the concern that I am
raising.</div>
					<a name="08051350000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">A slightly
more complex but related arrangement exists with regard to amendments
Nos. 62 and 63. Those of us who served on the 2006 Finance Bill will
recall lengthy debates and considerable controversy regarding the
Government&#146;s proposals on trusts and their concern that trusts
were being used as an avoidance mechanism for inheritance tax. As a
consequence of the Finance Act 2006, establishing a trust in certain
circumstances may trigger an immediate liability for inheritance tax,
which is a slightly different arrangement from that for an ordinary
lifetime gift. The concern raised by the Law Society, which I do not
think is a matter of ambiguity or clarification as the schedule does
not currently address it, is that in creating a trust for one of her
children, for example, the surviving spouse would immediately face a
liability for inheritance tax and would not be able to make use of the
transferable nil-rate band against the lifetime chargeable transfer
made by the survivor.</div>
					<a name="08051350000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 62 is a lengthy
one and I am sure that the Financial Secretary and you, Sir Nicholas,
will be pleased to know that I do not intend to go through it line by
line. I have described the essential purpose of amendments Nos. 62 and
63 because the concern appears to be legitimate. I would be grateful
for clarification from the Financial Secretary on those
amendments.</div>

							<a name="08051350000372"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I confess that I do not have a great deal of
sympathy with the amendments. Where lifetime transfers occur within
seven years of someone&#146;s death, they are counted as part of the
death estate for inheritance tax purposes. Amendment No. 61 seeks to
clarify that any transferred nil-rate band can be set against the whole
estate, including those transfers made within seven years of death, and
not only the part left behind at the point someone dies. I would like
to reassure the Committee that amendment No. 61 is unnecessary. As
drafted, the Bill refers to the transferred nil-rate band applying
to</div>
					<a name="08051350000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the charge to tax on
the death of the
survivor&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that is
already sufficient to encompass lifetime transfers on which an
inheritance tax charge subsequently crystallises on death.</div>
					<a name="08051350000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 62 and 63
relate to the situations in which transfers of assets during
someone&#146;s lifetime give rise to an immediate inheritance tax
charge. The Bill allows unused nil-rate band from a first death to be
transferred for use by the estate of the surviving spouse on their
death&#151;the hon. Gentleman used the example of a widow seeking to
make provision for her children. The amendments would allow unused
nil-rate band from a deceased spouse to be transferred to the survivor
during their lifetime, in order to reduce the immediate inheritance tax
charge triggered if assets exceeding the current nil-rate band were
transferred into trust. We do not believe that that change is either
necessary or appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08051350000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">In developing this measure, we
have focused on providing a simple mechanism for ordinary married
couples and civil partners to be sure that their heirs will benefit
from both partners&#146; individual inheritance tax nil-rate bands.
The Bill seeks to obviate the need for the planning that would
otherwise be required to exploit fully the nil-rate band of the first
partner to die. Allowing any unused nil-rate band to be transferred
when the surviving spouse dies achieves that intent. We do not believe
that it is right to extend the measure to reduce lifetime inheritance
tax charges. The inheritance tax charges on transfers into trust are
designed to ensure that assets held in trust bear a fair share of
inheritance tax.</div>
					<a name="08051350000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
wish to reassure ordinary families that if a married couple own
property in excess of the nil-rate band, they can be sure that both of
their individual nil-rate bands will ultimately be taken into account,
without the need for complex legal and financial planning. However, we
are not minded to go further and provide relief to those who can afford
to transfer more than &#163;300,000 into trust while they are still
alive. I fully accept that there are many reasons why someone might
want to transfer assets into trust, but I believe that the current
rules provide a generous enough exemption for such transfers, and that
the changes the amendments seek are
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08051350000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also appear to contain some technical deficiencies&#151;I
appreciate that the Law Society may have been behind them, but we do
not think that they work as they are perhaps intended to. In
particular, they do not make the consequential changes to the
commencement provision required for the transfer of unused nil-rate
band to be effective before  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>the surviving spouse dies. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will
not press his amendment to a Division. If he does, I shall invite my
hon. Friends to resist it.</div>

Gauke:
						</b> With regard to amendment No. 61, if the Financial
Secretary is saying that it is the Government&#146;s intention that
lifetime gifts, should they not be potentially exempt transfers, will
benefit from the proposal, then we welcome that clarification. The
drafting produced by the Law Society is clearer than in the Bill, but
if we have clarification that should be sufficient.</div>
					<a name="08051350000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the Financial
Secretary&#146;s comments on amendments Nos. 62 and 63, but there is
more to be said for them than she gives credit for. There is quite an
argument&#151;I put it no stronger than that&#151;for permitting
the nil-rate band to be used in such circumstances, although I accept
that these proposals do not deal with the priority cases. They do not
deal with the joiner to whom she referred, for example. There is an
argument for consistency in this matter. We raised a number of concerns
in 2006 about the proposals on creating an immediate liability to
inheritance tax on trusts. It is not my intention to press this matter
to a vote and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08051350000376"></a>Mr.
Gauke:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 address the issue of
transfers to spouses who are non-domiciled in the UK. There is a
long-standing limit on the transferable nil-rate band for non-domiciled
spouses of just &#163;55,000. That has stood since 1994 and has not
been reformed. The Bill will reform the law relating to residents and
domiciles. There is an argument for looking at the issue in the context
of that reform and of the reform making the nil-rate band
transferable.</div>
					<a name="08051350000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position of spouses who are non-domiciled is not as strong as that of
domiciled spouses. I wish to probe the Government&#146;s approach on
the matter. Is the Financial Secretary convinced that the
discrimination&#151;I use that word in a neutral way&#151;between
domiciled and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>non-domiciled spouses is consistent with European law? For example, it
would appear that a UK person is treated in a different way from people
who are domiciled in other member states. The schedule may be an
opportunity to look at the matter again. Amendment No. 44 would allow a
non-domiciled spouse a full nil-rate band transfer. Alternatively,
amendment No. 45 would abolish the non-domicile limit. I would be
grateful to know the Government&#146;s reason for the continuation of
the &#163;55,000 limit and whether they will review
it.</div>
					<a name="08051350000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 46 is the most significant of all the amendments that we have
tabled on schedule 4. The issue was touched upon by the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall. It is about looking back to when the first death
occurred some years ago. It is to be welcomed that, as part of the
package, the Government&#146;s approach looks back. The measure is
not just about the death of the first spouse after 9 October 2007. It
also looks back.</div>
					<a name="08051350000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a distinction between inheritance tax and capital transfer tax on
the one hand and estate duty on the other. Under inheritance tax and
capital transfer tax, there was a full spousal exemption so that, when
the first spouse dies and leaves his or her estate to his or her
spouse, the nil-rate band has not been used at all, because it is
entirely exempt from the IHT or capital transfer tax regimes.</div>
					<a name="08051350000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to estate duty, the
situation is somewhat different, and transitional provisions were made
between 1972 and 1975, which complicates matters. Essentially, estate
duty was charged on the first death, but the property affected could be
left out of the charge on the second death, which is the other way
round from the current arrangements. Consequently, on the
survivor&#146;s death, the property could be left out of the estate
for IHT purposes under the surviving spouse exemption, although that is
now of little value, as I understand it, because it has not been
indexed. When the deceased spouse leaves his estate to the surviving
spouse, the nil-rate band is not used up if the deceased spouse died
under the capital transfer tax or the inheritance tax regime, but if he
died under the estate duty regime, he has essentially used up his
nil-rate band. Consequently, if the first spouse died before
1972&#151;there is also still an issue if he died before
1975&#151;the surviving spouse is not able to benefit from the policy
on the transferable nil-rate band.</div>
					<a name="08051350000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not just a hypothetical
case, as there are real examples. Mr. David Jackson raised
that matter with his Member of Parliament, my hon. Friend the Member
for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), who wrote to the Financial
Secretary on that point and raised the matter during the Budget debate
in March. Mr. Jackson&#146;s mother was widowed in 1969
and died in January 2008. In response to Mr.
Jackson&#146;s concern that the transferable nil-rate band would not
be of benefit to his mother&#146;s estate, the Financial Secretary
said that the test is whether the deceased was the survivor of a
marriage and whether there was any unused nil-rate band when the
earlier death occurred. In those circumstances, Mrs. Jackson
was the survivor, but there was no unused nil-rate band.</div>
					<a name="08051350000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another example is that of Dr.
William Bain, who died in 1969, widowing his wife Elizabeth, who died
in December 2007. Both of their sons have been in contact with hon.
Members: Duncan Bain with my  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie); and Edmond
Bain with my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton. They have a letter from
HMRC stating:</div>
					<a name="08051350000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There was no spouse
relief available under Estate Duty Legislation and as such all
transfers were
chargeable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
talking about a relatively small number of people. My hon. Friend the
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has tabled a parliamentary question
asking how many cases there are in which the first spouse died before
1972, with the surviving spouse living in October 2007. I believe that
the Treasury does not have an answer to that, in the sense that it does
not know, rather than that it has not responded&#151;I am sure that
the Financial Secretary will correct me if I am wrong. Such cases do
exist, and I have given a couple of examples to show that.</div>
					<a name="08051350000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">All members
of the Committee will be somewhat sympathetic to those circumstances.
Life has not dealt those families the best of cards, in the sense that
most of the cases will involve wives who were widowed at a relatively
young age and who lived on for many years. Having heard the
announcement in October 2007, they could be forgiven for thinking that
they would be able to benefit from their deceased husband&#146;s
nil-rate band. Of course, for technical reasons, there is no nil-rate
band.</div>
					<a name="08051350000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
question of fairness. It is unfortunate that this relatively small
group of people appear to have been left out of the Government&#146;s
provisions. I am sure that that is unintentional. I hope that the
Minister will look at the matter sympathetically to see whether we can
perhaps address what appears to be an anomaly. I can see the logic of
the Government&#146;s policy, but a small number of widows and
widowers will not be able to benefit from
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051350000377"></a>Mr.
Breed:
						</b> I want to emphasise the points made by the hon.
Gentleman. There are examples and I have been sent one. I cannot put it
more succinctly than<i class="I"> </i>Mr. Harvey, who
writes:</div>
					<a name="08051350000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
mother died recently and I have been informed by HMRC that despite the
new regulations introduced last year on nil-band transfer the executors
of her estate cannot use the nil-rate band allowance from her deceased
spouse (my father) who died in 1971. My father left everything to my
mother but as they had some small savings and there was a house, albeit
in joint ownership, the value of the estate was more than the
then-limit of &#163;12,500 and my mother, who only had a very small
widow&#146;s pension, had to find &#163;850 to pay death duties at
the time. HMRC admitted that now having to pay IHT on my
mother&#146;s estate is unfair but pointed out that they are only
able to work from the regulations which were in existence at the time,
ie Estate Duty rather than Inheritance Tax. Ironically, the only reason
my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>mother&#146;s estate will now be liable for IHT is because of the
value of the house - the same one - which caused the initial demand for
payment back in 1971.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite clear that others will find
themselves in this situation. Although it is a relatively small number
of people, as Mr. Harvey puts
it:</div>
					<a name="08051350000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It seems
particularly unfair for a generation who were frugal and careful with
money to a degree almost unheard of today. I also presume that this
outcome for what must be a group of mainly elderly widows was never
actually intended as part of the new legislation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051350000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that that is the case. I hope
that fairness prevails and I hope that the amendment will be given
proper consideration.</div>

							<a name="08051350000378"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 are related to the
inheritance tax rules for transfers to spouses who are domiciled
outside the UK. As has been described, spouse relief is limited to the
first &#163;55,000 of assets transferred when the surviving spouse is
domiciled outside the UK. This is a long-standing feature of the
inheritance tax legislation. Amendment No. 44 seeks to operate the
transfer of nil-rate band as if the limit for such transfers had not
existed at the date of the first death. Amendment No. 45 seeks to
disapply the limit for all transfers of assets to spouses domiciled
outside the UK from April 2008
onward.</div>
					<a name="08051350000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
restriction on the spouse exemption dates back to 1975, when the
unlimited exemption for all other spousal transfers was first
introduced. It is necessary to ensure that inheritance tax is not
avoided through transfers of assets to their intended beneficiary via a
non-domiciled spouse. Without the restriction an individual could
easily transfer an unlimited quantity of assets to their non-domiciled
spouse, who in turn could pass the&#151;now offshore&#151;assets
back to the intended UK beneficiary without inheritance tax ever
biting.</div>
					<a name="08051350000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The potential
cost to the Exchequer is hard to estimate but could be very substantial
indeed. Members of the Committee with particularly long
memories&#151;I suspect that includes you and I, Sir Nicholas, and
perhaps the hon. Member for Gosport&#151;may recall that a similar
amendment was tabled by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John
Butterfill) during the passage of the Finance Bill in 1995. The
Government of the day argued against the amendment for precisely the
same reasons as I have just
given.</div>
