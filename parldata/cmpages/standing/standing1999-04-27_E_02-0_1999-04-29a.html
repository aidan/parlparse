<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I am grateful for  the opportunity to take part in the debate. On Tuesday, I  suggested that the European convention on human rights,  which was incorporated into the Human Rights Act 1998,  might be considered in trying to follow its thrust and  incorporating it into the Bill. I was struck by the  Minister's reply that he was slightly surprised by my  observation. He thought that I should know full well that  once the convention is brought fully into force it will bind  all public bodies. He therefore took the view  I paraphrase slightly that my appeal constituted simply  an appeal for a restatement of existing and  well-established law and was therefore wholly  unnecessary.  
<P>
That struck me as rather surprising. As the Minister  knows, we spent a great deal of time last year considering  the Human Rights Bill, as it then was, which many  Conservative Members did not favour for constitutional  reasons. Although I did, one of the things that struck me  during the debate was the extent to which some of the  implications of incorporation did not seem to have  completely sunk in as far as the Government were  concerned. Indeed, I sometimes think that they are only  now beginning to sink in, as evidenced by the fact that,  although we have now incorporated the convention into  law, the starting date on which it will be possible to bring  cases to court claiming breach of the Act keeps  disappearing further and further into the mists of the  future. The convention seems to present some genuine  challenges that are not tackled in the Bill.  
<P>
I remind the Committee of article 6 of the European  convention on human rights, now incorporated into our  law by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998. Article 6.1  states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any  criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public  hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial  tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly  but the press and public may be excluded"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
The convention contains further details, which I shall not  repeat. Article 6.2 states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed  innocent until proved guilty"	.     
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
Article 6.3, which is especially pertinent, states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following  minimum rights:  
<P>
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he  understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the  accusation against him;  
<P>
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of  his defence"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
and this is especially pertinent   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of  his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay  for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests  of justice so require"<P>
</UL></FONT>	.  
<P>
That does not stand on its own, but has been the subject  of considerable judicial interpretation by the European  Court, especially in the case of Airey v. Ireland in 1979  when the Court held that in certain cases "Article 6(1)"	      
<P>
  
<P>
I note that it is article 6.1 and not 6.3, which refers  specifically to criminal cases   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may sometimes compel the State to provide the assistance of a  lawyer when such assistance proves indispensable for an effective  access to a court either because legal representation is rendered  compulsory, as is done by the domestic laws of certain Contracting  States for various types of litigation, or by reason of the complexity  of the procedure or of the case."
<P>
</UL></FONT>	  
<P>
One has only to read the Bill to see some strict  definitions about the categories for which legal aid will  be available. Legal aid is confined to the employment  appeals tribunal, the mental health review tribunal and the  ordinary courts. That leaves aside the categories of  litigation from which, as we will discuss later, it will be  excluded.  
<P>
Before coming to the House of Commons I practised a  great deal in industrial and employment tribunals, from  which legal aid has hitherto been completely excluded. I  seemed to cut my teeth in the early 1990s doing virtually  nothing but sex discrimination cases. Those do not qualify  for legal aid, yet the awards and scope of industrial  tribunals have widened enormously over the past eight to  10 years. Previously such tribunals gave people a pat on  the head and a few thousand pounds in their pockets, but  I discovered when I represented the interests of the  Ministry of Defence in sex discrimination cases that some  of the awards being made against it for unfair dismissal on  pregnancy amounted to hundreds of thousands of pounds.  
<P>
For me, that flags up the question as to how the Bill's  exclusion of legal aid per se from such tribunals as a  matter of principle is compatible with the moves taken by  the Government over the past 18 months to incorporate  the European convention on human rights into English  Law.  
<P>
<B> The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's  Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> Did the hon.  Gentleman advance that argument at any stage during the  lifetime of the previous Government, and does he accept  that he legal principles are the same whether or not the  convention has been incorporated? Had there been a  requirement under the convention to provide legal aid for  employment tribunals, that would have bound the  previous Government as much as it binds this  Government.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The Minister is right to say that the  previous Government were equally bound, in so far as a  case could have been taken by the convention so far as  Strasbourg rather than through out domestic courts. The  Minister will know after all, he is the Minister in the  Lord Chancellor's Department that when the Human  Rights Act 1998 finally gets up and running and offers  the scope to bring the convention before domestic courts,  this country's judiciary expect a plethora of applications  in an initial period of three or four years. Due to the scale  of people's knowledge of the convention, there are likely  to be many more cases in which people invoke it. That is  the direct result of the Government's ow action, and I  presume it was desired.  
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Is article 6 not described  as the British article, not only because British lawyers  drafted it in 1949 but because it embodies British  traditions of justice and fair play? However great the  plethora of cases is, will not judges be well placed to  apply the same traditional values that they have applied  for hundreds of years?     
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable  point, but it is worth bearing in mind that, when the article  was drafted, an accused appearing in a criminal case in  the Crown court or as it then would have been, the  Assize who was poor was likely to have been given a  dock brief to be represented by one of a group of  barristers sitting at the back of the court, who would have  been appointed to represent the accused half an hour  before the case was due to come on. That is how many  barristers in the later 1940s and early 1950s started their  careers at the Bar.  
<P>
If that system of dock briefs still existed, today, it  would be unlikely to pass the security of article 6 of the  European convention on human rights as it is applied by  the European Court of Human Rights. The convention  evolves as societal changes take place. Decisions on the  application of the convention that were taken in the 1950s  are not the same as decisions taken in the 1990s.  Tremendous changes have taken place between the 1950s  and the 1990s in how the convention is applied for  instance, on rights for minorities and the recognition of  rights for gay people. The hon. Member for Stafford  (Mr. Kidney) has not make a particularly good point.  
<P>
The question that we have to address, which goes to  the heart of clause 1, is that those changes, particularly the  incorporation of the convention, is whether some general  principles should be included at the start of the Bill to  provide a framework for its application. If the Bill's  application is challenged because it breaches human  rights, the Government will be in a weak position if it  contains no framework. Treasury Counsel may be  appointed, but the Bill will be considered on a  case-by-case basis; instead the Government should say at  the outset that the Bill conforms with the convention and  tries to do whatever is reasonable and possible to apply  convention rights.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument is not  entirely logical. He has given a series of illustrations of  cases that might arise that might breach the principles of  the European convention. He now suggests that we should  restate the same principles or other principles in the  context of the convention. That argument does not  stand-up. He must apply the case-by-case analysis to  justify the need for new principles. Principles, in  themselves, do not necessarily fall foul of the convention,  but cases might.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I disagree with the Minister. It is true that  applications will be considered case by case, but we could  incorporate a reasonable clause in the Bill, which the other  place tried to do. If we set out the basis on which legal  services would be made available, and even placed  reasonable limits on their availability, the Government of  the day would be better able to tell a domestic court, or  even the European Court of Human Rights, that there is  not a bottomless purse everyone accepts that legal  services cost money and that there are limits.  
<P>
When defining the principles of access to justice, and  providing funding for a range of services, we should also  include a statement that we believe is in conformity with  the human rights convention. Indeed, I have no doubt that  the statement of principles in clause 1 does conform, or  the Minister's certificate at the beginning of the Bill  would not have been left there once the other place had  completed its scrutiny of the Bill. I assume that the Bill  conforms with the convention. If not, the Minister would  not have allowed his statement to remain in place.  Therefore, we can say that we have discussed the matter  and that we can apply those parameters. Given the margin  of appreciation allowed and given that the statement is  reasonable, I have no doubt that it would stand up if it  were tested at Strasbourg. It would be a powerful tool  for defining and refining the convention, which everyone  agrees is a loose restatement of rights.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): Given the hon.  Gentleman's comments about the purpose clause, can I  take it that he will not object to amendment No. 5, under  which the Government will introduce a purpose  provision albeit, in elation to the Community Legal  Service?  
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve: I do not find the purpose provision in  relation to clause 5 objectionable indeed, it has  something to commend it. I am concerned about whether  that purpose provision is sufficiently tightly drafted to  fulfil the purposes that I would like it to fulfil, but that is  a separate matter which we shall debate in due course.  The principle of that purpose provision is not something  to which I would object.  </B><P>
<P>
If the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) is  asking me to compare whether it is better to attach the  purpose provision to clause 5, or to include it as a separate  and discrete clause, as was done in the other place. I must  tell him that I prefer clause 1, which is an important  restatement at the start of an important Bill of the  principles that we need to apply.  
<P>
I remind the Committee that one of the arguments  advanced in Airey v. Ireland was that the financial  considerations had to come into play, but the court took  an absolutist view and stated that funding was not a  legitimate consideration in restricting an applicant's  access to justice. That fundamentalist approach will cause  problems not only for the Government but for other  countries. Again, we would do well to create a defensible  framework in clause 1.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has  mentioned the point made in the Airey case about finances  not being a consideration. Does that not destroy his  argument that including such general principles will  defend us from convention rights claims? The example  that he gave was that we could include the principle that  legal aid is not a bottomless pit, but it was clearly stated  in the Airey case that that would not be good enough?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall deal precisely with what the  Minister said, but I do not want to become involved in  too much esoteric discussion. The Airey case depended  on the facts of the case. Nevertheless, it would be a  helpful and timely reminder to those who decide whether  legal aid should be made available to include in the Bill  a restatement of the principles that they should consider  in determining whether legal aid should be made available  in the first place. So we are having a slightly circular  argument.     
<P>
It is of value to include such a restatement in the Bill  which will be a determining document that can be  referred to in deciding the criteria under which funding  will be made available. The principles that we are seeking  to achieve should be stated at the outset. That is what  clause 1 does.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): I was provoked  into intervening only by the remarks of the hon. Member  for Stafford. Is not his criticism of clause 1, which  introduced by Lord Lloyd of Berwick, equally applicable  to amendment No. 5 the Government's rather less than  tightly drafted purposes provision which they intend to  insert into clause 5?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree with my hon. and learned Friend.  At a later stage, it might be interesting to hear the hon.  Member for Clwyd, West tell us his views, because he  has praised amendment No. 5.  
<P>
It is common ground that if clause 1 were retained,  amendment No. 17 would excite virtually no objection in  the Committee. Indeed, I have even heard suggestions that  it is accepted that it would improve the existing text,  because the words  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"racial grounds, gender, sexual orientation"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
would be inserted in clause 1. That seems sensible and  compatible with current practice in many laws and  regulations on discrimination.  
<P>
Amendment No. 18 states  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that persons obtaining access to legal services under this Part shall  have the widest possible choice of provider or services"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
On Tuesday, I listened with interest to a debate in which  the use of the word "possible"	 was discussed. If the  Minister does not like that word and wants to use another  term perhaps, "reasonably practicable"	 I would be the  most receptive person to such a suggestion. That could be  done on Report. Other words could be used. In fact, the  principle that  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"people obtaining access ... shall have the widest possible choice of  provider or services"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
is important, because other clauses contain considerable  restrictions on the service provided.  
<P>
I am perfectly aware of the Minister's point, that  restricting the provision of services to those best able to  provide them may be perfectly legitimate. Therefore,  proposals such as franchising cannot be criticised.  However, the Government are creating a public defender  service, although it will not have precisely that name.  I wait with interest to discover the extent to which the  views expressed by the Solicitor-General on Second  Reading are modified in Committee we detect signs that  they may be.     
<P>
Perhaps it was a slip of the tongue, but in responding  to the debate on Second Reading, the Solicitor-General  seemed to hesitate about whether choice will be available  in every case in which someone uses the Criminal  Defence Service. Therefore, it is a good idea to restate at  the outset that the widest possible choice will be available.  
<P>
Again, subject to the question of the principle of clause  1 that I addressed earlier in this speech, I hope that it  would not command any real objection if the clause were  to remain. The amendments constitute two sensible  additions to what some sensible and learned people  inserted in the Bill when it was scrutinised in another  place.  
<P>
I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's  time, but I shall return to the basic principle. Everything  that we do should reflect the fact that we have  incorporated the European convention in the Human  Rights Act 1998. Last year, the Government announced  with a great fanfare that the provisions of the 1998 Act  would percolate down through the system and that it  would enable rights under the convention to be asserted.  It is extraordinary that, having incorporated the  convention but not yet having allowed people to seek  remedies in our courts, the Government seem to be  closing their eyes to the consequences of their own action,  even though they stimulated public discussion last year  about these matters.  
<P>
The reality is that we cannot escape the Human Rights  Act 1998; it is a growing phenomenon and we should  adapt to it. We should consider a further issue in the  context of clause 1. I have always viewed the 1998 Act  as a baseline. After all, given the access to justice in and  the human rights records and justice systems of several  countries that are members of the Council of Europe,  one's eyebrows rise on discovering that they are  signatories to the convention.  
<P>
The truth is that we have higher standards, especially  in our judicial system and our system of justice, in this  country that those required under the convention. That is  how it should be. Therefore, the convention should not be  used as an excuse to lower our standards, simply because  the Minister is happy to put his imprimatur on the front  of the Bill stating that it complies with the European  convention.     
<P>
Clause 1 is a creative clause, designed to enable those  whose job it is to interpret the Bill in the courts it will  undoubtedly be challenged to understand what  Parliament is driving at; and that what we are driving at  is in conformity with the European convention on human  rights and the Human Rights Act 1998. It is therefore to  be commended, and I deeply regret that the Minister  intends striking it out.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> I support Government  amendment No. 5 and the deletion of clause 1. I said on  Second Reading that I was unhappy that the Bill did not  contain a purposes clause. Given the Bill's wide  directive-making powers, it is essential that their purposes  should be included in the Bill so that they can be  scrutinised by the House of Commons. I am satisfied that  amendment No. 5 provides for that, although it relates  only to the Community Legal Service.  
<P>
I believe that clause 1 would defeat the purposes of the  Bill. The Government are entitled to take the view that it  is not an access to lawyers Bill but an Access to Justice  Bill. It is entirely proper that the Government should refer  in amendment No. 5 to the need for proportionality and  to the need to  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"promote improvements in the range and quality of services...and in  the ways in which they are made accessible"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I share the views expressed by my hon. Friend the  Minister and by some in the other place that clause 1 is  too widely drawn, and that it is unrealistic and  counterproductive. None the less, I wish to probe the  Minister a little further on how clause 5, as amended by  amendment No. 5, will work.  
<P>
The Bill seeks to promote a pro-active approach to the  application of public money, so that it meets real need.  I welcome the fact that such a strategic approach to need  is being taken, particularly in neglected areas such as  housing law, benefit law and public law.  
<P>
My first question is about public law. For some time,  people in many parts of the country have been denied  access to public law remedies because of the failure of  existing practices, particularly in rural areas, to be fully  aware of and engaged in matters of judicial review and  public law. Will the Minister expand on the answer that  he gave me to a recent parliamentary question?  
<P>
What proposals does the Minister have for ensuring that  judicial reviews are heard in centres outside London? He  is aware of my interest in Welsh devolution, but my  question is not confined to Wales. Ensuring access to  public law remedies can have a benign influence, raising  standards in local government and officialdom in general.  If we are to have a strategic approach to legal needs, it is  right and proper that the lacuna and weakness in the  present system should be addressed.
