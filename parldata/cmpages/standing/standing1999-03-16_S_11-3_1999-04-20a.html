<P>
On resuming  
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Will the Minister kindly make  it clear whether his answer suggested that the amendment  was not necessary because the standard of proof in it was  equivalent to that that the Secretary of State would have  to have in mind? Or does he oppose the amendment  because it would require a higher standard of proof than  his answer conveyed? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I made it clear that a civil standard of proof  was required. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> We must therefore assume that cases  will be determined on the balance of probabilities, and not  beyond reasonable doubt. I suspect that my hon. Friend  the Member for Hertsmere will wish to return to that  point, and I am almost certain that it will come up on  Report and in debates in another place. The penalties will  be high; £2,000 is the minimum. Unless, we can make the  penalties variable, I suspect that the Minister's reply will  not find favour either in the House or in another place. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a useful debate. Several  organisations that submitted evidence to the Committee  are particularly interested in the issue, and we have  obtained more information from the Government than we  did before. 
<P>
I am interested in the Minister's account of the  Government's relations with the FTA and the RHA. I am  in favour of good relations between those bodies and the  Government, but I am not sure that there has been  unadulterated pure love between them. A press release  issued by the FTA and RHA stated that claims by the  Government that drivers are either culpable because they  accept bribes or at best negligent because they do not  check their loads are nonsense and gravely offensive to  the industry. It said that Government comments accusing  the industry of negligence were made by the Minister  responsible for immigration the Under-Secretary in  the House on Monday, and that the Minister would be  steering the parliamentary path of the Bill, which proposes  to fine innocent drivers and operators £2,000 per illegal  immigrant discovered in their vehicles. 
<P>
We hope that there will be smooth relations between  Government and the industry, but that will depend on the  Government listening to the legitimate concerns of lorry  drivers and the road haulage industry. They are worried  about the procedures that the Bill will put in place. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West is  right. On every issue that the Committee considered,  things stack up against lorry drivers. The penalty is high,  and the additional penalty will be the same as the first  penalty. We now know that the Secretary of State will  determine everything according to a civil standards of  proof, so lorry drivers will not have the protection of the  higher, criminal, standard of proof. Defences will be made  available to drivers, but it will be difficult for them to use  them in practice. It appears more and more as though a  regime of strict liability will be imposed on lorry drivers. 
<P>
I suspect that others will determine those issues, and  that they may come before the courts. I am pleased that  the Minister referred to the statement on the front page of  the Bill that is required by the Human Rights Act 1998.  If he had not done so, I would have brought up the subject  myself. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Mr. Secretary Shaw has made the following statement under  section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998: 
<P>
In my view the provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Bill  are compatible with the Convention rights."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
When the learned views of outside organisations about the  points of due process that arise in the amendments are  put, it is incumbent on Ministers to take some care in  responding to those concerns and to consider them very  carefully.    
<P>
I know that the Minister will have thought carefully  about his reply. I could tell by the way in which he was  giving it. But Ministers cannot just steamroller things  through when they have given such undertakings in the  Bill. It is easy for them to give such undertakings, but it  will not necessarily be they who have to face up to the  consequences. Such matters may come before the courts,  as the hon. Member for Hallam pointed out. It is far better  to examine them in detail in a Committee and try to get  them right, thus avoiding the costs, problems and  embarrassment of court cases. 
<P>
I do not know what the fate of the provision will be.  I certainly would not pretend to give a decided opinion  on whether it will eventually be found to be compatible  with human rights requirements. But I do not think that  the way in which things are stacking up against the lorry  drivers will be entirely helpful to the Government's cause.  Whatever the result may be in terms of the human rights  consequences, it does not make it look any fairer to lorry  drivers to push through a draconian regime. 
<P>
I have listened carefully to what the Minister had to  say, but again I shall press the amendment to a vote. This  is a serious issue, and the lorry drivers will want us to  reflect carefully and to express their concerns. The best  way to do that is through a vote.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 463, in  page 13, line 31, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`if the person in control of the vehicle, ship or aircraft at the time  of its embarcation knew, believed or had reasonable grounds for  believing that a clandestine entrant was present in the vehicle, ship  or aircraft and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent their arrival  in the United Kingdom'. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  the following amendments: No. 466, in page 14, leave out  lines 7 to 11. 
<P>
No. 471, in clause 20, page 14, line 35, leave out  `suspecting' and insert `believing'. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to another important  subject. The amendment concerns the important subject of  the lorry driver's [Interruption.] Perhaps the Minister can  contain the enthusiasm that he displayed on the last group  of amendments until he has heard what the amendment is  about, which is the important subject of the lorry driver's  knowledge of the presence of the clandestine entrant. As the  Bill stands, there is no requirement for a lorry driver to have  any knowledge, belief or even suspicion of the presence of  a clandestine entrant in his vehicle for the question of  liability to arise.    
<P>
Once the clandestine entrant's presence is linked to the  responsible person, that person is liable for a penalty, as  we now know, unless he can avail himself of a defence  under clause 20. We shall come to that in due course, but  in brief, it requires the responsible person to show that he  had no suspicion of the presence of the clandestine  entrant. There are also other hurdles to be surmounted. 
<P>
The amendment explores the question of whether we  should require some form of knowledge on the part of the  lorry driver, and consider whether he has failed to take  reasonable steps. That is a perfectly reasonable  proposition to explore. The lorry driver's knowledge is an  issue that many of those who gave evidence to the  Committee commented upon and wanted us to explore. 
{**fc
<jf333**} 1.30 pm   <P>
Subsection (2) makes a responsible person liable for a  penalty. The amendment would qualify that by providing  that he would be liable only if at the time of  embarkation he 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"knew, believed or had reasonable grounds for believing that a  clandestine entrant was present in the vehicle, ship or aircraft and  failed to take reasonable steps to prevent"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
the arrival of the clandestine entrant. That does not require  a lorry driver to know. It would be sufficient for him to  believe or to have reasonable grounds for believing that  there was a clandestine entrant in the vehicle. 
<P>
That formulation of knowledge, belief or reasonable  grounds for believing was drawn up fairly carefully. It is  pitched at a lesser state than knowledge; belief or  reasonable grounds for believing will do to trigger the  liability. It has been deliberately pitched in that way to try  to tempt the Minister. Obviously, one wants to make  things as fair as possible for the lorry driver, but the  amendment has been drafted to make it as tempting and  realistic as possible for the Minister. I hope that he will  be able to think very carefully about it. I will see as I go  along how far I can tempt him. 
<P>
As the Minister will know, belief is short of knowledge.  Belief would be the state of mind of a person a lorry  driver, in this instance who says to himself, "I cannot  say that I know for certain that there are clandestine  entrants in my vehicle, but there can be no other  reasonable conclusion in the light of all that I have heard  and seen."	 That is belief. If the lorry driver had that state  of mind, liability would be triggered. 
<P>
In a bid to attract the Minister's approval, the  formulation in the amendment goes even further than that.  It also includes "reasonable grounds of believing"	. That is  intended to cover the case of a driver who says to himself,  "Despite all that I have seen and heard on this journey,  and what has apparently been going on, I refuse to believe  what my brain tells me is obvious."	 Belief in that sense,  in the sense in which it is meant in other fields of the law,  should be the minimum requirement. It should not go any  further than that but it is framed in those terms to make  it attractive to the Minister. 
<P>
The point at which we draw the line, where we say that  what has happened should not be enough to attract  liability, is mere suspicion. That would cover the lorry  driver who says to himself, "I suspect that there may be  clandestine entrants in my vehicle, but on the other hand,  there may not be."	 That state of mind would not be  enough. We shall examine that case on a later amendment  to a provision that requires a defendant to show that he  did not have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a  clandestine entrant was, or might be, concealed in the  trailer. We shall come to that important subject in due  course.    
<P>
The second limb of the amendment is about taking  reasonable steps: a lorry driver would be liable only if,  having become aware of the presence of the clandestine  entrants, he failed to take reasonable steps to prevent their  arrival. What is reasonable would depend on the  circumstances. In considering what is reasonable in the  circumstances, considerable allowance should be made for  the situation in which a driver finds himself. We have not  sufficiently considered the position of drivers, who would  want Parliament to consider the matter from their point of  view; I am sure that hon. Members will be assiduous in  that respect. 
<P>
No lorry driver should be expected to do anything that  puts his own health and safety or that of others, including  clandestine entrants, at risk. A later amendment deals  specifically with that matter, but it is relevant to ask what  are reasonable steps for a driver to take to prevent the  arrival of clandestine entrants once he has become aware  of their presence. The driver will be travelling across a  foreign country or at a foreign port when he makes the  discovery. Informing the foreign authorities the port  authorities, internal authorities or the police may be a  reasonable step to take, but that depends on the  circumstances. If the lorry driver becomes aware of the  presence of the would-be clandestine entrants when he is  on the ship, it would be a reasonable step for him to  inform the master of the vessel and the port authorities. 
<P>
It may be reasonable not to expect much more than  that. People in other walks of life who are neither lorry  drivers nor Members of Parliament would consider those  reasonable steps for someone to take in such  circumstances. In both limbs of the amendment, matters  concerning the mental state of the lorry driver, his  awareness of the clandestine entrants and the question  whether he has taken reasonable steps to prevent their  arrival are for the Secretary of State, and a proper legal  process should be available to the lorry driver. 
<P>
The absence of a requirement for the Secretary of State  to prove any knowledge on the part of the lorry driver,  including my extended definition of knowledge, is a  noteworthy feature of the system which has attracted  interest among those submitting evidence to the  Committee. I would appreciate he Minister's considered  response to that point. I hope that he will feel free, just for  once, to respond more positively than he has to previous  amendments. I await his reply with anticipation. 
<P>
Amendment No. 466 would delete the provisions of  subsection (7) which, subject to the defence afforded by  clause 20, make it immaterial whether the responsible  person knew of the presence of the clandestine entrants.  My arguments for amendment No. 463 also support this  amendment and I shall not burden the Committee by  repeating them. 
<P>
Amendment No. 471 relates to the defence provided  by clause 20(3). It refers to grounds for suspicion rather  than for believing. My earlier arguments also apply to  this amendment, but the first of the three defences in  clause 20 must be considered in conjunction with the  other requirements in the clause because the defence is  cumulative. Each of the limbs of clause 20(3)  paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) have to be proved by the  responsible person. I shall discuss that issue later when  we debate the defence mechanism in clause 20.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment is in the same  group as those that we are discussing now, therefore it  cannot be debated later. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to  say something about it he should say it now. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will have to say something about it  now because the proposal is not satisfactory as drafted.  Suspicion is not good enough; a higher threshold is  needed. 
<P>
In clause 20(3)(a) one limb of the defence that must be  proved, together with the other limbs, is that the carrier  shows that he did not know and 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"had no reasonable grounds for suspecting"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
that he was carrying a clandestine entrant. There is no  mention of "believe"	 or "grounds for believing"	 in the  clause, nor of "suspecting"	. The phrase is "reasonable  grounds for suspecting"	. Generally, in law, each of the  states of mind suspicion, belief and knowledge are  used to trigger thresholds for various things, including,  among many others, the powers of police officers on  arrest; they are in a graduated progression from suspicion  to believing to knowledge. Grounds to suspect are at the  bottom of the scale. 
<P>
On the subject of powers that are exercised under  stop-and-search arrest powers in the Police and Criminal  Evidence Act 1984, Bevan and Lidstone, a well-known  legal authority, says that those powers are conditional  upon the existence of reasonable grounds to suspect. The  authority states:    
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This is a much lower standard than reasonable grounds to  believe. In legal theory, the latter standard requires something close  to certainty."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Grounds to suspect are much lower than that. They are at  the bottom of the threshold and a lower standard than  reasonable grounds to believe. Amendment No. 463  requires reasonable grounds to believe as the minimum  threshold for triggering liability. In that amendment, the  Secretary of State has to establish that the responsible  person has reasonable grounds to believe. 
<P>
The defence in clause 20(3)(a) turns things the other  way round from the lorry driver's point of view. Once  again, the scales of justice are tilted against the lorry  driver who has to show that he did not know, and had no  reasonable grounds for suspecting, that he was carrying a  clandestine entrant. That is the lowest possible formula,  which puts a heavy burden on carriers, in fairness to  whom the state of knowledge must be more than the  lowest. That is an important point; I seek a considered  response from the Minister on the issues that I have  raised. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for  Hertsmere said, the amendments are important. When I  spoke earlier, I mentioned human rights. The amendments  give us an opportunity to consider the anxieties of hauliers  and freight boarders. The amendments deal with the  amount of knowledge that lorry drivers can have about  possible clandestine entrants in their vehicles. 
<P>
The Minister told the Committee about discussions with  the RHA and the FTA. Those associations have already  given their support to severe penalties for drivers who are  found guilty of knowingly bringing clandestine entrants  into the country. Several hon. Members have reminded  the Committee that the Immigration Act 1971 provides  for the penalty of imprisonment for seven years. However,  there is a difference between the evidence that we heard  and the Minister's comments about the detection rate  and the contribution of hauliers to detecting illegal  immigrants. 
<P>
The associations claimed that 90 per cent. of detection  occurred as a result of voluntary action by lorry drivers  or operators, whereas the United Kingdom authorities  by that, I assume that they mean the Immigration  Service were responsible for only 3 per cent. of  detection. I believe that the figures are almost  diametrically opposed to those that the Minister provided.  I am afraid that I did not write them down, but I am sure  that he will remind the Committee of them when he  replies to the debate. 
<P>
<H5> 1.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
The associations said that it would be easier for them  to enforce the clause if the code of conduct was made  available. What would the Minister like drivers to do to  ensure that there are no clandestine entrants in their  trailers? The Minister claims time and again that the Bill  puts the onus on drivers to check their loads. That is  understandable and sensible. Drivers should know the  contents of their trailers. The law-abiding majority know  where they stand with such a requirement.    
<P>
I assume that the Minister acknowledges that the  majority of lorry drivers are law abiding. My hon. Friend  the Member for Hertsmere pointed out that, this evening,  the Minister occasionally came close to blackening the  name of all those who work in the haulage industry. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend touches on a point that  I should have made in my opening speech. What  constitutes a reasonable requirement will depend on the  nature of the vehicle. A reasonable requirement for the  driver of a curtain-sided truck, which is difficult to enter,  might be different from that for the driver of a different  vehicle. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am happy to say that, even at this time  of night, my hon. Friend and I think similarly. I was about  to tackle the problems of drivers who are asked to inspect  their trucks or to look for clandestines who might be  hiding there. 
<P>
The Bill should penalise only those who knowingly  flout the law. We have often discussed those who may be  unwittingly affected by the Bill. Amendment No. 466  would delete subsection (7), which stresses that lack of  knowledge of a trailer's contents is not a defence. 
<P>
How does the law-abiding driver, who is under pressure  and worried about a possible fine that the Immigration  Service might levy, and about answering to his boss when  he returns to base, check his load thoroughly? Some hon.  Members suggest that the best method is opening up the  load and checking it before setting off. However, as my  hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said, that is often  wholly impractical. Containers, with or without fixed  sides or roofs, can be massive. It is impossible for a  haulier to root around through an expensive and possibly  sensitive cargo for illegal immigrants as he prepares to  leave. Customs and Excise officers acknowledge that they  cannot search every vehicle because it is unfeasible and  would take too long. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Throughout his contribution, the  hon. Gentleman appears to make excuses for bringing in  clandestine immigrants. Will he assure the Committee that  he is not doing so? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Faber:</B> No, I am not making excuses. However,  Conservative Members support a fair regime for  law-abiding truckers, who may find clandestines in the  back of their lorries through no fault of their own. It is  sad that the Minister ignores oral and written evidence  from acknowledged experts on the matter. 
<P>
In our fourth evidence-taking sitting, Mr. Dossetter  said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is not always possible to find illegal immigrants on board. We  are not looking here at someone crouching behind the back seat of  a Ford Fiesta, but a 40ft trailer full of goods."	 [Official Report,  Special Standing Committee, 18 March 1999; c. 411.]    <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have discussed the problems in our evidence-taking  sittings and in our later proceedings, during which the  hon. Member for Harwich gave the Committee an  interesting insight into sealing containers. We bow to his  knowledge on that. Breaking a seal to open a cargo can  cause grave problems. Many recipients would not take  kindly to the opening of their precious cargo, which could  consist of foodstuffs or medical equipment, or, as was  suggested in an evidence-taking sitting, computer  equipment worth £1 million. It is not practical to expect  a haulier to search such cargo for illegal immigrants. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> All we are getting from the hon.  Gentleman is a long list of excuses for carrying  clandestines. Lorry drivers must accept responsibility.  When will the hon. Gentleman begin to accept  responsibility for ensuring that our immigration controls  are effective? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I hope that the Minister will provide  examples of practical ways in which lorry drivers can  carry out searches. The Freight Transport Association and  the Road Haulage Association have asked him for such  examples for some time. I should be delighted to support  the Minister wholeheartedly if he suggested practical  methods by which hauliers could examine their trucks  thoroughly. If the Minister can convince the professionals  in the trade of those practical suggestions, I shall be  happy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not tempted by the amendments,  which constitute another attempt to undermine the  proposals for an effective regime of civil penalties for  carrying clandestines into the United Kingdom. 
<P>
Amendment No. 463 would limit the scope of the  application of civil penalties. However, it is technically  defective and, more important, it is completely  unacceptable It would require knowledge of, or  reasonable grounds for suspecting, the presence of a  clandestine entrant. Clause 18(2) provides for liability in  respect of a clandestine entrant. The responsible person is  liable to a penalty in respect of the clandestine entrant  under subsection (2)(a). Subsection (2)(b) provides for an  additional penalty in respect of each additional person  who is concealed in the same transporter.    
<P>
Amendment No. 463 would add at the end of  subsection (2)(b) a qualification that the person in control  of the vehicle, ship or aircraft should have known or  believed that a clandestine entrant was present and 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"failed to take reasonable steps to prevent their arrival in the  United Kingdom"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The amendment stresses that there should be an element  of knowledge before liability coupled with a failure to  take reasonable steps. That ground is covered better in  clause 20(3). Unlike amendment No. 463, the defence in  the Bill creates a requirement for an effective system for  preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants to be in  operation at all times. 
<P>
Amendment No. 466 would fatally weaken the impact of  the civil penalty. The Conservatives talk about immigration  controls but do not will the means to ensure that we have  them. The amendment would delete the whole of  subsection (7), which is intended to ensure that the civil  penalty is an absolute penalty that cannot be mitigated by a  claim of lack of knowledge of a clandestine being  concealed in a transporter. There is a carefully constructed  exception to that in the defence in Clause 20 (3). However,  the clause 20 defence is deliberately constructed so that  lack of knowledge, or suspicion of the presence of a  clandestine, has to be shown by the carrier and has to be  accompanied by proof of existence and operation of  effective counter-measures to prevent carriage of  clandestines. 
<P>
The amendment, by sweeping away subsection (7),  would cause doubt as to whether lack of knowledge or  suspicion of a clandestine was a material factor. It would  fatally weaken the civil penalty. I urge the Committee to  reject the amendment. 
<P>
The effect of amendment No. 471 would be to provide  much greater scope for a defence under subsection (3),  which provides a three-part defence against the civil  penalty and the first part, under subsection (3)(a), is that  the carrier 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
a clandestine entrant. The amendment would change that  to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"did not know and had no reasonable grounds for believing"	.    <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In ordinary parlance, a suspicion is something less  strong than a belief. The effect of the amendment would  therefore be to provide a much wider defence against the  civil penalty. It would encourage drivers who only  suspected the presence of a clandestine not to take action  to investigate the matter and not to involve the relevant  authorities They could base a defence on the fact that they  did not believe that they had a clandestine aboard. That  would be most undesirable. 
<P>
It is right to set the trigger at the level specified in the  clause. The amendment would reduce the effectiveness of  the deterrent that we seek to put in place. It would enable  clandestines to be brought into the country without  consequence where there are reasonable grounds to  suspect. Those who have reasonable grounds to suspect  should check their lorries and should be liable if they do  not. It is a matter of judgment and balance, and we believe  that the clause gets it right. 
<P>
Our aim is to get hauliers to check their lorries. No one  need be fined if the lorries are checked. The amendment  represents another Conservative attempt to undermine the  effective immigration controls that we seek to put in  place.

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Once the Minister starts using  party labels, he is losing control of his approach to the  Committee. In return, I invite him to consider what he  would think if a Conservative Government were putting  forward these measures and declaring that because the  balance was right, nothing said in Committee would make  any difference. What would his Labour colleagues have  said to that in terms of parliamentary propriety or on the  merits of the issue? 
<P>
The Minister might have suggested in relation to  amendment No. 463 that the word "and"	 before "failed"	  in line 3 would be more appropriate; or he might have  suggested that it would be more acceptable if there were  an either/or provision. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. friend is pursuing a valuable  line of argument. I hope that I demonstrated in my earlier  intervention that I was trying to be flexible and was  reaching out to the Minister to find out if there was a  way of making matters a bit fairer. I would welcome any  discussion and sign of flexibility.

<B>Mr. Bottomley: In his response to an earlier debate,  the Minister said that he would think about points made  about human rights and other possibilities in an  amendment. It is notable that the Committee accepted that  re-examination. The Minister did not commit himself to  change his mind, but demonstrated that he was willing to  pay attention to what was said. </B><P>
<P>
The Minister should do the same in relation to this  group of amendments, especially amendment No. 463. It  may be said that the Minister's only productive remark  was that effective counter-measures were needed against  clandestine entrants. Therefore, the very existence of a  clandestine entrant is enough to require the carrier to pay  the penalty. As we know, a burning lorry was taken  aboard a cross-channel train. Security people and even  the driver failed to notice that the lorry was on fire. 
<P>
If that can happen, where are the effective  counter-measures? In effect, the public authorities had a  responsibility to ensure against fire, not only in the tunnel  itself, but going into the tunnel. So the standard of  achievement sought by the Minister is contradicted by  the facts. 
<P>
Let us consider a lorry driver who believes that a  clandestine person is on board his lorry only after leaving  France or Belgium. If the lorry driver is on a one-way trip  to the United Kingdom and will arrive at Dover or  Harwich, what is he supposed to do? Is he supposed to  seize the clandestine entrant, keep him or her on the  vehicle, turn round, and go straight back to France or  Belgium? 
<P>
Is that legal? Does the lorry driver have the legal power  to apprehend and detain a clandestine entrant? Or does he  have a responsibility to use the hotline, possibly using his  mobile phone to ring and say: "I think someone is on  board my lorry. Do you want me to stop and check, or  would you prefer me to bring him to you so that you can  check yourself?"	 
<P>
When that lorry driver goes to the authorities, they will  find that he has suspected and detected a clandestine  entrant. Such a driver chooses to go to the authorities,  rather than take the law into his own hands. However, he  will automatically be fined £2,000 because clearly he did  not take effective counter-measures, even if he went  through the code of practice that we will discuss later.  Therefore, is the Minister not imposing a severe penalty  on someone who is carrying out a public duty? 
<P>
Conservative Members accept that some people will  load clandestine entrants into their lorries in mainland  Europe and bring them here for money. However, such  people are not likely to arrive in this country saying that  they have clandestine entrants on board. If that were to be  the case, the Minister should organise honey-traps or  honey lorries, which would go and recruit people in the  car parks of Antwerp, Ostend or Calais. For £1,500  which is £500 below the going rate the drivers would  load up their lorries, bring entrants straight in, turn  around, and go back. People carried in those lorries would  lose their money, having had two cross-channel trips. As  a result, people would become suspicious of lorry drivers  offering trips to Britain for £1,000-£2,000. 
<P>
That is an example of how the matter may be  approached. I am trying to demonstrate that a lorry driver  may take all reasonable measures, only to suspect or  detect a clandestine entrant. However, the Government's  proposal will ensure that whatever that lorry driver does,  he does not let that person out of the lorry in front of the  United Kingdom authorities so that that person may be  detained. In effect, the measure provides an incentive to  do the wrong things, rather than the right things. 
<P>
The amendment is sensible and the Minister should  give it serious consideration. He should not make the  accusation that Conservatives are soft on immigration  every time that we ask a question. Such a ludicrous  suggestion is unworthy of the Minister. He should shape  up, listen to our debate, and respond when he can. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I  apologise for not being here for the whole debate. I only  came into the Committee Room half way though the  remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for  Westbury (Mr. Faber). 
<P>
The Minister's remarks surprised me and prompted me  to speak.    
<P>
The Minister said that a lorry driver only has to make  a few simple checks to avoid the penalty. Surely that is an  understatement of the burden that this clause and other  clauses places on the lorry driver? Thresholds have been  built into the measure so that the lorry driver will still be  liable, even if he does a few simple checks. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Does my right hon. Friend recall that I  suggested to the Minister that he had a perfect opportunity  to recommend ways and means in which lorry drivers  could carry out those checks? The Minister could discuss  that matter with trade associations. However, he did not  seem interested in taking up my suggestion. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I had noted that. However, it is not  accurate to say that the lorry driver only has to make a  few simple checks to avoid the penalty, because another  clause specifies that an effective system must be in place  to prevent the carriage of clandestines. Who is to decide  what is an effective system? 
<P>
During the four years that I spent at the Home Office,  I learned that as soon as we thought that we had invented  a good system for dealing with criminals, they cleverly  found a way round it. That was true of paedophiles,  internet crime or whatever aspect of criminality one cares  to name. As soon as one thinks that one has an effective  system for dealing with a problem, criminal masterminds  and others devote much effort to trying to get round the  law. 
<P>
Clandestines and some of those organising routes and  trips are desperate people. Big money may be involved.  Such people will soon find ways of making a measure  ineffective. 
<P>
No doubt effective advertising will encourage members  of the Road Haulage Association and the Freight  Transport Association, big companies such as Eddie  Stobart and small owner-drivers to have the latest bit of  kit, such as tilt wagons or trailers, which, once sealed,  will ensure that no one can get in. Once such a vehicle is  checked and tabs or locks are put on the back doors, the  driver is guaranteed that no one will enter. 
<P>
However, you can bet your bottom dollar that, within a  few weeks, some people will have found ways of  infiltrating that system. Clandestines will be transported  in those vehicles and will get into this country.  Prosecutors will say that the system is clearly ineffective  because people are inside vehicles. I do not see how one  can defend the line that there must be an effective system. 
<P>
An effective system prevents anyone getting through.  Should someone get into such a system, it is obviously no  longer effective. Those who are prosecuting will be able  to win all their cases, because they can argue that the lorry  was opened or stopped and people were found inside  and that therefore the system is ineffective. 
<P>
The Minister's remark that simple checks will suffice  is a gross exaggeration. In fact, it is an understatement of  what is specified in law. Amendment No. 463 would  make provision for a sensible test of reasonableness. That  test pertains not only to the defences that we shall discuss  later, but to clause 18, and would prevent an offence being  committed in such circumstances. 
<P>
I bow to no one in saying that I would like those who  deliberately bring in clandestines to be clobbered hard.  That is because they are bringing people in illegally and  because they can cause untold suffering. 
<P>
We know of cases in which people have died or  suffocated in such vehicles. It is a horrific, vile trade and  those who deliberately perpetrate it, or are so careless as  not to care whether people get into their vehicles, should  be hit hard.    
<P>
If we are to believe the statistics, more than 90 per cent.  of those clandestines who are reported to the Government  or the authorities are reported by lorry drivers themselves  and they are the people who are to be hit hard, I know of  no other aspect of criminal law I will happily accept  being told that I may have this wrong where the  innocent victim is penalised if he has not taken all  effective steps to prevent being made a criminal. 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I know that an insurance premium may increase if a person's  house is wide open to burglary or if he has not taken effective steps  to secure his property. That is what effectively the Minister is  saying: if a person who is not a criminal has failed to take effective  steps to secure his property has not, in the Government's view,  taken effective steps to prevent a new crime, the crime of bringing  clandestines here, for which the Bill provides he will be clobbered  by severe penalties, because the Government want to put the  enforcement burden on the person who discovers the criminality and  reports it. That is grossly unfair for 90 per cent. of the innocent  carriers who are reporting this vile trade. <P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Did the right hon. Gentleman  think it grossly unfair when the Government in which he  was a Minister put a requirement of liability on carriers  and made them responsible if they were carrying persons  because they had not carried out proper checks on their  documentation? 
<P>
<B>Mr. MacLean:</B> If the Minister is happy to say that he  will rely on that existing legislation. I will back down.  However, he is going much further than the measures laid  by my colleagues in the Government of whom I was a  member. The Minister is introducing a new series of  clauses and changing the burden of proof I think that he  is also changing the trigger point to make the provisions  draconian, and unfair on the innocent. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman think, in  view of what is happening now, that his Government's  legislation was effective? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If it had not been effective, I assume that  the Government would have got rid of it straight away. It  seems that the result of that legislation is that more than  90 per cent. of clandestines have been detected because  lorry drivers pull up to authorities and say, "I think there  are people in the back."	 If that legislation had not been  effective, the Government would, I suspect, have  abolished it long before now. It seems that it is the  legislation that is delivering to the authorities the  clandestines who are currently being caught. That is a  reasonable way to go about things. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Gentleman appears  to say that he is quite happy for 8,000 people to have been  carried in the back of lorries last year those are the ones  that we know of; there are perhaps others of whom we  do not know and that he is not prepared to extend the  legislation to counter that. That is quite unacceptable and  a complete erosion of our immigration controls.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is nonsense. I said that I am quite  happy to see penalised people who are deliberately or  carelessly carrying loads perhaps knowing that  clandestines are on board. I am happy for the Government  to step up their enforcement effort at the ports. I thought  that the Government believed in intelligence-led policing  in these sorts of operations, not the stopping willy-nilly  of every lorry driver or the use of detection methods to  catch out unwary lorry drivers if someone has sneaked on  board. I thought that the Government would use  intelligence-led methods through Customs and Excise and  immigration whereby they target those whom they suspect  are at it and in the main, that is not British lorry drivers. 
<P>
We will have the nonsense that legitimate British lorry  drivers and those who are registered here as well as  those who report 90 per cent. of the illegal trade because  they discover it will be caught by the Government's  proposals while some of the foreign rackets will not be.  Surely the sensible way forward would be to follow the  advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West  and introduce proposals to try to tackle the remaining  fewer than 10 per cent. who are not reported by the lorry  drivers themselves those who are not detected at  present, but who specialise in this trade. 
<P>
The Minister is able to take advice from experts who  are much more informed than I am, including those who  drafted these legislative proposals. It may well be that this  is a serious trade, as the Minister claims. I think that it is,  and that the consequences are serious. I do not like our  immigration laws being flouted or this form of despicable  slavery being practised where people abuse other people  by stuffing them into horrible containers to bring them  here, or anywhere, and make a lot of money out of it. But  just as it is permissible for the National Criminal  Intelligence Service NCIS along with Customs and  Excise, the police and other authorities in the set-up that  we established to target other areas of criminality and  serious crime, whether it be mafia operations from eastern  Europe or drugs operations, it would be perfectly sensible  and permissible, if the Minister wished, for NCIS to target  this illegal trade, to get at the ringleaders and operators  responsible for it who go into certain parts of eastern  Europe or France, and to pick them up. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> If a lorry driver picked up a load  from a port and it was found to be overweight, who would  be responsible the person who loaded the vehicle or the  lorry driver who picked up and carried the overweight  trailer? 
<P>
<B>Mr Maclean:</B> Transport law places an obligation on a  lorry driver to weigh his load, and it is a simple matter to  weigh the load on the weighbridge and know whether it  is overweight. It is not simple to detect clandestines in a  vehicle; if it were, no doubt the detection rate by British  lorry drivers would be much more than 90 per cent. I  understand that they already catch more than 90 per cent.  so the detection rate would then rise to nearer 99 per cent.  or 100 per cent. But it is not as simple as knowing the  weight of a vehicle, or knowing whether the covers are  tied properly or the load is being shed.    
<P>
The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. It is some time  since I taught road traffic law to lorry drivers and a little  while since I obtained my certificate of national  competence in road haulage law, HGV driving and so on.  However, I appreciate the difficulty faced by lorry drivers  in trying to deal with the problem of clandestines. I ask  the Minister again to tell me of any area of law where  there is an obligation on a person who is not a criminal  to do the Government's detective work for them and  where that person is rendered liable to the severe penalties  that are in the Bill if he has taken reasonable precautions  but failed to set up an effective system. I gave the example  of the householder who did not have an effective system  for preventing crime getting burgled and being done, but  the Government's proposals are nonsocial. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Gentleman seems  to be asking for another example and describing precisely  the regime that his Government set up for carrier liability.  I accept that we are going further than that but that is not  what he described. He has asked for another example,  when what he described is almost the same as the  provision for carrier liability that was introduced by the  Conservative Government. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is not so. I am complaining that the  Minister has gone too far beyond the bounds of fairness in  penalising innocent lorry drivers. Let us target the evil  people involved in this new form of slavery, the lorry  drivers or firms on the Continent, in eastern Europe or in  this country who specialise in dealing in the trade. It  cannot be beyond the wit of the NCIS, the immigration  service specialists and others to target them instead of  penalising every lorry driver who, in the opinion of the  courts, has not used effective means to prevent the  carrying of clandestines. Such an approach cannot be  regarded as effective after the deed has been done. We  may say that the Bank of England is effective because it  keeps people out, but if some guy is found inside, it is not  effective. That could be how the Minister's rules in  clauses 18 and 20 will be interpreted, and that would put  an unfair burden on the innocent. I am happy for the  severest penalties to be enforced against those who are  deliberately committing these acts and against those who  do not care and take no precautions. But the Minister goes  too far, and therein lies a fundamental unfairness. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I support my hon. Friend's remarks. We are  trying to insert a test of reasonableness into the  amendments. 
<P>
If somebody is caught with clandestine immigrants in  his vehicle, a charge is levelled against him and he must  defend himself. As most drivers are on their own, the  biggest problem is how they convince people that they  have carried out the checks: it will simply be their word. 
<P>
In the road haulage industry, tacographs, a mechanical  device, are put into lorries to limit hours. One can take  the cards out and read them; they give certainty, because  it is difficult to fiddle with them. However, it is difficult  to prove that somebody carried out procedures such as  checking a seal, getting on top of a trailer and looking at  it, looking underneath with mirrors or making other  checks. That is why we are trying to get the wording of  the Bill right. A responsible driver may do all those  things, but how can he prove that he carried out the  procedures correctly? If the driver was parked up with six  other vehicles, he could ask the driver next to him to look  at his vehicle and he could look at the other driver's  vehicle. He could sign a docket to say that he looked over  an Eddie Stobart lorry and that, although he was not the  driver of the vehicle, he checked it. There is then some  corroboration.    
<P>
It is a difficult area. That is why the wording is  particularly important. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> May I assist the hon. Gentleman,  because he is going through some intellectual gymnastics  to work out how a lorry driver can check his load? Our  discussions with the Freight Transport Association and the  Road Haulage Association have partly related to them  setting up checks and perhaps providing a certification  system so that they can say that effective checks have  been carried out. As part of the code of practice in due  course the Government can no doubt accept what are  effective checks. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman does not  need to go through intellectual gymnastics; it is quite a  straightforward exercise. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am glad that that is the case. The Road  Haulage Association and the Freight Transport  Association are responsible organisations and I am sure  that they will implement the Bill, when enacted, in a  responsible manner. However, there is a problem. 
<P>
Our procedure is basically administrative rather than  judicial. A person must prove that he has carried out the  test to avoid being fined. Therefore, the precise wording  will be important, because the clause will catch not only  British vehicles under the Road Haulage Association but  international vehicles from across Europe and beyond. 
<P>
I shall not mention its name, but a German company  has many vehicles coming to Britain driven by east  European drivers, because it can pay them lower wages  and undercut British competition. There are problems in  getting everybody to sign up to procedures that ensure  greater certainty. 
<P>
With amendments Nos. 463, 466 and 471, my hon.  Friend the Member for Hertsmere is trying to broaden the  discussion to obtain the right wording, because we want  a regime that is enforceable and is seen by lorry drivers  to be fair, so that, if they are caught with somebody on  their vehicle, there is a procedure and they can prove

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree  that if a lorry driver was caught carrying drugs or  dangerous goods in his vehicle, he would have to pay  a penalty? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> We know all that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman says that he  knows about the traffic Acts. I do too, because I worked in  a port. Some drivers try to flout the regulations by not  saying that they have dangerous goods in their vehicles,  because it is cheaper not to put the labels on the trailers.  We all know that. 
<P>
Most drivers are responsible, and I have worked with  many of then, but there are some irresponsible drivers  who like to cut corners. that is what we are talking about.  Most drivers will carry out damage checks all over their  vehicles. Otherwise they are charged for damage claims.  Therefore, most drivers are responsible. Does the hon.  Gentleman agree that there are penalties to be paid if a  driver is caught with drugs or does not declare that he is  carrying dangerous goods? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I do not want to depart too far from the  amendments, because I know that you will call me to  order, Mr. Maxton. To answer that question if drugs are  found in a vehicle, that is a criminal matter which must  go through the courts. We are discussing not a court case,  but an administrative burden. Also, someone must place  drugs on a vehicle, whereas clandestine immigrants can  make their own way. They have not necessarily been  picked up by the lorry driver or put on by someone else. 
<P>
I accept that the vast majority of lorry drivers are  responsible individuals. All we are striving for with  amendments Nos. 463, 466 and 471 is to get the wording  right, so that the Bill is workable and does the job that  the Government want it to do. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been an interesting debate. I  think that the Minister was having a little bit of fun with  my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The  Border when he talked about the difference between  regimes, because we have already been over that ground.  I do not want to go over it again, but if the Minister is  going to use that as a major debating point, I may feel  that I must.    
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I think that my hon. Friend should. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No, I will not give way to temptation.  However, I put the Minister on a warning: if he provokes  me any further, I will return to that ground. i am trying to  help the Minister. I give the hon. Gentleman another  warning. If he once more accuses me or any of my hon.  Friends of not being tough on immigration controls and  trying to keep out clandestine entrants and prays in aid  the Immigration (Carriers Liability) Act 1987, I will refer  to what Labour Front Bench Members, said about that Act  when it was introduced. He is now not only adopting that  Act, but taking it further and claiming greatly to extend  our immigration controls. I am looking for an undertaking  from the Minister that he will not repeat what he said any  more. What was said in 1987 was pathetic and I shall  refer to it if the Minister provokes me once more. 
<P>
I know that the Minister is even tempered  [Interruption.] If the hon. Member for Weaver Vale  (Mr. Hall) wants to hear what was said, he can, but he  will not like it. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Is not the main flaw in the Government's  argument that we are trying to undermine their tough  regime the fact that at present, lorry drivers themselves  are the best detectives, discoverers and turners in of  illegal, clandestine immigrants? The effect of the  Government's measures will be to deter those detectives  from performing that detection? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. A big  problem with the provisions concerns not only their  fairness and compliance with human rights, but the fact  that they may not work in practice. As we have said, they  will create a big disincentive for lorry drivers. It is  insufficient for the Minister to say, "We want to deter all  clandestine immigrants and lorry drivers. We will impose  a draconian regime. Anyone who makes any suggestions  about the measures is trying to weaken them and water  them down."	 That is simply not good enough. 
<P>
It is time that the Minister started to reach out to lorry  drivers. He can do so by reconsidering the spirit of the  amendments. I am prepared to accept the suggestion of  my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West. I had  hoped that the amendment would find some favour with  the Minister. It contains the words "reasonable"	 and  "taking reasonable steps"	. Lorry drivers are public  spirited, they understand the concerns of other members  of the public about clandestine entrants and immigration  controls and they would want to take reasonable steps.  We should not ask them to take unreasonable steps. The  Minister can reach out to lorry drivers by telling them that  he is asking them to take only reasonable steps to prevent  illegal entrants. 
<P>
I shall cite the example that I mentioned in an  intervention of a curtain-sided tilt truck. That was  mentioned in evidence, and I thought that it was an  odd name. Being a layman in these matters, I thought  that I would find out a little more about it. It turns out  that what we were told in evidence about that truck  was entirely correct. It is used by the Wilson truck  service; I will not read out its entire specification, but  the point is that the open-topped curtain-sider has  loading access through the roof. How is a driver to  take simple steps to check the lorry's contents? We  must accept that lorry drivers should take reasonable  steps I think that they understand that. I do not want  to make too much of that point at present, because I  think that the Minister will return to it when we discuss  the code of practice, but it is important that he takes it  on board. 
<P>
The Minister referred my hon. Friend the Member for  Poole to the code of practice, and said that everything  would be taken into account in that code. That will not  do. We have constantly been pressing the Minister for that  code of practice, so that we can debate it. 
<P>
Earlier, we mentioned the code of practice under  clause 13, which deals with section 8 of the Asylum  and Immigration Act 1996. That code of practice sets  out how employers can avoid discriminatory behaviour.  We have not seen that code of practice in order to  debate it; we need to do so now. 
<P>
It would assist the Committee enormously if we could  see the code of practice, or if the Minister would just  impart a little information about it. The purpose of  parliamentary debate is to scrutinise such matters. Having  taken evidence, we are a little better informed, but it  would assist us enormously to see the code of practice.    
<P>
<H5> 2.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I speak as a layman in these matters. The Committee  has appreciated the interventions from the hon. Member  for Harwich, who has some professional experience to  which I defer. My only experience of taking a load  anywhere involved it disappearing into a ditch, and I have  not since been entrusted with any similar undertaking. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Is not the key question for  the Minister that if the figure cited that nine out of  10 clandestine entrants have been detected by lorry  drivers and delivered to the authorities is roughly  right, does he believe that the new provisions will  increase or decrease it? If that proportion reduced only  from 90 per cent. to 50 per cent., the Minister could  not say that there appeared to be about 8,000  clandestine entrants; he would be speaking of 5,000,  because the other ones would have been lost. Under  the new provisions, will there be any incentive for  lorry drivers to deliver people whom they discover to  the authorities? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a very good point, which we  have argued all along. I argued that point on Second  Reading, and canvassed it when we took evidence in the  Special Standing Committee. My hon. Friend is right: we  must consider the matter from lorry drivers' point of view  and try to reach out to them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is looking for a  slogan for his campaign to get the Government to reach  out to lorry drivers, perhaps I could suggest, "Hug a  trucker."	 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will have to think about that one. We  have heard much in recent times about white van man; it  is time that we started to think about big van man, who  is not entirely happy at present. Some reaching out is  needed. Big van man is certainly not dancing with glee at  the recent increases in fuel duties. In the mood that he is  in at present, any reaching out that we can do would be  to the good. 
<P>
Adopting the spirit of reasonableness and not asking  lorry drivers to do more than can be reasonably expected  of them would get us a long way towards where we all  want to be all working together to fight the problem. I  am unhappy with the Minister's response so far. Unless  he can tell me something more or can answer the question  posed by my hon. Friend the member for Worthing, West,  and can be as good as his rhetoric and say that the  measures will increase the number of incidents reported,  or some other statistic, I will press the amendment to a  vote, but I give the Minister one last chance to reach out  if he wants to.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Let me reach out to the road  haulage industry and assure the hon. Gentleman that the  code of practice that we shall bring forward in due course  will follow discussions with the Freight Transport  Association, the Road Haulage Association and other  haulier groups. It is right that we should have those  discussions before we produce the code. 
<P>
I have already dealt with the point about the figure of  90 per cent. from the RHA and FTA. It is nonsense. Of  the 4,000 detected in the Kent area, abut 2,000 were at  the port of Dover, and only 270 of those were the result  of driver action. I do not know where they dug up the  figure of 90 per cent., but it is spurious, and we do not  accept it. 
<P>
During the debate we heard a series of excuses for the  carrying of clandestines, managing to end up with a  description of lorries on fire. I say to the hon. Member  for Worthing, West that if an effective system for  checking lorries were in place to ensure that drivers  checked their lorries and others assisted them in doing so,  clandestines would probably not be entering the country.  At the same time, the extra security precautions involved  would hopefully prevent such serious problems occurring.  We also heard some bizarre justifications for clandestines  on lorries. It seemed that we had moved from spontaneous  combustion to spontaneous clandestines: I do not think  that we want to move down that route. The hon.  Gentleman also referred to honey lorries, which  broadened the issue even further. He concluded by saying  that there are various ways of approaching the matter, and  he certainly convinced us that all sorts of ways can be  invented at 2 o'clock in the morning. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border took  us from the sublime to the ridiculous. He argued that  criminals will always find ways around things and  appeared to be approaching the conclusion that we should  therefore have no controls, although he backed off from  that in the end. I am not talking about drivers carrying  out, as he suggested, a few simple checks. We want  thorough checks to ensure that we do not get clandestines  entering the country in the back of lorries. 
<P>
Practical measures can be taken. We are discussing  those with the road haulage industry, with which we will  be working on the detail of the code of practice. Some  straightforward aspects include: improving the security of  the vehicle; regular checks on the vehicle; record-keeping;  checking how the consignment is being documented;  ensuring that the driver of the vehicle witnesses the  loading of the container, if possible, or that he has a  contract in place which transfers some of the liability to  the person who loads the container if something goes  wrong; reconciling the appropriate paperwork and seals  so that the driver is sure that what he is supposed to be  carrying is what he is carrying; and reporting any  suspicions and any attempts to enter the vehicle. Those  are all practical steps that drivers all too often do not take.  That is why we must ensure that we have an effective  system in place for dealing with such matters. 
<P>
Finally, I say to the right hon. Member for Penrith and  The Border that we have, of course, involved the security  service and NCIS. The police and the immigration service  are setting up new elements of co-operation with Europol  and other organisations. They are all involved in  operations against illegal immigration. It is a big racket,  and international co-operation is essential to deal with it.  We also need to ensure that effective controls, such as the  provisions in the Bill, are in place. 
<P>
However, that is only part of the solution, in which the  penalties will play a further role. It is no good the lorry  drivers blaming someone else, such as the French. We  have heard about blame being transferred in all sorts of  directions by the lorry drivers. The responsibility for  doing something is now apparently being transferred to  Europol and NCIS. Lorry drivers must also accept their  responsibilities, and that is what the clauses will achieve.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Minister smiled while he was  speaking, which was pleasant to see, but his words did  not always match his smile. 
<P>
With regard to those lorry drivers who report their  suspicion or belief that they have a clandestine entrant in  their lorry, we must take it on trust that a code of practice  will come; that may deal with the issue. However, we  must have a system that encourages those drivers to go  on reporting their suspicions or beliefs. 
<P>
If the Minister was saying that some of the 200 lorry  drivers his number in Kent have taken money,  deliberately brought their lorries in containing clandestine  entrants and then delivered them to the authorities, we  must take it on trust from him, although it seems a rather  curious way of proceeding. If that is not what he is saying,  he should consider whether his new provisions are likely  to increase or reduce the numbers of people who are  declared to the authorities. The system should encourage  those truckers who do not take money and who are not  negligent to go on declaring to the authorities their belief  that they are carrying someone who should not be allowed  further into the country. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is mistaken all the  way through this debate, because he seems to have heard  the message from the RHA and the FTA without  understanding its reality: most of these people quite  happily report themselves to the authorities because often  they want to claim asylum and access the benefit system.  That happens to be a fact. The reason that we know about  the 8,000 is because most of them report themselves. It  does not require the lorry driver to report them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> We are getting closer to a common  understanding of what we are trying to achieve. I thought  that I had put a point to the Minister, but one of the  reasons that I will not be successful in politics is probably  because I am bad at communicating. I want to know  whether he believed that the number of clandestine  entrants whom he said had been declared to the authorities  not by themselves but by lorry drivers saying, "We  believe that someone is in our wagon"	, would increase or  decrease. I think that the provisions are likely to reduce  that number if they are not improved and if the Minister  does not consider the point made by amendment No. 463. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is asking me a  question, but it seems that he has still not got the point.  The provisions are meant to stop clandestine entrants  coming into the UK in the first place; they are not about  handing them over after they get here. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> In that case, the Minister seems to  concede the point that these measures will provide a  greater disincentive, and it is likely that a smaller number  of lorry drivers who have not accepted money will report  people who turn up uninvited on their lorries. The  measures will thus be counterproductive, at least for that  category. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend had touched on an  important point. Does he think that the Minister's  unwillingness to give any indication of the numbers who  will report, whether it is a proportion or an absolute  figure, shows a lack of confidence? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> We should accept that the Minister  is genuine. We support him in saying, "Let's reduce the  numbers who are trying to cross the channel in lorries by  paying their way across."	 The cheapest rate across the  channel is on an ordinary ferry as a foot passenger, but  presumably the people who pay up to £2,000 to a lorry  driver will not get in that way. 
<P>
We agree with the Minister that those numbers should  be reduced. Let us accept, as he says, that 8,000 people a  year come over in that way; he knows that because they  report themselves. But let us also continue to try to get  the Minister to understand it may take several days or  even several stages of the Bill that the measures as  drafted may reduce the number of times that a lorry driver  or carrier says to the authorities, "Here is someone I did  not know was on my wagon and whom I did not want on  my wagon. I want to report him."	 If the Minister is not  interested in providing an incentive to decent truckers  who do decent things, he should at least say so openly.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> There is no point in going over this  ground further. It would, however, be much appreciated  if the Minister could give us more information about the  code of practice. Will he tell us when he is next meeting  the road haulage industry and whether he has a draft code  of practice? Can we have an idea of the subjects that will  be covered? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The code of practice is dealt  with in the next clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was about to come to that. I hope  that the Minister will tell us about the issues that I  mentioned when we reach the next clause. I put him on  notice that I am going to ask about them then and  particularly about the curtain-sided tilt trailer again. I will  leave it at that. I am, however, not satisfied that the  Minister has reached out far enough on this matter. He  has not answered the spirit of the amendment, and I will  press it to a vote.

</FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 464, in  page 13, line 33, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the responsible person has alleged that he is not liable for the  penalty and the Secretary of State has not considered the allegation'. <P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment  No. 465, in page 13, line 36, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but a person may still allege that he is not liable for a penalty when  the full amount has been paid'. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment involves a small  point, but one which may be important to some of those  who are made responsible for liability. It relates to the  point at which the payment of a penalty is made. As the  Bill stands, that is not entirely clear. 
<P>
Under subsection (3), a penalty that is imposed under  the provisions for carriers' liability must be paid before  the end of the prescribed period we have already had  some illuminations on the word "prescribed"	 and  everything that it implies. What happens when the person  who is made responsible for the liability wants to contest  it? As we have heard, such a person may avail himself of  the defence in clause 20. We need, however, to consider  the procedure in clause 21 to see where the amendment  fits into clause 18. 
<P>
What happens under the clause 21 procedure when  somebody wants to contest liability? After the Secretary  of State has served a penalty notice on the person whom  he believes is liable for penalties, that person may serve  a notice of objection. The Secretary of State then  considers the objection and decides whether the person is  liable for a penalty. The purpose of the amendment is to  explore where the prescribed period for payment fits into  that procedure.    
<P>
Clause 21(2)(c) tells us that the penalty notice that the  Secretary of State serves must specify the date before  which the penalty must be paid. It would be wrong for  that period to end and for the person to have to pay the  penalty while he was challenging the liability or still had  an opportunity to do so. Otherwise, in effect, he would be  paying before he had had the chance to contest the  liability. There would also be the possibility of a refund  being made. Will the Minister give an assurance that  payment will not be required when a person has alleged  that he was not liable? 
<P>
Subsection (4) will allow one of the responsible  persons to discharge the liability of the others.  Amendment No. 465 is intended to explore questions  concerning cases in which that happened and in which  one of the people on whose behalf responsibility was  discharged wished to contest liability. One might ask  why someone might want to contest liability when a  penalty had been paid for them, but such a situation  is possible. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> A driver might profess his innocence, but  his employer might pay the penalty to avoid his vehicle  being taken. That driver wishes to go to work for another  company. Having been fined once, the new company  might take a dim view of his employment record,  reducing the driver's employment status. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is an excellent example much  better than mine. To be brief, I shall adopt my hon.  Friend's example and ask the Minister what would happen  in such circumstances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> They say that if a monkey sits in front of a  word-processor long enough, it will eventually type the  words of William Shakespeare in the right order. No  doubt, if the Opposition table enough amendments, they  will eventually get one right. I am pleased to say that  amendment No. 464 is an example of them getting it right. 
{**fc
<p4**}Under clause 18(3), the civil penalty imposed must be  paid  <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"before the end of the prescribed period."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Amendment No. 464 seeks to qualify that, so that  payment would not be required if the person on whom the  penalty was imposed had given notice of an objection,  and the Secretary of State had not yet considered that  objection. The Government's intention is to operate the  civil penalty system in line with the spirit of the  amendment. I have no objection to the incorporation of  the amendment in the Bill to achieve that. The drafting of  amendment No. 464 is defective, but I am willing to  consider the matter further and to return to it on Report. 
<P>
Amendment No. 465 is rather peculiar. It would add an  odd qualification, so that a person could protest that a  civil penalty should not apply to him even when it has  already been discharged. It is inappropriate to use  legislation to enable a person to register a grievance after  the event. The procedure in clause 21 makes adequate  provision for people to register, through a notice of  objection, their disagreement with the imposition of a civil  penalty. Amendment No. 465 would make an unnecessary  and inappropriate addition to the legislation, and I urge  the Committee to reject it.

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I welcome the first part of the  Minister's response. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Not the bit about the monkey.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> The Committee will want to pass  over the Minister's unnecessary words, and he will not  wish to be reminded of them. His acceptance of  amendment No. 464 is welcome. His reaction to  amendment No. 465 could be improved. An unresolved  issue is whether a carrier should be able to get back  the penalty if the clandestine entrant's application to  live in this country by exceptional leave or as a refugee  is later agreed to. A carrier might have paid under  protest because it did not want its light aircraft, small  vessel or train impounded. 
<P>
The issue raised by amendment No. 465 remains with  the Government. Given that the Minister is accepting  amendment No. 464, it would be churlish to go on at  length about my desire for Ministers to continue thinking  about that issue. We have not heard from Ministers  whether they accept that carriers should not have to pay  £2,000 for the privilege of having brought to this country  a clandestine entrant if that person is given leave to  remain. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I agree entirely with my hon.  Friend's remarks. I am a little disappointed about  amendment No. 465, but it would be churlish of me  not to welcome the Minister's remarks about the lead  amendment. Having received his undertaking, I beg to  ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Government amendment No. 52. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to issues that will take  a little longer to deal with than those previously  considered and which were the subject of interest and  comment among those who gave evidence to the  Committee. 
<P>
The opposition amendments relate to the liability of the  owner of a vehicle or trailer that has been hired by another  person. Amendment No. 184 relates to the liability of the  owner under subsection (5) which deals with clandestine  entrants concealed in a vehicle, ship or aircraft.  Subsection (5)(b) ensures that the owner, hirer or driver  are all responsible people when such concealment occurs  in a vehicle other than a detached trailer. It ensures that  if a hirer brings in a clandestine entrant, the vehicle's  owner is also responsible. The Opposition may be wrong  on that, and I look to the Minister for confirmation. The  wording of the clause appears to suggest that the owner,  hirer and driver are each "a responsible person"	. 
<P>
The amendment is intended to prove the basis on  which the owner of a vehicle will be made liable when  he has hired it to someone else who has brought a  clandestine entrant into the country. In such  circumstances, the owner will become a responsible  person, liable under subsection (5)(b) to be charged a  penalty. An owner may hire out a vehicle for general  use, perhaps without a driver. It is up to the hirer to  use the vehicle as he wishes, subject to any conditions  of hire agreed between the parties. 
<P>
What degree of control does the owner have to ensure  that a clandestine entrant does not get on board the  vehicle? The Committee could take the line argued by the  Minister throughout the evening and look at the provision  in terms of determent. Of what value is it as a deterrent?  The owner has no control on clandestine entry and is not  the person who should be deterred. 
<P>
The haulage industry operates to generally high  standards. A statement of best practice in commercial  vehicle rental and operation is designed to ensure, among  other things, the safety of both parties to an agreement  and the safety of other road users. Subject to such an  agreement, a hired vehicle is under the control and  direction of the hirer. If I am right in my interpretation of  who can be a responsible person, and if each of the three  specified parties is responsible every time a clandestine  entrant is brought into the country, why will the owner be  made liable in the first place? 
<P>
<H5> 3 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.    
<P>
<H5> 3.20 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence, I advise  members of the Committee that, given the lateness of the  hour, it will not be possible for any amendments handed  to the Clerk from now until the end of the sitting to be  printed this morning. Any amendments tabled from now  on will therefore be published for the first time on  Thursday, when they will be starred. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We were discussing why any owner  should be one of those who is made liable when a  clandestine entrant comes into the country, especially  when the entrant is brought in by someone who has hired  the owner's vehicle. I have touched on the degree of  control that could be exercised by the owner. There is also  the issue of how the owner can defend himself once it is  alleged that he is the person responsible for the penalty,  given his lack of direct control over, or involvement in,  the events that have taken place. 
<P>
Let us use an example in which the hirer and driver are  one and the same person. Let us suppose that when the  Secretary of State issues his penalty notice under clause 21  because the hirer-driver has brought clandestine entrants in  to the country, the hirer-driver disappears from the scene  and cannot subsequently be traced. That is not  inconceivable. The owner of the vehicle is liable to receive  and, we think, pay a penalty notice as another responsible  person. In those circumstances, when he receives his  penalty notice from the Secretary of State, how can he  possibly avail himself of the defence afforded by clause 20  and satisfy each requirement of the defence? He may not  have been told by the hirer-driver that anything is amiss. He  may not know that clandestine entrants have been brought  into the country. Receiving the penalty notice after the  Secretary of State has decided that he is a responsible  person after tracing his ownership of the vehicle may be the  first thing that the owner knows about it. 
<P>
How can an owner in that position defend himself  under clause 20, which describes him as a carrier? The  terminology of the provision has changed, referring to the  carrier rather than the responsible person. In this case,  however, to call him a carrier is to describe him wrongly,  because he has not carried anything. He has hired his  vehicle to someone else who has carried clandestine  entrants. 
<P>
The burden of proof is on the owner, a point that we  shall come to later. Subsection (3)(c) requires him to  establish 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible  for operating that system did so properly."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
How can he establish that, when the person who hired the  vehicle from him and was driving it at the time has simply  disappeared from the scene? How on earth can the owner  mount a defence to absolve himself from liability? I ask  for the Minister's enlightenment. 
<P>
Can the Minister tell us a little about the apportionment  of liability when more than one person is held to be a  responsible person? Let us use a different example from  the last one, in which a single hirer-driver disappeared  from the scene. Let us say that a vehicle has a driver, a  hirer and an owner in relation to an incident of clandestine  entry which gives rise to liability. Let us suppose that  each of them is there at the time, each is served with a  notice by the Secretary of State, and each is a  responsible person. 
<P>
Under clause 21(1), the Secretary of State decides who  is liable to a penalty the owner, hirer and driver are all  eligible. How is the right hon. Gentleman to decide which  of the responsible persons will face a penalty? Will each  responsible person always face a penalty, or will the  Secretary of State pick and choose between responsible  persons when there is more than one? If the right hon.  Gentleman is to pick and choose in that way, on what  basis will he do so?    
<P>
Where does the owner, who is the subject of the  amendment, stand? Clause 18(4) provides that the  Secretary of State will accept payment in full from any of  the responsible persons. But how are responsible  persons persons allegedly responsible for the  clandestine entrants, and liable to a penalty expected to  apportion liability and payment among themselves in the  event that one of them is not prepared to pay everyone  else's penalty? That is not inconceivable. 
<P>
Finally, for the purposes of amendment No. 184, what  is a vehicle? We have heard a bit about this already, and  this part of the debate may have been anticipated, but this  is a troubling point, and we shall have to have a fuller  definition of a vehicle for these purposes. I am afraid that  some more comments may be made about the drafting of  the Bill, which I hope no one will take personally. It is  not meant in any way as a criticism; it is just an attempt  to understand what the provision means. 
{**fc
<p4**}We are talking about the liability of owners, but the  owners of what? What types of vehicle will give rise to  such liability? It would be easy to assume that we were  talking about liability for heavy lorries, because that is the  context in which the Bill is being debated. However, we  have already heard that the debate has widened, and a  reading of the Bill gives rise to questions which I hope  that the Minister can clarify, and which will be of interest  to vehicle owners who are the subject of the amendment.  They will want to know what sort of vehicles will give  rise to liability.  <P>
We need to consider who the owners in question might  be for the purposes of the amendment. Clause 18(5)(b)  refers to a vehicle, but not a detached trailer. What is a  vehicle? Clause 28, which is the interpretation provision,  says 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`vehicle' includes a trailer, semi-trailer, caravan or other thing  which is designed or adapted to be towed by another vehicle."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
So such things can be vehicles. It is interesting to note, as  we have already heard, that the definition includes  caravans. I am sure that that will be of interest to  caravaners. However, under the definition, vehicle  "includes"	 rather than "means"	 such methods of transport.  Elsewhere in the interpretation provision, the word  "means"	 is used as an inclusive definition of what may  come within that category. 
<P>
I have given examples of what could be vehicles and  could presumably include other things. We would like to  know more about this. Does "vehicle"	 include vans? Does  it include Salford van hire's range of vans, for example?  Will Salford van hire be liable if it hires out one of its  vans to someone who brings a clandestine entrant into the  country? I understand from Salford van hire that its range  starts with a 17-tonne truck and goes up to include the  models with which we are all familiar. Is there a point in  that range at which a model becomes a "vehicle"	 for the  purposes of the Bill, or are they all included?    
<P>
What does the word "vehicle"	 import in these  circumstances? Is it an expression from another statute?  Have we missed something in the legislation? Apparently  we did so in an earlier debate, and were taken to task for  not having read clause 135 carefully enough? Does the  Bill contain another interpretation that will give us a clue  as to what "vehicle"	 means? 
<P>
In amendment No. 184, the person who hires or owns  the trailer has no physical contact with it or direct control  over its utilisation. We need to consider that carefully. 
<P>
Amendment No. 185 relates to subsection (5)(c),  which deals with the owners of detached trailers,  whereas subsection (b) dealt with non-detached trailers.  Obviously, the same points including the owner's lack  of control arise in relation to this amendment and  amendment No. 184, and I do not want to go over  them again. I should, however, make an additional point  in the light of the evidence that we received earlier in  our proceedings about the way in which detached  trailers are transported. Once again, the hon. Member  for Harwich may correct me, and I apologise to him  because I am only a lay person; I am, however, taking  the evidence at face value. 
<P>
The way in which detached trailers are transported  means that their owners may have even less control and  be even more remote than was the case in the previous  example. I remind the Committee briefly of the joint  evidence of the Freight Transport Association and the  Road Haulage Association, which was that: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Similar problems exist with subsection (5)(c) which states that  in the case of a detached trailer, the owner or hirer of the trailer will  be considered to be a responsible person."	 [Official Report,  Special Standing Committee, Thursday 18 March 1999; c. 401.] 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It goes on to say that the nature of unaccompanied  freight trailers transported without a permanent driver  means that it is frequently transported from one place to  another without proper control. We need to know a little  more about that, and I look to the Minister for  enlightenment as to how the provisions will operate in  practice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I want to add to the comments made by  my hon. Friend the member for Hertsmere. Government  amendment No. 39 alters the wording of subsection (6)(a)  to "owner, hirer or operator"	. That wording is much better  because operator means more to the road haulage  industry. In that industry, hiring trailers for major  companies is a widespread practice and is subject to  agreement between the operator and the owner of a trailer.  The amendment makes life a little easier. 
<P>
Should not the wording of subsection (6)(b) also be  changed to "owner, hirer or operator"	 of a vehicle? Many  people in the road haulage industry lease and rent vehicles  just as they lease and rent trailers. It would be invidious  if a hire company's vehicle was impounded because the  person to whom it was hired did not pay a fine. That is a  key issue. 
<P>
A few years ago in Canada, it was decided to impound  the cars of people who were caught drink driving. Many  of those cars were then found to be company cars owned  by hire-purchase companies or leased. That causes all  sorts of technical problems. Focusing on the owner of a  vehicle can, in many respects, be more difficult than  focusing on the operator.    
<P>
The operator is the responsible person for trailers,  cabs and, indeed, other vehicles. My hon. Friend the  Member for Hertsmere mentioned vans. It is not unknown  these days for people to hire vans to go over the channel  to pick up and bring back booze. It is not inconceivable  that somebody might try to get in the back of such a van,  which could cause a major headache for the hire company  that had hired it to somebody who just wanted to cross  the channel and load up with something for Christmas. 
<P>
Focusing on the owner is a problem. It is not unusual  in the road haulage industry, in particular, for vehicles to  be owned by somebody else. There are many company  cars and hire vans. If we are to focus on those who are  responsible, it must be those who drive, operate and  control vehicles, not those who simply own the asset and  who might find that it is impounded and that they have to  make various representations. I note that the Bill contains  a procedure for getting something released. No doubt hire  purchase companies will be keen to have trailers, cabs,  vans or cars released if indeed money was outstanding in  that respect. Thus there are difficulties here. I shall be  interested to hear the Minister's reply. The Government  are considering the matter constructively they would not  otherwise have tabled an amendment to alter the wording. 
<P>
The other point that my hon. Friend the Member for  Hertesmere made concerned the division of responsibility  between the respective owners, operators and drivers.  That is a key issue. We heard earlier that £2,000 per  clandestine immigrant would be levied. It is possible for  that liability to be discharged by one of those who have  been served with the notice, whether they be an owner,  an operator or a driver. 
<P>
I am interested in how the scheme will operate and how  responsibility will be divided. Is it a case of either/or, so  that just one party takes responsibility, or is it conceivable  that almost everyone involved with a relevant vehicle,  whether the hirer, the operator or the driver, would have  to pay a fine or protest their innocence? That is a crucial  point. Much of the legislation is framed so that the driver  of the vehicle would have to make a defence. If he made  a successful defence, the individual owner of the vehicle  would, by that defence, not be liable. But if the individual  driver, whether innocent or not, did not make a defence,  the owner might suddenly find himself liable for someone  else's actions, of which he was not in control and for  which he had no responsibility.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is clear that on some occasions it will  be appropriate for the owner of the vehicle to face the  penalty, whereas on others, in all fairness the driver  should be penalised, or the hirer, or the operator. Where  the Government have got it slightly wrong is in trying to  provide a catch-all. They seem to be saying, "On every  occasion we will get one of them, whoever it may be. If  it is not legitimate to get the hirer or we cannot get the  driver, we will get the owner. Someone is going to pay."	 
<P>
In general, I have no qualms about draconian  legislation, which always hangs someone out to dry  hanging concentrates the mind wonderfully. However, the  Government may be going a bit far on this occasion and  the provision may not be effective. Unfairness could come  about because the road transport industry operates in  many complex ways. I suspect that the Government need  to pay more attention and get a teach-in on how the  system operates from the RHA, the FTA and some of the  other lorry companies and hirers. 
<P>
I get the impression that the Government think that  there are people who own lorries and people who hire  them, and that it is simple and clear cut. It is not like that.  Many haulage companies operating between Scotland and  England are based in my constituency; the location  attracts them. No two companies operate in the same way.  Many are in the business of driving with a trailer, which  they may own, taking it to the docks at Dover or  Folkestone, either driving it on to a ferry and detaching it  or detaching it at a trailer park which may or may not  be as secure and then picking up another trailer to come  back. That may be their trailer or someone else's. It may  be a return load belonging to a clearing house that  specialises in ensuring that lorries do not run empty but  have a load to carry back. 
<P>
In most circumstances, that return load may be  contained in a trailer owned by another operator and hired  by someone else. The hirer may not be a person of means,  which may be a perfect excuse people bringing in  entrants would want to have as complex a trail as possible,  and might hire a trailer from a legitimate company instead  of using their own lorries. If such a hirer has disappeared  from sight or has not paid, it would be quite unfair to  penalise the owner of the trailer or of the vehicle. There  are the big Eddie Stobarts of this world, but I suspect that most constituencies contain more individual  owner-drivers who do not have a large fleet of trailers and  who are not the Salford van hires of this world. Such  people often have only one or two trailers, one of which  is on the way out to Europe and one of which is on the  way back. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Is my right hon. Friend suggesting  that the Bill could produce a gross inequity? Two sets of  circumstances may arise, similar except in one respect. A  guilty driver can be called to account and fined, and the  owner will therefore not be fined. In almost identical  circumstances, however, the guilty driver could disappear  and the Secretary of State could exercise his right to fine  the owner. The degree of guilt or rather of innocence  of the two owners would be exactly the same, but one  owner would be fined and one would not, solely on the  arbitrary basis of whether the driver could be found.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That appears to be the case, and it is  unfair. Constituents have complained to me about similar  injustices in relation to the Child Support Agency. The  chap who filled in his forms is paying £150 a week  maintenance, whereas the fellow who tore up the forms  has not been touched for anything. That involves a degree  of unfairness, and we are discussing a similar approach.  When the driver pays the penalty, the owner of the vehicle  is not liable. When the driver does not pay, however, the  Government have a catch-all measure for the owner. 
<P>
I am happy for provisions to be built into the law on  whether it is appropriate for the owner or hirer to pay, or  for a combination of the owner, hirer and operator to do  so. It is, however, patently unfair to make owners pay  simply because they are the only people whom the  Government can fine, and because other, guilty parties  have evaded the consequences of their criminality. People  who are guilty should be penalised I have no qualms  about that. It is, however, unfair to make the owner pay  in all circumstances because he is the person of means  and of last resort. 
<P>
When we hire a car from Hertz, Avis or smaller  companies, we sign forms ensuring that we, rather than  the car rental company, pay for our parking tickets. My  wife refuses to sign such forms when I ask her to do so  on my behalf. If it is legitimate to ensure that a rental  company does not pay for the criminality that we may  cause when we hire a car, surely the provisions should  contain exemptions for owners. 
<P>
Finally, I should like to query interpretations of the  terms "vehicle"	 and "detached trailer"	. The point is  relevant to the amendment, although clause 28 specifies  the interpretations. It states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`vehicle' includes a trailer, semi-trailer, caravan or other thing  which is designed or adapted to be towed by another vehicle."	 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I am 25 years out of remembering my legal interpretation.  The clause states clearly, however, that the term "vehicle"	  includes trailers. Will the Minister confirm that that  wording does not limit the term merely to trailers,  semi-trailers, caravans or other towed things, and that it  could apply to any motorised vehicle, from a small car or  van to a big tractor or Volvo cab lorry? The definition is  not limited or made sui generis by the fact that it includes  those things. If that is the case, why is "vehicle"	 not  specifically defined as an independent motorised vehicle?  The current definition applies to detached trailers. As a  layman, I think that the definition of "vehicle"	 is the same  as that of "detached trailer"	. The definition of "vehicle"	  in clause 28 seems to be limited to trailers and  non-motorised vehicles. Explanation is required. The  Minister should put on the record that the term "vehicle"	  applies to everything from a little Renault van to a big  tractor unit and other such motor vehicles.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon: Amendments Nos. 184 to 187 would make  identical changes to the provisions of clause 18</B>(5) and (6)  which define who is a responsible person in respect of a  clandestine entrant. Amendment No. 184 would alter the  responsibility of the owner of a vehicle as set out in  subsection (5)(b). Amendment No. 185 would alter that of  the owner of a detached trailer as set out in subsection 5(c).  Amendment No. 186 relates to the responsibilities of an  owner of a detached trailer as set out in subsection 6(a), and  amendment No. 187 to those of an owner of a vehicle as set  out in subsection 6(b). The net effect of the amendments  would be to make owners not responsible if they have hired  out a vehicle or trailer.    
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere has explained the  concern that lies behind the amendments. The owner of a  vehicle or trailer transfers direct control while a vehicle  or trailer is on hire, and so should not be responsible if a  clandestine entrant is discovered in the vehicle or trailer.  The Government believe that it is right to impose some  responsibility on the owners of vehicles that are hired out.  It is important that owners ensure that vehicles and trailers  can be secured. 
<P>
It is also important that owners have an incentive not  only to take care to whom they hire their vehicles or  trailers, but to spell out, perhaps in a contract, the need to  prevent the carriage of clandestine entrants. The people  who hire vehicles or trailers will then play their part in  the enhancement of security that the civil penalty seeks  to encourage. 
<P>
For those reasons, we have not qualified the definition  of owner in subsections (5) and (6), as the amendments  would. If I was in any doubt about that decision, the  explanation of the rich, diverse and complex arrangements  of the haulage industry given by the right hon. Member  for Penrith and the Border has confirmed me in my view. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a habit of coming  back on discussions, and I ask him to let me finish my  explanation before I let him do that. 
<P>
It will be for those who hire out vehicles or trailers to  include in the terms and conditions of hire a transfer of  responsibility for any civil penalty incurred. That would  be a private matter at the discretion of the owners of  vehicles. It would not affect any liability of the owner to  pay the civil penalty to the Secretary of State. 
<P>
The circumstances in which clandestine entrants reach  the United Kingdom, whether by vehicle, ship or aircraft,  involve several parties, each with a different role to play  in the prevention of the carriage of such people. The  Government believe that it is right that the owners of hire  vehicles should not be excluded from responsibility. I therefore urge the Committee not to accept the  amendments. 
<P>
Government amendments No. 38 and 39 will tighten  up the coverage of the civil penalty concerning detached  trailers, often known as drop trailers. Those trailers, with  goods on, are towed on to a ferry at a continental port and  towed off on arrival at a United Kingdom port. The trailer  is then picked up by a lorry unit and driven to its  destination. Detached trailers are targeted by clandestine  entrants, and are therefore included within the scope of  the civil penalty. At present, however, the definition of  the responsible person in respect of detached trailers is  limited to the owner or hirer. 
<P>
The drop trailer trade is categorised by agents who  organise the dropping of the trailer at a lorry park on one  side of the Channel, its loading on board the ferry by tug,  its unloading on the other side by another tug, and its  parking to await collection. The agents may neither own  the trailers, nor hire them. They may use trailers made  available to them by owners or hirers, taking a cut of the  proceeds. We wish to include as responsible persons those  organisers of the loading and carriage of drop trailers.  They will be encompassed by the term "operator"	. 
<P>
Government amendment No. 38 will add an operator  as a responsible person to subsection (5)(c) in relation  to concealed clandestine entrants to the United Kingdom.  Government amendment No. 39 does the same in respect  of subsection (6)(a) in relation to the other two categories  of clandestines in subsection (1). Together they ensure  coverage of all the situations in which a detached trailer  may be involved in a civil penalty. 
<P>
Government amendment No. 52 clarifies the term  "hirer"	, using subsections (5) and (6), and inserting into  clause 28 a definition of the word which makes it clear  that the hirer of a vehicle means a person who has hired  the vehicle from another person, including a person who  has hired it from a person who is not its owner.  Opposition Members successfully reached an explanation  of what is meant by vehicle, but for the avoidance of  doubt, the purpose of the definition in clause 28 is to  extend the definition from its commonsense meaning to  include items such as trailers, which might not otherwise  be considered as vehicles. 
<P>
In terms of financial responsibility, each of those  responsible will in each case be liable. While only one  may be responsible initially, all responsible persons are  legally liable under the proposals. Liability is joint and  several. It will be up to them to decide who should pay  and how they should divide the liability between them. In  practice, it is likely that the authorities will pursue those  most closely involved in the carriage of the clandestine,  but obviously they can seek contributions from others  who might also be legally responsible.    
<P>
I invite the Committee to accept the Government  amendments, which provide an important strengthening of  the civil penalty provisions, and to reject the other  amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I have two questions for the  Minister. First, which part of the clause, as amended,  limits the Government to saying that either the owner or  the hirer has to pay? Joint and severally may be an  expression that is well known to lawyers, but I am not a  lawyer. Is it conceivable that a power in the Bill may  require £2,000 to come from an owner and £2,000 to  come from a hirer? 
<P>
Secondly, does the expression "hirer"	 include a lessor  as well? There is a range of ways of funding equipment,  including hiring, hire purchase and leasing. Had the  Minister ensured that, one way or another, anyone who  legally has ownership whether by hire purchase, leasing  or hiring for a shorter period than the whole life of the  equipment is caught by the definitions? In asking only  those questions, I am not saying that I am satisfied with  the Minister's responses to the other points raised by my  hon. Friends. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Will the Minister clarify a point in his  explanation of the Government's amendments? He  appeared to be saying that in the case of detached trailers,  the operator who carries the detached trailer to the  appropriate point possibly a ferry or the shuttle will be  made liable. We have heard about points of immigration  control that now exists abroad, specifically in France,  where there is a point of immigration control that falls  within the scope of the Bill. A UK operator responsible  for shifting detached trailers through the immigration  control will presumably be liable under the Bill. 
<P>
Will there now be a discrepancy whereby a  foreign-owned operator French, for example  performing the same task will not have the same liability?  In that case, the only person who could be held liable  would be the owner or hirer of the detached trailer, and  the operator would be in a different situation from that of  a UK operator, over whom the Bill would hold sway. I assume that the Bill will not hold sway over a foreign  firm performing exactly the same task. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I shall follow on from the points made by  the hon. Member for Hallam. The Minister mentioned the  term "operator"	. In the road haulage industry, one needs  an operator's licence to run vehicles domestically, for  which one has to meet certain criteria, and another to run  vehicles internationally, under which one applies to run a  certain number of vehicles. It is conceivable that one  could be an operator, for which one would need  qualifications in the road haulage industry to operate  vehicles, while not necessarily owning those vehicles  perhaps, in effect, operating subcontracted vehicles on  one's licence.    
<P>
The Minister said that the penalty would apply purely  to trailers that are towed on and off ferries. That is a rather  narrower interpretation than is possible. Operators in the  road haulage industry hold an operator's licence and  operate vehicles internationally, and the provision could  apply simply to the responsible manager who was in  charge of vehicles, trailers and operations from this  country to Calais or anywhere abroad. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> The owner will have to be  responsible for pursuing the driver if the driver has been  responsible for wrong-doing of which the owner knew  nothing. Will not one effect of that be that no owner will  be able to hire out a vehicle to a driver from another  country, perhaps in the European Union, because of the  prohibitive nature of any legal proceedings that he might  have to undertake in trying to pursue someone in the  courts of another country? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall give way to the Minister if he  chooses to respond to that point. What the Minister has  said will be a disappointment to people in the road  haulage industry who are interested in the matter, because  we received a weight of evidence from the road haulage  industry that it was especially interested in this matter. It  dealt with this point more than any other in its submission  to us on the clause. That bears emphasising, in view of  the importance that our witnesses attached to the matter.  In its written evidence, the road haulage industry said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Unless the owner/hirer is also the driver at the time the  clandestines are discovered, we believe it would be unreasonable to  apply the penalty to them. Even if the driver is involved in some  way, the owner (unless he is also the driver) will be an innocent  third party."	 [Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 18 March 1999; c. 401.] 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It says that similar problems exist in relation to the other  limb, subsection (5)(c), in the case of the detached trailer: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The nature of the unaccompanied freight ... means that  frequently, the person hiring or owning the trailer has no physical  contact with the trailer nor direct control over its utilisation. Thus  we believe it would be unreasonable to impose a fine in such  circumstances."	 [Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 18  March 1999; c. 401.] <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps later the Minister would like to read the  evidence that I have already quoted from Steven Norris  about the case of 100 people being detected in a trailer.  Someone suggested that it was preposterous to say that it  was possible to fit 100 people in a trailer, but it turns out  that that was indeed the case.

<B>Mr. Norris:</B> said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that was exactly the point: they were in an unaccompanied trailer,  which would have been delivered to the dock by one driver, taken  by a tug driver from the dock to the boat, taken by another tug driver  from the boat to the dock on the disembarkation site and would then  have been collected by a subsequent driver who would take it on to  its destination."	 [Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 18 March 1999; c. 413.] <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that chain of events of different people having  control of the vehicle and the owner being a long way  away, what control could the owner be said to have  exercised? I heard the Minister's answer that the  Government want to extend liability as widely as possible  to make everyone aware of their responsibilities.  However, if the owner must face up to his responsibility  in the matter and has no direct control over it, will that not  absolve someone else possibly the driver of a share of  the responsibility, and possibly of all responsibility, when  we should be trying to ensure that the latter takes  precautions in such cases? 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I do not want to make a cheap point, but  surely a parallel exists between such proposals and a law  that might be proposed that someone who hires out  oxyacetylene gear must be held responsible if the person  to whom he hires that gear chooses to use it for  safe-breaking?    
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an entirely fair  point. What control can the owner have over the servant  of a hirer, for example? He cannot give him directions as  to how to behave during his employment, as he has no  control over him. 
<P>
The Government enunciated the principle of seeking to  deter people from bringing clandestine entrants into the  country by introducing a punitive deterrent to make those  responsible take proper precautions, but the Minister is  going against that principle. We are going away from that  and spraying responsibility all over the place. I cannot see  the point of what the Minister seeks to do. I am sure that  the Government cannot need the money. I thought that the  idea was that they wanted to make people behave more  responsibly, but this provision seems to go against that. 
<P>
<H5> 4 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I return to my original point about defences available  to the owner. Is the Minister not saying to the  Committee and to lorry owners that there will be many  circumstances in which it will be impossible for owners  to have a defence? Where the hirer or driver drops out  of the picture, the owner will be unable, in many cases,  to mount a defence because he will be unable to satisfy  clause 20(3)(c) the defences clause and prove that  the person in charge of the lorry operated the system  properly on the occasion in question. In effect, the  Minister is putting strict liability on owners as there is  no way that they can avail themselves of such a  defence. As we will discuss in a moment, the burden  to show everything is on owners, which is extremely  draconian. From what the Minister said, it would seem  to serve no purpose in calling those in control to  account. 
<P>
I asked the Minister specifically whether we could look  at the word "vehicle"	 as referred to in another statute. He  did not reply directly, and said that we should rely on our  commonsense interpretation. I hoped that matters would  not come to that, as my common sense is not great when  it comes to vehicles, but I did the best that I could and  looked at the statute in the way that those who interpret  it will have to. They will turn to the dictionary to find the  word's meaning, so that is what I did to try to find out  who the owners of vehicles referred to in the amendment  would be. The dictionary that I consulted describes a  vehicle as: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a means of conveyance or transmission: a medium: a substance  with which a medicine, a pigment, etc., is mixed for administration  or application: a structure in or on which persons or things are  transported, esp. by land"	. 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is a wide definition. Any clandestine entrant  concealed in the back of such a conveyance will be liable.  I appreciate the point that the Government are trying to  make, but I am surprised that they have not given wider  currency to the matter because, in all the discussions and  debates, it has been introduced as a liability for the road  haulage industry. If people may be liable for penalties,  such as one of £2,000, the Government owe it to all others  who might be affected by the meaning of "vehicle"	 to  make it clear that its application is much wider than solely  to that industry. Perhaps we could not get 200 people in  the back of something from Salford Van Hire, but it is  perfectly conceivable that we could get one or two  through without their being detected. I think that the  Government ought to make the provision more widely  known to the vehicle-using public than is presently the  case.    
<P>
I am disappointed and not convinced by the Minister's  response because it does not serve the purposes that the  Government want to serve. There are also elements of  potential unfairness that have not been addressed by the  Minister at all. Therefore, I shall press the amendment to  a vote. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I was awaiting the conclusion of the hon.  Member's remarks so that I could answer his relevant  points about the amendments comprehensively. 
<P>
On joint and several liability, it is built into the  structure of part II that any of several people may be  responsible for a specific clandestine entrant. Essentially,  the penalty paid cannot be recovered from more than one  person in relation to a single incident. As we have recently  debated, once a penalty is paid by one person responsible,  all others are thereby discharged. I am sure that the  definition of "owner"	 is wide enough to deal with the  various examples that have been given. With regard to  the definition of "operator"	, the hon. Member for Hallam  explained the effect of the Government's amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> No, I am dealing with these points at the  moment. The nationality of an operator is not strictly  relevant, but the extent to which an operator is within the  jurisdiction is relevant. That is a much more important  distinction to draw than their place of business or origin.  The hon. Member for Hertsmere made heavy weather of  the definition of an ordinary, everyday word. Judges will  be perfectly capable of interpreting the word "vehicle"	. If  the hon. Gentleman has any doubt, I am sure that his right  hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and the Border, with  his wide experience of teaching road traffic law, will  enlighten him as to what the word "vehicle"	 means. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> On the Minister's point about jurisdiction,  I have a query about the prescribed zones of immigration  control that are external to the United Kingdom. We have  an example at present in respect of the shuttle, but the  Minister implied earlier that a ferry port would be a  possible place. It is precisely such an issue that I hope  will be examined. A French operator working within the  French jurisdiction is likely to be responsible for the  loading of detached trailers into a prescribed zone of  immigration control. A discrepancy could arise within the  framework, whereby we are unable to catch operators. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Maclean:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister  would confirm that point. He was right to pick us up on  our sloppy language when we talked about foreign-based  operators loading lorries. It was not an attempt to be  derogatory about French operators. It is right to say that  their foreignness is not relevant it is whether they are  within the jurisdiction. My hon. Friend the Member for  Hertsmere tried to use the correct terminology. 
<P>
Let us assume that an operator across the channel, who  is not within our jurisdiction, loads detached trailers on to  the ferry boats from a vehicle park in Calais, and then  drivers, within our jurisdiction, go to Dover to pick them  up. In those circumstances, is the operator in the other  jurisdiction liable? I suspect not. What possible controls  could our owners and hirers, or people within the British  jurisdiction, have over a French operator in another  jurisdiction? How could fees be recovered? The  Minister's proposal will not permit action or penalties  against an operator who is based in Calais and in another  jurisdiction. In those circumstances, no matter how sloppy  or careless that operator may be, the penalties will fall on  the owner, hirer or driver anyone who comes within the  British jurisdiction if it is not possible to get someone  in another jurisdiction.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall try to deal with that point, although  we are straying into abstruse areas of international law.  Clearly, if someone is within British jurisdiction, he can  be made subject to the British courts. If someone is not  within the jurisdiction, it will depend on whether it is  possible, under the ordinary principles of international  law, for the country in question to enforce a civil penalty  against its own citizens. If a citizen of France is never  within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, he would  not be subject to the jurisdiction of the UK courts, save  for international agreements, whereby countries that are  party to international agreements allow the reciprocal  enforcement of judgments, arising from civil claims  within their own courts. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> How do we deal with the agent  in the drop load example? Let us suppose that a Belgian  agent allows people to get on to a trailer and arranges for  a tug to put the vehicle on a ferry. When the clandestine  entrant is discovered on arrival in Britain, we assume that  the tug owner who brought the vehicle off the ferry is not  liable. Let us presume that the ferry operators are not  liable because the trailer was locked when it arrived on  the ferry and was still locked when it left. Does the  Minister expect to be able to enforce liability on the  hypothetical Belgian agent, or will he look to Sea  Containers, for example, who may have leased the vehicle  five years previously to someone else?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is simply restating the  question that I have just answered. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> With respect, the Minister has not  answered it. He has given us an exposition of international  law, which is no doubt correct, but we want to know what  the Government will do when trying to enforce the Bill  against lorry firms drivers, owners and operators  within British jurisdiction? What will happen when a  driver or owner from my constituency drives to Dover  docks to pick up a trailer that has been loaded by an agent  or an operator in France, contained in a vehicle park in  Calais, loaded on to a ship and offloaded for 15 minutes  by a tug company in Dover? If clandestines were found,  would the Minister be perfectly happy for the British  owner of the trailer that has been going round France for  the previous six months to be found liable, although the  clandestines were inserted into the vehicle by an operator  based in Calais, outside British jurisdiction, whom the  Government cannot reach? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> With great respect, the right hon.  Gentleman reformulates the question that I have already  dealt with. Where there is the possibility of reciprocal  enforcement of civil penalties in other jurisdictions  through international agreements, it will be open to the  Government to pursue the Belgian operator, as in the  circumstances described by the hon. Member for  Worthing, West. 
<P>
What is important is that if the penalty may not be paid  by a party outside the jurisdiction, it will be possible to  detain the drop trailer as security. I expect that that will  concentrate the minds of all those involved to ensure that  appropriate penalties are paid. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> That will surely put the burden on  the innocent owner to get recompense by suing in foreign  courts. That negative sort of answer appears to apply to  the problem that I put to the Minister earlier although  he has not specifically addressed it which would face an  owner who hired out a vehicle to a foreign driver who  was responsible for inserting clandestines into the vehicle  and promptly scarpered back to his own country. The  innocent owner would have to try to pursue recovery of  the fine levied most unfairly on him in foreign courts  against a foreign national. The effect of that will be that  all owners will have to decide never to hire out their  vehicles to foreign nationals. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Under the Bill, if the fine is paid, that  discharges liability for all those who have in effect had  permit against them. A Belgian or French operator might  well be responsible, but the British owner may in  desperation pay the fine because he wants to release his  vehicle. Is not there a lack of natural justice there?    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I made it clear at the outset that it will  be for the owner to take care about to whom he hires  the vehicle. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That does not take account of the  realities of cross-channel trade. The owner may take great  care about to whom he hires the vehicle the parties may  all be part of one international group. But in many cases  in fact, in the majority of cross-channel drop loads the  owner will not have control over the agents at ports in  Calais and other places who hold the vehicles in trailer  parks for a few hours or overnight and then put them on  to a ship. Those are the operators whom the Minister  wants to get. He has amended the Bill, to catch operators  who are running such systems, but it will catch only those  within our jurisdiction. It will not catch operators outside  our jurisdiction who run lorry parks and load the  containers on to ships, yet they are the ones over whom  the owner or hirer of the vehicle has little control. If an  owner wants to get his trailers across the channel, he must  use some of those lorry parks, loaders and operators  whether he likes it or not; he has little choice. 
<P>
The Minister is no doubt right that it could be open to  the British Government to seek to enforce civil penalties  in France, but it ain't going to happen. Why should any  Government bother trying to do that when they can  clobber the owner, the hirer or the driver who goes to  Dover to pick up the load that has been put on to the ferry  and finds clandestine entrants? He will be forced to pay;  if he does not, his vehicle will be impounded. But he had  no control whatever over how it was loaded in France  I am not slagging off France or in a port outside our  jurisdiction. 
<P>
<H5> 4.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Although the Minister is making a virtue out of  amending the Bill so that it will catch operators, it will  not catch the operators involved in the vast bulk of our  cross-channel trade who may be negligent, sloppy or  guilty of inserting clandestine entrants on to vehicles. It  will merely catch more innocent drivers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The Home Office Minister said that  operators might well factor into their contracts an element  of risk for fines levied for clandestine refugees being  found in their vehicles. Given that some people are out of  our jurisdiction, is not it conceivable that British operators  would try to factor in those additional costs but foreign  operators would not, because they are outside our  jurisdiction? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend is right; that is  self-evident. But the point that I was trying to make and  which I want the Minister to admit to concerns the way  in which the trade operates. This is not a criticism of the  trade, and it would be unfair for the Government to tell it  to change its operation and smarten up its act; the business  of moving containers is highly efficient. But when those  containers are moved, they are not under the control of  the owner or the hirer all the time.    
<P>
There are several agents people who specialise in  putting containers on to ships or taking them off ships,  and others who specialise in holding them in parks  overnight. All such parties in this country are rightly  caught by the provisions and they should be just as  careful. If the Government are going to insist that owners,  drivers and hirers are careful, those operators too should  be careful about how they run their operations so that  clandestine entrants cannot get on board. 
<P>
I suggest to the Minister that it is patently unfair to  penalise owners or hirers who pick up vehicles coming  off ferries in this country when they have not had direct  control over the loading of them the night before or a few  hours before, in France or elsewhere. It is not good  enough for the Government to say that they should be  more careful about whom they hire their vehicles out to;  they can be infinitely careful about that, but they have  little control over their loading in other ports. That is a  fundamental unfairness that the Minister does not want  to acknowledge. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a good debate that raised  some important issues. Although the Minister has given  his response, I hope that he will think about some of the  points that my hon. Friends have made. Some questions  have yet to be answered. 
<P>
I may have got this wrong, but I am sure that I obtained  an answer to my earlier question about what will happen  when more than one person can be made liable and when an  owner, hirer and driver are all available. Will the Secretary  of State proceed against each one? If not, how will he pick  and choose? The Minister said that one person could  discharge the liability for them all; I understand that. But  which one is the Secretary of State going to proceed against  in the first instance? How will he make such a decision?  Will he always go against each one or will he vary his  decisions? 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Is not the answer to that question  self-evident? In every case, the owner will face the  possible confiscation of his vehicle. If the driver or  anyone else who is liable in addition to the owner decides  to hold out and not to pay the penalty, the owner will  almost certainly have to volunteer to pay it. That will be  the case even if he is the least guilty or, indeed, totally  innocent because he will be desperate to get his vehicle  back. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a valuable point, which  develops mine. Unless we hear otherwise from the  Minister, it looks likely that the Government intend to go  against each of those involved, but particularly against the  owner; he will be in the firing line because he is the  easiest to get at. The vehicle's registration documents and  details will be traced back to the owner. He will be the  most traceable and easiest person on whom to serve the  notice. It will be less easy in many cases to serve a notice  on someone else as a responsible person particularly, as  we have heard, in the case of a foreign driver. 
<P>
Our points are supported in full by the evidence that  we took in Committee. The road haulage industry is  crying out the message that the owner has, in many cases,  the least responsibility and no direct control. We hope that  owners will aim for best practice and enter into  agreements that promote it. In the real world, however,  the owner will have the least control. Yet, he will be the  one who is most likely to be fixed with the responsibility.  That runs counter to the Government's proposals. 
<P>
Unless the Minister tells us on what basis the Secretary  of State will proceed and against which person he will  take out penalty proceedings and serve a penalty notice  under clause 21, we must assume that the owner will be  in the firing line.    
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was not  paying attention when I answered, but I dealt with that  point. I made it quite clear that the Government would  proceed against the person, in the first place, who was  most responsible for the carriage of the clandestine. I said  that once and I have said it again. 
<P>
<B> Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that there is some clarification  in that. It would be interesting to know how the  Government will form a view as to who the most  responsible person is. 
<P>
The Minister made a fair point. I hope that he accepts  that the purpose of our proceedings is to probe. It is  slightly more difficult at this hour but I am trying to  follow attentively and I am enjoying his responses. I shall  do my best to listen more carefully in future; I have been  given something of an exhortation to do so. I am still  not satisfied, however, and I will press the amendment to  a vote.
