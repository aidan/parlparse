<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000514"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b> There are
clearly one or two Committee members who had an overexcited lunch,
while others are still finishing
off.</div><a name="09031951000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was giving some general comments on the debate that we have had. I
shall resist the temptation to respond to all the points, because I
fear that that would take a disproportionate amount of Committee time.
I shall seek to address the amendments that we are debating in this
section.</div><a name="09031951000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a few things to say on the stand part element of the debate. The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, as I predicted, wants
to quote from the my letter from Mike Butler, and I would not want to
disappoint him in his prediction by not quoting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>back to him the letter that I received previously from Ros McMullen,
when she was the chair of the Independent Academies
Association:</div><a name="09031951000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
IAA welcome the plans to establish the YPLA and its proposed role in
the administration and support of open academies. It has been clear
that the growth of this transformational and successful programme
requires an agency to deal with the increasing administration. We are
especially pleased that this proposition will allow Academies to
continue to receive all their funding directly from a single, national
agency&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09031951000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
opposed to local authorities, as the hon. Member for Yeovil would
like.</div><a name="09031951000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have been discussing these issues with ministers for some time, and
fully support these
proposals.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
refute the suggestion of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton that there is little or no support for this move within
the academies movement. Indeed, it is worth reiterating what Daniel
Moynihan said in the evidence sessions, in response to the hon. Member
for
Basingstoke:</div><a name="09031951000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
makes sense for the Department to have an agency to take care of
academies. Clearly the Department was never meant to be a local
authority, so we are perfectly happy with that and we think it will
work
well.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Basingstoke then
asked:</div><a name="09031951000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Are
you happy that academies will be administered by the YPLA at a regional
level?&#148;</div><a name="09031951000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elizabeth
Reid, from the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, said in
response:</div><a name="09031951000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">It
makes absolute sense and, as the academies programme continues to grow,
it would be anomalous and unusual for a Department of State to take
direct responsibility for a very large number of schools when there are
other models, both past and present, available to look at. The
Specialist Schools and Academies Trust views that as a sensible
provision.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

</i>3 March 2009; c. 43-44, Q107 and
109.]</div><a name="09031951000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are many other quotes that I could use, but I shall not detain the
Committee.</div><a name="09031951000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031951000515"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): The Minister quoted Liz Reid,
but perhaps he could also refer to her evidence on question 125. She
was asked about the alternative of having academies under the strategic
accountability of local government. All she said in answer to that
was:</div><a name="09031951000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are others you would have to ask. It would depend on the nature of the
legislation that could be crafted and considered by the
House.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
I take it from that, that the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust
envisages that it would be possible to craft legislation that would
deal properly with those
concerns?</div><a name="09031951000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000516"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I could not speak for the SSAT, but it is worth
looking further on in column 48, at what happened immediately after
that answer from Elizabeth Reid. The hon. Member for Yeovil
asked:</div><a name="09031951000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
are being very diplomatic. Perhaps it is time for me to bring on Dan.
Is that
okay?&#148;</div><a name="09031951000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Daniel
Moynihan then
said:</div><a name="09031951000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am sorry. I am not a politician and I am not good at being diplomatic.
My answer would be that local authorities have  called in
academy sponsors&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 48, Q125.],</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div><a name="09031951000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">going on to say what I
quoted this morning. He clearly put the view that he thought that
academies would not support the move talked
about.</div><a name="09031951000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000517"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am still unclear whether the reason that the
Government have not been willing to put academies under LA oversight is
that they believe that they are not capable of performance managing
academies or that they fear local government would seek to suck the
autonomy of academies away. Which of the two is
it?</div><a name="09031951000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000518"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Both could be true. Liz was right that it depends
on the precise proposition, but my strongly held view is that we should
not disrupt the current academies model. Suffice to say that some of
the functions performed by the Department should be carried out on an
agency basis, by an arm&#146;s length body and in accordance with the
Education and Inspections Act 2006, the intention of which was to
distance the delivery from the commissioning of services, which is what
we seek to do with this
legislation.</div><a name="09031951000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to deal with the point about the role of Ofsted and the YPLA
performance management proposals. When the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton thinks about it, he will accept the importance of the
softer, earlier intelligence that comes from a regional capacity, which
will allow us to intervene earlier before problems become significant.
I do not want to dwell overly on the significant problems that arose
early this year at the Richard Rose academy in Cumbria. I pay tribute
to the leadership of Mike Gibbons, who has taken over as chief
executive of the two academies, and to the sponsors, who helped to
resolve the issues. However, that situation had been allowed to get out
of control, before we made the necessary interventions. It was thanks
only to the procedures that we introduced&#151;allowing parents to
complain directly to Ofsted&#151;that Ofsted could properly identify
the problems at the school  in Carlisle.</div>
<a name="09031951000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want the
YPLA to provide the Department with intelligence about problems and be
able to act much earlier itself. The hon. Gentleman has allowed
ideology to take over his undoubted common sense. Once he allows his
common sense to be heard, he will agree that the arrangement is
sensible, and, of course, it will not get in the way of the current
arrangements, under which, one year after the opening of an academy,
Ofsted will carry out a monitoring visit, and three years later a full
section 5 inspection. We are not introducing a second form of
inspection&#151;it is simply a relationship on the ground to provide
proper support before problems become serious. We will work with
academy sponsors and leaders to ensure that every single academy is a
success.</div>
<a name="09031951000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
24, it will help to explain the effect of clause 74, which gives the
Secretary of State the power to require the YPLA to act as his agent
and to carry out academies&#146; functions. It is important to
understand that we are talking about an agency role and that, in that
regard, we are preserving academies&#146; autonomy. We are not moving
powers away from the Secretary of State, but stating that certain
functions can be carried out on an agency basis. As the programme
expands, it is right, as I and others have said, that open academies
continue to be supported and that their performance be monitored, owing
to the challenging circumstances in which they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>operate. The Department finds it increasingly difficult to deliver that
level of individualised support, which is why we want the delegation.
The YPLA will be able to offer the necessary support, and academies
will benefit from its regionalised structure. The routine functions
currently carried out by staff in my Department, such as calculating
and paying grants, will be undertaken by the YPLA on the Secretary of
State&#146;s behalf. In addition, the YPLA will oversee academy
improvement through academy school improvement
partners.</div><a name="09031951000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000519"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the Minister clarify the number of regional
offices? Where will the one in the south west be
based?</div><a name="09031951000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000520"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We are currently working on aspects of that. I
would expect the regional structure to be coterminous with the
Government office regions, but if the position is any different, I will
let the Committee know. I do not know whether the detail of where
functions will be based in the regions has been agreed in the
negotiations, but if I get that information, I will certainly send it
to the hon. Gentleman and copy in the rest of the Committee.</div>
<a name="09031951000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we allowed
each academy to chose whether to participate in the proposed
arrangements, as amendment 24 suggests, the YPLA would potentially
carry out functions for only some academies. The Department would
continue to carry out the same functions as it does now for academies
that did not agree to the new arrangements. There would therefore be
significant duplication of roles and functions, significant
inefficiences, significant inconsistencies and increased costs. I would
therefore strongly resist the proposition that the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton puts forward in his amendment.</div>
<a name="09031951000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The YPLA will
also be able to provide more responsive regionally based support to
academies&#151;something that the Department is unable to do at the
moment and is unlikely to be able to offer in the future. The YPLA can
provide better local knowledge, additional local support can be
delivered more quickly to prevent crises, and a more personalised
service can be offered to meet the needs of individual
academies.</div>
<a name="09031951000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
25, the Secretary of State will retain responsibility for the
regulatory framework for all academies and will continue to take key
decisions about individual academies on issues such as terminating the
funding agreement, appointing additional members to the governing body
and developing the academy&#146;s policy.</div>
<a name="09031951000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
26, the Committee will be aware that one reason why academies have
flexibility and independence is that they are regulated for the most
part via their funding agreements. The powers in the Bill will not
change the content of those agreements and will not entitle the YPLA to
impose new duties on academies. Nor will it change the fundamental
principle that sponsors provide direction and leadership for the
academy.</div>
<a name="09031951000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State and his officials will, of course, have a close working
relationship with the YPLA, which will be required to exercise its
academy functions in accordance with arrangements set down by the
Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will provide the YPLA with
guidance on the delivery of academy functions. Reporting arrangements
will ensure that there is regular communication and
accountability.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div><a name="09031951000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton of course questioned whether
the YPLA was the right organisation to do the work; indeed, he proposed
setting up a completely separate organisation to do it. We must ensure
that any academy functions are carried out in a cost-effective way. It
is intended that routine academy functions carried out by the YPLA will
deliver cost savings, as the use of YPLA resources will, for example,
reduce staff costs and prevent unnecessary duplication of back-office
functions. The agency&#146;s internal structure, with the main office
responsible for finance functions and regional offices responsible for
the improved delivery of performance management functions, means that
those cost savings can be achieved.</div>
<a name="09031951000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The YPLA will
calculate and make payments of grants, supervise and ensure financial
control of budgets, and monitor and enforce the funding agreement. That
fits with its main remit of funding education and training places for
16 to 19-year-olds. A large number of the officials who transfer their
employment to the YPLA will carry out the same funding functions in
respect of academies that they currently perform in the Department.
There is therefore a good fit in terms of the bulk of what the YPLA
will do in respect of academies.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000521"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Why would the Government not consider allowing other
schools to opt into the YPLA and out of local authority
oversight?</div>
<a name="09031951000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000522"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> My view on such a transfer is that the academies
intervention is a particular sort of intervention. It is intended to
deal with circumstances in which we need to achieve a more rigorous
form of government, as well as a particular form of accountability
through the funding agreement, which we know has worked for academies.
Other schools&#151;from trust schools to voluntary assisted schools
through to community schools&#151;remain part of the local authority
family, and it is right that they should do so. I have no proposals to
alter that arrangement. Schools that are independent of local
authorities will be academies, except for the few CTCs that are
left.</div><a name="09031951000476"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09031951000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
339 would affect the proposals in the clause. Under the clause, the
YPLA will not have the power to impose new duties on academies. It will
have only the Secretary of State&#146;s existing powers that he asks
it to exercise on his behalf. As I said, it is an agency arrangement.
If an academy takes the view that the YPLA is acting unreasonably in
carrying out those functions, it can complain to the Secretary of
State. The Secretary of State will investigate any such complaint to
ensure that the YPLA is carrying out those functions on his behalf in a
reasonable
manner.</div><a name="09031951000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
agency arrangement does not change the current situation. If an academy
complains that officials are behaving unreasonably, the Secretary of
State will investigate the matter whether the officials are in the
Department or an agency. The new arrangement will not reduce the legal
remedies available to academies. If an academy is unhappy with the way
it is being treated by the agency on the Secretary of State&#146;s
behalf, it will have all the potential legal remedies it needs. For
example, it might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div>think that the agency is breaching the terms of the funding agreement by
failing to pay grant or that it is failing to comply with the general
principles of public
law.</div><a name="09031951000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
391 and 392 would work together to ensure that the YPLA could not enter
into a funding agreement with an academy on behalf of the Secretary of
State. The clause gives the YPLA the power to do that if required to do
so by the Secretary of State. However, I confirm that we have no
intention of requiring the YPLA to enter into funding agreements with
academies. As I have said, under the new arrangements the Secretary of
State will continue to carry out those functions. These proposals will
mean that the way in which the Secretary of State and the YPLA work
together can be flexible. We will be able to move to a lighter-touch
approach if in the light of experience that seems appropriate to the
Secretary of State and, crucially, to
academies.</div><a name="09031951000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
if we did want funding agreements to be negotiated by the YPLA in the
future, by law the contracting party would still be the Secretary of
State. Therefore, the Secretary of State and the Department will take
an active interest in any funding agreements for the setting up of
academies. The idea that the YPLA could enter into funding agreements
unravels as a serious proposition because it simply acts as an agent in
respect of academies&#146;
functions.</div><a name="09031951000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000523"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That may be the Minister&#146;s intention, but
surely there is nothing in the Bill to stop the YPLA entering into such
agreements without the Secretary of State&#146;s
agreement.</div><a name="09031951000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000524"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> My understanding is that the only academy funding
agreement that can be undertaken is the one between the Secretary of
State and the academy sponsor. It is therefore not possible for the
YPLA to enter into such an agreement. I assure the Committee that we do
not intend for there to be any reduction in the autonomy of academies
through these provisions. These are simply more practical arrangements
that will allow the planned expansion of the academies programme. For
those reasons, I urge hon. Members not to press their
amendments.</div><a name="09031951000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000525"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments on
amendments 391 and 392. I am a little confused about the
Government&#146;s position on this matter. I need to reflect on the
Minister&#146;s words on
paper.</div><a name="09031951000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister seemed to indicate that although the Government&#146;s
intention is to not confer on the YPLA the power to enter into academy
funding agreements, that power is in the Bill. He is relying on the
assumption that the YPLA will not be willing to do something that the
Secretary of State disagrees with, but his other comments indicated
that at some point the Government&#146;s attitude might change on the
degree to which these powers should be devolved to the YPLA. That set
off alarm bells in my mind about how much openness there is
here.</div><a name="09031951000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will go away and reflect on these matters and perhaps speak to the
Minister and his officials to ensure that I understand their intention
and the reality. Perhaps if I am not satisfied, I can bring back
amendments at a later stage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div><a name="09031951000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
will, with your permission, Mr. Chope, want to press clause
74 as a whole to a Division later, because I remain unconvinced by the
reasons that the Minister has given for placing the academy programme
under the YPLA. I am left with the suspicion that the hon. Member for
Barnsley, East and Mexborough hit on the reasons for the
Government&#146;s decision when he questioned the Minister on the
matter during our evidence session on 10 March and the Minister
replied:</div><a name="09031951000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would have given in to the charge of watering down the independence of
academies if we had handed over their performance management and
funding to local authorities.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee</i>, 10 March 2009; c. 173,
Q411.]</div><a name="09031951000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
impression from that statement is that the Government were nervous
about being seen to be compromising the independence of the academies
programme.</div><a name="09031951000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we have questioned the Minister further, he has given, under some
pressure and encouragement from me, some more serious reasons why the
Government might want to put the academies programme under the YPLA.
The two points that under some pressure he acknowledged he has concerns
about are, first, the performance management of academies and,
secondly, the possibility that local authorities might seek to suck
back some of the autonomy that has been granted to academies because of
their concern somehow to be controlling those schools. We have made it
clear that we see local authorities as having a commissioning and
strategic role, not a role in running the individual
schools.</div><a name="09031951000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reason that the Minister gave is entirely unconvincing, because
there is no reason why the Government could not place in legislation a
protection for academies in respect of the freedoms that they currently
enjoy, which the Government granted them. Some of them, as the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, have been rather rolled
back on over the past couple of years. There is no reason why the
Government could not also give a power of appeal, for example, to the
schools commissioner to ensure that if academies were concerned about
the activities of their local authority, they could appeal to the
schools commissioner to ensure that their independence and autonomy was
not
compromised.</div><a name="09031951000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other reason that the Minister gave, under some pressure and
encouragement, was that he did not think that all local authorities
could be trusted to performance manage academies. He said that that was
one of the two concerns. Under further questioning, he said
later&#151;or perhaps it was as part of his speech&#151;that a more
rigorous form of government or governance was needed for academies.
That is very surprising, because even today, with the expansion of the
academies programme, the majority of the 23,500 schools in the country
are under the performance management and strategic control of local
authorities.</div><a name="09031951000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government are really so concerned that a serious number of local
authorities are not doing their job properly, one wonders why they
should be given the strategic oversight of performance for all those
other schools, including a very large number of schools whose
performance is just as poor as that of some of the academies that the
Government are now placing under the YPLA. If the Government are really
so concerned about the inadequate performance management by local
authorities, I do not see why the Government or perhaps 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>even the Conservatives are not proposing the logical outcome of that
concern and that process, which is to allow schools that are not
impressed with their local authority to opt out of the local authority
control and move under YPLA control. If the YPLA will provide such a
rigorous form of governance and will be so much better at performance
management, why on earth will it not be controlling the performance
management of the majority of
schools?</div><a name="09031951000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
do the Government not draw the obvious conclusion from the concerns
that they appear to have about the performance management of some local
authorities, which is that they should be addressing that more
vigorously and should be ensuring that the systems of inspection hold
more transparently and vigorously to account those local authorities
that are not performing well? A local authority that is failing its
local school that has become an academy is likely to be failing other
schools.</div><a name="09031951000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
asked the Minister where the oversight of academies would be in the
south-west and he has kindly undertaken to let me know later where that
will be from. However, I think that the impression was that there will
be one headquarters to cover the entire south-west region. I do not
know how many academies there are in the south-west at the moment, but
there are probably not all that many. For example, I think that one
academy, to which the Minister referred earlier, is just about to be
established in Somerset.</div>
<a name="09031951000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems
extraordinary that we are going to put in place an extra level of
bureaucracy that will operate out of one centre in a huge region
covering hundreds and thousands of square miles, and that such a system
is expected to do a better and more efficient job at performance
managing those schools than the local authorities that are on the spot
and are aware of the local circumstances. For example, local
authorities might pick up information from other schools to which
parents might be taking their children if they are not happy with the
school that is failing. It is possible and, indeed, necessary to have
stronger performance management and oversight through the existing
local authority system. If we are really not convinced that that is
working at all, we would be far better getting rid of that tier
altogether and allowing schools to opt in to some kind of
YPLA&#151;an idea that the Conservatives occasionally toy
with.</div>
<a name="09031951000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
academies, the Government seem to have constructed the YPLA to meet the
true concerns that they have, which was indicated by the
Minister&#146;s comments to the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and
Mexborough. Those comments gave the impression that the
Minister&#146;s concern is about much more than transferring academy
oversight to local authorities; it is that the Government would be
perceived to be undermining the autonomy of academies and that
programme. As a consequence, it is a great pity that an opportunity has
been missed to place the academy programme under the strategic
oversight of local authorities and, as part of that process, to ensure
that the job that local authorities are doing in terms of performance
management for all schools is much improved. For that reason, I will be
seeking a Division on clause 74 as a whole
later.</div><a name="09031951000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="09031951000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031951000526"></a><b class="B">Mr.

makes sense for the Department to have an agency to take care of
academies. Clearly the Department was never meant to be a local

Q107.]</div><a name="09031951000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can
both agree with that quote, but my honest assessment of the opinion of
the academy movement is that it does not believe that the YPLA is the
correct body to look after academies.</div>
<a name="09031951000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
confusing that the Minister said that the YPLA has a useful regional
structure, which makes me think that the 49 buildings plus the one in
Coventry, which the LSC currently occupies at a cost of &#163;26.1
million a year, are going to be maintained and not streamlined. That
will spread the people who are managing the academies between those 49
buildings, which is not a terribly efficient way of managing
them.</div><a name="09031951000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000527"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> From memory, I think that currently  22
officials will move over from the Department to the YPLA. Does the hon.
Gentleman have any idea about how we might spread them across 46
offices?</div><a name="09031951000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000528"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am reassured to hear that.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> As the hon. Member for Yeovil says
from a sedentary position, that is how it will start. The Minister said
that the regional structure of the YPLA is a useful mechanism through
which to conduct oversight of the academies, but, of course, it is the
role of the federation of academies to look after academies in a
regional or national way by selecting five, six, seven or ten academies
within their federation to be monitored and nurtured. That is not the
role of an expanding YPLA. If possible, I would like a Division on
amendment 26, rather than on lead amendment 24. Amendment 26 enshrines
in legislation that the objective of the YPLA is to maintain the
autonomy of academies, which is an important principle.</div>
<a name="09031951000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
intrigued by what the Minister had to say about the powers of the
Secretary of State who would maintain his power and duty to terminate
funding agreements and appoint additional governors. It seems that the
Department will maintain an oversight role to ensure that academies are
performing well. That prompts me to ask what the YPLA will do if it
does not inspect schools or oversee them, because the power to tackle
underperforming academies still rests with the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09031951000477"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

Knight:</b> A good hint as to the sort of things that it would
do was given by Daniel Moynihan in his evidence to the Committee. In
response to my questions about the sort of issues on which he has a
regular relationship with officials, he said that there is a
&#147;fair amount of traffic&#148;, and went on to say:</div>
<a name="09031951000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Admissions,
funding and clarification on funding models, legal issues relating to
academies, local discussions with local authorities and the
DCSF&#146;s role in arbitrating those discussions, so a very wide
range of different issues.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div><a name="09031951000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the sorts of
things that our officials our working with academies on, on a
day-to-day basis, that I would see the YPLA doing on our
behalf.</div><a name="09031951000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000530"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I see that role being performed by federations of
academies rather than by a Government
agency.</div><a name="09031951000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000531"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about
federations and their role in performance management, what should
happen with academies that are not part of a wider federation, or with
federations that consist of only two academies? Would he be happy for a
single academy to performance manage itself, or for federations of only
two or three academies to do that
job?</div><a name="09031951000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000532"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman raises an important point,
but these are early stages in the academy movement, and I do not
believe that we will have single academies surviving out there, in the
long run, and that they will end up forming federations. An important
part of the academy movement is allowing parents to have real power and
choice. That is concomitant with the effectiveness of the whole policy.
The pressure to raise standards will come from parents having a genuine
choice of schools or academies for their children. There is not genuine
choice at the moment, because there are so few good schools, and it is
difficult for new academies to enter the market because of
restrictions, planning laws and so on, so there is not that pressure to
perform. Once parents have that genuine choice, because surplus places
are being maintained, and it is easy for new entrants to come into the
system, the reputation of academy federations will be absolutely key,
and they will be determined to maintain and enhance their reputation.
Therein lies the source for raising standards in our
schools.</div><a name="09031951000097"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000533"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s aspiration for
more choice in the system and the potential to ratchet up standards as
a consequence, but he will be aware of evidence that choice has not
always proved to be a good vehicle for automatically increasing
standards, particularly in less affluent areas. Surely, there will
therefore need to be a mechanism of accountability that is stronger
than simply having the choice
mechanism?</div><a name="09031951000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000534"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> We have not really had genuine choice in this
country. In countries that do have genuine choice, such as Sweden,
standards have risen considerably, both in the schools that have come
into the system and in the existing municipality, so I believe that
choice will have an effect. He is right that, ultimately, powers will
have to reside somewhere to tackle academies or federation of academies
that fail, and I think that they should rest in a newly established
body. There is some confusion, which the Minister will clarify in a
moment, about where those powers lie. Is it with the YPLA or with the
Secretary of State, who has the ultimate powers to terminate funding
agreements or to appoint additional governors. Those are the key powers
that will be used to tackle poorly performing academies, leading to a
rise in standards. If those powers rest with the Secretary of State,
rather than the YPLA, the YPLA will be powerless to tackle
underperformance.</div>
<a name="09031951000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000535"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I was reluctant to intervene on the hon. Gentleman
because we want to make progress, but he has said something significant
about his party&#146;s policy  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div>on moving towards all academies being part of wider federations and
chains of schools. It is worth pointing out that Dan Moynihan, whom I
have quoted, is the chief executive of one of our most successful
partnerships. It is also worth pointing out that however successful the
free schools in Sweden or the charter schools in the United States have
been, this country&#146;s education system still outperforms theirs
in international comparisons. I thought that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s policy of parents being able to start schools would
be that groups of parents could start them wherever they want, but he
is now saying that they can do that only as long as they are part of a
chain.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000536"></a>Mr.

federations. They would probably form federations with primary school
academies to provide the back-office support and assistance that the

that will happen, but I suspect that it would happen if there were more
freedom and ease to set up academies to run

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000567"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 27, in clause 75,
page 46, line 18, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(e) require the
YPLA to support the successful establishment of Academy sixth
forms.&#146;.</div><a name="09031951000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment reflects the concern of academy principals and sponsors that
the new arrangements for funding established under the Bill might
result in discrimination against academies that want to establish sixth
forms. In a letter to the Minister from the Independent Academies
Association, Mike Butler, the chairman of the IAA,
wrote:</div><a name="09031951000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
the force of numbers likely to be brought to bear in many debates
regarding post-16 commissioning, particularly where the commissioning
power rests with groups of local authorities, and/or there is a strong
FE sector contingent, there is genuine anxiety that academy sixth forms
will lose out. Despite verbal assurances, there appears to be nothing
in part 3, chapter 4 of the Bill that would suggest that the YPLA can
safeguard an academy&#146;s post-16 funding should local agreements
be to its
detriment.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
goes on to say that</div>
<a name="09031951000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the presumption
for academy sixth forms is based on a sound rationale, namely that of
raising student aspirations and being able to recruit the best
teachers. New academy sixth forms need time to build up, and are
critical to developing academic work throughout the academy, and thus
to raising community aspirations and contributing to regeneration and
community
cohesion.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to give legislative backing to those verbal assurances,
by requiring the YPLA to support academies at which to establish sixth
forms. That support should be forthcoming notwithstanding other
sixth-form provision in the area. Choice and competition as a lever to
force up standards can work only if new providers are given the freedom
to establish schools, without restrictions based on the number of
surplus places that already exist.</div>
<a name="09031951000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The areas
with the most surplus places are where there is greatest need for new
providers to establish the type and quality of education demanded by
those very parents who are avoiding the schools with the spare
capacity, whether that be sixth form or secondary education more
generally. If the Minister believes in choice and diversity provision,
he should have no problem in supporting the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000568"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I shall speak briefly to amendment 27, as I have
already made a similar point about an earlier amendment. I am sure that
the Committee can refer back to what I said then for a fuller argument.
I reassure the hon. Gentleman and others that the size of a proposed
academy, and whether it should have a sixth form, will be decided long
before it opens and while the Secretary of State retains direct
involvement. Appropriate admission arrangements are determined to
reflect that. After an academy is open, if there is disagreement
locally about the number of places to be funded, the matter would be
referred to the YPLA, which would act on behalf of the Secretary of
State. The YPLA would reach any decisions on academy sixth-form places
by having regard to the policy guidance provided by the Secretary of
State. For those reasons, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000569"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000570"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The growing use of information-sharing clauses under
the Government is always a cause of anxiety. I understand the
Government&#146;s rationale. If they establish three or four quangos
where there used to be just one, to avoid replicating the same
information three or four times, they can pass a law that enables those
quangos to send the data files that they hold to each other. The danger
is not simply that those files could go missing in the post&#151;I
cannot believe that would ever happen&#151;but that through the
clauses, new data-sharing powers are swept in. Personal data collected
for a narrow, specific purpose could be shared with other statutory
bodies for whom they were not intended. In the clause, exam or internal
test data from students at an academy, or confidential notes regarding
conversations between a student and a teacher, could be given to the
Secretary of State, the YPLA
or</div><a name="09031951000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
other person by or in respect of whom a relevant function is
exercisable.&#148;</div>
<a name="09031951000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is clause
76(3)(d).</div>
<a name="09031951000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful for the Committee, and in due course for the Information
Commissioner, if the Minister would spell out what information he has
in mind, and what are the limits to the type of information that he
envisages being shared among the four categories in subparagraph
(3).</div>
<a name="09031951000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
instances when it is necessary for information to be shared between
parties in order to effect the new arrangements, and we will debate
information sharing more widely when we reach clause 119, from memory.
We can go into more detail then, if that is the Committee&#146;s
desire.</div>

76 enables the information to be shared between the Secretary of State,
the YPLA, the academy and other relevant parties, including, typically,
the local authority. That information will be subject to guidance that
the Department will issue. Such information sharing might include
management information on the application and impact of specific
policies&#151;for example, exclusions or special educational
needs&#151;that the YPLA has referred to the Secretary of State. The
information will be used to inform policy
development.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000572"></a>Jim

be circumstances in which, for example, an individual in an academy,
rather than carry on from year 11 to the sixth form, might want to
secure learning somewhere else, so information about them would best be
supplied to the YPLA as part of the commissioning arrangements that it

<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>functions in clause 79. As far as I can tell, the Bill makes no mention
of either the SFA or the NAS. I am sure that there are strange British

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000574"></a>The

<a name="09031951000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000575"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes, of course. Clause 78 and schedule 4 establish
the post of chief executive of these bodies. The explanatory notes
refer to the Skills Funding Agency and the National Apprenticeship

of the Bill, all that appears is the term,</div>

Executive of Skills
Funding.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume that there is some strange House reason why the other terms are
not included in the Bill, and I would be grateful if the Minister could
explain what it is. This is not only about nomenclature but the
amorphous nature of the legislation, which gives weight to the worry
that we are sowing the seeds of two very large new bureaucratic
empires. The Association of Colleges has expressed that worry,
stating:</div><a name="09031951000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are concerned that Further Education Colleges will have to respond to
at least two funding bodies - their local authority and the
SFA.&#148;.</div><a name="09031951000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
wants to be sure
that</div><a name="09031951000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Colleges
do not spend even more time dealing with bureaucratic burdens and can
concentrate maximum effort to teaching
students&#148;</div><a name="09031951000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
feels that the process of abolishing the LSC and transferring its
powers and functions to local authorities, the YPLA and the SFA should
have been used as an opportunity to remove some of the duties and
powers, not to reinforce
them.</div><a name="09031951000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
106 would mean that the chief executive of the SFA could employ no more
than 1,800 staff&#151;the number that will be transferred from the
LSC to the SFA, as confirmed by the Minister on Tuesday. The
impact assessment
states:</div><a name="09031951000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
part of our thinking on the design of the new structures we are looking
at opportunities for making administrative savings through
centralisation of functions, including looking at the potential to
share support services where possible, and greater use of new
technology.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would assist the Committee if the Minister could expand on those
matters and set out where he envisages cost savings being made, which
support services are to be shared, and how new technology will help. We
want to be reassured that the carefully crafted sentences in the impact
assessment have behind them schedules and plans that will result in
cost
savings.</div><a name="09031951000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I talk about the cost implications for colleges, I have one further
point to make on the cost of the plans to the Exchequer. As we heard on
Tuesday, when we debated the transition costs of transferring staff
from the LSC to the YPLA, the Under-Secretary of State for Innovation,
Universities and Skills and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>Minister for Schools and Learners explicitly stated in evidence sessions
that the costs were set out in the impact assessment budget. The
Minister has, in effect, already apologised for that. The impact
assessment states:</div>
<a name="09031951000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
on-going costs of the new system will be revenue neutral there are
likely to be transition costs relating to premises and pensions and,
potentially, the transfer of the people from the LSC to their new
employers. There will be assets that can be realised to offset these
costs, such as the premises, though the current economic climate will
make the calculations more complex. Work on calculating these is
on-going and will proceed alongside the development of the designs for
the Young People&#146;s Funding Agency and Skills Funding
Agency.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alas,
that is all that it says about transition costs. The Minister is not in
the room at the moment, but he must have had the impact assessment in
front of him when he said that it sets out the transition costs in
full. Moments before he explicitly stated that the transitional costs
were set out in the impact assessment, he said that</div>
<a name="09031951000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we expect to
make administrative savings through a centralisation of functions,

words were lifted directly from page 32 of the impact assessment. It
has been 48 hours since we asked him to provide estimates from the DCSF
and DIUS of the transition costs. I hope and expect that they will be
supplied when the Government respond so that we do not have to return
to the issue on
Report.</div><a name="09031951000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the cost to colleges of the new arrangements, it is depressing to see
the vision set out in the impact assessment. We used to have one
organisation&#151;the LSC&#151;but now its functions will be
carried out by three or more bodies, including local authorities, the
YPLA and the SFA. The impact assessment
states:</div><a name="09031951000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Best
practice guidance will be produced to cover partnership
working.&#148;</div>
<a name="09031951000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">So one organisation is
taken, split into three separate organisations and then a 20-page
document is issued, to be read by all the senior figures in each of
those new organisations, about how they should all work together. It
says:</div><a name="09031951000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
line with existing practice, providers of both 16-18 and post-19
education and training will continue to have separate commissioning
conversations but, instead of these being with the LSC they will be
with both the Skills Funding Agency and a local authority. This will
not, therefore, be an additional burden on these providers, as in many
cases they currently have multiple commissioning conversations with the
Learning and Skills Council regarding these separate
areas.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to
say:</div><a name="09031951000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
designing the new system we are looking for opportunities to streamline
arrangements &#151; for example by using a single performance
management framework for both pre- and post-19
providers&#148;.</div><a name="09031951000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
there will be a &#147;single performance management
framework&#148;. What a good idea! Maybe in time, once the new
arrangements have settled down, we can merge the management structures
and even create one overarching organisation that performs the
functions of all three organisations in a streamlined way, benefiting
from synergies and further efficiency savings. Until that moment comes,
can the Minister expand a little more on what is meant by a
&#147;single performance management framework&#148;, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div>giving us a reassurance that that phrase is more than just a set of
words drafted into a document for the impact
assessment?</div><a name="09031951000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
106 would limit the number of staff that the SFA can employ to
1,800&#151;the number that will transfer from the LSC. That should
far exceed the number needed if costs are to be reduced. The SFA is not
taking on any new functions, such as administering the academies, so
the figure of 1,800 should leave it with maximum
flexibility&#151;apart from the flexibility to expand its empire and
clock up ever-rising costs. I look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s response.</div>

Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): Good afternoon,
Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="09031951000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a lot of sympathy with what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has said, because I, too, find it
curious that the clause establishes the office of the chief executive
of the SFA rather than the nature of the organisation over which he or
she will preside.</div>
<a name="09031951000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made various references to cost savings. When I was a member
of the Education and Skills Committee&#151;now the Children, Schools
and Families Committee&#151;the chief executive of the LSC, Mark
Haysom, appeared before us. We questioned him several times on the
nature of the cost savings that the LSC had had to make in its short
life, with much upheaval having been visited on it by the Government.
Its total staff complement has changed many times, as has the nature of
the organisation. The amendment would therefore represent a good start
in trying to limit the staff numbers of the new agency, the
SFA.</div>
<a name="09031951000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems odd
that we will have to wait for a memorandum from the Secretary of State
that establishes exactly what form the SFA will take and what its
functions will be. Perhaps the only saving grace in all this change is
that it is clear that the SFA will be incorporated directly within the
Department and that it will not be a separate agency, as the LSC is at
the moment. If there are any potential future foul-ups and confusion
over who has given approval for college capital expenditure budgets to
be accelerated before the brakes are put on and an investigation is
launched into the fact that one part of the Government did not know
what another part was doing, it is to be hoped that such confusion will
be avoided by the direct accountability to the permanent secretary and,
through him, to the ministerial team. That might be an improvement in
terms of college capital expenditure.</div>

what Opposition Members are trying to say. Clearly, we have no desire
to create a bloated new bureaucracy. What we want is an SFA that can be
responsive and adaptable, and that works with providers to meet the
needs of employers and learners. But, as the hon. Member for Bristol,
West said, it is essential that the chief executive is able to exercise
his or her own 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>judgment about the number of staff needed to carry out the vital work.
That judgment will be exercised and those staffing levels managed
within an agreed administrative budget allocated by the Secretary of
State. The funding will be accounted for in the Department&#146;s
expenditure plans. The Secretary of State will be accountable for that
expenditure to Parliament. The SFA will also be subject to independent
scrutiny by the National Audit Office which will also be
required&#151;</div><a name="09031951000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000578"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Should the chief executive have the discretion to
employ more than 18,000
people?</div><a name="09031951000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000579"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The chief executive must have the discretion to
make his or her own judgments about the number of staff needed to do
the job. I think it very unlikely that the chief executive will have to
employ more than 18,000 people. It would be very unusual and
potentially counter-productive to put an arbitrary number such as that
into the Bill. As I say, there is no intention to increase that
number.</div>
<a name="09031951000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000580"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> In the past when Departments or quangos have
reduced their staff complements they have often gone out and hired
consultants to deal with some of those tasks. What consultancy budget
does the Minister think this new agency will
have?</div><a name="09031951000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000581"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am sure that hon. Gentleman does not seriously
expect me to speculate on the consultancy budget of the new agency.
Actually, he raises a very good point. If there were an 18,000 staff
limit in the Bill and for reasons that we cannot currently imagine the
chief executive required more work to be done&#151;perhaps urgent,
important and very value-for-money, cost-effective work in the national
interests&#151;than could be done by those 18,000 people, what would
he or she do? I suspect the answer is that they
would&#151;</div>
<a name="09031951000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000582"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Not do the
work.</div><a name="09031951000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000583"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> That remark from a sedentary position is a
disappointingly cynical approach to very hard-working people in the
LSC. If we put an arbitrary cap like this on the number of permanent
staff, in the very unlikely event that extra capacity were needed, the
SFA would be almost obliged to turn to consultants who might be more
expensive.</div><a name="09031951000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031951000584"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): The
outrage expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton about the absence of pertinent information is indicative
of his passionate concern for the public interest. Does the Minister
know whether any estimate was made of the cost savings to be made when
the LSC was set
up?</div><a name="09031951000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000585"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Do I know whether estimates were made of the cost
savings to be made before the LSC was set up in the late &#146;90s? I
do not know the answer to that off the top of my head. I do know that
in the first period of its operation the LSC saved &#163;50 million a
year on its original budget and another &#163;40 million a year in
the second period. The situation that the SFA will inherit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>will by now be saving &#163;90 million on the original budget. There
is no intention that the complement of staff should
grow.</div><a name="09031951000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000586"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> All those figures are quite properly drawn from
parliamentary answers. The Minister is right about the figure of
&#163;50 million. Does he know how long it took to pay for the
reorganisation in terms of the clearing-up work due to the abolition of
the training and enterprise
councils?</div><a name="09031951000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000587"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am not going to spend the rest of the afternoon
debating with the hon. Gentleman how long it took and how much it cost
to put right the mess  that we inherited from Conservative
party. There were 72 TECs under the Conservatives, which we streamlined
considerably. Any outcome now will be vastly fewer organisations than
presided over the skills system under his party.</div>
<a name="09031951000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make
some progress. To constrain the chief executive in such a way could
have an adverse impact in reducing his flexibility, and that is why we
do not propose to do it.</div>
<a name="09031951000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 4
sets out the provisions relating to the chief executive&#146;s
status, tenure of office and terms of appointment. It also sets out
provisions relating to staff and the delegation of functions of the
office to staff; funding and payment of grants from the Secretary of
State to the chief executive; arrangements for preparing annual reports
and accounts, as well as the provisions on the supplementary powers
that may be exercised by the chief executive in connection with the
functions of the office and restrictions of those
powers.</div><a name="09031951000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about which bits of the new
organisations are named in the Bill, there are two things going on.
First, I am told that it is not normal to name agencies in legislation
and that they are generally established administratively by
Departments. In this case, we want to put duties on a statutory
postholder to make it clear that there should be more separation
between the postholder and the Secretary of State than in an Executive
agency. That postholder is responsible for implementation and the
allocation of resources on the ground. It is an unusual beast. The fair
access regulator is quite similarly constructed but on a much smaller
basis. There are other examples, but, as I say, it is a relatively
unusual beast in
Government.</div><a name="09031951000205"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000589"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> No, the National Apprenticeship Service is not an
agency. It is a service that sits within the Skills Funding Agency. Its
chief executive has a direct reporting responsibility to the two
Secretaries of State because the National Apprenticeship Service job,
with its planning and delivering of apprenticeships, is so important.
The NAS is not an agency. The Skills Funding Agency, although we have
called it an agency for the sake of explaining what it does, is not an
Executive agency in the way that, for instance, Jobcentre Plus is. The
statutory power is vested in the statutory officeholder, who is the
chief executive of the Skills Funding
Agency.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000591"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Before I answer that question, I will reply to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point on transition costs. He made that point
very strongly in debate with my right hon. Friend the Member for South
Dorset, who said that he would write to him before Report stage. I can
confirm that he will write to Opposition Members about the details that
were not included in the way that they would have liked in the impact
assessment.</div>
<a name="09031951000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000592"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> We want the letter to be as useful as possible for
all members of the Committee. Will it include a schedule for the
repayment of any costs? Relevant to my earlier intervention is the fact
that in the 2006-07 budget line for costs, the reorganisation of text
was still accounted for by the Learning and Skills Council. The last
reorganisation was still being paid off six or seven years
later.</div><a name="09031951000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000593"></a>Mr.

can be got, then I am sure that my right hon. Friend will be happy to
share it with members of the Committee.</div>

the question from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
about the single performance framework, it is the framework for

the relationship between DIUS and the SFA, and the SFA and its

write to Members before Report stage to share it with them.</div>
<a name="09031951000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000594"></a>Mr.

whether before the Minister concludes he can return to the names of the
accounting officers who will be accountable to the Public Accounts
Committee for the performance of the NAS and the
SFA?</div><a name="09031951000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000595"></a>Mr.

the SFA will be the accounting officer for
both.</div><a name="09031951000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000596"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> That is a useful answer to the question of my hon.
Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, but given that
the NAS reports to two Departments, what line of political
responsibility will it be in terms of the proper scrutiny from
organisations such as the Public Accounts
Committee?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div><a name="09031951000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000597"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am not sure that I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question. Is he asking whether the chief executive
of the NAS will appear before the Public Accounts Committee? In that
case, as he is not the accounting officer, then the answer is
no.</div><a name="09031951000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000598"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I will clarify my intervention. My hon. Friend the
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about the
responsibilities of the Public Accounts Committee regarding the
officers of the NAS. The point that I was making is that there is also
a line of political accountability, given that the NAS reports to two
separate Departments. What is that line of political accountability?
Which Ministers will take responsibility regarding the Public Accounts
Committee&#146;s scrutiny of the
NAS?</div><a name="09031951000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000599"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am not sure whether it is for me to determine
which Ministers will appear before the Public Accounts Committee.
However, I envision that, given that the chief executive of the NAS
will make a dual political report, to each Secretary of State, if there
were to be officers from that organisation or Ministers appearing
before Select Committees to answer for that organisation, it will be
Ministers from both Departments. However, the ultimate answer is that
the chief executive of the SFA is the accounting officer, and that is
where the ultimate accountability for the operation of the NAS, which
is housed statutorily within the SFA, will
lie.</div>
<a name="09031951000480"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09031951000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000600"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I do not want to be unnecessarily inquisitive about
this, although I suppose to be so is our purpose. The NAS relationship
with the SFA is becoming clearer as a result of the Minister&#146;s
comments. However, I understand that the SFA does not report to both
Departments, so presumably if the accountability is assured through the
SFA, it is hard to understand why Ministers from a Department with
which the SFA has no relationship would be involved in an inquiry
concerning those matters by a body such as the Public Accounts
Committee.</div>
<a name="09031951000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000601"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I now understand the point that the hon. Gentleman
is making. The distinction, which I perhaps have explained better, is
that the statutory relationship is through the chief executive of
Skills Funding, who is a civil servant accountable to the permanent
secretary at DIUS. Beneath that, there is a relatively unusual dual
report from the chief executive of the NAS directly to the two
Secretaries of State. As for how that reporting line would manifest
itself in ministerial responsibilities to Select
Committees&#151;</div><a name="09031951000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000602"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> If that were to be drawn, it would be a mix of
Jackson Pollock and Heath Robinson. We need to know how that political
line of responsibility marries with the administrative responsibility,
which the hon. Gentleman has made clear. It might be more
straightforward if the Minister were to write to me about that, so that
we could make progress.</div>
<a name="09031951000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000603"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I will be happy to reflect and write to the hon.
Gentleman, should I have any inspired thoughts of anything that I have
not said. However, I do not want to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>promise to write to him with new information that I do not have. I have
explained the situation to him as best I can and as it is envisaged. On
that basis, and on the basis of everything else, I hope that Opposition
Members will feel able to withdraw their amendment and that we might
make some
progress.</div><a name="09031951000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000604"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It was nice to hear the Minister say that he has no
desire to create a bloated new bureaucracy. I have never heard a
Minister say that he would like to create a bloated new bureaucracy,
yet our country is riddled with them and, I suspect, will continue to
be so. He went on to say that the chief executive must have discretion
to employ numbers as he sees fit&#151;he saw no reason to have an
upper limit on those numbers. However he said that he thought that
there was no intention to increase that number, which is assuring.
Perhaps that is a phrase that the Public Accounts Committee can use
when quizzing the various accounting officers who come before them,
following the establishment of these organisations.</div>
<a name="09031951000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I get
depressed when we have these debates. I read the impact assessment and
I see phrases about setting up a single performance management
framework, which I now understand is going to create excellence. If one
looks at our state sector, one can see the waste, and the
reorganisations that seem to take place every five, six or seven years.
I am not assured by this debate that we have got this right and that
our management techniques within the state sector will produce a
streamlined, highly efficient operation. However, we will wait to see
the letter that has been promised from the Minister for Schools and
Learners setting out some proper facts and figures about the transition
costs of transferring these operations from the LSC to the YPLA and the
SFA. Pending the arrival of that letter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000607"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> We have seen off the Under-Secretary of State and
the Minister is back to discuss clause 79 and amendment
107.</div><a name="09031951000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
79 allows the Secretary of State to direct the chief executive of
Skills Funding to designate a person to carry out apprenticeship
functions on behalf of the chief executive. As we heard a few moments
ago, the Government expect that the person designated will be the chief
executive of the National Apprenticeship Service. We also heard that
the NAS will be a discrete service within the Skills Funding Agency,
which we now learn is not an agency at all. The chief executive of the
National Apprenticeship Service will undertake apprenticeship
functions, including the duty to give places to young people on
apprenticeship schemes. Subsection (5) sets out the apprenticeship
functions that will be carried out under this clause. The clause allows
the Secretary of State to define and regulate the relationship between
the two postholders and to set out the functions on which the chief
executive of the NAS or any other designated person will be required to
report to the Secretary of State. As we heard a few moments ago,
Secretary of State refers here to the Secretaries of State of both
Departments.</div><a name="09031951000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
107 is relatively straightforward and I will therefore speak briefly to
it. However, I am afraid that I will speak at some length about new
clause 8, which is a pivotal clause in our estimation because it sets
out an entirely different set of views on how the matters should be
managed. The Minister will note that our amendment is devised to ensure
that the design of the National Apprenticeship Service enables the
Government to fulfil its pledge of world-class apprenticeships that
provide high quality employer places and build support for more
employer ownership of apprenticeships. His objection to earlier
amendments, the purpose of which was to ensure greater employer
involvement in building their frameworks and so better deliver
apprenticeships, was that they were too bureaucratic. No such claim
could be made about amendment 107. It merely seeks to ensure that the
NAS does what it is supposed to do, building an effective
apprenticeship service and having an apprenticeship brand that is alert
to and responds to employer need.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div><a name="09031951000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I spoke
previously about the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, and its
&#147;Apprenticeships: a key route to skills&#148; paper. The noble
Members of that eminent body
concluded:</div><a name="09031951000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government has given individual employers too little involvement in how
apprenticeships are run, rendering them little more than passive
partners. Employers need to be at the centre of apprenticeship
provision. Within five years, all Government funding for
apprenticeships should go directly to employers, rather than through
training providers as happens
today.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Innovation, Universities and Skills Committee on the draft
Apprenticeships Bill, which preceded this Bill, reaffirmed concerns
about employer engagement in the apprenticeship system. My hon. Friend
the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) questioned the CBI
witness who gave evidence to that Committee. When he asked about
employer engagement, particularly about the prescriptive model that he
perceived as the likely product of the Government policy and the NAS,
the CBI witness
replied:</div><a name="09031951000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think that is a
concern&#148;.</div><a name="09031951000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s hon. Friend, the Member for Brigg and Goole
(Mr. Cawsey), asked whether the system was likely to be a
success and the CBI witness
replied:</div><a name="09031951000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
terms of whether it will be a success, it really has to focus on
helping employers reduce the time they spend on bureaucracy,
encouraging more young people of all abilities to take an
apprenticeship.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand that the Bill will prevent funding flowing directly to
employers, advancing it instead through the intermediary of the NAS. At
the very least we should ensure that the service itself is responsive
to employer need. That is the minimum that employers require and
apprentices deserve, hence our
amendment.</div><a name="09031951000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall speak more freely about new clause 8, which sets out an
alternative vision for rejuvenating apprenticeships, and that lies at
the heart of Conservative thinking. We know that the current system is
imperfect&#151;I use the word with moderation, because others have
been more critical. The chairman of BT, Sir Michael Rake, who is also
chairman of the Commission for Employment and Skills, said that he has
met no one who does not believe that the system is incredibly
over-complex, and that it is ridiculous in cost of delivery,
effectiveness and so on. That is a damning criticism from the man who
has been appointed to chair the commission, so my comments, by
comparison, are extraordinarily understated and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000609"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I want to make some progress, so that we can move
on, but I will then happily give way. Otherwise, you will accuse me of
delaying the Committee unduly, and I do not want to do
that.</div><a name="09031951000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000610"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I would not consider doing that, Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000611"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> You would certainly never do that, Mr.
Chope, but the Minister might, because he can be mischievous.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div><a name="09031951000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recent
House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs supports that
simpler funding model and
says:</div><a name="09031951000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that handing the money directly to employers not only provides
companies with a greater incentive to provide apprenticeships but can
also help to reduce red tape as
well.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservatives
understand that a commitment to train an apprentice involves a
financial risk for employers. At base level, it takes time for an
apprentice to start to make a financial contribution to the business.
Under the current funding system, support for off-site training leading
to national vocational qualifications and technical skills is paid
month by month, with some of the money held back to ensure higher
completion rates, so it takes employers a long time to see any real
return on their
investment.</div><a name="09031951000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty is not for large corporates, which can absorb the costs, but
for small businesses it is a major disincentive; but it is through
small businesses that we will rejuvenate the apprenticeship system from
the bottom up. The House of Lords Select Committee report
&#147;Apprenticeship: a key route to skill&#148;, to which I
referred,
says:</div><a name="09031951000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the case of apprenticeship funding, the administrative chain separating
policy from practice on the ground is a long and, we would argue,
dysfunctional one.&#148;</div>
<a name="09031951000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is unlikely to
improve that situation, as John Lucas of the British Chambers of
Commerce made clear in his evidence, which I shall speak about, having
first given way to the
Minister.</div><a name="09031951000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000612"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
indulgence. He is extremely patient. He mentioned the average funding
for apprenticeship places. Is his party committed to sustaining that
level of funding per place at our projected
volume?</div>
<a name="09031951000481"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="09031951000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000613"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> We have no plans to do so, as the Minister will
know if he reads &#147;Building Skills, Transforming Lives: A
training and apprenticeships revolution&#148;, which should be his
bible, because it is the Conservative party&#146;s green paper on
opportunity and skills. It makes it clear that we intend to create
100,000 new apprenticeships, to pay money directly to employers, and to
create an apprenticeship bonus, which I shall speak about in a few
minutes. We have no intention of reducing the level of funding for
apprenticeships. Our funding plans, which the Minister questions,
include a bonus for each apprentice taken on by small and medium-sized
enterprises to encourage them, because we know that SMEs have a vital
role to play if we are to produce a step change  in the number
of employer-based apprenticeships. Proportionate costs to smaller
businesses taking on apprenticeships are much greater than for larger
companies. In a recent CBI survey, 29 per cent. of firms cited a lack
of in-house capacity as the reason for not getting involved in
apprenticeships. We want to change that through our SME bonus. The
Federation of Small Businesses pointed out in the consultation for the
draft Apprenticeships Bill that according to labour force surveys, 69
per cent. of all apprenticeships take place in small businesses but, it
said, an inherent problem for businesses with fewer than 10 employees
remains the cost to businesses of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div>training their apprentices. Subsection (2)(c) of new clause 8 refers to
consultation with SMEs in the science, technology, engineering and
mathematics sector. Many experts regard STEM business as key to our
future, as British firms increasingly need to compete in a high-skill,
high-value world economy and as competition from emerging nations puts
further downward pressure on labour costs. The STEM sector has a high
proportion of SMEs and its ability to train people will be
crucial.</div>
<a name="09031951000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">When speaking
of STEM businesses it is easy to focus on information systems,
information technology and so on, but we should not ignore the creative
and cultural sector&#151;a big growth area in our
economy&#151;which fares very badly from the Government&#146;s
Train to Gain scheme. The Minister will be able to tell us precisely
what proportion of such businesses benefit from Train to Gain, but the
scheme is certainly not providing a significant contribution to
training in that sector. Whereas, apprenticeships can indeed play a
useful, highly valuable role in enabling Britain to continue to lead in
the creative and cultural skills field. Subsection (3) of new clause 8
aims to provide funds to make it easier for employers to come together
and pool their resources and talent to create their own apprenticeship
schemes or group training associations. When a substantial body of
employers within an industry is committed to sponsoring apprenticeships
they should be encouraged and enabled to develop their own
apprenticeship scheme. This is key to ensuring that employers&#151;it
could be small employers&#151;are committed to apprenticeships. To
ensure greater employer involvement in apprenticeships, funds should be
provided for pilot schemes for new GTAs led by employers who already
run successful apprenticeship schemes. In oral evidence to the
Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee on the draft
Apprenticeships Bill, the British Chambers of Commerce added its
support for group training associations. It
said:</div><a name="09031951000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
concept of a group training association will be at the heart for many
small and medium sized businesses because the world of apprenticeships
has changed from...where you had very large companies that were
embedded in the regions that would often recruit 50, 70 or 100
apprentices at a time for both their own purposes and then for other
business as well. Those have now gone. What we are looking at is a
concept where one or two apprentices perhaps are being taken by a
number of companies and we have effective delivery of training for
those which brings in the group training
association.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
the Government, albeit slowly though I will not say reluctantly, have
recognised the potential of group training associations&#151;their
impact assessment accompanying the draft Apprenticeships Bill explained
that the creation of GTAs is specifically intended to ease the
administrative burden on small businesses. The Innovation,
Universities, Science and Skills Committee report recommended
that</div><a name="09031951000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
draft Bill be revised to place a duty on the National Apprenticeship
Service to facilitate the setting up of bodies such as group training
associations, to assist small businesses to carry the administrative
burden of setting up apprenticeships, organising training and securing
financial
support.&#148;</div><a name="09031951000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response, the Government stated in their special report of 2008-09,
published on 12 February, that the Bill will require the chief
executive of Skills Funding to secure apprenticeship training and
encourage the provision of apprenticeship training among employers.
These duties will be delegated to the chief executive of the National
Apprenticeships Service.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div><a name="09031951000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government, I think grudgingly, have recognised that merely adding
apprenticeships to those well established programmes of well respected
large employers is not sufficient to make apprenticeships reasonably
accessible to large numbers of people who could take up apprenticeship
places in those areas of the country where there are fewer corporates.
A glance at the breakdown of the number of apprenticeships in different
areas shows extraordinary differences. Indeed, even across London there
is an extraordinary disparity; some boroughs have very few
apprenticeships&#151;Greenwich, for example, has just
200&#151;whereas other boroughs have 270 or 300. Some cities and
towns have a small number, while others have long-established
apprenticeship programmes and a large number of opportunities for young
people and others. There are problems in parts of the
country, and reinvigorating the system through SMEs, with the support
of group training associations, will help to even out some of the
variety.</div>
<a name="09031951000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">In urging
Members across the Committee to support new clause 8, I emphasise that
I do not think that there is much difference in our ambitions for
apprenticeships, but there are real differences in how we believe those
ambitions are most likely to be realised. There is a disconnect between
the Government and employers, which is why the new clause is vital.
There was disappointment during the witness sessions from organisations
such as the British Chambers of Commerce and the sector skills councils
about the Government underestimating the role of employers and so
understating it in the Bill. A bigger role for sector skills councils
would also help to achieve our shared ambitions for apprenticeships.
Their role is barely mentioned in the Bill, although I accept that it
is dealt with liberally in the explanatory
notes.</div><a name="09031951000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
I do not want to unduly delay the Committee, I will just emphasise that
the new clause would improve the Bill. It is certainly not destructive,
although frankly, it does not sit terribly easily in the convoluted
structure set out in the Bill, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was so critical of a few moments ago.
However, it at least goes some way towards improving the prospects of
achieving the ambitions that the Government have rightly identified as
essential to re-equip Britain with the skills it needs. Apprenticeships
matter too much for us fail to deal with funding, support for small
businesses, and the importance of group training associations and the
STEM and high-tech industries. We have tabled the new clause for all of
those reasons, and I am delighted to propose it on behalf of
my  hon.
Friends.</div><a name="09031951000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000614"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I shall speak briefly to the amendment and the
new clause as we still have a lot of ground to make up this afternoon.
I have no difficulty supporting amendment 107, which states that the
chief executive should be responsive to employers&#146; needs,
however, it would be extraordinary if the chief executive was
unresponsive to their needs. Although, as we established in the
discussion on the previous clause, that person will be directly
accountable to Ministers and so directly responsive to their targets
and requirements, it is useful to make clear that the chief
executive&#146;s primary purpose is to be responsive to
employers&#146; needs, rather than to Government targets. Perhaps,
that was the intention behind the amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div><a name="09031951000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have general
sympathy with new clause 8 because it is similar to our proposals in
our policy review. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
has been charged by his leader with reviewing his party&#146;s skills
policy and has already waved his document around. I performed a similar
function for my party. I do not have a document with me to wave
around&#151;I have left it in the office&#151;but I know that the
ministerial Front Bench read it avidly and are, no doubt, sending
circulars out to their colleagues in the country with lines of
criticism.</div>
<a name="09031951000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">All three
parties want to encourage more people to be attracted by apprenticeship
training and for more employers to offer such opportunities. However,
employers need more of an incentive to create them and that is what
lies behind the new clause. In our own deliberations we identified a
pot of money, rather than a target, to create a number of new
apprenticeship places. That would come from the growth in the Train to
Gain budget over the next period, which is a little over &#163;500
million. Rather than being left in the Train to Gain provisions, it
should be specifically directed to paying the off-the-job training
costs of apprentices in order to incentivise employers to offer those
opportunities.</div><a name="09031951000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) of the new clause, which encourages the setting up of group
training associations, is broadly similar to my new clause 13, which
also states that the National Apprenticeship Service should encourage
the setting up of group training associations. That is a new clause
that I know has the enthusiastic support&#151;I am sure this will
gladden you, Mr. Chope&#151;of the FSB. I look forward to
hearing words of encouragement from the
Government.</div><a name="09031951000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000615"></a>The
Chairman:</b> New clause 13, however good the hon. Gentleman
thinks it is, has not been selected for debate, so I hope that he is
not going to debate it.</div>
<a name="09031951000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000616"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I assure you, Mr. Chope, that that
was the end of my remarks on my own new clause. It was not selected,
mysteriously, for debate, but it is broadly similar. That was the point
that I was making to subsection 3 of new clause 8, which has been
selected for debate and we are discussing that.</div>
<a name="09031951000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I was
about to say was that I look forward to hearing from the Minister when
he replies that the Government certainly will expect the NAS and the
chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency to encourage the setting
up of group training associations in various parts of the country, so
that small businesses and communities where apprenticeships are at a
low state, as referred to by the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings, are
encouraged.</div><a name="09031951000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000617"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> As we have heard, the intention of amendment 107
is to require the chief executive of Skills Funding to take account of
employers&#146; needs in delivering the apprenticeship programme. We
agree that employers&#146; needs are fundamental and that is why we
now have 130,000 participating employers. Of course, the apprenticeship
scheme is a demand-led programme and, if we do not take account of
employers&#146; needs, they will not participate; there would be no
supply and no programme, so their needs are fundamental.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div><a name="09031951000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief
executive of the National Apprenticeship Service will report regularly
to the Secretary of State on apprenticeships, and we will want to hold
that person to account on employer involvement. Sector skills councils
play, and will continue to play, a crucial and vital role in ensuring
that employers&#146; needs are fully reflected in apprenticeship
provision. Therefore, the amendment is not necessary and I ask the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="09031951000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
tempting to say that new clause 8 is slightly fanciful, given that the
hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) was unable to provide
the assurance, on Second Reading, that he had managed to secure the
protections to his budget that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath
(Michael Gove) has to his budget. Therefore, all the talk about
apprenticeships from the Conservatives is not going to come to
anything. However, I will focus on new clause 8.</div>
<a name="09031951000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(1) of the new clause would require the chief executive of Skills
Funding to fund directly employers who take on apprentices, with the
funding provided in one lump sum at the beginning of the apprenticeship
framework and a further sum paid on completion. Funding for the
delivery of an apprenticeship framework is paid to who is actually
delivering the training, which may be the employer or an external
training provider. A proportion of the apprenticeship funding is paid
on enrolment to the apprenticeship framework, with a further payment on
successful completion.</div>
<a name="09031951000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) would put a bonus scheme into statute for small and medium-sized
businesses to be paid once apprentices have completed a recognised
framework. Payment to training providers, at 25 per cent. on completion
of an apprenticeship, already acts as such an incentive. However, we
think that it is right to direct that to the training provider. While I
understand that the intention might be to incentivise employers to take
on apprentices, a blanket subsidy of that kind runs the risk of being a
dead-weight cost where we would have to fund things that have already
been incentivised by the current incentive system. We therefore think
that the suggestion is fundamentally
flawed.</div><a name="09031951000482"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="09031951000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind subsection (3) appears to be to guarantee the ongoing
role of group training associations in delivering apprenticeship
training. I reassure the Committee that the Government are strongly
committed to group training associations. The &#147;New
Opportunities&#148; White Paper, which was published this year, set
out new plans for a fund to establish or expand group training
associations and similar consortiums, and we expect the National
Apprenticeship Service to announce a prospectus for a &#163;7 million
funding stream by the end of next month. Given that we are already
committed to group training associations, which have the same standing
as any training provider, new clause 8 would not improve their
position.</div><a name="09031951000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I understand the aims of much of the new clause, the right funding
arrangements to maximise employer participation and engagement are
already in place. To accept the new clause would mean a spending
commitment that I certainly cannot make&#151;it is interesting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings thinks that he
can&#151;so it should not be pressed to a
Division.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000618"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b><b class="B"> </b>When the time comes, we will certainly press
for a Division on new clause 8. On the Minister&#146;s response, make
no mistake that paying employers up front, with the final payment being
made on completion of the full framework so that completion rates are
secured, would make a massive difference to employer engagement in
apprenticeships. I am absolutely certain that, had the opportunity to
obtain an apprenticeship bonus and take on apprentices arisen when I
was a small business man in a growing company and industry that was
recruiting staff, it would have influenced the company&#146;s
recruitment and training policies. I believe that that is true of
companies the length and breadth of Britain, so I completely disagree
with the Minister about how money should be
directed.</div><a name="09031951000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
share the view of most representatives of businesses and industry, the
Innovation, Universities and Skills Committee and the Economic Affairs
Committee, which is that paying employers directly would create a more
straightforward system that would be more attractive to employers, more
transparent and much easier to market, which matters as much as
anything in engaging new companies. It is extraordinary for the
Minister to speak of dead-weight cost, given that the dead-weight cost
of Train to Gain is so profound. Even the Government had to acknowledge
during the pilot stage that it was a significant difficulty, not to
mention the brokerage service associated with that appalling
policy.</div><a name="09031951000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000619"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman is assiduous in quoting the CBI
in support of his arguments. Employer satisfaction with Train to Gain
is high: 92 per cent. are happy with the training course content and
the provider that delivered it; 30 per cent. of people who completed a
Train to Gain course got promoted the following year; and 43 per cent.
got a pay rise. Furthermore, the CBI recently
stated:</div><a name="09031951000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Train
to Gain is exactly the product we need at this time.&#148;</div>
<a name="09031951000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that evidence,
why does he not support the
policy?</div><a name="09031951000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000620"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> In the same survey, most employers reported that
the benefit that they gained from Train to Gain was much less
impressive than the Minister would have us believe; they said that it
had little value. In addition, although I accept what he says about the
CBI, there have been profound criticisms of Train to Gain from other
employer organisations. Indeed, in his evidence to the Committee, John
Lucas
said:</div><a name="09031951000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is fair to say that if funding, financial incentives and financial
support for employers were equalised across the whole apprenticeship
programme, both pre-19 apprenticeships and post-19 adult
apprenticeships, employers would be
happier.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 12,
Q25.]</div><a name="09031951000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
the precise position of the Opposition; we should equalise funding
between so-called adult and other
apprenticeships.</div><a name="09031951000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
as most employers want the money paid direct, most people know that
Train to Gain suffers from three things: a dead-weight cost; the
confusion between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>assessment and real training; and immense cost-ineffectiveness. We could
use that money much more wisely if it were redirected to the
apprenticeship programme, as advocated in the paper that I mentioned.
That would allow us to create 100,000 new apprenticeships. The
Government do not support that objective, but it would engender the
support of employers and potential
learners.</div><a name="09031951000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not say more, because the document speaks for itself. I have
briefly outlined it, and the whole House knows of our commitment to
skills and, in particular, to apprenticeships. However, even if the
analysis and recommendations in the document did not exist, frankly we
could not support a Bill that puts into place such a structure, even
with the best will in the world&#151;and good will seems to be the
basis on which Ministers were recommending the Bill to the House. Just
last week a Minister said that good will was a fundamental element in
the Bill&#146;s genesis and likely delivery. Frankly, good will is
something that we try to practise and preach at Christmas, but it is
crackers to base legislation on it. Legislation should be based on a
proper analysis of what is happening, and on a set of plans that can
deliver an improvement in the status
quo.</div><a name="09031951000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
shall not build an apprenticeship programme around a convoluted,
confused structure that is unlikely to be understood by learners, is
likely to bemuse employers and will certainly not incentivise small and
medium-sized enterprises to get more involved in the apprenticeship
programme. For that reason, we shall press new clause 8 to a vote when
the time comes, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000623"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I shall endeavour to be brief, concise and to the
point, because I am looking forward to precise clarification from the
Minister. The amendments and two new clauses are interconnected and
attempt to get clarification on the situation with regard to people
with learning difficulties. There are many opportunities in the
proposed apprenticeship programme, and we need to get things right for
people with
disabilities.</div><a name="09031951000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
229 is intended to give recognition to the importance of
apprenticeships in supporting disabled people to bridge the gap between
education and the labour market. Apprenticeships are important in
supporting disabled people to gain qualifications, workplace experience
and skills. Both employers and employees gain valuable experience and
skills in understanding disability and breaking down
barriers.</div><a name="09031951000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Royal
National Institute of Blind People research indicates that 92 per cent.
of employers would find it difficult or impossible to employ a blind or
partially sighted person, which just shows that, given the
Bill&#146;s high objectives, it will not be easy to tackle the issue,
although it will be necessary to do so. The proposed extra duty in
amendment 229 would enable the chief executive of Skills Funding to
tackle the problem. I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
response to the simple proposal of adding the requirement that the
chief executive takes on board the need to support fully people with
learning
difficulties.</div><a name="09031951000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
230 is fairly straightforward and should involve the straightforward
matter of the Minister telling me that the proposal will be introduced.
It would ensure that people with disabilities have access to the
information that they need. He will be aware that I have been involved
in trying to improve access to textbooks for people with sight
impairment, and it is very difficult to ensure full accessibility. The
amendment, therefore, focuses on learners with some form of
print-related disability&#151;blind and partially sighted people, and
all who find it difficult to access material in written or electronic
forms. We ask 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 475</div>for a properly designed website that conforms with web content
accessibility guidelines, an accessible print format, such as large
print, giant print or Braille, an audio format or an easy-to-read
format. The amendment would mean that the chief executive has to ensure
that all information on apprenticeships, whether from the NAS, the
national portal, or from an employer&#146;s advertisement, was
accessible to disabled would-be apprentices.</div>
<a name="09031951000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">On new clause
10, we established last week that the chief executive will have a duty
to those with learning difficulties, and that learning difficulties was
an all-encompassing term. A learning difficulty or a physical
disability might create issues with accessing the training under
discussion. As I understand the situation, the chief executive has a
duty to those with learning difficulties in respect of disabled
learners aged 19 to 25. The chief executive must also have due regard
for those over 16 with a statement of special educational needs.
However, those aged 16 to 18 years old who do not have a statement may
not have one for all sorts of reasons: they may not have been assessed
at school; they may have failed to get a statement; or they might have
developed a learning disability, such as sight loss,  aged 17.
I am therefore concerned that the Bill might not cover those people, so
I am looking for a clear answer, because that could represent a
significant oversight, and disabled apprentices in that age group must
be given the same support that we welcome the Bill giving to their
statemented or post-19 peers.</div>
<a name="09031951000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
few further points to clarify, and they are relevant to all the
amendments. The Learning and Skills Council was a statutory body and
had a disability equality duty, but there is general concern about
whether the Skills Funding Agency will have that specific duty. It is
quite difficult to work through that issue, given the body&#146;s
formation and its location within the new structure, but we need an
assurance that the new and complicated structure that is proposed will
deal with that
duty.</div>
<a name="09031951000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="09031951000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
employer-led programmes and special educational needs provision
obviously have to be of concern to agencies representing those with
learning disabilities. We drafted new clause 11 to find out how the
duties towards those with learning difficulties will be met while the
apprentice is in the workplace. It can be difficult to perform such
duties in the classroom, but it is even more important to do so in the
workplace and support will be critical and valuable. We should also be
interested to know how the Government intend to join up SEN provision
access to work provision. There are several probing aspects within the
string of amendments and new clauses, and I hope that we can receive
clarification because they are important for many people within the age
groups under
discussion.</div><a name="09031951000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000624"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> As the hon. Lady said, the amendments and new
clauses are important. They highlight the value of involving those with
learning difficulties between the ages of 16 and 18 in opportunities
that we want for other citizens. In principle, we are extremely
supportive of legislation to improve the chances of disabled learners
and those with learning difficulties. All learners must be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>given the chance to make the best of their aptitudes, interests and
skills and, only by their doing that, can we build the just and
cohesive society that we
seek.</div><a name="09031951000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
a couple of issues need to be dealt with. There is a debate about which
apprenticeship schemes would in practical terms be available to
different learners. It would certainly not be true that all apprentice
schemes would be suitable for all sorts of learners. Those with
particular learning difficulties or disabilities might find some
apprenticeships either impossible or undesirable. I want to test the
hon. Lady and the Minister on such
matters.</div><a name="09031951000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 10 would move disabled students aged 16 to 18 to the aegis of
the SFA. Is that necessarily the best thing? Perhaps the new clause
would not do that.</div>
<a name="09031951000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000625"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I am sorry, but I did not hear the first part of
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentence. Will he repeat
it?</div><a name="09031951000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000626"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000627"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Lady said that she did not hear what you
said.</div><a name="09031951000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000628"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. To prevent the debate being a dialogue of
the deaf, can everyone speak
up?</div><a name="09031951000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000629"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I shall broadcast my sentiments rather more
powerfully.</div><a name="09031951000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 10 explicitly moves disabled students between the ages of 16 and
18 to the aegis of the SFA. Would that always be in their best
interests or might it, perversely, occasionally limit opportunities for
them? That could be an unintended consequence of the change.</div>
<a name="09031951000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is some
concern about what is entailed in having regard to the needs of a
person with a
disability</div><a name="09031951000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which
prevents or hinders the person from making use of facilities of a kind
generally provided by institutions providing
education&#148;.</div><a name="09031951000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole or the Minister make it
clear how that would work in practice? A balance needs to be struck
between opening opportunities and creating the impression that we
provide all kinds of services and openings, which could not practically
be delivered. Notwithstanding all that, I understand why the amendments
have been tabled and  I am extremely sympathetic to them in
principle.</div><a name="09031951000306"></a>

widely available to people with the kind of challenges that the hon.

delivery.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 477</div><a name="09031951000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000632"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I understand and support the sentiment behind the
amendment. We believe firmly in maximising opportunities for people
with learning difficulties to take up apprenticeship training, but we
consider the amendment to be unnecessary as the Bill already builds on
existing legislation to ensure that the needs of people with learning
difficulties are met. We have made a number of provisions in the Bill.
Clause 80 confers on the chief executive of Skills Funding the power to
secure the provision of suitable apprenticeship training for people
aged 19 to 24 who are subject to a learning difficulty assessment.
These are the same people for whom a local education authority must
ensure that enough suitable education and training facilities are
provided under the duty contained in proposed new section 15ZA of the
Education Act 1996, inserted by clause 40. There is also a general duty
in clause 111 on the chief executive of Skills Funding</div>
<a name="09031951000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to have regard
to the needs of persons with learning difficulties&#148;
</div><a name="09031951000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">when
exercising his or her functions. That would cover adults over the age
of 18.</div>
<a name="09031951000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
230, I can assure the hon. Lady that the vacancy matching service will
be accessible to people with disabilities and has been set up according
to approved guidelines for accessibility for disabled people. That
covers those who are partially sighted and have reading difficulties
because of visual impairment whom she mentioned and whose cause she
champions in the House. The vacancy matching service will provide the
opportunity for learners with difficulties and disabilities to raise
anything they will require for an interview so that they have the
opportunity to be fully supported. There will be additional support
where, for example, disabled people are not being successful in their
applications. I can also confirm that the Disability Discrimination Act
2005 amends the 1995 Act to introduce a statutory duty on public
authorities, which would include Skills Funding and the National
Apprenticeship Service, to promote equality of opportunity for disabled
people.</div><a name="09031951000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000633"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The NAS will be focused on all types of learners.
What specific expertise is it likely to have in respect of disabled
learners? Where will disabled learners get advice if they are not in
touch with Connexions?  I am thinking of younger people here.
What specific facility will there be to provide them with the necessary
support, advice and guidance that they might need to embark on the
courses of training that are an implicit part of the
Bill?</div><a name="09031951000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000634"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The sort of expertise that the NAS would have
would be that which migrates from the current LSC. The numbers of
learners in the FE system, for example, declaring learning difficulties
and/or disabilities is 618,000. Some expertise will transfer to local
authorities, and there are the duties of co-operation between the chief
executive of Skills Funding&#151;and through him the delegated
person, who would be the chief executive of the NAS&#151;and local
authorities. Through local authorities, young people would get advice
from Connexions, and, when they reach the relevant age, they would get
advice from the Adult Advancement and Careers
Service.</div>
<a name="09031951000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000635"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Given that Skill, the institute for disabled
students, has highlighted its concerns about the quality of information
advice, it is not incredibly convincing to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column478" />Column number: 478</div>say that we will simply pull across the existing skills of the Learning
and Skills Council. If the organisation that represents the interests
of disabled students is worried about what services are provided,
surely we should think about how we can enhance and improve those
services. For example, would it be possible to mission the NAS to take
on additional skills to deal with that? Perhaps there could be a
section within the organisation aimed at such learners. This is a
specialist area that requires the right kind of people and the right
quality of advice.</div>
<a name="09031951000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000636"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> It is certainly our intention to work with
organisations such as Skill, which provide a powerful voice for the
interests of those individuals and ensure that we have the right
capacity and skills to deal with that important group of vulnerable
learners within the NAS. We have also introduced the information,
advice and guidance standard for local authorities, which we discussed
when we debated the Education and Skills Bill last year. The
implementation of that is an important aspect of improving the overall
quality of the IAG available through local authorities and Connexions.
The fact that we introduced that standard and have more to say on
information, advice and guidance this year, is an implicit recognition
that we can do more to raise the quality of information, advice and
guidance. One aspect of that will be to ensure that the advice and
guidance that we have for this group of people is as good as
possible.</div>
<a name="09031951000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 10
would replicate provisions in clause 111 that relate to 16
to 18-year-olds, by placing a duty on the chief executive
to</div><a name="09031951000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
regard to the needs of persons with learning
difficulties&#148;</div><a name="09031951000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">when
exercising functions. It is essentially a replication, and I urge the
hon. Lady not to press the clause.</div>
<a name="09031951000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on
new clause 11, I assure the Committee that access to work is being
expanded. When creating further apprenticeship places, employers are
made aware of their obligations to make reasonable adjustments to
accommodate those with a learning difficulty, and they are advised of
support on which they may draw. The Disability Discrimination Act 2005
also places duties on employers. Most aspiring apprentices with a
learning difficulty will have their support needs identified and met
during the recruitment process, prior to commencing an apprenticeship.
We do not believe that the amendment would strengthen that
provision.</div>
<a name="09031951000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000637"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Let me return to new clause 10&#151;I apologise,
but the Minister was in full swing. I am aware that clause 111 covers
many of the points, including that about picking up on the definition.
However, the concern was that there is a gap in relation to 16 to
18-year-olds who do not have a statement at that point. I do not
believe that the Minister has addressed
that.</div>
<a name="09031951000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000638"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I think we addressed that point when we discussed
part 2 regarding assessments for LLDD. The debate and discussions that
we had on clause 40 were relevant to that, as are sections 13 and 13A
of the Education Act 1996. The combination of those things addresses
the point raised by the hon. Lady on new clause 10. I urge that the
amendment be withdrawn.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column479" />Column number: 479</div><a name="09031951000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000639"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister for his replies. I feel
reassured about the accessibility of information on amendment 229. The
amendment was perhaps the icing on the cake, but it was useful for
clarification and the Minister had a lot to say about people with
learning difficulties being protected and supported within the
workplace. I am not convinced about new clause 10, and the gap
regarding 16 to 18-year-olds. If necessary, I shall return to that
matter at a later date. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000642"></a>Mr.

with such alacrity that we come to  clause 81 and amendments
204 and 205, which stand in my name and those of my hon.
Friends.</div><a name="09031951000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes set out that the responsibility for a range of
apprenticeships is delegated to the chief executive officer of the NAS,
who then organises matters with local education authorities. We want to
make it absolutely clear that we are stout defenders of local
government. I served for many years on Nottinghamshire county council;
for most of that time, I was the shadow chairman of education. Once
again, I pay tribute to the councillors across the country of all
political parties who give such sterling service to their localities,
through their work in local government.</div>
<a name="09031951000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
are simply not convinced that local authorities have a significant role
to play in the way that is envisaged by the Bill. I have previously
argued that incorporation of FE colleges gave them a new lease of life.
They look ahead to the days when they come under the
influence&#151;indeed, one might say within the power&#151;of local
government with some scepticism, and that is an understatement, given
what some college principals have said to
me.</div><a name="09031951000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
204 is a simple one. It would replace &#147;local education
authorities&#148; with &#147;employers&#148; and education
providers. There is a real gap in the Bill on the role of employers,
which has been established through our consideration of it. Employers
are not given the weight that we need to give them to make the
ambitions that lie at the heart of this Bill a reality. The amendment
is straightforward.</div>

204 attempts to alleviate those concerns by ensuring that the NAS works

under the age of 19. I think the hon. Gentleman referred to the dead
hand of local authority control. As a former county councillor, albeit
in the post-college incorporation period&#151;I was elected in
1993&#151;I do not think that local authorities are a dead-hand part
of our government structure. Good local authorities can be enabling
authorities, which will work in concert with employers. I think that
that is the better way forward, rather than deleting their role
entirely.</div><a name="09031951000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000644"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> While the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings described himself as a stout defender, and was working on his
stoutness over lunch, I was at the Local Government Association at a
meeting with councillors, to whose work I pay
tribute.</div><a name="09031951000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the sentiment behind the amendments. It is, of course,
essential that the chief executive of the SFA, through the NAS,
consults employers and training providers, both about the volume of
apprenticeship places that they are able to offer and about how to
stimulate demand for apprenticeships among young people&#151;indeed,
in clause 82, there is some mention of the work that the SFA will carry
out with employers.</div>
<a name="09031951000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NAS will
also work closely with employers and providers to increase the number
of apprenticeships on offer. I can provide a categorical assurance to
the Committee that that will happen. Relationships with employers and
training providers are critical if we are to ensure that the
apprenticeship scheme is implemented effectively. However, the
amendment would undermine the relationship between the NAS, which will
be acting on behalf of the chief executive of the SFA, and local
authorities. That relationship is central to the successful operation
of the apprenticeship scheme. Removing that duty to co-operate would
mean that there is no link between local authorities&#146; role in
the provision of 16-to-19 learning places and the NAS&#146;s role in
securing a sufficient supply of apprenticeship 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div>places to meet demand. Without that linkage, the apprenticeship scheme
cannot be implemented effectively. I think that the hon. Gentleman
believes that we cannot have a good relationship between the NAS and
local authorities, between the NAS and employers, and between local
authorities and employers, but I believe that that circle can be
squared.</div>
<a name="09031951000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
principle underpinning the 16-to-19 planning process is that local
authorities will plan and commission provision across the full range of
post-16 options available to young people, and that funding should
follow learner choices. Planning by local authorities must therefore
reflect, as closely as possible, the choices that young people are
likely to make, and the trends in their choices about what, where and
when they want to learn. We are committed to ensuring that
apprenticeships are rooted as a high-quality, mainstream education and
training route for young people, fully integrated in the common
application process and the 14-to-19 prospectus. The relationship
between local authorities and the NAS is critical to ensuring that that
situation comes about. It is for that reason that I hope that the
amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="09031951000341"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000645"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The problem with the response of the hon. Member
for Bristol, West is that it is dependent on an assumption that local
authorities should be involved in these matters in the way that he
articulates and is embodied in the Bill. We acknowledge that local
authorities have a critical role in economic development&#151;indeed,
they have a statutory role. As he will know, unitary and county
authorities and districts have a statutory economic development
function. So of course it is appropriate that they are a
stakeholder&#151;a player&#151;and that they are involved in all
kinds of discussions, consultations and negotiations with the other
agencies responsible for economic development, either directly or
indirectly.</div><a name="09031951000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
giving local authorities a funding and management role&#151;a direct
role in the creation and delivery of the training regime that the
Government have set out in the Bill&#151;seems to be yet another
example of making something that should be straightforward complex. If
the Government faced up to the prospect of a deregulated system, with
all its virtues&#151;a system of free-standing, self-managed further
education colleges, funded and managed by a slim funding agency, which
would obviously, in the end, be directly under Ministers, with, of
course, appropriate checks and balances to ensure the quality of
education and probity&#151;we would not need such a complicated piece
of legislation, with all the features that the Bill contains. Local
authority involvement is another part in that immensely complex
machine.</div><a name="09031951000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000646"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> In a vain attempt to persuade the hon. Gentleman
of my case, I remind him of what the much-quoted CBI representative,
Richard Wainer, said in a reply to him in evidence:</div>
<a name="09031951000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
members are primarily concerned about ensuring that they get a
good-quality apprenticeship programme, so as long as local authorities
adequately consult and work with local employers in ensuring that they
are putting on the sort of apprenticeship programmes that are in
demand, I think that our members will be generally
happy.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000647"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The comments that the Minister quoted were made by
someone who will be obliged to work with the system and who will make
the best of what the Government provide. Employers, by their nature,
will work with the prevailing system. Mr. Wainer, the CBI
spokesman, made that clear. Whether employers would choose such a
system is an entirely different matter. The employers, FE college
principals and others in the sector to whom I speak seek a simpler
system, in which we have none of the opacity of the funding regime that
the Minister is proposing, none of the obtuse organisational structure
and none of the obscure systems for reporting and
accountability.</div><a name="09031951000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
said earlier that if the proposals were represented pictorially, we
would have a mixture of Pollock and Heath Robinson. I am inclined to
think that there would be a bit of Warhol in there as well. At least
Heath Robinson&#146;s drawings have a certain symmetry; I suspect
that the Bill lacks that. Although I understand that local authorities
have an important role to play because of the statutory
responsibilities that I described&#151;of course, if the system was
working properly, we would want to draw on their expertise&#151;I do
not think that Connexions should be based in them, that they should
have a funding and management role in FE colleges, or that they should
play a key statutory or management role in apprenticeships. It is as
simple as that. If that directly contradicts the Minister&#146;s
view, so be it.</div>
<a name="09031951000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that

Government amendments 410 to
412.</div><a name="09031951000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000664"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The purpose of these Government amendments is to
extend the apprenticeship scheme so that an apprenticeship place will
be made available to all suitably qualified care leavers up to the age
of 25. This is a commitment that was made in the &#147;New
Opportunities: Fair chances for the future&#148; White Paper, which
was published earlier this year. It is our intention that the
apprenticeship scheme for care leavers will work in exactly the same
way as it will for 16 to 18-year-olds. That means that care leavers
will have to meet the same minimum entry
criteria.</div>
<a name="09031951000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000665"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> We are broadly supportive of the amendment, which
seeks to ensure that care leavers to whom a local authority in England
owes certain duties will be able to apply for apprenticeships. We have
three questions. First, does the Minister have any idea what the
&#147;sufficient&#148; number of apprenticeship places the SFA must
secure is? What is defined as being suitable? How many care leavers
over the age of 19 are in apprenticeships at present? Perhaps because
those are too easy, I have a couple of supplementary questions. At what
point or age are the local authorities to stop having those duties to a
care leaver? Finally, does the amendment, more mischievously, not show
some of the weaknesses in Government policy in terms of encouraging
access dweller
apprenticeships?</div><a name="09031951000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000666"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Having heard the Minister&#146;s introduction
to these amendments, it certainly sounds as if this is something that
we would welcome as well. I look forward to hearing the replies to the
questions from the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings. The
educational outcome of people who have been in care needs an awful lot
of attention by the Government, and any encouragement to get young
people who have had a difficult emotional and educational experience
into an apprenticeship, would be welcomed.</div>
<a name="09031951000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000667"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We anticipate that the number of care leavers
covered by the extension will be relatively small. About 6,000 young
people are entitled to leaving care support from local authorities each
year, so there are about 30,000 16 to 21-year-olds in touch with the
local authority leaving care services per annum, of which no more than
30 per cent. are estimated to be aged 19 to 25. Not all are able or
would want to follow an apprenticeship pathway. On the assumption that
around 500 care leavers aged 19-plus opted to take an apprenticeship
per annum, the annual cost would be in the region of &#163;2 million.
That is the basis upon which we made the change of policy, in order to
offer the entitlement to this group of relatively vulnerable young
adults. The suitability would be the same as for 16 to 18-year-olds. As
far as I understand it, we do not collect the information about how
many apprentices between the ages of 19 and 25 are care leavers. That
is why I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the information requested, but
I hope that that is
sufficient.</div><a name="09031951000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000668"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I also asked at what point or age the local
authority stops owing such duties to care leavers. I shall add a point
that I have been cogitating upon as the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>Minister has been speaking. There are parallels with our earlier
discussions about young people in secure accommodation. Continuity of
options, in terms of skilling and education, the need to transfer
information and the issue about where such people might reside all seem
to be relevant. Has the Minister any thoughts on those
subjects?</div><a name="09031951000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000669"></a>Mr.
Knight:</b> I have thoughts on all sorts of subjects that I
could share with the Committee, but in the interests of efficiency, I
will reserve my thoughts on whether we should extend this to young
offenders until such time as we might add a suitable
amendment.</div>
<a name="09031951000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question on when the local authority
stops owing duties to care leavers, I understand that it is at age 21.
When the amendment to the Education and Skills Act 2008 is commenced,
it will be up to the age of
25.</div><a name="09031951000376"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000670"></a>Stephen

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000671"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000672"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Clause 83 is a key clause because it places a
duty on the chief executive of Skills Funding to provide for choice in
apprenticeship places for 16 to 18-year-olds. First, the young person
is able to nominate at least two choices of sectors into which they
wish to enter an apprenticeship. Following our discussions on clause
35, I hope that, after provision of sufficient information, advice and
guidance, people will be exercising radically different choices to
those that exist at the moment. It is an important duty to make sure
that there are enough vehicle maintenance places and apprenticeships
for young women who wish to go into them, for instance. They also have
the ability to nominate the level at which they seek to
enter&#151;level 2 or advanced&#151;and the apprenticeship place
should be within a suitable travel-to-work
area.</div><a name="09031951000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
those matters are challenging in themselves for this new duty, but of
course we are discussing the Bill against the background of a
recession. One part of the triangular relationship that we have
mentioned several times during the debate&#151;the
employer&#151;may actually be missing. For a layman, that is
essential to the characteristics of the definition of an apprentice.
Amendment 114 seeks to put in some protection for a young person who
has already entered into an apprenticeship agreement but whose employer
then fails and goes out of business because of the difficult economic
circumstances that we are in at the moment. Would there then be a duty
on the chief executive of Skills Funding or the NAS to make sure that
that young  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>person&#146;s interests were protected so that they could continue
with their apprenticeship, given that their employer has ceased to be
in
business?</div><a name="09031951000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
115 largely covers the same area. What if a suitable employer is not
available? Suppose someone has chosen a particular sector for which
they are well qualified&#151;they have received the good advice and
guidance that says that they are well qualified to enter into a
particular apprenticeship&#151;but a suitable match cannot be made
with an employer within a reasonable travel-to-work distance of their
home? How will the choice of that young person then be met? It comes
back to previous discussions that we have had on the role of group
training associations. Both the amendments seek yet another assurance
from the Government Front Bench&#151;as we have had in respect of
previous clauses&#151;that the Bill will be flexible enough to
encourage the setting up of group training arrangements once it is
enacted. Particularly when an employer is missing, will college-led
group training arrangements be encouraged by the Government, so that at
least somebody can commence their formal training requirements of the
apprenticeship with the college while a search for a suitable
employment match is carried out? That is the broad purpose behind
amendment 115. If an employer failed completely and another could not
be immediately identified to pick up the formal employment part of the
apprenticeship, could the college fulfil that role, albeit
temporarily?</div><a name="09031951000383"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000673"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to make a lot of sense, as
do the amendments. GTAs are particularly important in areas where there
is a poor history of training for apprenticeships. They can galvanise
the diet for training and the appetite for apprenticeships. I mentioned
the different number of apprenticeships across the country and picked
on Greenwich, but there is an embarrassment of riches there compared
with Hackney or Hammersmith.</div>
<a name="09031951000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000674"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. As
we discussed on previous clauses, group training arrangements have an
important role to play to bring together small employers who may not be
able to provide all the support necessary to take on an apprentice by
themselves, but several small employers could work together to fulfil
the employment aspect of an apprentice&#146;s training. These
amendments deal with the complete absence of a suitable employer, and I
am hoping that the Government will confirm that a college-led group
training arrangement would be a suitable vehicle for an apprenticeship
place, so that the expectations of the apprentice can be
met.</div>
<a name="09031951000385"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000675"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I understand the sentiment behind the amendments.
It is only right that an apprentice whose apprenticeship agreement is
prematurely brought to an end by an employer for a legitimate business
reason, such as redundancy, should be assisted to find an alternative
place. We have systems in place through initiatives such as the
construction clearing house, and the work of Connexions and training
providers, to find redundant apprentices alternative places. That is
particularly important given the current economic situation.</div>
<a name="09031951000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
strengthen those systems&#151;involving local authorities,
Connexions, training providers, sector skills councils and the National
Apprenticeship Service&#151;to maximise the opportunities for
redundant apprentices 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>to find alternative places. The online apprenticeships vacancy matching
service has a potentially important role to play. However, an employer
may have withdrawn the apprenticeship agreement because of an
apprentice&#146;s poor performance. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment is attractive if one assumes that the only reason for the
apprentice&#146;s employment contract to cease would be the
employer&#146;s economic problems. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the
other side of the coin and appreciates that there might be a poor
performance problem with an apprentice, he will understand why I am
going to ask him to withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="09031951000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such an
instance we do not consider that the chief executive of Skills Funding
should have a duty to find an alternative apprenticeship place. The
most effective means of dealing practicably and meaningfully with that
situation is through other systems, rather than amending the
legislation in the way proposed. Equally, I understand the concern that
there may be insufficient employer places to enable every young person
who wants one to take up an apprenticeship. However, the way to address
that is to implement a range of policies to encourage employers to take
on more apprentices, such as reducing bureaucracy, expanding group
training associations, and establishing, among a host of other
measures, the National Apprenticeship Service, which will have
end-to-end responsibility for the
programme.</div><a name="09031951000388"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000677"></a>Jim

a new name clearly to designate the new reformed route. As such, while
understanding the motivation behind this amendment, we do not believe
that this is the most effective means of achieving what we all want
which is more apprenticeship places. I hope the hon. Gentleman will be

his Department and DIUS are going to undertake once this legislation is
passed. I accept that there may be

employment contract of an under-performing apprentice. That was not the
scenario envisaged by my amendments or what I had to say to them. I

again, Mr. Chope, our changeover is not taking place at
quite the point in the Bill that we imagined, so I will be brief. This
particular amendment is obviously again looking at boundaries of
sub-regional groupings on which we have already had some discussion.
Local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 488</div>authorities, in the Bill, will directly fund and commission education
which takes place in sixth-form colleges. There will be approximately
43 sub-regional groups of local authorities and they will be
commissioning 16 to 19 education and training which takes place in
further education colleges, although the funding as, we know, comes
directly from the local authority. There is a concern that further
education colleges will have to respond to at least two funding
bodies&#151;a point that we made the other day&#151;their local
authority and the Skills Funding Agency. An additional division of
areas for the purposes of determining suitability of apprenticeship
places is potentially going to add to confusion and bureaucracy, where
we have splits across the sub-regions and two layers, so we have a
horizontal and a vertical split in terms of these different agencies.
We believe that in the interests of simplicity divisions made for the
purposes of apprenticeships should align with the already determined
sub-regional
groupings.</div><a name="09031951000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000680"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The apprenticeship scheme is a key element of our
plans to ensure that an apprenticeship place is made available for
every suitably qualified young person who wants one. How we define a
reasonable travel area is clearly an important part of the
apprenticeship scheme, and one that we are determined to get right.
That is why I understand the motivation behind the amendment, and share
the view that there needs to be a linkage between these reasonable
travel areas and the sub-regional groupings, which are an important
part of our 14-19 planning
processes.</div><a name="09031951000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
starting point in defining reasonable travel areas has been to use
travel-to-work areas as defined by the Office for National Statistics.
As apprenticeships involve a relationship with employers it is only
right that we use travel-to-work areas as the basis in the first
instance. We are mindful, however, of the need to take a practical
common-sense approach. The definition of a reasonable travel area needs
to be flexible enough to cover a variety of situations. There may be
circumstances in which it is entirely appropriate for the reasonable
travel areas to align with boundaries defined in local authority
sub-regional groupings, which are based on travel-to-learn patterns,
but there may also be situations in which reasonable travel areas mean
that young people living near the boundaries of a sub-regional grouping
can easily travel across those boundaries to take up apprenticeship
opportunities. Previously in our debates the hon. Lady talked about
Brockenhurst college, which would be on the boundaries of such
groupings. Using legislation to link reasonable travel areas with
sub-regional groupings might therefore have the unintended consequence
of reducing learner choice. For that reason, and as this is an
operational matter, there is no need to further specify the detail of
how the process will work in legislation, and I encourage the hon. Lady
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09031951000403"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000685"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I said that things are never simple, and on cue the
Minister jumped up to show that that is the
case.</div><a name="09031951000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
89 gives the Secretary of State the power to suspend an apprenticeship
scheme in a specified geographical area in relation to particular
apprenticeship sectors or a particular level for up to two years. That
would allow the duty to secure suitable apprenticeship places to be
suspended when economic difficulties or other circumstances were so
severe that that duty could not be fulfilled. The amendment is designed
to ascertain exactly why apprenticeship schemes would have to be
suspended in certain areas or certain sectors during economic hardship.
It is now clear that the country is moving to a state of significant
economic hardship, by any measure. The clause enables the Secretary of
State to suspend apprenticeship schemes at such times, and as a result
it has many worrying aspects. It is particularly worrying that training
and skills education could be discontinued during hardship, when, as
many reports have argued, it should be used as an exit route. The
recent report by the Institute of Directors makes it clear that during
downturns it is important to continue to invest in skills and training.
The failure to do so in past recessions has both lengthened and
deepened them. It is a particular concern that the clause facilitates
that
approach.</div><a name="09031951000414"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000686"></a>The

his comments, I apologise, but I would be grateful if he addressed his

<a name="09031951000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will move

is with legislation, so it is with
amendments.</div><a name="09031951000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
207 suggests that the elements of clause 89 that I have outlined should
only be effected after consultation with representatives of employers
and providers from the sector. This is another case of us seeking to
ensure that employers are fully involved in both the theory and the
practice of the Bill. I anticipate, and I will welcome, the
Minister&#146;s agreement with that sentiment when he rises to say
that the Government intend to accept the

of employers and
providers&#148;</div><a name="09031951000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">before
the regulations that would suspend an apprenticeship scheme can be
laid. I remind him and other members of the Committee that the guidance
in the code of practice on consultations is that the period for formal
consultation should normally last for at least 12 weeks. Also, any
failure to comply with formal consultation requirements could lead to a
judicial review challenge to any decision to suspend the apprenticeship
scheme, and to the invalidation an order to
suspend.</div><a name="09031951000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000693"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> For the benefit of the Committee, will the Minister
describe the circumstances in which a scheme would be suspended,
specifically, not
generally?</div><a name="09031951000425"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000694"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The experience in last outbreak of foot and mouth
disease was that it entails considerable disruption to certain sectors
in rural areas, for example. It might be appropriate in specific
sectors in specific geographical areas to suspend a scheme because of
the difficulty of access to
it.</div><a name="09031951000426"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000695"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031951000696"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I have no comment to make about that. I reassure
the Committee that the decision to suspend the scheme will not be taken
lightly; we would need evidence that it is impossible to fulfil the
duty to secure the places. In determining whether the suspension of the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>scheme is necessary, we will take account of the views of employer and
training provider representatives, among
others.</div><a name="09031951000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the amendment would restrict flexibility by imposing an additional and
potentially lengthy formal step in the process before a change can be

withdraw it.</div>
