<H4><center>Limitations on rights of appeal under section 45</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): The clause sets out limitations on rights of appeal under section 45. There will be no right of appeal under the Bill. As in earlier legislation, those whom we have decided to deport on the grounds that it would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``conducive to the public good as being in the interests of national security or of the relations between the United Kingdom and any other country or for other reasons of a political nature''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will still have no right of appeal against a refusal to revoke a deportation order when
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State has certified that the appellant's exclusion from the United Kingdom would be conducive to the public good''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or when the Secretary of State personally refuses to revoke the order on that ground.
<P>
As before, there will be an equivalent right of appeal to a Special Immigration Appeals Commission. Hon. Members will know that the matter was discussed at some length in recent proceedings in the House and in the other place when new legislation was passed on a Special Immigration Appeals Commission. An appeal against a refusal to revoke a deportation order will still not be exercisable in the United Kingdom, but clauses 47 and 51 will allow an in-country right of appeal solely on grounds of the European convention on human rights or on asylum grounds in some circumstances.
<P>
Finally, clause 46 sets out the restriction in the Immigration Act 1971, which prevents a person who is being deported as a family member from disputing statements about family relationships made to secure his entry or stay here.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 577, in page 30, line 2, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`immigration officer or the Secretary of State' and insert `authority'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following:
<P>
Government amendment No. 578
<P>
Amendment No. 272, in page 30, line 5, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless that decision was mandatory under immigration rules'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 579 to 584
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Bill provides that a person may appeal to an adjudicator when he alleges that a decision of an immigration officer or the Secretary of State was in breach of his human rights regarding his entitlement to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. As members of the Committee have already heard, the Home Secretary and I have stated on many occasions that the Government are fully committed to ensuring and maintaining a strong human rights policy.
<P>
The clause, however, does not achieve that in the way that we would wish. The purpose of our amendments is to widen the circumstances in which a right of appeal would exist when a breach of human rights is alleged. The purpose of amendments Nos. 577, 579, 581, 583 and 584 is to extend the right of appeal on ECHR grounds to decisions taken by an entry clearance officer as well as those of an immigration officer and the Secretary of State. That would cover the circumstances when an entry clearance officer refuses to grant an entry clearance and the person refused alleges that the refusal is in breach of article 8 of ECHR&#151;the right to respect for private and family life. The right to appeal against the refusal of an entry clearance on human rights grounds will be exercisable only from abroad.
<P>
I have to admit to some surprise about amendment No. 272. The clause introduces a right of appeal where a breach of the applicant's human rights is alleged. An appeal on such grounds will exist for all applicants, including those who apply when they do not have valid leave to remain. The clause aims to comply with our obligations under ECHR and with the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
Amendment No. 272 would deny the right of appeal on human rights grounds, when the refusal is mandatory under the immigration rule. As a firm believer in immigration control, I can see the logic of the amendment. However, I am also a firm believer in human rights and as a member of the Government who incorporated the ECHR into domestic law, I believe that the right of appeal in cases in which a breach of human rights is involved should apply even when the refusal is mandatory under the immigration rules. That is because it is conceivable that a rule might be at variance with the ECHR. The Human Rights Act 1998 provides for precisely such challenges.
<P>
Therefore, it is right that an alleged breach of human rights should be regarded as more important than what some might argue is&#151;in terms of the whole area of human rights&#151;a technicality of the immigration rules. Indeed, a mere technicality could result in such a situation. I therefore ask the Committee members to reject the amendment.
<P>
The purpose of Government amendments Nos. 578 and 580 is straightforward and I ask Committee members to accept them. As debate on earlier amendments made clear, the Government are determined to safeguard human rights in the same way that we are determined to meet our international obligations and to have firm immigration control. We need to get the balance right.
<P>
As everyone knows, the Bill concerns immigration and asylum. We wish to ensure an appropriate right of appeal when a breach of human rights is alleged in relation to leave to enter or remain and the refusal of entry clearance.
<P>
In its present form, clause 47(1) contains the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relating to that person's entitlement to enter or remain in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could be widely interpreted. For example, it could be taken to apply to decisions by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate on British citizenship or by the UK Passport Agency on British passports.
<P>
Government amendment No. 578 makes clear that the right of appeal under clause 47 relates to decisions under the immigration Acts; that is, decisions on leave to enter, leave to remain and refusal of entry clearance.
<P>
Government amendment No. 580 is straightforward and is consequential on the amendments that we have just discussed and agreed. As orginally drafted, clause 47(2) refers to ``a person'' acting
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in breach of another's human rights''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 579 replaces ``person'' with ``authority''. As a result, subsection 2 does not make grammatical or practical sense, and the purpose of Government amendment No. 580 is to put that right.
<P>
I invite the Committee to reject amendment No. 272 and accept the Government amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison (Hertsmere):</B> We come to clause 47, which gives someone a right of appeal on the grounds of a breach of human rights. I listened to what the Minister said about amendment No. 272. However, it is important to investigate how far a new right of appeal will extend.
<P>
Clause 47 states that the right of appeal exists in relation to any decision taken by the Secretary of State or an immigration officer. As the Government themselves say, they are streamlining rights of appeal elsewhere in the Bill. However, we are interested in how the new right of appeal extends appeal rights to people who hitherto may not have had such rights.
<P>
I do not want to go back over old ground. However, we have already raised that matter in our debate on clause 6, when we said that the Government were taking away what many regarded as important rights of appeal from overstayers who were in breach of conditions. The Government made great play of the fact that, by doing so, they were streamlining rights of appeal and making everything faster and more efficient. However, they neglected to tell us that they were creating a new right of appeal which would be available to all those from whom the old right of appeal had been removed.
<P>
Therefore, as we pointed out, instead of people being dealt with under existing deportation proceedings, the new right of appeal created new legal proceedings and new work for the appellate courts. People were simply moving from one queue to another and getting on a sort of legal merry-go-round. However, I wish to make progress, so I will not go over that ground again, as we established that that would happen.
<P>
Amendment No. 272 explores another area in which the new right of appeal may be important and relates to decisions by the Secretary of State that are mandatory under immigration rules. The amendment was designed as a probing amendment. However, I have already received a response from the Minister, so I will briefly say what I wanted to probe.
<P>
As the Committee knows, some decisions under the immigration rules are mandatory. Section 11 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 makes provision for mandatory refusals. In such cases, there is no right of appeal for people who do not meet a requirement of the rules or who do not have a document specified under the rules when they apply for leave to enter or entry clearance. As a result, there is a mandatory refusal for such people.
<P>
Will those people for whom refusal is now mandatory be given a right of appeal under clause 47? Given the Minister's earlier remarks, I think that the answer to that is ``yes''. That being so, will the Minister give an estimate of how many cases involving mandatory refusal there are under section 11 of the 1993 Act? How many people for whom refusal is currently mandatory will be eligible to have a right of appeal? I do not expect the Minister to have that information at his fingertips, but perhaps he can give an estimate later.
<P>
Let me raise another matter to determine how far the right of appeal extends. I genuinely do not know the answer; it is an investigative question, rather than a rhetorical one. How will the measure work in relation to cases in which the adjudicator makes a decision? For example, let us consider someone who applies for leave as a visitor and then applies for an extension of stay as a student. That extension is refused, so the person appeals to an adjudicator, only to have that appeal refused. As the Minister knows, there is a law on what the adjudicator may take into account.
<P>
Does someone in such a scenario have the right of appeal under the provisions? I would genuinely like to know the answer to that question. I think that the answer is ``no'', but the Bill does not contain anything saying why such a person should not have such a right of appeal. Indeed, such a person would seek to come within the ambit of clause 47 by alleging that a decision taken by an immigration officer or the Secretary of State had affected their human rights.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked how many people will have the right of appeal under the provisions, but the matter does not quite work like that, as not everyone against whom such a decision is made will be in a position to exercise a right of appeal. Obviously, making such an appeal depends on whether there are good grounds for an ECHR appeal. Therefore, such matters are restricted to cases in which an ECHR issue arises. So there will be a right of appeal, but making such an appeal depends on whether the individual can find grounds to raise a particular point. Such a person has to make clear the ECHR grounds for the appeal.
<P>
We do not know how many people will be able to raise appeals on such grounds. No doubt, that will become clearer as the courts consider how the convention operates in English law and&#151;in due course&#151;Scottish law. The grounds on which people can exercise their right of appeal may be quite broad initially, as the courts will have to set out a system of precedents and considerations. However, such grounds will become clearer and what initially appears to be quite a broad right of appeal will become much more specific.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In a sense, he is asking me to predict how the courts will interpret various provisions of the ECHR. As a lawyer, he is in as good a position as I am to know the difficulties of doing that. He than asks me to predict further, after the courts have formed a view, the implications for people who may or may not be able to establish grounds on which to make an appeal. It becomes quite difficult. There is quite a large potential field, but in practice, in the long term, I suspect that there will not be a large variety of grounds on which there is likely to be an appeal under the ECHR on these provisions.
<P>
To some extent, it is a matter of seeing how the courts deal with the ECHR once it is fully incorporated in our domestic law. In any appeal ECHR grounds would have to be argued, so the appeal against the refusal of a student extension would be the point at which the ECHR ground would be raised. If the hon. Gentleman is asking me whether a person would have one appeal, followed by an entirely different appeal so that the process could be dragged out, I can tell him that it is not envisaged that it will operate in that way. Any argument relating to ECHR would be argued at the initial appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> What is there to stop people alleging an ECHR point after their cases have been determined? The Minister may say that the right time is earlier on when they are arguing the first point supporting their application for an extension of their stay.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The legislation is attempting to create a one-stop appeal at which all relevant issues will be raised. We will come in due course to provisions dealing with how that will operate. When someone makes an appeal, the Secretary of State can serve on him a form which obliges him to set out any grounds on which he may seek to remain in the UK, and that includes ECHR grounds. Moreover, clause 55(6) enables the Secretary of State to stop a late appeal which is an abuse of the process. There are provisions to stop abuses of the process, but there are also provisions enabling people to bring forward any points that they may wish to raise during an appeal at the appropriate time.
<P>
If there is clearly an abuse of the process, the Secretary of State can seek to stop people raising an ECHR point later by using the provisions in the Bill. However, they could then challenge the Secretary of State's decision and seek to question whether it was appropriate. I cannot guarantee that we can stop the courts considering judicial reviews and claims under the Human Rights Act 1998, but we are attempting to create a mechanism whereby all appeal issues can be determined at one stop so that this and any other issue relating to the right of appeal can be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Which provisions can the Secretary of State use to stop such an appeal?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 55(6) enables the Secretary of State to stop a late appeal which is an abuse of the process.
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I have entered the fray rather late in the day. Perhaps I can explain why. Like other hon. Members who are involved with economic policy, I am struggling with a Select Committee and its sub-committees, two other Standing Committees and a Special Select Committee and, on the principle of division of labour, I have had to give them priority. I apologise to you and to the Committee, Mrs. Roe. I meant no discourtesy. My other reason for not being here is that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) has given an extremely self-sufficient and able preferment of our case, so I was happy to leave it to him.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's statement to the extent to which I understood it, but I should be grateful if he would clarify one point. The hon. Gentleman's comments appeared to render unnecessary the amendment that we tabled with regard to entry officers overseas. We were anxious that sponsors in the United Kingdom should be able to pursue potential human rights abuses in the same way that they can with an immigration officer and with the Secretary of State. The Minister's statement appeared to imply that they would be covered in the same way, which seemed to meet the substance of our amendment. Perhaps he will confirm that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard (Walthamstow):</B> I want to raise a couple of brief points with my hon. Friend the Minister.
<P>
I understand the difficulty that he has with stating precisely how clause 6(1) of the Bill will apply as we are entering new ground. As the Human Rights Act 1998 comes into force, there will be new grounds for appeal. We do not know in advance how courts or adjudicators will interpret the legislation. There may well be some settling down and some case law to be developed.
<P>
I am fairly clear in my mind about the relationship with the one-stop appeal that the Minister mentioned: that people who have rights of appeal under the Act will, under the one-stop appeal procedures, be expected to explain in their statement any human rights grounds that they wish to be taken into account. Clause 56(6)&#151;I recall that the Minister referred to clause 55(6)&#151;gives the power to refuse to hear an appeal if the Secretary of State certifies that its only purpose is to delay removal from this country. I am less clear about the relationship between the Minister's comments on the amendment and clause 6 of the Bill. There appears to be clear potential in clause 47&#151;under the procedures that the Minister outlined and especially because of the amendment, which widens the scope&#151;for people subject to removal under clause 6 to be able to apply to appeal under the human rights provision. I have difficulty understanding the relationship between that and clause 56(6).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that there are amendments for discussion later to which clause 6 will apply. The hon. Gentleman may wish to make those points later. He is not keeping to the amendment now before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I take your point, Mrs. Roe, but the later amendment concerns the coming into force of, and relationship with, clause 6, which will not come into force until this clause is already in force. I am more concerned about amendment No. 577, which widens the scope of the clause to cover entry clearance officers overseas. It takes out the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``immigration officer or the Secretary of State''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and inserts the word ``authority''.
<P>
I am not entirely clear about the relationship between that and decisions that might be taken under clause 6. It could be argued that the clause is not a decision about entitlement to enter or remain because there might be people who have no entitlement to enter or remain. People who overstay have no valid entitlement. I am interested in how far the amendment relates to the earlier parts of the Bill, and whether its widening effect will take in people who would otherwise have no right of appeal under clause 6. I should like to know how that would work.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There are two provisions under which a person may apply to have an ECHR breach of human rights dealt with&#151;the Bill and, in due course, the Human Rights Act 1998. Clause 6 enables a person bringing an appeal to have certain issues raised with the Secretary of State although there would be no formal right of appeal on the subsequent decision. I have already covered that point.
<P>
However, we are examining decisions to remove or deport which relate to a person's entitlement to have leave to remain in the United Kingdom. Therefore under the Bill, if an ECHR point arises, it may well be subject to appeal. Effectively, I can say yes to the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard). An illegal entrant or overstayer will be able to rely on clause 47. Clause 48(3) refers to clause 47, where my hon. Friend will find answers to his questions about enabling issues to be raised under the ECHR charter.
<P>
In answer to some of the questions raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, limitation on appeals is covered by new clause 21, which allows the Secretary of State to certify that an ECHR claim brought after an appeal has been finally determined is an abuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is the new clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes, it is. There will then be no appeal, but there could be a judicial review. However, that would not be an appeal. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether I can guarantee that people who abuse the system will not be able to do so by use of judicial review, I have to tell him that I cannot&#151;and he would be as reluctant as we are in the broadest sense to constrain the courts' operation of judicial review.
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) asked about sponsors. They are not directly the subject of immigration decisions, but may have a remedy under the general provisions of the Human Rights Act. So the Bill will not necessarily protect them, but the Act may&#151;I say ``may'' rather than ``will''. In practice, the interests of applicant and sponsor are likely to coincide, so if an applicant had a right of appeal under the ECHR, I suspect that the sponsor's interests would coincide with that and the issue could be dealt with during the applicant's appeal. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether a sponsor could use the provision if there were a breach of his human rights, the answer is no. However, that does not constrain a sponsor from using grounds that he may well have under the Human Rights Act. In practice, the interests of applicant and sponsor are likely to coincide. Therefore, the issue is unlikely to arise, but the provisions are there in case it does.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a short, but useful debate. I said that I wondered what there was in the Bill to prevent someone in the situation I described from appealing. I have not yet looked at all the new clauses to see whether something will be there. It was an issue about which I was genuinely curious.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about mandatory refusals, but he was in danger of confusing having the right of appeal with having good grounds of appeal. At present, refusal is mandatory. There is no question of any grounds of appeal. However, as the Minister has conceded, the provision opens up a right of appeal for someone in whose case refusal is at present mandatory. He may or may not have good grounds of appeal. People often think that they have good grounds of appeal when they have not. The courts have experience of the ingenious ways in which people have brought their cases into the framework of the ECHR.
<P>
The Minister is now having to concede that people for whom refusal is mandatory under section 11 of the 1993 Act, because they do not have the right documents and do not fulfil the right requirements, will have a new right of appeal. That being so, and I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to answer this now, how many people receive mandatory refusals under section 11 or other sections where that is applicable? An estimate would give us some idea of the extent of the new right of appeal that is being created.
<P>
It is always good to talk about new rights of appeal, but they create new work for adjudicators and immigration appeal tribunals who are already overstretched and it makes other queues longer. Let us have an idea of how much extra work the provision will entail. It may not be much; I just do not know. On the other point, the Minister concedes that people who were in one appeal queue in the past are being moved into another. That may create more work for the lawyers.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an estimate of the numbers in this category off the top of my head, but I shall certainly write to him with a figure. An appeal against a mandatory decision under a rule quite obviously could not open up the merits of refusal. It could only challenge the compatibility of the rule itself with the ECHR&#151;an issue that would be established on the first appeal. The hon. Gentleman makes claims for the provision which go far beyond what it does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Our understanding is the same on that. That was the point I was making.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We therefore have a broadly similar view. Once the courts begin to consider these issues, as we know in respect of the provisions of the Human Rights Act, they will have to develop a body of jurisprudence relating to immigration law and associated issues such as asylum. That will doubtless become very extensive and will affect people's ability to find grounds on which to appeal.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman quite rightly distinguishes between having the possibility of mounting an appeal and having grounds to do so. In order to mount an appeal, a person will have to show that he at least has some tangible ground to stand on. In due course, the courts will identify which grounds are acceptable and which are not and the position will become much clearer. Indeed, when the courts start making initial decisions quite quickly some of those grounds will be constrained and others will be opened up. It is therefore difficult to equate numbers of people who are refused the application on mandatory grounds with all those who claim that they have a right of appeal. In practice, many people will be unable to appeal because they do not have grounds on which to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to labour the point. The Committee will have gathered from the Minister's comments that the provision will create some new work for the courts and when he has written to me we will have an idea about just how much. I am not sure that the Government intended this. I think that it may have quite a few unintended consequences. There is a degree of confusion in the Government's plans for the appeal system. In order to make progress, I will not press the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 578, in page 30, line 3, after `decision' insert `under the Immigration Acts'.&#151;[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 273, in page 30, line 5, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) An appeal under subsection (1) above does not entitle a person to remain in the United Kingdom when they are not otherwise entitled to do so.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 277, in clause 48, page 30, line 32, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless he is appealing under section 47 or 51(4)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments are designed to explore the effect of the new right of appeal and to examine whether its exercise would enable a person to remain in the United Kingdom who would not otherwise be allowed to do so. We suspect that it would. There appears to be a clue pointing in that direction in clause 48.
<P>
We were told that illegal entrants would be dealt by removal. At present they have a right of appeal that can be exercised only once they are out of the United Kingdom. The rationale for that is presumably that if someone has entered illegally a right of appeal should not enable him to achieve his purpose and to remain in the UK. All Governments seem to have taken that view.
<P>
When we raised the question of long-term overstayers the Minister made great play of the way his provisions in clause 6 would deal effectively with clandestine and illegal entrants who, he told us at some length, cost the taxpayer a lot of money. He therefore moved overstayers from deportation to removal because he said that removal was more effective and he wanted people to be dealt with as quickly as possible.
<P>
At present an illegal entrant can appeal only after he has left the United Kingdom. Clause 48 (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This section does not entitle a person to appeal while he is in the United Kingdom unless he is appealing under section 47 or 51(4).''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Setting aside the question of the refugee convention in 51(4) which is already open to him, can the Minister confirm that this means that an illegal entrant who would otherwise be subject to directions for removal can appeal under clause 47 and thereby remain in the United Kingdom?
<P>
Will that apply whatever the circumstances of entry and does that not open up another avenue of appeal with the great attration that its exercise enables people to remain in the UK? In 1997 illegal entry papers were served on 14,300 people. Will not each one of those be able to exercise that appeal? I genuinely do not know the answers to those questions and I am looking for some clarification from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The combined effect of these amendments would be to deny an in-country right of appeal against removal from the United Kingdom where an applicant had claimed asylum or an alleged breach of human rights.
<P>
I would advise the Committee to think very seriously before contemplating this step. Under the 1951 convention, a person who claims asylum must have their claim properly considered before they are returned to a country where they fear persecution. Although the convention does not expressly require a right of appeal, it is generally accepted that a proper framework of appeals is needed in order to ensure that the safeguards in the convention operate effectively. 
<P>
Similar considerations apply to the ECHR. There might be exceptions to that principle. For example, there is a case for considering whether an in-country appeal is appropriate in relation to asylum or ECHR applications from nationals of European Union members states or from states that have met the democratic and human rights standards for joining the EU. I would wish to consider that further, but one would have to be sure that any development on those lines was consistent with our international obligations.
<P>
There is also a purely practical objection to the proposal in the amendments. Given what is at stake, and the likely reaction of the courts where there were no suspensive appeals, there would be many more applications for judicial review on matters that could more effectively and expeditiously be considered by adjudicators.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere is effectively arguing that people with legitimate human rights grounds under human rights legislation should have them considered not in an appeal but through judicial review. Unless the hon. Gentleman is proposing to circumscribe those rights by not accepting the jurisdiction of the courts in relation to judicial review, he is creating a difficult situation.
<P>
People might have a case under article 3 of the ECHR which raises similar issues about the protection of rights to asylum. It would be unlawful to remove such people in breach of article 3 claims. The hon. Gentleman makes too much of illegal entrants having a right of appeal under clause 47. If people did not have that right, the Human Rights Act would in any case provide an avenue of challenge to the courts by way of judicial review.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's argument is not entirely valid. He is effectively saying that the Human Rights Act might give rise to certain claims by illegal entrants who are subject to removal under the convention. Of course it might. We propose to deal with the problem by having a proper mechanism in place. The hon. Gentleman suggests that we should not have such a mechanism, but should rely on judicial review&#151;a far more complex, difficult and expensive process. The hon. Gentleman needs to be careful about the line that he is pursuing.
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that we are aware of the wide implications of the Human Rights Act, an important piece of legislation passed by the Government. It will have implications for immigration and asylum and for all those people resident in the United Kingdom who have rights under that Act and the ECHR. We therefore need to ensure that as the jurisprudence develops, we have mechanisms in place that will enable a sensible and proper response. We believe that the mechanisms in the Bill will achieve that, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment and, if he does not, I ask the Committee to reject it.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I seem to have touched a sensitive point for the Minister, but I was only probing and asking questions. The Minister's answer seems to be that there is something in what I am saying and that he will write to me about it later. I look forward to receiving the Minister's letter. It seems clear, however, that the answer to the question whether an illegal entrant will have a new right of appeal that would enable him to stay in the United Kingdom is yes, which runs against everything that the Minister told us in our earlier debates.
<P>
As I said, I look forward to receiving the Minister's answer and I can assure him that I was only probing to find out how many new rights of appeal the Government are creating in light of the fact that they have made great play of streamlining rights of appeal but seem to be clocking up one or two new ones. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 633, in page 30, line 5, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) If evidence which could materially affect that decision is produced to the adjudicator, but has not been produced to the immigration officer or the Secretary of State, the adjudicator may refer such evidence to him for reconsideration of his decision before proceeding with the appeal.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment to establish how the new appeal procedure will work, particularly regarding its assimilation of the provisions of the Human Rights Act. As the hon. Member for Walthamstow has already said, the appeal court will be one of the first opportunities fully to test out those provisions.
<P>
Our concern is that the appeal court will be considering not only basic human rights provisions but potentially a mass of new evidence and factual information, which could be investigated more appropriately by the Home Office before going before the appeal court. There is a danger that the appeal procedure will become the first course of appeal rather than the final determination of people's rights.
<P>
We tabled the amendment in order to clarify the procedure and establish the Government's thinking about how it will work. We need to avoid a process whereby an unnecessary amount of factual evidence and detail is being considered, which could be examined administratively first.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am a little concerned about the amendment. As part of our one-stop appeal procedure, we propose that applicants should be able to provide details of any compassionate factors, including ECHR matters, together with their grounds of appeal. In those circumstances, I am unsure what other evidence would necessarily need to be produced. The wording of the amendment would provide scope for endless argument and appeal about what constitutes material evidence. It is therefore a recipe for delay and a charter for those who would undermine the integrity of the asylum system.
<P>
It is open to an adjudicator at any time to adjourn an appeal to enable the Secretary of State to consider any fresh evidence. That right already exists. I doubt whether the hon. Gentleman's suggestions would do anything other than provide lawyers with the ability to raise all sorts of issues at different stages of the process, which could be referred back to immigration officers or the Secretary of State. The adjudicator is already able to deal with any new evidence and should be allowed to do so.
<P>
If an immigration officer takes an initial decision and new information subsequently arises, it can be put back to the immigration officer or the Secretary of State&#151;or, if there is not enough time, to the adjudicator. That is perfectly satisfactory and the normal way in which the courts proceed. The amendment suggests that matters have to be referred back for reconsideration before the appeal progresses.
<P>
I am curious to know whether any organisations are promoting this amendment: if so, I suspect that they be lawyers and that the amendment could well be a recipe for dragging matters out and earning lawyers a great deal of money. It is not, however, in the interests of justice and certainly not in the interest of expeditious justice.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> The Minister raised the wider issue of the one-stop principle, which most parties to discussion have largely welcomed. However, the Minister will know that some reservations have been expressed by not only immigration lawyers but the Immigration Advisory Service which, among others, was concerned about human rights and compassionate grounds being considered simultaneously. It is not merely a legal argument.
<P>
Our point is simple: where new evidence is available, the Home Secretary should examine it first. The Minister said that that would happen in many cases, but that it is a matter of timing. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure, wherever possible, that such examination happens before the matter comes to court.
<P>
Having registered my concern, I will not pursue the amendment further. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> Amendment No. 536 concerns a timing-related matter. As the hon. Member for Walthamstow said, a problem arises in relation to people removed under clause 6 and the loss of their in-country right of appeal. The Minister has already made clear that there will be an opportunity to invoke the Human Rights Act, but that will only be so once that Act comes into effect in autumn 2000. So there is a potential gap within which people deprived of the in-country right of appeal will not have access to the human rights appeal process.
<P>
We are anxious about how that gap is to be filled, as it will affect people with genuine human rights concerns and family obligations: that applies especially to longstayers. Under the Bill, such people will be forced to resort to judicial review, to direct approaches to the European courts and to other processes that we have already considered and judged unsatisfactory.
<P>
Amendment No. 536 seeks to ensure that deportations under clause 6 do not take place until the Human Rights Act is fully in effect. The amendment is a holding measure, designed to cover that gap or hiatus. It does not challenge the principle of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand the point of amendment No. 536. The argument is that there is a gap between clauses 6 and 47 coming into force which could unfairly put certain people at a disadvantage.
<P>
I am not sure whether such a point needs to be made in the Bill. However, as I have already said, I am willing to examine such matters, as it is worth scrutinising the transitional provisions for those groups of people who will lose appeal rights under the Bill. In that context, I am willing to consider whether there is any reason why clauses 6 and 47 should not come into force at the same time.
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) put his finger on a possible lacuna in the Bill and highlighted a potential difficulty in the Bill's progress. We will examine how best to address those matters.
<P>
At the moment, we see no reason why clause 47 should not come into force at the same time as the Human Rights Act. Similarly, we see no reason why the clause should not have a similar effect on sections 6 and 7 of that Act. Under those sections, proceedings could be brought against a public authority within a year of a decision being made. We will examine such matters.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting matter, which I will examine if he withdraws his amendment. Should he do so, I will write to him in due course, explaining how we intend to deal with the issue on Report should that be necessary. If, however, such action is unnecessary, I will explain why.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I thank the Minister for his helpful and gracious response. He has clearly registered the matter that I raised and the Government propose to address it. They will determine how best to do that: the matter may be incorporated in the Bill or it may be better to deal with it in another way. I am grateful, however, that my point has been acknowledged and will be acted on. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 634, in page 30, line 18, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) A person who alleges that an entry clearance officer has, in taking a decision relating to an application for entry clearance, acted in breach of his human rights may become a party to any appeal to an adjudicator or the Tribunal against that decision and the appeal may be allowed on that ground.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In view of our earlier exchange, it may not be necessary to pursue this matter very far. However, it may be useful to rehearse some reasons why problems arise. We are concerned about human rights abuse cases that may occur as a result of the actions of entry clearance officers in the countries of application and how they are dealt with.
<P>
Breaches of human rights legislation will occur in certain cases, but jurisdictional problems prevent such breaches being pursued in the countries where they occur. As Members of Parliament, we are all familiar with the problems that arise with entry clearance officers. Many problems encountered by our constituents and their relatives create inconvenience, cost and sometimes humiliation. However, in some cases, there is an invasion of privacy or serious breach of family ties that amounts to human rights abuse.
<P>
I feel strongly about such matters as, long before I became a Member of Parliament, I tried to manage immigration procedures for my many Indian in-laws and for my son's many east-European in-laws. I experienced difficulties in dealing with entry clearance officers, most of whom assumed that all their applicants were pathological liars trying to circumvent British procedures.
<P>
I therefore have a feel for the abuses that can occur as a result of excessive zeal. We are keen to build in a provision that would ensure that there is a mechanism by which lapses of human rights occurring as a result of the actions of entry clearance officers may be pursued through the appeal process.
<P>
As the Minister acknowledged, there may be cases in which the interests of the sponsor coincide with those of their relatives overseas. That will almost certainly be so when disruption of family life is involved. The amendment would introduce a provision whereby breaches of human rights originating in the behaviour of the entry clearance officer may be pursued.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In a sense, we have already rehearsed some of the arguments behind amendment No. 634.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns about the difficulties that he and his family have had with entry clearance. However, let me speak in defence of entry clearance officers by saying that, in many ways, they have a thankless and extraordinarily difficult task. In my experience, most of them seek to perform that task to the best of their ability.
<P>
Having talked to those who deal with entry clearance officers, I have learned that their response tends to depend on whether they get what they want. Such people are usually grateful if they get what they want, and think that entry clearance officers are wonderful. However, people are sometimes unhappy, if entry clearance officers do not deliver what they want.
<P>
That is not to say that entry clearance officers always get matters right in relation to making the best judgment. That is one reason why an appeal system is necessary, ensuring that appeals are heard when appropriate.
<P>
I welcome the amendment. However, I must invite the Committee to reject it because there is a technical difficulty relating to the fact that there is no definition of an entry clearance officer in the Bill or the Immigration Act 1971. The role of the entry clearance officer is performed by different people at different grades and involves different roles in diplomatic posts overseas. ``Entry clearance officer'' is a term of common parlance, rather than a legal term.
<P>
However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we are tabling an amendment that will widen the scope of clause 47 to include decisions made by people who refuse entry clearance. The amendment will overcome the problems of definition that the hon. Gentleman mentioned and meet hon. Members' concerns. In a sense, I have dealt with the sponsor issue and the way in which a sponsor might be able to exercise claims under the Human Rights Act. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel disposed, at least for technical reasons, to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I appreciate the spirit of the Minister's reply&#151;that he accepts the sentiment underlying the amendment, that the problems are technical and that he will try to overcome them. That is a welcome step forward. I should add that I was in no sense trying to malign entry officers in general, however they are defined. I am well aware that most of them do a very conscientious job and that they operate to a difficult political mandate set in this country. Also, on the many occasions that I have had to write to the Minister about constituents' matters, they have often been pursued sympathetically. The issue behind the amendment concerns those cases where there is a serious legal problem; we have attempted with our amendments to ensure that the Government will devise means through which they can be pursued. I have the Minister's assurance that the Government will do their best on that, and I am grateful to him. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 47, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 48</center></H4>
<H4><center>Validity of directions for removal</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move Amendment No. 585, in page 30, line 20, leave out `under this Act'.
<P>
This is a drafting amendment whose purpose is to clarify that clause 48 applies to directions for removal given under the 1971 Act as well as to directions to be given under this legislation. The phrase ``under this Act'' inadvertently limits the scope of clause 48 to directions under the Bill when it is enacted. As subsection (1) (c), which refers to powers under schedule 2 of the 1971 Act, makes clear, we want clause 48 also to apply where directions are given under the 1971 Act. The amendment will achieve that by deleting the words ``under this Act''.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 537, in page 30, leave out line 23.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> No. 119, in page 30, line 32, after `47', insert `or subsection (2)(c)'.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> The Minister will be familiar with our concerns in this respect because they were debated on clause 6. This is an issue about which my party and many other people feel strongly&#151;the principle of people being administratively removed and deprived of in-country appeal despite the fact that some have been here for a long time. I understand that people who have in-merit appeals will not be able to pursue them for up to 10 years.
<P>
Another feature of clause 6 that especially worries us is the blurring of the distinction between people who clearly are illegal immigrants and have come here with the specific purpose of undermining immigration control and those who are in breach of entry conditions for technical reasons as much as any other factor. As the Minister was reminded, his party, when in opposition, was clear and unambiguous in its views on in-country appeals. In the White Paper, ``Fairer, Faster, and Firmer&#151;A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum'', which was published in July 1998, the Home Secretary made the clear statement that removing people before they appeal undermines justice. That is the essence of our concern about the clause and its ramifications. Essentially our amendments raise the matter again in the context of the clause and offer two possible routes through which its negative implications could be dealt with. Effectively, we want a return to the status quo and a reinstatement of the basic right of appeal in-country to people who have been here for seven years.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendments would extend the right of appeal against directions for removal for those categories of persons listed in clause 48(1)&#151;that is, illegal entrants, section 6 cases and crew members under the special powers conferred by schedule 2 of the 1971 Act. Amendments Nos. 117 to 119 would provide for full review of a case for illegal entrants and schedule 2 people, and an in-country right of appeal in all circumstances for those liable to review under section 6. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have in a sense already cantered over this ground a number of times so I shall not delay the Committee by rehearsing the argument.
<P>
Amendment No. 537, strangely, appears to remove entirely a right of appeal under clause 48 for section 6 cases. This seems odd in view of the express purpose of the other amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman. It is possible that the hon. Gentleman intends that right of appeal for section 6 cases that he proposed for clause 47 to cover all possible grounds for appeal. If so, I cannot agree with the analysis. Clause 48 gives the right of appeal against removal directions on the ground that in law there is no power to give directions. A right of appeal under clause 47 would not necessarily cover all the circumstances under which a person might wish to appeal on that ground. I cannot accept the amendment for that reason.
<P>
The principles and arguments already outlined by me during previous debates deal with the issues under clause 6. I will not detain the Committee by rehearsing them.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I will not detain the Committee by pursuing the matter, which we shall come back to because it involves an important issue of principle. We are concerned about the different mechanisms that could be employed to restore an in-country appeal.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The clause gives a right of appeal on the ground of objection to destination. This applies when a person who is being removed from the country objects to the destination to which he is being sent. Will the Minister tell me whether the right to object to destination conferred by clause 49 extends to the people under clause 6 of whom we talked a little earlier&#151;if I describe them as long-term overstayers the Minister will know who I mean&#151;who were subject to deportation, especially if they were here for more than seven years, and will be subject to removal in future?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The straight answer is yes, they will have a right to question their removal to a particular place. In practice, this right is not exercised on any great scale. We have been removing people for many years under the ordinary provisions; we do not propose the wide-scale use of provisions of this sort. We are not opening up an area where we expect much abuse, but some people take the view that they should not be returned to a particular country which might seem the obvious country to send them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was curious about that. Are they people who would be covered by the clause? Where will their right of objection to destination come from? It is a point of curiosity. The Minister will know my views about this and he has just described what the position was in the past. However, those people will be in a different position because they are not subject to deportation, but to removal. Will the clause give them a right of appeal against destination?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We do not think that this will confer new rights of appeal on overstayers. We would certainly be concerned if it did. I shall look at how the provision might operate over a longer time and I shall write to the hon. Gentleman. He has raised an interesting issue and I should like to be absolutely sure that we are not removing one mechanism and replacing it with another.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment will apply where someone who is appealing against a refusal of leave to enter objects to the country to which it is intended to remove him, and claims that he ought to be removed to a different country specified by him. In this case, he must be able to show that the country he has nominated has agreed to accept him. Otherwise, it would be possible for him to enjoy an appeal in relation to a destination when he knows full well that he cannot be removed to the country he has specified. The aim of this requirement is to prevent unscrupulous appellants from abusing the system, and prolonging their removal, by specifying a country which they know will not accept them. I invite the Committee to accept the amendment.

Amendment made: No. 54, in page 31, leave out line 27.&#151;[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The clause sets out a number of limitations on the rights of appeal under clause 49. A person will not be entitled to appeal against the destination specified in removal directions given following a refusal of leave to enter unless he is also appealing against the decision that he required leave to enter or he was refused leave at a time when he held a current entry clearance or work permit.
<P>
In addition, if a person is entitled to object to a country on an appeal under clause 49 and he does not object to it, or his objection is not upheld, then clause 49 does not entitle him to appeal against any directions subsequently given as a result of the refusal if their effect would be his removal to that country.
<P>
The clause also stipulates that someone who is claiming that he ought to be removed to a different country specified by him must be able to show that that country has agreed to accept him. Otherwise, it will be possible for him to enjoy an appeal in relation to a destination when he knows full well that he cannot be removed to the country he has specified.

This is the effect of amendment No. 590. However, we believe it is appropriate to make an exception in cases where a person is applying for leave on asylum grounds and, although not granted refugee status, is given limited leave for a period of more than 28 days. That is because of the special treatment afforded those granted asylum compared with those granted exceptional leave. For example, is that a person granted refugee status may be joined immediately by eligible family members.

Clause 52 as amended by Government amendment No. 597 precludes an appeal under clause 51(2A) where the reason for the person not being granted asylum is that article 1(F) of the refugee convention applies&#151;for example, if he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge&#151;and where the Secretary of State certifies that the disclosure of material on which the refusal is based is not in the interests of national security. In such case, the person's appeal will be to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. If SIAC disagrees with the Secretary of State's amendment that disclosure would not be in the interests of national security, then it can quash the certificate and remit it to the special adjudicator.
<P>
Amendment No. 594 is simply a drafting amendment and gives an abbreviation for the 1951 UN convention on the status of refugees. It does not alter the effect of clause 51 in any way. I invite the Committee to accept the amendments.

<P>
Government amendment No. 592, which the Committee agreed when we were debating clause 45, povides for a new right of appeal for a person against whom the Secretary of State has decided to make a deportation order following a recommendation by a court, under section 3(6) of the 1971 Act. Amendment No. 593 is a tidying amendment consequential upon the changes made by that amendment.
<P>
Because paragraph (a) of subsection (3) has been amended to cover deportation orders made under both section 3(5) and 3(6), the words

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 603 and 605.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Both amendments are tidying amendments giving relevant definitions in clause 135 which are of particular relevance to the clause. Amendment No. 603 inserts in clause 135 a definition of what is meant by a claim for asylum, except in relation to parts V and VI of the Bill, which have specific definitions for the purpose of those parts of the Bill. Amendment No. 605 inserts into clause 135 the clarification that the refugee convention refers to the convention relating to the status of refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and to the protocol to that convention.
<P>
I invite the Committee to accept these minor amendments, which do not substantially change the practical provisions of the law and are needed only to improve the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
I turn now to the debate on clause stand part with which the amendments are being considered. Britain has a longstanding tradition of giving protection to those fleeing persecution in other parts of the world. We will continue scrupulously to observe our international obligations in respect of those seeking asylum. Clause 51 maintains the longstanding rights of appeal by those who have claimed asylum.
<P>
Clause 51 also provides for a right of appeal against a refusal to grant asylum in cases where limited leave to enter or remain on other grounds has been granted. Although the general principle of the new system is that there will be no right of appeal against the refusal of an application that does not require the applicant to leave the United Kingdom, we have concluded that it would be right to make an exception in those circumstances given the significance of refugee status under the 1951 convention, which is recognised by the many signatory countries throughout the world, and the particular benefits associated with it. This is a point to which many respondents to our consultation exercise on appeals attached importance and I am pleased that it is to be incorporated into the Bill. I invite the Committee to agree that clause 51 should stand part of the Bill.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 599 and 600.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendments all clarify the drafting of the clause. Amendment No. 598 clarifies the meaning of ``those grounds'' by referring back to the specific grounds of the appeal in question. An appeal may not be brought on asylum grounds unless an asylum claim has actually been made. Amendment No. 599 ensures that an appeal may not be brought on asylum grounds other than under clause 51. It simply prevents an asylum appeal from being made under the Bill's provisions for non-asylum appeals, as is the current effect of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. Amendment No. 600 is a companion to amendment No. 599. The deleted provision now appears in clause 52.

I invite the Committee to accept these technical amendments.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 52 imposes a number of limitations on the rights of appeal set out under clause 51. They principally concern cases where leave to enter has been refused on the grounds that the appellant's exclusion from the United Kingdom would be in the interests of national security; or where a decision to make a deportation order&#151;or to refuse to revoke one&#151;was also made on grounds of national security. They also include cases where the Secretary of State himself&#151;and not someone acting under his authority&#151;has refused to revoke a deportation order. In all those instances, there is no entitlement to appeal under clause 51. However, there is a right of appeal to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission under section 2 of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1993.
<P>
One of the amendments that we proposed to the clause has the effect of restricting the right of appeal, set out in proposed subsection (2A) of clause 51, against a refusal to grant asylum but where limited leave to enter or remain has been given. A person who has been granted limited leave but refused asylum on the grounds that he falls under article 1(F) of the 1951 convention, which lists those categories of persons considered not to be deserving of protection, will not have a right of appeal where the Secretary of State certifies that the disclosure of material on which the refusal was based is not in the interests of national security. In such cases it will be SIAC that hears the appeal unless SIAC quashes the certificate and remits the matter to the ordinary appellate bodies.
<P>
Finally, clause 52 states that a claim for asylum must have been made before the time of the refusal to grant or vary leave, or the making of directions if the person wishes to appeal against the refusal on asylum grounds.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will support the clause.

In those circumstances, a person may appeal to a special adjudicator against a certificate, but not to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.

<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 555, in page 33, leave out lines 11 to 14.
<P>
I should like to deal with amendments Nos. 555 and 556 together because they cover&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall be calling them separately. We are now debating amendment No. 555.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> There is a considerable widening of the scope of the measure or perhaps a narrowing of the opportunities for in-country appeal. That is of concern to those involved in immigration law. There is a specific issue involving third countries. The Government were articulate and clear about this when in opposition. Perhaps I should remind the Minister of what the Home Secretary said about third country appeals. He said that Labour would restore the right of in-country appeals to those who have travelled through so-called safe countries.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The implication of this tightening of the appeals structure is that that is effectively being revoked. This is an issue on which quite a few Labour Members may wish to comment. It also raises issues that were very controversial under the previous Government, including the definition of safe countries, the so-called white list and the arbitrary process of deciding which countries are safe given their changing political conditions and the importance stressed by the Government when in opposition of looking at cases individually. There is also a legal point. How do subsections (2) and (3) interrelate, because subsection (2) appears to negate the effect of appeals under subsection (3)? The lawyers are at something of a loss as to why the clause is drafted in that way.
<P>
The amendments attempt to do two things. First we want to ensure that there is an opportunity for human rights-based appeals where third country cases are considered. The principle that human rights grounds are involved in third country cases has been accepted by the Home Office in its operational procedures. We are trying to ensure that that is properly embodied in the law. Secondly, we want to try to return to the pre-1996 position with appeals to ensure that third country cases can be heard in this country. There has been an acceptance in practice that there are grounds for appeal. We are trying to ensure that those rights are properly entrenched. The clause appears to widen considerably the scope of the withdrawal of in-country appeals and we would like to see it removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to go over old ground here. The hon. Member for Twickenham referred to the history of these matters and I do not want to strike postures now. Some who may have struck postures in the past are now having to eat their words. We shall allow them to do so in silence. The Government are doing the right thing. [Interruption.] It sounds as if they are enjoying eating their words. They are having to go back on commitment after commitment. Those words are all being eaten with great relish and a new gloss is being put on things.
<P>
We will support the Government where they are getting it right. In generally supporting the Government, who in this case are keeping in place what the previous Government did, we do from time to time question the fairness of some of the things that are done and the way they are done. I have made various points about overstayers and I hold no brief for such people. They are breaching immigration controls and we have to be mindful of that. However, we must compare their position with that of others and ask about fairness.
<P>
On Tuesday I asked why people who have committed serious criminal offences should get far more extensive rights of appeal than those who have led blameless lives but have overstayed? Why should overstayers be deprived of the right to object to a destination, when under the provisions we debated earlier people with criminal convictions who have only just arrived in the country have such a right? We need to look at this with a broadbrush but fair approach and without getting too bogged down in technicalities. For the meantime, having been reminded by the hon. Member for Twickenham about what has been said in the past, I will leave the Government to eat their words silently and with relish. I shall relish watching them.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not recall uttering any words that I need to eat. The hon. Gentleman will be waiting a long time for his relish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall remind him. Does he remember speaking at a conference which is referred to in the evidence submitted by, I think, the Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality? When he was asked whether section 8 would be repealed he said yes. However, I do not want to go over old ground again.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 54 is not section 8 of the 1996 Act. We have already had a debate on section 8. I have explained precisely how we have dealt with the issues arising there, but we are dealing with a different issue here and I should be curious to know whether the hon. Gentleman could identify any words that I need to eat in relation to this.
<P>
Subsections (2) and (3) provide that asylum seekers have no right of appeal in respect of matters arising from their removal from the UK and have no right of in-country appeal against a decision to transfer them to a member state or other designated safe third country while they remain in the UK. These subsections were designed to repeat the current effect of section 3 of the 1996 Act. We will be proposing an amendment shortly to add section 3 to schedule 14 on repeals. That is part of the reorganisation of the appeal provisions.
<P>
The amendment would delete the first of those subsections. Amendment No. 556, which is not part of the present group, would delete the second. Taken together they have the intended effect of reintroducing a suspensive right of appeal in third country asylum cases. The comments I make here apply equally to amendments Nos. 555 and 556. Unless the Committee considers that it would be helpful I do not propose to repeat these point when we consider amendment No. 556.
<P>
We have carefully considered the arguments for reintroducing suspensive appeals. It was a point made in a number of responses to the White Paper and indeed in the written submission from ILPA. However, we have decided against doing so. First, we do not believe that the suspensive appeals in these sorts of cases are necessary. We are satisfied that these states comply and will continue to comply with their international obligations in respect of the 1951 convention.
<P>
Secondly, the Dublin convention, under which the vast majority of third country returns are now effective, provides safeguards that did not exist at the time of the introduction of the 1996 Act. Applicants are now returned to member states only if the authorities there have accepted responsibility for considering their claim and where specific arrangements were made for their transfer.
<P>
The Dublin convention is based on the principle that asylum claims should be dealt with only once in the EU and that member states trust each other to consider these claims in accordance with the 1951 convention. We work closely with other member states on asylum issues and we have a good understanding of how their procedures work and we keep ourselves informed of developments.
<P>
There are and are always likely to be some differences in the way in which the 1951 convention is interpreted and applied as between member states. It does not follow however that that means that one state is right and one is wrong. It is properly a matter for individual signatory states to decide how to comply with the convention within their constitutional and legal frameworks, which may differ.
<P>
The courts have accepted that in returning asylum seekers to other member states we are entitled to consider that there is a margin of appreciation within which signatory states may operate the 1951 convention. Over the next few years we will see the standards of asylum procedures in other member states cemented in terms of binding minimum standards which will be adopted under the Amsterdam treaty. These measures will be enforceable in the European Court of Justice and will lead to a further narrowing of differences in interpretation of the 1951 convention between member states.
<P>
I do not believe that the objective of developing fairer, faster and firmer asylum procedures would be served by introducing any additional and unnecessary delay. ILPA pointed to the costs and inefficiency of challenges at judicial review in third country cases and suggested that there would be savings to the public purse if a suspensive right of appeal were reintroduced.
<P>
I simply do not believe that that is so. We would see just as many cases proceeding to judicial review. The nature of those cases involves comparisons&#151;which are often detailed&#151;between United Kingdom asylum systems and those in other states. However, there would be scope for raising new issues after appeal.
<P>
ILPA queried the drafting of clause 54(2). I confirm that we do not intend to remove the suspensive right of appeal in relation to states that are not member states or designated safe third countries. The suspensive right of appeal will remain in such cases.
<P>
ILPA and the IAS raised the matter of appeals on ECHR grounds in third-country cases. We are still examining that matter and may consider Government amendments on it in due course. It would be unfortunate if applicants whom we propose to remove on third-country grounds are able to delay their transfer by making unfounded allegations that their removal would be contrary to the ECHR.
<P>
I reiterate that judicial review challenges unnecessarily hinder the enforcement of decisions to return asylum seekers to other member states under the Dublin convention. We are still considering whether to introduce a legislative provision to deal with that problem and may table a Government amendment to the Bill. I therefore invite Committee members to reject the amendment.

<P>

<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): I should like to speak briefly on the amendment.
<P>
In their enthusiasm for speed, the Government sometimes run the risk of losing sight of matters relating to fairness. When the previous Government was in power, we debated at some length the removal of asylum-seekers to third-party countries. Even some EU countries whose standards of dealing with asylum seekers are&#151;broadly speaking&#151;similar to ours, have problems.
<P>
There have been a number of unfortunate cases in which Congolese and Zairian asylum seekers who have been sent back to France have found themselves right back in the Congo and Zaire, where they were subjected to physical threats as a result of the politics of the relationship between France and its former colonies. As has been demonstrated in the past, there are dangers in returning asylum seekers to EU countries where, for political or perhaps business reasons, asylum seekers' rights are not respected as they would be in Britain.
<P>
Those arguments were put forward when this issue was debated in Committee under the previous Government. I feel that I could not let the present debate go on without restating that issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand the points raised by my hon. Friend. The Amsterdam treaty will be part of the process of ensuring that member states change or come close to changing how they deal with 1951 convention cases and establish basic minimum standards so that, in future, the issues identified by my hon. Friend may give less cause for concern.
<P>
I accept my hon. Friend's point, which relates to an important matter. Since the 1996 Act was passed, there have been two third-country cases in which the courts have found against the Secretary of State. In one case involving Germany, the Court of Appeal considered that we had provided insufficient explanation of the statistical disparity in recognition rates relating to a particular nationality. In the other case, the divisional court was not persuaded that the French approach to persecution by non-state agents was within the scope of the 1951 convention.
<P>
I am confident that the former case is only a short-term barrier to transfers to Germany. However the latter case raises a more marked difference of approach between member states on interpretation of the convention. That is the point to which my hon. Friend alluded.
<P>
The Court of Appeal will give further consideration to that matter, so I do not need to go into detail on it now. I simply wish to say that the French approach is similar to that taken by some other member states and is consistent with the 1996 EU resolution on the harmonised definition of the term ``refugee''.
<P>
As a result of the Amsterdam treaty, we are now involved in a process through which member states will increasingly work together to ensure minimum acceptable standards. That will enable us to return third country cases to other EU countries without fear that those countries will fail to carry out the proper procedures for those who are returned.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Obviously, I do not conclude that every interpretation of the 1951 convention by every member state in respect of those who make initial applications within a particular country will be framed in a particular way, although I hope that minimum standards will, in due course, apply to all those cases. At least for cases that we return under the Dublin convention, other EU states will try to ensure&#151;under the Amsterdam treaty as well as the Dublin convention&#151;that 1951 convention standards are applied.
<P>
I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) that we have reflected on those matters. The concerns raised by her and other hon. Members about the wider context of the EU are being addressed at meetings between member states.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> Our brief exchange suggests that we are dealing with a politically sensitive area. I appreciate that the Minister has not done a 180 degree turn, but the Secretary of State certainly has&#151;as indeed has his predecessor. I also appreciate the intervention of the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington who raised some of the concerns that continue to exist among Labour Back Bench Members.
<P>
I should like to make two additional points. First, although the Minister is endeavouring to reassure us about the legal advances represented by the Dublin convention, it is clear that immigration legal practitioners do not accept that that provides adequate protection. As the Minister acknowledged, practitioners are convinced that there will be a considerable increase in recourse to judicial review.
<P>
Secondly, I welcome the tone of the Minister's reply to me and to the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington when he said that the Government are seeking to table amendments that might mitigate some of the consequences. I look forward to seeing them in due course. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In light of the debate on amendment No. 555, does the hon. Member still wish to move amendment No. 556.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> No.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 601, in page 33, line 16, leave out `or territory'.

<P>
The amendment is necessary for two reasons. It supports our application forms policy, which is intended to ensure that in circumstances where the forms are mandatory, applicants assist us in dealing with their cases promptly by providing the necessary information in the required form. It also ensures that a person who does not pursue his application properly should not benefit from a right of appeal if it is refused. No application form is required for asylum or human rights claims.

I invite the Committee to support the amendment.

Amendment agreed to.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 54 imposes limitations on certain appeal rights. It provides that while a certificate issued under section 2 of the 1996 Act remains in force, the person in respect of whom it was issued is not entitled to appeal in connection with matters arising before their removal. In addition, it removes an in-country right of appeal from those who are to be removed to a designated country. The clause also provides that no appeal may be made in relation to a decision made on an application if that application was required to be made&#151;but was not&#151;in a prescribed form.

<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> Most people who have examined the Bill regard the one-stop procedure as a positive development: it simplifies procedures, reduces legal costs and should potentially be fairer. However, some legal practitioners are worried about how it will operate and the amendment is intended to explore that matter further.
<P>
I should be grateful for clarification on some specific points. It is unclear why the Home Office is expected to make a decision on a claim before, rather than after, inviting the applicant to mention all the relevant facts. It is also unclear what will happen to an appeal while matters raised in a statement provided under clause 55(5) are being considered. It also seems that asylum claims are to be dealt with separately from the appeals process. I should be grateful for further clarification of how the one-stop process operates in those cases.
<P>
Another important issue was raised by the chief adjudicator when he gave oral evidence before the Special Standing Committee. He argued strongly that the Home Office should reply to points raised as a result of clause 55 before the matter comes before an adjudicator&#151;the issue of how to prevent the appeal process from becoming clogged up with matters that could better be dealt with earlier. Much time and effort could be wasted if new points were put forward after a refusal. How can that be prevented under the one-stop process?
<P>
If an appeal is to be comprehensive&#151;the purpose of the clause&#151;it should take all relevant factors into account. The decision should also be comprehensive, not just a combination of different decisions taken at different times. Under the amendment, the Secretary of State would notify someone making an appeal of his intention to refuse an application, so that the person could mobilise the various grounds that can be advanced&#151;human rights, asylum issues, compassionate cases&#151;and which could be considered together. A comprehensive refusal would then be served on the applicant, at which point he would have the right to appeal. The amendment would enable an applicant to mobilise a case comprehensively. That is the spirit of the one-stop provision and we are trying to make it more explicit.
<P>
Immigration lawyers would also like some clarification of the notice period for the appeal process and some reassurance that it will not be too short, because as the Minister knows, many of the issues are complex and sensitive and there is often a shortage of good advice.
<P>
The amendment raises a series of questions. It is not hostile but intended to clarify how the one-stop procedure will work, whether it will be fair as well as efficient, and whether it will truly be a one-stop process rather than a to-and-fro process that is inconsistent with the spirit of the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): I suspect that the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that the applicant will have grounds to appeal rather than to remain in the country in the first place&#151;a simple explanation. I hope that the Government will ensure that where circumstances change while an appeal is in progress, there will be an opportunity to take that into account. I cannot believe that in a case where an applicant on appeal says, ``I think that going back to the country that I might go back to is dangerous for me'' and the Home Office has reasonable grounds for thinking that it would not be dangerous but then circumstances in that country change&#151;there might be a coup or other major change&#151;the fact that that was not known when the grounds for appeal were given will exclude it from consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is an important subject. After listening to the attractively-put contribution from the hon. Member for Twickenham&#151;and to save time, because the hon. Gentleman enlarged in his probing amendments onto several issues addressed in my later amendments, and the Minister will respond to them&#151;I will make my comments now in the interests of progress.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) made a good point about circumstances involving changes in-country. A person's position can change in this country in the way that my hon. Friend described. A person might suddenly become associated with particular political opinions here or express an opinion which may alter his position in respect of his own country. The Minister owes the Committee an explanation following that worthwhile point from my hon. Friend.
<P>
As regards the one-stop shop generally, we have said that we support the objective and spirit of the idea, and that we would like the appeal system to be streamlined in so far as that is possible consistent with the interests of fairness, our international obligations and the general administration of justice. The key question in my mind is not whether the concept is right, because plainly it is, but whether the provisions will achieve a one-stop shop. I will return to this shortly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham made two points, one of which related to a person having to state his grounds for appeal. The Minister will have to address that point, which came up in evidence given to us by a number of organisations.
<P>
Our understanding of the way in which the system works is that when a person has a right of appeal on one ground, the Secretary of State will serve him with a notice requiring him to say whether he has additional grounds for wishing to stay in the United Kingdom. The person then has to serve on the Secretary of State a statement that sets out those grounds. If he wishes to make a claim on any of the grounds set out in clause 55(5)(c), he must include them in his statement or he may be deprived of certain rights in future.
<P>
It has been said that a person who is relying on those grounds should be asked whether he wants to do that in the notice served on him by the Secretary of State, otherwise he is being asked to state grounds in general terms and may be penalised for not mentioning particular grounds when he may not be aware that he should do so. That point was made during the evidence that we took by a witness who asked who on earth would know what the concessions were in a given case. The Minister will have to address that point. No doubt he will have an answer for us.
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham also adverted on another point the evidence that we received from His Honour Judge Dunn QC of the IAS. The Minister will no doubt want to respond to that important comment from an eminent authority. The purpose was to try to ensure that all matters can be dealt with simultaneously when an appeal goes before a tribunal. It is important that there are no outstanding issues that have not been fully canvassed before an appeal is heard. When a person has appeared before a tribunal and stated his grounds, the tribunal should be in a position to deal with all the matters together rather than to have to adjourn. If an appellant indicates that he wishes to rely on other grounds following receipt of notice from the Secretary of State, the latter should answer those grounds, so that when the matter goes before the tribunal, it will see the full picture and deal with everything.
<P>
Judge Dunn said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the appellant, on being served with a notice suggested in clause 55, puts in grounds B, C and D, having initially at his interview put in ground A, we consider it totally essential that the Home Office answer any new grounds. Otherwise, when the appeal comes before us, we will not know what the Home Office position is if the grounds of appeal start off as asylum and then human rights and various other things are thrown in&#151;B, C and D&#151;as grounds of appeal.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee; 22 March 1999; c. 437.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our later amendment was, we hope, a reflection of that.
<P>
We want the provision to work as well as it can. We want to overcome any technical problems that may arise, although of course issues of substance may be involved. But, in a way, these are technical legal procedures. We want the provision to work as well as possible.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The question is, how well will it work in practice and does it live up to its description of a one-stop shop? That is a term that we all understand. Governments of all parties frequently use it. The previous Government used to talk a great deal of one-stop shops for small businesses. It is a term that everyone understands. But will this be a one-stop shop, as the Government are anxious for us to believe? I wonder. I wonder also what will be made of it by the people with whom we all want to get to grips&#151;those who exploit the system by running one ground of appeal after another. I am talking not of people with genuine appeal grounds, but of people who simply set out to exploit the system.
<P>
Let me put one scenario that I thought about last night. I was inspired&#151;if that is the word; I doubt that I could be inspired by such things&#151;or interested, to read the Government's note on the reform of immigration and asylum appeals which outlines how the new system is intended to work. The Government put two cases&#151;the current and the new system&#151;in annex B of the document, with which the Minister will be familiar. Governments are anxious to put the best gloss on things and make them look wonderful by quoting specific examples of how something might work.
<P>
Without wanting to put a spoke in the works, I jotted down my own example of how the new system might work and whether it would actually be a one-stop shop. The Minister will probably tell me that I have got it all wrong, as I probably have, but I shall wait to hear what he says because, if I am wrong, I should like to know why.
<P>
I give the example of the old system that the Minister quoted in his document, which I transferred to the new system:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``X, who obtains leave to enter, has visited for 6 months. Shortly before the 6 months expire, he applies for an extension of stay as a student. The application is refused.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The application was refused by the immigration service. X then appeals and makes no mention of any other ground. His appeal would, I believe, go to an adjudicator.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Perhaps I am straying too far into stand part matters, Mrs Roe. But the debate was opened on that basis.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying. Later amendments will cover the ground that he is on. I ask hon. Members to concentrate on the amendment before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. The Minister hinted that there might be an indication from the Chair that, if the debate went slightly wide, we would not have a debate on clause stand part, and that it might be possible to take matters together for the convenience of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not know whether I shall be in the Chair when that moment comes. I can take matters only as I find them in front of me at this moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall not go through the example now, although it is not long. I want to know whether the provision lives up to its billing of a one-stop shop. I look forward to some future opportunity to discover that.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Amendment No. 538 would bring forward the point at which an applicant would have to be served with notice requiring him to submit further grounds to the point when a provisional decision to refuse an application was made. We considered that this would be an appropriate time to serve the notice, but concluded that it would introduce an unnecessary delay to all cases where refusal was planned. We think that it is better that the period for appealing and the period for lodging additional grounds begin simultaneously.
<P>
In the vast majority of cases where a person has a genuine additional ground, we shall in any case raise it in conjuction with the main application. However, there is a good argument for asking people who claim asylum or make ECHR claims and who do not have valid leave to stay to state at the point of application all the grounds that they may have for staying in the United Kingdom. We intend to use the regulatory power in subsection (7) to achieve that. However, that is a slightly different point from the one raised by amendment No. 538.
<P>
Earlier Opposition amendments Nos. 118 and 119 sought to introduce an in-country right of appeal under clause 48 for overstayers being removed under clause 6. If there were such a right of appeal, amendment No. 120 would apply the one-stop procedure to those exercising it. We do not believe that there should be an in-country right of appeal before removal, apart from on ECHR or asylum grounds. I invite the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 538 and 120.
<P>
I turn to the Government amendments. Amendment No. 669 seeks to clarify that the one-stop appeals procedure set out in clause 55, which ensures that all appealable matters will be heard at a single appeal, will also apply to appeals heard by the SIAC. It complements similar provisions elsewhere in part IV applying to SIAC.
<P>
Amendment No. 670 extends the application of the one-stop procedure to those whose application for variation of leave is curtailed without their having made an application. The latter is done infrequently, but it would be anomalous for them to be treated differently from those who have made an application that has been refused.
<P>
Amendment No. 672 is a fairly minor drafting amendment. Subsection (1) makes it clear that clause 55 applies in the circumstances stated in respect of applications for leave to enter and to remain. However, subsection (3), which requires an applicant and any relevant member of his family to disclose any additional grounds they may have for wishing to enter or remain in the UK, refers only to leave to remain. The amendment rectifies that by inserting a reference to leave to enter in the appropriate place.
<P>
Amendment No. 678 seeks to clarify that appeals heard by the SIAC are subject to the requirements of the one-stop appeal procedure set out in clause 56(2) and that SIAC appellants, as well as those whose appeal is to be heard before an adjudicator or the tribunal, may not, subject to any exceptions set out elsewhere in part IV, rely on grounds that they have not mentioned in their statement.
<P>
I shall now respond to the questions that I have been asked. The hon. Member for Twickenham asked why the Home Office make a decision before rather than after additional matters have been raised. The answer is that, because the majority of immigration applications are granted, time would be wasted if, for example, a student seeking an extension were asked to produce all sorts of other pointers on which he might wish to base his claim to stay. The application would almost certainly be granted anyway, and we would not want to know why he wanted to stay if the application were to be refused in any event.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the time periods for notice from the Secretary of State&#151;the ILPA concern, as I understand it. It requires careful consideration as we need to strike a balance between a speedy process and one that allows enough time for claims and appeals to be properly prepared. We shall want to consult widely about timescales to take into account practitioners' views. Indeed, it will be valuable to do so during our consultation on all the matters in the Bill. Discussing with the practitioners how we can most efficiently and effectively deal with some of the appeals issues has proved helpful. Some practitioners are well aware that their colleagues deliberately drag out the process. Indeed, many lawyers are appalled at the way in which some of their colleagues abuse the process, and wish the Law Society to crack down on abuse. The Government all too often rightly criticise the duff, incompetent and corrupt lawyers, but we should also draw attention to the many good lawyers practising in this area who do an honest job and who have on occasion helped to identify ways in which things can be done much better.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West, who I see is busy with his computer, asked what would happen if circumstances in the country of origin altered. Nothing in the Bill will prevent an appellant from claiming asylum or adding to the evidence in support of his claim if there is a genuine change of circumstances in his country of origin. The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if there were a coup d`etat. That would certainly be a relevant consideration, as it might change the whole basis of a person's ability to return to his country. The Government would want to enable him to base an asylum claim on such a change, even though, when his case was initially considered, he had perhaps said that there was no basis for a refugee claim. If there is a coup and he cannot return in the way in which he previously expected to, that seems to me a proper basis on which to allow him to come back to us and say, ``The circumstances have changed. I therefore wish to make a claim for asylum.''

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> The Minister has been helpful. I do not propose to ask him to write into the Bill all the circumstances that could arise, but I hope that, if circumstances in the country of origin change after a person has put in his grounds for appeal and, therefore, has had his last chance to say why, they will be taken into account by Ministers and their officials, even though, under the Bill, there is no extra opportunity to put in a revised ground for appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not think that we need to put such circumstances in the Bill. Our aim here is to deal with those who are making purely abusive claims. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not dissent from that. That is the intention of clause 56(4). Such people will be penalised by the loss of their right of appeal.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere raised an issue that greatly concerns me, which it might be helpful to mention here. It relates not so much to where there is a change of circumstances in the country from which the person comes, but, to where a person who has arrived in this country then becomes engaged in political activity here, which makes it difficult for him to return to his own country and may create the basis for an asylum claim here. That is clearly a complex and difficult issue.
<P>
In this country we have freedom of speech and people have the right to engage in proper political activity&#151;a right that we are reluctant to curtail. However, there have been concerns that in the past people who have come here as visitors, or otherwise quite properly, have then, during their stay and to ensure that they do not have to leave, created circumstances in which they can mount a claim for asylum by engaging in political activity that would make it extremely difficult for them to return to their home country. That presents us with serious problems and, in particular cases, has caused Ministers to look carefully at the material before them.
<P>
We do not want to create a situation in which abuse is allowed; at the same time some people may feel that they can say things here that they could not say in their home country. There is a limit to the extent to which we want to curtail their ability to do that, provided that what they are doing and saying is lawful and peaceful and does not promote terrorism abroad. However, to mount campaigns in this country in respect of trade unionism or certain political rights can create difficulties for them in respect of their home country. That presents a problem which the hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned in passing. I do not have an answer as to how we will deal with such matters. The only way to do so is to examine each case on its own merits and make a decision on it as it presents itself.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised some other points. He asked how the one-stop procedure will apply in asylum cases. People claiming asylum should make that claim when they are refused leave to enter or remain. Alternatively, illegal entrants or overstayers will be required to indicate their asylum claim at the outset. Should they fail to do so then, it will be open to the Secretary of State to certify that their claims are abusive claims, and that will remove the right of appeal. However, judicial review will still be appropriate, should the circumstances known to the court suggest that. The court, not the Government, will obviously make a decision on that.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
How will people know about prescribed concessions and other matters? Those wishing to enter or remain in the United Kingdom should know the basis of their application for wishing to stay. Such people would know whether they feared persecution in another country or whether they were claiming family links in the United Kingdom.
<P>
We have published the concessions and as much of the advice and guidance to immigration officers as we can. Should people rely on a concession, they should be able to identify the substance of that concession. It is not for the Home Office to second-guess someone's reasons for wishing to stay. However, we accept that ECHR issues are in a different category because of the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
I was asked whether the Secretary of State will deal with all the points raised in the notice period before a case goes to appeal. We intend that that should happen. Judge Dunn made that point. It is good point and we seek to respond to it. We have not yet set out exactly how we will do that. Indeed, we have not published all the concessions, but we intend to do so in due course.
<P>
Judge Dunn's point about dealing with matters before the case comes to court will be addressed. We do not intend to put the appellate authority in the position of having to decide cases ab initio. All applications and respresentations will be considered at the notice stage. Of course, that may persuade the Secretary of State to grant leave and therefore the appeal may then become unnecessary. However, if that does not happen, a consolidated refusal notice covering any points raised will be issued by the Secretary of State.
<P>
I have dealt with most of the points put to me. The hon. Gentleman asked in broad terms whether there will be a one-stop shop; he may give more detail in the example that he said that he may give. He rightly pointed out that previous Governments, including the one in which he served, talked about one-stop shops. The danger is that the one-stop shop becomes just another stop. We must ensure that that does not happen in our provisions for a one-stop appeal.
<P>
I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman that we are satisfied that we have covered every possibility of judicial review and the various options for going down different routes. However, we have taken account of all the needs of a criminal justice system to have appropriate rights of appeal and have tried, as far as is reasonably possible, to circumscribe the options for multiple appeals.
<P>
I cannot therefore give the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance that we are providing for a one-stop shop that will prevent every single possible possibility of judicial review or appeal. Indeed, we make provision for certain appeals to go to a higher court when that is appropriate and a point of law has arisen. The aim, however, is as far as possible to minimise the abuse evident in the way in which some appeal structures have been used as well as opportunities for abuse.
<P>
That is the object of the exercise. In practical terms, if lawyers apply the rules as we intend them to and with all the provisions to enable the courts to penalise those who put in abusive claims, we shall be able to create a comprehensive right of appeal that deals with all the issues and closes off the option of appeals that are without realistic foundation. The hon. Gentleman is a lawyer, as I am, and he will appreciate that lawyers are inventive in applying the law. I suspect that some lawyers will find ways of getting round the procedure, but, as parliamentarians, we must have a clear objective in mind and seek to circumscribe their ingenuity with devices that legitimately meet the interests of justice and fairness as well as ensuring that cases are dealt with speedily and efficiently. That is what we seek to do in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. We shall come to the wider point of the one-stop shop in a moment. He talks about circumscribing rights of appeal, but it is difficult to circumscribe existing rights of appeal and achieve a saving of time when the Bill creates entirely new rights of appeal that are relevant here.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West raised an important subject. I think that the Minister is familiar with a case that falls into that general category&#151;the unusual case of the Campsfield detention centre. A number of detainees from the detention centre were put on trial for criminal charges and alleged to have breached our law in various ways. I believe that in the course of their trial their identities were revealed.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister nods. I do not believe that the case got as far as the jury having to reach a verdict because, if I remember correctly, the judge stopped the trial and verdicts of not guilty were entered against those concerned, so in that sense their names were cleared. However, their identities had become known, which was a material consideration as regards their position in their own countries. As I have said before, people may come here with bogus claims or with genuine claims, but we must be careful that anything that we do here should not expose them to an additional risk of persecution. I was concerned about that case, because the identities of the people had become known, and I have taken a continuing interest in it. However, it is a difficult area.
<P>
The Minister said that the critieria are being published. In fairness, he must agree that that does not necessarily mean that those concerned will know about it. I was simply seeking a commonsense way forward that would avoid complications and future legal challenges, but the Minister knows the point and I shall not take it further.
<P>
I am pleased by what the Minister said about Judge Dunn: there had to be a response when the president of the Immigration Appellate Authority made a suggestion of that kind. I hope that, in implementing the Bill, the Government will continue to talk to the IAA and discuss the matter with Judge Dunn, and that there will be no unnecessary adjournments and delays.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> The Minister has dealt comprehensively with many of the points that I and the hon. Member for Hertsmere raised, and I appreciate that. We all accept that, in the case of the one-stop procedure, a balance must be struck between efficiency, speed and fairness. We have emphasised fairness, but recognise that the other factors are relevant too.
<P>
Although the Minister has a jaundiced view of some lawyers and their ability to drag out proceedings, he helpfully suggested that he was willing to consider sympathetically the idea of allowing realistic time periods for appeals to be developed. I hope that in discussion we will strike a reasonable balance. The problem is not simply a fairness issue in the first place, The problem is not simply a fairness issue in the first place, but if matters are rushed and issues are raised subsequently, the process may become more protracted than if it were initially done properly. With a sensible discussion on timing and taking up the practical problems raised by the chief adjudicator, I hope that we will make some progress in properly constituting the one-stop procedure. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 552, in page 33, line 25, leave out `relevant' and insert `dependent'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 553, in page 33, leave out lines 40 and 41.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> Amendment No. 552 is simply an attempt to ask the Minister what the Government intend by ``relevant'' family members as opposed to ``dependent'' ones, as it is not entirely clear why that word is being used. Cases will arise in which various members of the same family have different legitimate grounds for making an appeal based on different circumstances. It would be wrong for one case to prejudice another. Therefore, it should be absolutely clear that we are talking about members of the family who are dependent rather than the nebulous concept of their being relevant. Will the Minister clarify that potential difficulty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The wording is as drafted because the relevant family member may not be dependent. The word ``relevant'' means any person who perhaps ought to be in receipt of such a notice, but may not be directly financially or otherwise dependent on the primary applicant. There may be a 19 or 20-year-old relative of independent means who is therefore not dependent on the applicant, but may be relevant to consideration in terms of the way in which the matter proceeds. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would narrow rather than broaden the way in which the clause will operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> Will the Minister tell us whether the meaning of ``relevant'' is in the Bill, as there are definitions scattered through it, or was the meaning given in his response to the hon. Gentleman?
