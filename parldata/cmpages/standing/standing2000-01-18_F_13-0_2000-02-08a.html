<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): Before we adjourned for lunch I listened closely to the Minister's response and particularly to his comments about how the linking rule could work in theory. Since then I have had the opportunity to obtain some advice about the way in which it works in practice, and I shall put one or two points about that to the Minister in a minute.
<P>
At the start of the Minister's response to this group of amendments, he chastised Opposition Members for raising what he regarded as nit-picking points, saying that it would be more appropriate for us to laud the clauses from the rooftops. At the beginning of my remarks this morning I made some clear comments on our views about the principles behind the clauses, partly to address Ministers' understandable concern about what Opposition Members might say. However, our role in Committee, as the Minister rightly said, is to move amendments that delve into the detail of the clauses. Teasing out answers relating to some of the principal concerns that are brought to our attention and, I dare say, to Ministers' attention, should be part of what we are doing. Therefore, I make no apology for being critical on occasions in the debates on this and later groups of amendments.
<P>
The fundamental constraint that we encounter is information technology: we were told that the computer systems cannot cope with the administrative burdens imposed by this kind of development.—[Interruption.] If the Under-Secretary wishes to intervene, I shall be happy to give way.
<P>
The Minister told us that a weekly system would cause considerable administrative problems for the Government.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am happy to give way to the Under-Secretary, who has been speaking from a sedentary position.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he is now saying that it is Liberal Democrat policy to have a weekly calculation of people's pension entitlement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Under-Secretary was here this morning when I introduced the amendments and I hope the record will show that I said at the start that they were probing amendments. I am sure that she has tabled amendments in the past, so she knows what that means: it means that we seek clarity. The amendment is not necessarily a Liberal Democrat policy that is set in tablets of stone, but is a legitimate means of exploring the difficulties that arise from the way in which the system is set up. There may be benefits from not doing the calculation weekly: it may minimise and inhibit the crediting of contributions to a state second pension, as we outlined earlier.
<P>
I accept that the problem is partly to do with computers and partly about practicalities. The Minister also referred to employers' additional burdens. We are talking about carers here. The amendments that I have tabled specifically refer to the invalid care allowance gateway for contributions. Carers receive an invalid care allowance. Some carers may work, but the majority do not, so I could not follow the Minister's point about an additional burden for employers, because carers do not have employers in a recognisable sense.
<P>
However, what worried me most was the Minister's assertion that a carer and the person they are caring for can have eight weeks of respite care in a year without in any way reducing the carer's ability, under the Bill, to secure their contributions to the state second pension.
<P>
I have made further inquiries about this, and the Minister is right to say that that would technically be possible, but it would require a superhuman feat of management or very good fortune to achieve it in most cases. This will affect the carers of the most seriously disabled people in the community—people with multiple disabilities, who often require regular respite care. Following consultations with the Carers National Association, I understand that a large number of cared-for people in that group regularly go into respite care.
<P>
Under the linking rules, it would be necessary to have a 28-day gap between each period of respite care, otherwise there would be difficulties with ICA no longer being available, and consequent broken contribution records. That aspect of the problem greatly concerned me—as well as Age Concern and the Carers National Association—and it does not appear to have been addressed.
<P>
I have listened closely to what the Minister has said, and I shall seek leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment. However, I hope that the Government will consider further the implications of the way in which the linking rules will work in practice. They will, as I understand it, make it very difficult for people with heavier caring responsibilities to benefit from the provision.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I thought that I had responded earlier. I do not expect anyone on the Opposition Benches to talk up an aspect of the Bill that will provide for two million extra carers to get help with their pension. However, the way in which they put across their arguments suggested that there was nothing in the Bill for carers. That gave a false impression.
<P>
In relation to feats of management, I accept that there might be difficulties in individual circumstances for some families. We are introducing legislation to cover everyone, but one cannot cover every eventuality. Life is not like that.
<P>
I gave an example in relation to the effect of amendments Nos. 146 and 147, which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) described as probing amendments. Would not the effect of amendment No. 149 be to allow a person in receipt of invalid care allowance for one week to benefit from a full year's entitlement to a state second pension? It clearly cannot be the intention for that to be credited on a weekly basis. We are not complaining about the IT in this case, but it makes no sense to accrue pension for a lifetime on a weekly basis. It makes no sense in pension terms, let alone in operational terms.
<P>
We are starting not with a clean sheet of paper, but with the existing system of additional pensions. We are building on the present arrangements, to ensure that much more help—in the form of a second state pension—goes to those who miss out under the present system. We are not tearing up the old system and starting again. I ask the hon. Gentleman to take that difference on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> For the purpose of the debate, we needed to table amendments that would give us the opportunity to raise various concerns. I accept the Minister's argument about weekly crediting. However, I want the Government to think again about the way in which the linking rules will work. It may be unjustifiable that someone who qualifies for ICA for a week should get the credit for a whole year, as the Minister cited in his example. However, it would be fundamentally unfair if a person who had received ICA for a substantial period of a year received no credit for that period, because of the way in which ICA was structured. The amendments are a means of asking the Government to look again at the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I can only repeat what I have said. I do not want to give a false impression to the hon. Gentleman. The system works on the basis of yearly accrual. I return to an example that I cited earlier, which was not picked up by members of the Committee. If someone cared for a person for 11 months and that person died, the carer would lose only that year's accrual—not all the accrual that may have been accumulated in previous years—for the simple reason that the system has an annual basis. I could not justify any grounds for moving from that yearly basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham) rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I have forgotten whether I am responding to the amendment or intervening on an hon. Member.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a general discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am not sure if I am due to give way to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. Did he originally give way to me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We have not yet considered a scenario in which someone who has a full year of relevant contributions, part of which is ICA, becomes ill and thus eligible for another benefit on account of that incapacity. They would thus have a full year's entitlement. Would it be possible to take that into account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That would depend on the benefit concerned. In the case of invalidity benefit, the person would be covered, on the basis of their accruals, for the state second pension. That could represent a worse situation, because in some unfortunate circumstances the person's benefit could be partly in one benefit year and partly in another year. The situation would then depend on what the person's work record had been.
<P>
At a point of change, difficult decisions are always involved. I am not seeking to deny that. However, in some cases people will be able to swap from one benefit to another and still be covered, because of the nature of the benefit. It will depend on individual circumstances, including factors such as work record and national insurance status.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sure that we all have sympathy with a person who accrues a large amount of a year's contributions. Perhaps it would be possible to work towards a situation whereby when a person approaches retirement the indicative number of credits associated with national insurance stamps and other such forms of help are totted up to arrive at a notional deeming of the amount of credit that they have. The objective is to try to ensure that people have a pension, not to stop them having a pension. The Bill seems to be closing options down rather than opening them up.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The same argument would apply to the long-term disabled and low earners. The low earner boost applies only when a person has crossed the lower earnings threshold. In certain circumstances, people may just miss the threshold in more than one year. If that they do that, they will not qualify for S2P; they will not get the boost.
<P>
We are covering 2 million carers and 2 million long-term disabled who were not covered before, and changing the provisions at the margin to cover other people in similar circumstances would not fit in with the yearly accrual. While I accept that all the examples that have been cited are practical cases that have happened in real life, we have no plans to move away from the yearly accrual. I cannot sugar-coat the matter any more than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 24, line 40, after `benefits', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or through the earnings rule'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is intended to address the impact of the earnings rule in respect of invalid care allowance, and the way in which that interacts with the ability to clock up contributions or credits towards the state second pension.
<P>
I said to the Minister before we started this morning that I was struck by some of his comments on the Floor of the House during yesterday's consideration of the draft Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2000. My hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) expressed concern about the way in which the earnings rule creates disincentives and the problems created by the fact that the £50 threshold that applies to the earnings rule in respect of ICA has not been indexed or changed for a long time. In his response, which was based on personal experience and a midlands radio phone-in in which he participated on Friday, the Minister correctly identified some difficulties associated with the earnings limit. He said that, in the context of the Government's policy to encourage people to work where possible rather than claim benefit, the earnings limit sends the wrong signals. Someone might adjust his or her hours to keep within the earnings limit, and the employer might then decide that the number of hours worked are insufficient, and say ``Bye-bye''. That would be a perverse outcome. The Minister said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Earnings limits for carers are a real issue.''—[Official Report, 7 February 2000; Vol. 344, c.77.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He is right, and they are certainly an issue in the context of the clause.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall give an example of the problems associated with the earnings limit. A person called Tom works part time in a small workshop, but he also cares for his elderly mother. The business recently had a good trading year and Tom's boss paid his employees a Christmas bonus. The Benefits Agency decided to take that into account and averaged out the figures over the year. Tom's bonus, which was two weeks' wages, took him over the earnings limit for ICA, so he lost 6 months' ICA payments. Because Tom does not earn enough to pay national insurance contributions, he does not qualify for state second pension credits. ICA, which is his principal means of access to credits for the state second pension, is denied him because of the earnings rule, and he gets no other credit because his wages are not sufficient to take him over the lower earnings limit. Therefore, the signal is being sent that the provision neither rewards work nor recognises the caring role.
<P>
The amendment, which would allow the current earnings rule to be disregarded, may be imperfectly drafted, but it should be seen as a means to debate the working of the system and how, in the real world, it could disadvantage many people with caring responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> This matter, which is worthy of comment, and which I realised would be discussed again today, was raised earlier in the context of a working woman with caring responsibilities. At her place of employment, the minimum wage was welcomed and had benefited many people. However, in practice, according to her husband, she had had to reduce her working hours and might have to reduce them again in the light of future increases in the minimum wage. As a result, her employer may say, ``Don't bother working here, it's not worth it. You were working 13.8 hours and it's now down to 12 hours. Soon, it will be 11 hours.'' For a carer, a job is a vital link to the outside world. This is a genuine issue that must be addressed in due course.
<P>
Under amendment No. 143, carers who are disallowed ICA because they have earnings above the limit of £50 would still be able to accrue entitlement to the state second pension. However, such a carer will qualify for the state second pension under the Bill's current drafting either as a low earner who earns above the lower earnings limit but below £9,500, which would attract the boost, or as the carer of a sick or disabled person who fulfils the qualifying criteria for home responsibility protection, the relevant provisions for which are contained in another clause. That person's basic protection would also be protected. The example that was given by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam involved a person whose earnings in a year were below the lower earnings level—such a person would not enter into that system.
<P>
We must ensure that carers who do not receive ICA notify the Department at the time of the periods of caring activity that involve home responsibilities protection. A clause that we shall presently come to will require carers to make such notifications in a more timely way than is currently the case. We must ensure that that receives massive publicity and that carers are aware of the proposal, which will protect their state second pension and their basic pension. Unlike the publicity that was given to the abolition of SERPS for widows in 1985, our change will be well publicised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Neither the Minister's comments nor the explanatory notes were clear about home responsibilities protection. Will the change that we shall presently discuss apply only to the state second pension or will it also apply to the basic pension?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Off the top of my head, I believe that it will apply to both. In fact, I am advised that this important change will apply to both pensions. People may turn up at the Department with claims dating back to 1978, although relevant evidence may not still exist. We must not leave the matter until a person retires, and we must make the system much more up to date. It is important to link the two pensions.
<P>
The cost of raising the ICA earnings limit to the lower earnings level would involve a maximum of £20 million a year. That sum relates to the cost of ICA payments and has nothing to do with the pension. The earnings limit was last raised in April 1993 but, in view of the introduction of the national minimum wage and our proposal, it cannot be too long before it is reviewed. I imply that developments will flow from such a review.
<P>
We are seeking to do more for carers. It does not make sense to do more or to give with one hand and to maintain a system that takes away with the other hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. His concluding statement is fundamental to this part of the Bill. We must ensure that the framework does not remove some of the benefits that the Government will put in place through the national carers strategy. I am mindful of the Minister's remarks. The amendment was intended to raise discussion about this serious issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 24, line 46, leave out `six' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sixteen'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 164, in page 24, line 46, leave out `six' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`eleven'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Fawcett Society and other organisations have criticised the clause because it makes unrealistic assumptions about the way in which people live their lives. We tested that in earlier debates, when we discussed how examples of real lives might interact with the proposed legislation. The way in which the clause is structured also compartmentalises women's lives. For example, many women may move, during their lives, between full-time employment, part-time employment and managing different caring roles, whether for children, parents or older relatives. Child care responsibilities do not necessarily end at the age of six. After a child begins school, the demands on parents—especially in the child's early years, and if there are several young children in the family—can often preclude women, in particular, from returning to work. Even if they do return to work, family demands may mean that only part-time work will be possible. As a result, they may never be able to clock up the credits under the state second pension, because their income is below the lower earnings limit. Research by the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Institute for Employment Research produced some interesting statistics, to which I shall briefly refer. The EOC found that women's family commitments were a key factor in choosing part-time work, especially in catering and other such industries. In 1998, the Institute for Employment Research found that women were more likely to earn below the lower earnings limit. One in six women between 25 and 54 earn below the lower earnings limit, compared with one in 100 men.
<P>
The amendment is designed to explore why the Government decided to change the age from 16 to six. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) proposes changing it to 11. I look forward to hearing the rationale that underpins that change. It would be better to align that condition of qualification with the existing home responsibilities protection regulations, which are currently available up to the age of 16 for people receiving child benefit. That is a key issue for the value that we place on unpaid work. Although promoting work is a key part of the Government's strategy, the state second pension should also recognise unpaid work. The Government have recognised that to a degree with their provisions for carers, and, in certain circumstances, with regard to disabled people. There is a gap, however, and the change to the age of six creates the likelihood that many women will retire on little more than the basic state pension, or a very small part of a state second pension. That is unjust, which is why we wanted to explore the option of aligning home responsibilities protection with the age of 16.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I should like to speak in support of amendment No. 164, which, as the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam pointed out, suggests that credits should be available for women looking after children under the age of 11. I can easily explain why the age should be 11 rather than 16—11 is the age at which we propose that single mothers looking after children should be able to go out to work.
<P>
This issue is part of the debate about the Government's view of the role of women looking after children. For many years, many of us have been concerned about the conflict between the desire of mothers to stay at home and look after children and the fact that in some families it is beneficial to the children for mother to be able to go out to work. That concern focuses particularly on the problems of single mothers who need to get out of the isolation in which they find themselves if they are looking after one or more children, often in poor housing, and have no extended family or access to, support services. Isolation has long been regarded as a problem for such mothers and their children. If mothers have access to support services and the world of work, they will have a much more balanced approach to ensuring that their children benefit as much as possible. Bringing in additional money to the benefits on which they often live also helps.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I understand why the Government are proposing that the credits for S2P should be introduced only when the children are aged six: it is part of their campaign to get single mothers out to work. The other side of the coin, however, is that only when children are over the age of 11 and in secondary school do most women go out to full-time work. The figures that I have from the labour market trends show that the number of women working full time with a child under the age of four is only 19.2 per cent. When children are between five and 10 the figure is 23.6 per cent. Then there is a big jump: when the children are between 11 and 15, 34.7 per cent. of mothers go out to work—an increase of 11 per cent.—and when the children are over 16, 41.9 per cent. go out to work. Those figures have stayed remarkably stable over the past 10 years and show a similar pattern.
<P>
A woman who is working full time, although she may be in low-paid work, will certainly qualify for the credits. The problems arise when she is not working or is working part time. The break when the children are aged 11 is the key to helping her gain the credits for the state second pension.
<P>
We all know of many single, widowed or divorced mums who are trying hard to make ends meet and care for their children. There has been a continual debate since the introduction of child benefit in the 1960s and early 1970s between women who want to stay at home and look after their children and those who either feel that it is best for themselves and the family to go out to work or have an economic necessity to do so. Opposition Members want to ensure that women continue to have choices: that is essential for them and their family.
<P>
I admit that, because the subject of pensions is so complex, when a woman is deciding whether to go out to work, the question of whether she is credited with state pension is not at the forefront of her mind. It could, however, be part of the decision and there could be an adverse effect on her and her family if she felt that she had to go out to work in order to get sufficient credits towards the state second pension. A mother who does not resent being parted from her children is probably not the best mother in the world. Therefore, we must reinforce women's ability to choose whether they work. Our aim in the amendment is to match the reality of the labour market with a cut-off at 11, when women with children want to work full time because they feel that the children are safely at secondary school, are getting more independent and can look after themselves better.
<P>
The other problem with the Bill is that it imposes on people what I regard as the Government's rather hard-hearted view of single parents, which drives much of the new deal and other legislation affecting single women. The Government have one view of all single parents and believe that the same solution will solve all the problems. As we know, the variety of human nature is infinite. The Government close options by being so keen to ensure that everybody goes out to work when their children are still young.
<P>
I have no problem with mothers going back to work the minute their children are born if that is their choice and if they have put in place the necessary mechanisms to ensure that it works well, but a proposal that would impose the pressure of society on mothers by insisting that, when the children are aged six, a mother should go back to work full time does not sit easily on Conservative shoulders. That is why I and my hon. Friends will want to explore more closely the thinking behind the Government's insistence on that age limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): Should a single mother have her benefits stopped if she does not go out to work when her youngest child is three months, as is the case in Wisconsin, 16 years, as it is in this country, or 11 years, as it is in the Conservative manifesto? The truth is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) said, that there is no answer. It would be an appalling society if we decreed from this building a point at which a mother with a child under the age of 16 had to go out to work. In an ideal world we should create a flexible system. I suppose that it is impossible to create one under a national social security system, because we are told that there has to be the same rule for everybody. I have never understood that argument, apart from the fact that it is much easier to administer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said, there is an infinite variety of human natures and different circumstances apply. I should much rather everyone had a Government adviser whom they could go and see in a social security office, who could advise them on the interaction with Government on tax, social security and everything else. I hope that, as computer technology becomes more sophisticated and Government Departments and their software start to speak to one another, that situation may not be as fanciful as one might have thought.
<P>
There is no right solution to this set of amendments, but it is wrong for us to force mothers to go back to work. They are already in work: they have one of the most important and demanding jobs going, albeit at home. There is no point in saying that now that the youngest child has reached such an age he can look after himself; there may be older children in the family and, in a sense, children never grow up. I must be with my mother at lunchtime today. Here I am approaching 50, running off to see my mother at lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, so she is still looking after me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): It is Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is Tuesday—I usually see her on a Wednesday.
<P>
It is ridiculous to say that there should be a hard and fast rule on the matter. Building on the ideas that I discussed this morning, the Government should establish a real pension plan for women that acknowledges the obvious point that more women than men take on caring roles, and that their caring role in society is just as important as roles performed by men in the workplace. The Government should help women to retain those roles.
<P>
The Minister will doubtless tell me that I am being idealistic, that my proposals are simply pie in the sky, and that the Government could not afford to implement them. That may be true, but one of the joys of opposition is that one can say what one pleases without worrying about what the Treasury is saying over one's shoulder. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Ah.''] I am a humble Back Bencher. I can say what I like, and I am not making spending commitments on anyone's behalf However, it would be interesting to know the cost of the Liberal party's proposal. Perhaps the Minister can tell us because, if we can afford it, it is eminently sensible. Can we all agree on that?
<P>
Why should we not try to help women to create a decent pension, and give credit to those who look after children until they reach the age of 16? 1 am sure that no one disagrees with that, and there can be no logical argument against it. The only potential problem is cost, and I accept that we may not be able to afford the provision. If so, we should recalculate the cost in respect of children under the age of 11, and so on, until we reach the age of six. What is magical about the age of six? Why have the Government plucked that age out of the air? Children are already at school at that age. Do six-year-olds suddenly no longer need to be met at the school gates at 3.30 pm by their mothers? Of course not. Six-year-old children need as much care as five-year-olds, eight-year-olds or 11-year-olds. The argument is ridiculous.
<P>
I shall not speculate on why the Government have plucked the figure of six out of the air, but we shall doubtless be told. Committee members are well acquainted with my views. For children, the best system is to be brought up by a married couple, and for one parent to work and the other to stay at home. Not everyone wants to adopt that system, and people should be allowed to do what they want. However, where a woman—or, indeed, a man—wants to stay at home and look after the children full time until they are sixteen, the Government should be big-hearted and give credit for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I shall not detain the Committee for long, because my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) has analysed the problem well. However, it worth recapping on a point with which many of us will be intimately familiar. Women who want to have a family are presented with a difficult equation. Properly attending to the family's domestic needs will make demands on their time, and attending to the family's economic needs by generating additional income will make further demands on their time. That is a difficult balance to strike.
<P>
Not surprisingly, families with differing circumstances address the problem in different ways. Indeed, families with similar circumstances sometimes address the problem in different ways. However, by and large, the market arrives at a solution. That is demonstrated by figures that have been brought to the Committee's attention. Fewer than one in five mothers whose children are under the age of four go out to work. That figure rises to less than a quarter once the child is about 10 years old, and rises significantly to about a third once the child is more than 11 years old. In other words, an ordinary social force that addresses this equation is at work. I suspect that it is wrong for the Government to intrude on that process. However, they have chosen to intrude and to suggest that six years of age is appropriate. The provision conveys a powerful message about pension entitlement, which is unhelpful, given the reality of the labour market to which I referred earlier.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Is it proper for the Government to have a view on when it is appropriate for a mother to return to work? The provision will effectively achieve that. It will not force mothers to return to work, but it will provide a powerful incentive through the pension system. It will create an expectation. Women with parental responsibilities have to bear in mind all their economic circumstances when making their decision. The Bill will provide a powerful additional economic factor for them to consider. It is inappropriate for the state to introduce such a consideration.
<P>
One might ask what was the difference, in principle, between the amendment and the Government's proposal. Amendment No. 164 would change the age from six years old to 11 years old. In principle, there is no difference in that a decision is being made and an incentive built into the pension system. We have merely differed on the age chosen. There is power involved in these decisions. By choosing any age, one is making a value judgment; the state is intruding into private decisions.
<P>
The taxpayer has an interest in the matter, so the Government must decide on an age. Nevertheless, given the reality of the labour market, it would be much less intrusive to decide on the age of 11 than the age of six. One would be going with the social trend in deciding on 11 years old, whereas it might be suggested that we are trying to alter that social trend by choosing the age of six. That would be undesirable and all sorts of consequences might flow from it. Delinquency and other undesirable social phenomena could result from the possible alteration in behaviour of a significant number of women taking on greater economic responsibilities at the expense of family responsibilities. Actions have consequences. We do not know what they will be, but it would be better to leave things as they are than to implement the changes in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I shall not be provocative by saying that the Bill is an attack on family values. Instead, I shall try to be friendly and say that it does not go far enough to help. The timing is awkward. Some of us will have received letters from the Inland Revenue in the past week or so notifying us about changes in the married man's allowance. MIRAS is going to change in April. Discussions are under way in the other place—this might be provocative—about another clause 28, and there is a continuing debate about the age of consent.
<P>
None of that is family friendly, and neither is setting an age of six as a threshold. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said, why six? I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne)—it is difficult for the state to decide on the threshold. Should it be set at an age at which a child could care for themself without getting into trouble or needing help with homework? In a more intangible sense, should it be set at an age at which the child would no longer feel lonely or in need of someone to be there when they got home from school?
<P>
When children start school at the age of four or five, the fact that they are out of the house for a certain amount of time each day can cause more problems for the parent with responsibility than there were before. Problems can also get worse when children go to secondary school. The potential for children getting into more serious trouble is greater at that age than when they are, say, seven years old.
<P>
At the risk of annoying my hon. Friends, I have to say that I have some sympathy with the amendment that was tabled by the Liberal Democrats, which would set the age at 16, because that is consistent with some of the existing legislation. However, I appreciate that we have to try to avoid bankrupting the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and for his concern about the Treasury. He may be interested to know that in a written answer that I received on 26 January, having sought information about the cost of setting the age at 16, I was told that the number of additional people who would be brought into the state second pension would probably be negligible. It would therefore involve a negligible cost to the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that information, although it puts me in even more difficulty. I see that my hon. Friend is about to rescue me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I trust that while the additional information might affect my hon. Friend's opinion, it will not affect his vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I shall take that as friendly advice, rather than a threat. Perhaps I shall find myself able to vote in favour of both amendments.
<P>
While I accept that it is difficult to set an age, why six? Responsibility for a child does not end at the age of six. Children are not grown up at that age or at the age of eight. Those ages are meaningless. Elsewhere, the Bill provides that someone who is claiming certain benefits, such as incapacity benefit, will be able to claim while they remain unable to work. To pursue that analogy, while the child needs looking after, the mother should be able to qualify. A great inconsistency is involved here.
<P>
I support amendment No. 164, although I confess to having some sympathy for amendment No. 144.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I am in a little difficulty among my hon. Friends, because I believe that it is right and proper that parents have to take their economic responsibilities seriously, as well as their responsibilities for their children. After all, where the state seeks to compensate families for loss of earnings or pension contributions the taxpayer picks up the bill. I therefore feel slight trepidation about going down the road that was suggested by my hon. Friends or by the Liberal Democrats. I look forward to hearing the Government's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that the activity that is undertaken by a mother who cares for her children is not quantifiable—it is a subsistence activity—but that it is, nevertheless, genuine economic activity that provides economic welfare for her children and for society? The benefits and tax systems should recognise that fact.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I was about to disagree more forcefully with my hon. Friend until he mentioned the tax system. Briefly—I shall not develop this line of thought in too much detail, Sir David, because you would rule that my comments were out of order—when an income comes into the family unit, there is a case for examining the entire tax and benefit structure in order to ensure that more money is kept in that unit. When the unit has no income that could be used to maintain the children in a relationship and the family has to rely on the taxpayer, the situation is slightly different. That family is not, for want of a better description, economically viable. They need the help of the taxpayer through income support, family credit or pension contributions to make up their income.
<P>
The state obviously has an interest in all its citizens, and we seek to maintain a decent quality of life and standard of living with a redistributive tax and benefits system. However, there clearly have to be limits on such redistribution. I do not underestimate the contribution that a mother makes—I am the first to admit that I should rather do a day's work as a Member of Parliament than look after a child for 24 hours—but people make choices when they have children. It is, first and foremost, up to the parents who have a child to decide how they wish to live their life. They may choose to live at home and not to take an economic wage or to go out to work and arrange for someone else to look after their child. We need to establish where the correct balance lies.
<P>
Pension contributions may be made for mothers who stay at home to look after children, but should the relevant age be six, 11 or 16? It will be difficult for the Government to make their proposal consistent with the wider benefits system, in which mothers—or fathers, for that matter—are entitled to stay at home with their child and to receive income support without expecting to go out to work and without the state requiring them, as the benefit rules put it, to actively seek work. The state says to such people, ``While your child is under the age of 16, the state will not expect you to seek to go out to work. You are at liberty to stay at home and to look after your child if that is what you want to do.'' That approach is adopted for income support but not in the Bill. That is a difficult inconsistency, which the Government should consider further.
<P>
The state needs to be careful about placing demands on the taxpayer on behalf of parents who have chosen to have children. As we discussed in relation to the amendments that dealt with the CSA, people's first responsibility is to generate an income that will allow them to keep a roof over their heads and to put food in their mouths. The state should help women to acquire a pension when they retire. Women who retire are sometimes greatly disappointed by the pensions regime. That is no one's fault—we had not cottoned on to the importance of the pensions regime or realised how important pensions would be in later life, not least because we did not expect people to live as long as they do. As a result of the way in which financial affairs were run, many women retire on totally inadequate pensions—not just modest ones—through no fault of their own, and certainly no fecklessness. There was a lack of forethought in the old system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Lady and I agree with most of her comments. Does she agree that the way in which society has changed has put us in danger of lacking respect for mothers, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West suggested, and respecting only careerists? I am not against women or men who are careerists. The role of the mother, however, is equally important.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend, but it is difficult to decide where the right balance lies. It is a tragedy that, in the past, women have not been properly looked after for having performed the role of mother, with no expectation that they should ever work. It is precisely those women who are now getting a bad deal from the pension arrangements that were introduced 20 or 30 years ago. Fortunately, the arrangements are changing, but if such women are divorced, or their husband dies, they find themselves in an inadequate financial position. The Government are right to introduce pension credits for mothers, who have a vital role in society. Society cannot exist unless some people do the decent thing and raise a family. There is a huge grey area around the question of how to credit women who have families, to ensure that their pensions are not massively denuded by such a responsibility.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the Government's view that the age should be six. I am keen to learn why they think that it should not be 11. In the light of the Liberal Democrat amendment, which suggests age 16, I am also interested to hear how such lack of consistency is rationalised with a wider benefits system. If we are properly to look after the family environment and mothers who stay at home to look after their children, I urge Ministers to encourage their Treasury colleagues to look at the wider context. It would certainly be appropriate if, for example, men who went out to work but whose wives stayed at home could be given a tax incentive to contract their wives into the pension system. That would be right and proper, and would represent a more satisfactory reward for those who go out to work than blanket protection from the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend. All the speeches on this issue, especially that of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, have been thoughtful. We await the Minister's response with great interest. I do not think any of us realised how ill the Under-Secretary was last week. She was completely silent during debates, except when she was called to speak. She has been chuntering throughout this sitting, and it is marvellous to see her back on form. As I am sitting reasonably close to the hon. Lady, I can hear what she is saying most of the time. The nature of those chunters is interesting. It is reminiscent of an early Margaret Thatcher, just when she discovered the power of the market. If the election of May 1997 had gone a different way, and Conservative Members were on the other side of the Room, I have a sneaking suspicion that we might have been making similar remarks. We might have been saying, ``We can't afford this. It's not right. We've got to draw a balance. This is too expensive. What the Opposition are saying is nonsense. It is administratively inconvenient.'' The amendment seeks to strike a balance—[Interruption.] They are off again. The Minister of State is a folk hero to me. I find this very depressing.
<P>
The amendment attempts to strike a balance between what my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) said about delinquency, what my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said and the model suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride). There is a time when it is more beneficial for a mother to be at home looking after the child, but there also comes a time when it is better for her to be out at work.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Not necessarily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> If my hon. Friend will let me develop the point, I shall be happy to take an intervention from him.
<P>
One of the benefits of being in opposition is that one gets to read a lot—although one's reading matter no longer comes in a Red Box—and to meet many people conducting research into matters such as this. My hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) and I attended a meeting with a number of academics who were examining research into the effects on young people of single mothers going out to work. One thing that particularly struck me was that, the daughters of mothers who went out to work, did better, materially, academically and socially. Why should that be? According to the model suggested by hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, one would think that nurturing at home should be crucial: we all sit down to watch ``Blue Peter'' and have our tea. Surely that is better. However, the research shows that daughters of working mothers had a role model who was economically active—somebody to emulate and aspire to—and who raised expectations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I have seen the same research and I am extremely dubious about it. It includes the alarming statistic that only 7 per cent. of daughters of single mothers who do not work achieve higher educational qualifications. I think that is the research to which my hon. Friend is referring. From that one would assume—as he is doing—that a single mother who does not work one condemns her daughter to a lifetime of low educational qualifications, but that does not follow.
<P>
That statistic may have resulted from the fact that some mothers in those circumstances may come from a socio-economic background where people do not achieve high educational qualifications. There may be 100 reasons for it. One cannot extrapolate from that research that it is bad for single mothers to stay at home. One cannot draw a general conclusion one way or the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I accept what my hon. Friend says, but I would point out politely that the research is in line with my personal experience of seeing the effect of monuments to success on some of the sink estates where I used to be a councillor. One such example was the technology college, where people had the opportunity to get a better education than was available from the local comprehensive and then began to go on to higher education. Expectations started to rise as people realised that they had a choice: they were not confined to a stereotype. The research is in line with that experience. We should not give up on people who say that they come from a particular socio-economic background with a tradition of low academic attainment. It is our job to try to break that cycle of deprivation. This debate and, to a small degree, the amendments address that issue.
<P>
We must ask ourselves what the provision is about. Are we trying to bring in a law that will reflect the changes taking place in society or should the law try to affect the changes in society that we find objectionable? We can think of times when both approaches are appropriate. The aim of the clause is to change what is happening. With great respect to the Liberal Democrats, the advantage of our amendment is that it reflects what is going on. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said that there is a watershed at the age of 10 or 11. When a child is below the age of 10, a smidgeon above 20 per cent. of mothers go out to work, but once a child reaches secondary school age, there is an enormous change and more mothers go out to work. We have tried to draw a line and arrive at a balance.
<P>
I remember a powerful speech on Second Reading of the Welfare Bill last year by the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks). I think that it was the last powerful speech that he made, because he then took the Queen's silver and became a Minister, which stopped him from making powerful speeches. In the context of what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said, the hon. Gentleman said that it was ridiculous that single mothers should not be confronted sensibly with the prospect of work until the youngest child reached the age of 16: it was clearly wrong. He went on to say that to accept the Wisconsin model of three months, which my hon. Friend has referred to, is clearly also wrong. He hoped that there would be a debate, preferably in Committee, where we could decide on a reasonable figure, as both three months and 16 years were unreasonable. We tried, unsuccessfully, to initiate that debate at the time. I think that the response from the hon. Gentleman's predecessor, the hon. Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms), was ``Not on your Nellie. We have no intention of getting into that debate.'' I commend the Government for their brave decision to choose the age of six, because it opens up all the other ages. We have now begun the debate and we must come to a conclusion.
<P>
I remember reading some time ago a judgment by the late Lord Denning, in which he spoke about parental responsibility. He said that when a child is an infant, the parents have absolute responsibility and control and that, as a child goes through adolescence and arrives at the age of 16, those responsibilities and powers disappear. They do not disappear when the child is 15 years, 11 months and 29 days old, but gradually, because of the child's personality. That is why we seek a sensible figure and a balance between the three Opposition views.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Only three?
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Whenever six Conservatives are gathered together, there will be seven opinions on matters such as these. We want to try to pull the arguments together.
<P>
In some cases the age of six will be unsuitable, and in some cases the age of 11 would be unsuitable. Moreover, in some cases, the age of 16 would be unsuitable. However, we must accept that, for most children, the age of 11 represents a natural break. It is normally the break between primary and secondary education, although some local authorities still operate a middle-school system, which would have implications for children aged 14.
<P>
We believe that our proposal makes sense. There is a natural change at the age of 11 in the way in which a child is educated, and in existing working patterns. There is no logic to the proposal for an age limit of six years old. The only significance that I can find for that age is that children in Poland enter the education system at that age. That is not a good reason for introducing a reform in the United Kingdom's pension system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Our NHS is apparently worse than that of Poland.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is a little wide of the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend tempts me, but on this occasion, I must treat his intervention with disdain.
<P>
We are not necessarily agreed on this matter, but we like to think that there is a balance between economic necessity and choice. However, given the levels of income likely to be affected by the state second pension, I was struck by the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham that people will be thinking a great deal more about their immediate income than their state second pension. Our concern is to get the age limit right. We are not certain that either 16 or 11 are the right ages, but we are absolutely certain that the age of six is wrong.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We have had an interesting insight into the psyche of the Opposition today. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove chided us about the consistency of the existing benefit system, which we are in the process of reforming, yet there was no consistency between any of the speeches and views given by Opposition Members. They expressed not just three different opinions, but as many as there are Opposition Members in Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough charitably said that he did not want any mother to be made to go out to work, and that everyone should have a Government adviser to help them deal with such complicated decisions. We are piloting such a scheme. However, the new Conservative policy is that, once a lone parent's child reaches the age of 11, that parent would be not simply given advice or encouraged to take a job, but made to take a job. That policy was developed unannounced by the hon. Gentleman's Front-Bench colleagues, after an interesting speech by the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts). The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar mentioned some of the research that probably formed the basis for the position taken by the hon. Member for Havant.
<P>
Conservative Members' approach towards working women is always schizophrenic. Half of them do not want women to go out to work and think that they should stay chained to the sink, which is their rightful place, while the rest struggle to reconcile their policy positions with what has been going on in the economy for the past 50 years. Whatever they may think, this social change has been happening all around us despite the systems that were put in place during the past century, for 70 years of which there was a Conservative Government. If the Conservatives wanted to create systems that would support children and women in that situation, they had plenty of time in which to do so.
<P>
We are encouraging women to decide whether they want to go out to work or not. That is the basis of our policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Why six?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I shall turn to that in a moment. I have listened to Opposition Members for an hour, and the hon. Gentleman must allow me to make my point.
<P>
When the Government took office, Britain was one of the only countries in Europe that did not have reasonable child care systems. Those that existed were informal and had developed willy-nilly without any desire on the part of previous Governments to ensure that women could have a real, practical choice. The result in social policy of a Government having decided that 16 is the right age at which a mother should no longer be expected to look after her children—which is the current situation—is that more than one million lone parents, many of whom are very poor, bring up a third of this country's children on low incomes. That is clearly socially undesirable, as the hon. Members for Havant and for Brentwood and Ongar have said. It means that an entire segment of the next generation are being brought up not only with poor material prospects, but with no opportunity to see role models at work. That will cause problems for future generations.
<P>
Through the new deal for lone parents, sure start and many of our child care policies, we are attempting to deal with that legacy, which is the result of the neglect of social policy that arose from the schizophrenia that has been exhibited by Conservative Members today. The hon. Member for New Forest, West implied that women should not go out to work and that the state should have no opinion on when a mother should be deemed to have done her best by her children and be able to pursue other interests at work. The hon. Member for Gainsborough seemed to suggest that we should have no opinion as to whether the age should be set at 16. Perhaps his mother should still be getting a home protection allowance for him. We have to take a view on the matter. Front-Bench Conservative Members would compromise by setting the age at 11, while the Liberal Democrats want to keep matters unchanged at 16. I shall explain in a moment why the Bill sets the age at six.
<P>
Leaving aside the antediluvians on the Conservative Benches—I exonerate the two hon. Ladies—we must all be modernisers in this respect. Nine out of 10 lone parents want to work. The figures reveal that women are going out to work in huge numbers, and will soon represent 50 per cent. of the work force. The employment rate for mothers who are in couples rises from 57 per cent. for those with a youngest child aged under five to 72 per cent. for those with a child aged five to nine. That is a huge step up. Fewer lone parents have been able to work because of the policy—with which we are grappling—of dumping them on income support and leaving them to cope with children until they are 16. The employment rate for lone parents increases from 28 per cent. for those with a child under the age of five to 47 per cent. for those with a child over the age of five.
<P>
Clearly, women want to work. We are not forcing them to work; we are providing incentives.
<P>
An anecdotal example can be found in the results of the new deal for lone parents. Currently, 100,000 lone parents are involved. It does not apply to parents of children aged under five. However, 40 per cent. of such parents have volunteered to work, so that they can take advantage of the extra opportunities that the scheme provides. Clearly, there is a demand for women to be able to combine caring with work. We want to facilitate that by providing the incentive to work, but we also want women to be able to accrue, for the first time, a state second pension.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> Perhaps I am alone in this view, but the Under-Secretary has yet to explain why the age should be six. At the moment, she seems to be arguing that there should be no allowance. She says that women of all ages want to work, and that none of the Government's proposals would prevent a woman from doing so, but she has not even begun to address the six-year-old threshold.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I will explain why we have set the age at six—
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We are waiting with bated breath for the Under-Secretary's explanation. Her figures relate to economically active women, and include part-time work, but I hope that she is not disputing that the real change takes place at the ages of 10 and 11. If she wants to dispute that, let her do so with figures.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We have to include part-time work because women often begin with such work. Some women have used the opportunities provided in the new deal for lone parents to increase the hours that they work, rather than to move into the labour market at the first opportunity. We must remember that 30 per cent. of lone parents have no educational qualifications. That is the legacy of a policy that we have inherited of dumping people on income support. We must prepare those who want to enter the labour market by enabling them to access the further education and training that was often denied them through earlier circumstances. We have already given such opportunities to more than 10,000 people.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Under-Secretary should realise that I deliberately chose figures for women in full-time work because it is women in part-time work who are most likely to need credits towards a state second pension. Quoting the total number of women in work does not address the issue of women with children under the age of 11 who need credits towards their second pensions.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Part of my argument is that, as few people would deny, a great unrealised desire and demand exists for women with children to work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> In a minute. Let me finish dealing with this point. We are trying to enable such women to work. I do not deny the relevance of the hon. Lady's figures, but mine are also relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Is the Under-Secretary arguing that home responsibilities protection is a benefit so significant that it will materially affect people's decisions on when to enter the labour market?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman should remember that when the Bill becomes law there will be two kinds of home responsibilities protection—that which credits into the basic pension and continues with the payment of child benefit until age 16, and that which will credit into the state second pension for the years that are the subject of our discussion. Those are two different things. The Bill will not end home responsibilities protection for people who are receiving child benefit for children over the age of six for basic state pension credit purposes. That will remain. This part of the Bill maintains a balance between the extension of opportunities to work and caring responsibilities. We feel that age six, rather than age 16, is the right time.

<P>
Before I explain our reason for deciding on age six, I want to put on record the costs of the amendments. Opposition Members were saying that the Bill was too costly anyway, but their amendments cost even more.
<P>
Amendment No. 144 would cost an extra £2.6 billion between now and 2050—
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> A snip.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> That is an interesting definition of £2.6 billion. By their nature, pension costings must be taken into account over the next 50 years. If Opposition Members were to study the debates that took place when SERPS was slashed in half— replacing the best 20 years with the best 40, which was the worst thing that ever happened to women in the work force—they would find that the costings were based on the fact that it could not be afforded in 2038. That is the nature of pension projections.
<P>
Amendment No. 164 would cost £1.3 billion in one year, by 2050. That is not an agglomeration of everything that would be spent until 2050. People would be credited in each year, for many more years. The Liberal Democrat amendment would add a further 10 years, while the Conservative one would add a further six. I put those costs on the record, as several hon. Members have asked me about them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> Will the Under-Secretary put that in context? What will be the total cost of the change to a state second pension?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It would be several billions of pounds more, because an extra 4 million people would be credited into pension entitlement. There will also be savings, because fewer people will have to rely on means-tested benefit in retirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> How can the Under-Secretary use that logic but condemn the amount? If our amendment were accepted, there would, on the basis of the logic that she just used, be considerable savings. The Under-Secretary has been hoisted by her own rhetoric.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The extra amount that will be spent in 2050 on the state second pension is £6 billion. Amendment No. 144 would account for a further £2.6 billion a year, while amendment No. 164 would account for a further £1.3 billion a year. Those are the costs.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the Under-Secretary confirm that the second option for rebates, which the Government chose, will reach a total of £18 billion by 2050?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Lady will have to wait for that to be debated in detail at the appropriate time. I do not intend to debate rebates, or how to make a transition from an existing system to that which is under discussion. That is not helpful.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It is the cost.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> But there are savings as a result of the transition from SERPS, which are on the credit side.
<P>
The hon. Lady should read the report that was produced by the Government Actuary's Department, which uses very simple rhetoric.
<P>
Why was the age of six chosen? Most children will have started school by the age of five, but we did not want to use that age because of the annualised nature of the accrual rate in pensions. If the age of six is used, it will be possible for the mother to receive five annual credits for one child before the crediting in arrangements for the state second pension end. I acknowledge that our choice of age may appear to be odd. The annualised nature of the accruals rate means that everyone will be credited in for five years, until their youngest is at school. The extra time will also give a mother whose child starts school time to think about what to do about work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> If the Under-Secretary is arguing that six is the right age because of the annualised nature of the credits and that the mother could go back to work when the child reaches that age, why do not the Government change the rules and take single mothers off income support if their youngest child is above the age of six?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We are trying to give women with children active choices, not to create compulsions that will apply to them. We will help mothers who wish to enter the labour market—there is such a demand—to do so. Such choices are available in other areas of social policy, including our child care provisions and the new deal for lone parents. We do not believe that women whose children are that young should be forced to go out to work. The best route out of poverty for a lone parent is to return to the labour market. That also gives a good role model to children. Problems are created when women are dumped on income support and left there for 16 years. Those problems have been belatedly acknowledged by the Opposition Front Bench, if not by Conservative Back Benchers.
<P>
Amendment No. 144 would mean that someone receiving child benefit for a child under the age of 16 would accrue entitlement to the state second pension in any tax year when they earn below the level of the annual lower earnings limit. Amendment No. 164 would have the same effect for someone receiving child benefit for a child under the age of 11.
<P>
The state second pension is designed to give most help to those who are least able to afford to make their own provision. We want to give people the incentive to make their own provision when they can. We have to get the balance right between crediting people in and giving them incentives to make their own provision when they can afford to do so. That is why we have focused on the mothers of children who are below school age—we recognise that they have few opportunities to earn above the lower earnings limit. Mothers of school-age children combine their caring duties with part-time work and many will benefit from the state second pension's low earner's boost if they earn as little as £3,432.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> How will the state second pension help mothers who return to the labour market on a part-time basis and who earn less than the lower earnings limit? They are doing what the Government want—they are seeking work—but the work that is available or their choices about caring may mean that they cannot secure an income that is above the lower earnings limit.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Some people do not earn above the lower earnings limit of £3,432 a year. Earning more than that is not a huge hurdle, although I acknowledge that some women with part-time jobs involving very few hours do not earn above that and are not credited into the state second pension. We have put the balance in the appropriate place.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman must remember that we are discussing a contributory benefit that emphasises the advantages of work. Without crediting everybody in, we have not found a way of crediting in people who work very few hours, and I acknowledge that there is a gap there. We have set the lower earnings limit—or hurdle, if the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam wants to see it in that way—at about the right level. Many people will earn more, but I acknowledge that some people will fall below it. The hon. Gentleman must also recognise that just over 4.5 million low earners will benefit from the creation of a state second pension, and 70 per cent. of them—around 3 million—will be women. Therefore, that is where the line has been drawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Under-Secretary has been very helpful, but I cannot square her statement that the measure is all about balance and targeting women on low incomes with her earlier statement that the accrual rate is six years. Is it a fortuitous coincidence that the balancing and the targeting are at the same period as the accrual rate?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The accrual rate must be on an annual basis simply because that is how the national insurance contribution system works, on which all additional pension is based. As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said, we do not think it clever to rip up that system when we are trying to build on it. Six years will give a mother child five years' crediting into the state second pension before her child goes to school. That is a significant benefit. We think that when her child goes to school, a mother, if she so desires, can go out and get a job. If she gets a job and earns more than £3,432 a year, she continues to be credited in and to get the low earner's boost just as if she had earned the £9,500 a year to which my right hon. Friend referred in previous debates.
<P>
Hon. Members should recognise that this is a far more generous pension provision than has ever been made for women in part-time or low-paid employment. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I fear that I shall not, and I shall explain why. First, the measure introduces yet more complications into the system. We have established that we now have two systems of home responsibilities protection. The Minister of State told us in an earlier debate about the need to expend vast sums of money and a great deal of energy on raising awareness of the change in the system, the difficulties that that might arise and the need for a great deal of publicity about that change—a big change, as he rightly said. However, we are now being told that there will be two systems—HRP that applies to the basic state pension and HRP that will apply to a state second pension. That is a recipe for further confusion.
<P>
The Under-Secretary argued that underpinning the change from 16 to six for the state second pension demonstrates the Government's commitment to their lone-parent strategy and that the measure is part of that strategy to deal with the legacy, as she described it, of past failure to address the needs of lone parents and the consequences for their children. However, the Bill is not the appropriate place to pursue that strategy. The Government have put in place a range of measures to pursue that strategy. To use that as the cover for this change, which we now know will save the Government some £2.6 billion on the overall scheme—if one works it back the other way—is intriguing, to say the least.
<P>
I do not find the Under-Secretary's argument persuasive, not least because of the use of data related to the economic activity of women. That argument does not hold water, as she said that the Government's feeling was that six was about the right figure.
<P>
According to 1998 research, one in six women are earning less than the lower earnings limit. If the Government's intention is to lift people out of means testing, which the Green Paper says is what the state second pension is about, we are consigning a large number of women to live on the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
Yet the Government's argument against the amendments has focused on lone parents.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our argument is clear. There should be no confusion: there should be one home responsibilities protection rate, which should be set at 16 to reflect the diversity of women's responsibilities and enable the people who make the choices to receive a contribution to a state second pension without the prospect of having to live on Government's minimum income guarantee. As a result, the Government would make savings. I should be interested to hear whether the £2.3 million—
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Billion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Billion. I should like to know whether it is a net or gross figure. We shall press our amendment, because the Government's arguments have not persuaded us to seek to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I want to set the record straight. The Under-Secretary clearly misunderstood everything that I said. That may be my fault for not having been clear in saying it, so let me be clear.
<P>
The Under-Secretary was correct to identify that I was uncomfortable with the notion that the state should have a view as to when it was proper for a woman with a child to take on the additional responsibility of work. Nevertheless, I accepted that it had to take that view because it had the taxpayer's interest to protect. The question therefore turns on how old a child should be when a woman makes that decision.
<P>
I suggested that the age of 11, being in accordance with social trends, was preferable to the age of six that the Under-Secretary has selected. She has given us the reasons for selecting six. Frankly, I did not find them persuasive, and it comes back to the point that she made. She said that it was not an insignificant incentive. She said that it was £2.6 billion a year's worth of incentive. I suspect that that will have an impact on behaviour. I do not believe that it is proper for the Government to seek to change people's behaviour in that way, with all sorts of consequences, foreseen and unforeseen.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> What began as a polite discussion about the age at which mothers might wish to go out to work has turned into a firecracker of a debate, which reflects many of our debates over the years on choice versus compulsion. It is clear that the Government's view in making their changes in social policy is that when a child is aged five or six, women should go out to work. All the incentives will be built into the system so that they have little option but to do so. The Under-Secretary presents the measure as an active choice. There is not much active choice if a woman is to be done down by the state second pension, has to take part in the new deal, whether she wishes to or not and even if she feels able to and wants to look after her children, and has to send them to nursery school earlier than she wants.
<P>
Women are constantly being confined and constrained. I accept what the Under-Secretary says about long-term social changes and women's desire to go out to work. The figures that we have quoted on women who work full time and part time illustrate those changes, as does the number of women sitting in this Room. However, the compulsion element is anathema to Opposition Members—
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> There is no compulsion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The right hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that there is no compulsion, but I disagree. As a result of changes that the Government are making, women will have to go out work whether they want to or not.
<P>
If I were to discuss the economy, Sir David, I am sure that you would rule me out of order, but, should there be an economic downturn, an inevitable consequence of the provision will be great unhappiness and job losses. The Government are able to introduce this social policy because the economy is currently expanding and jobs are available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I apologise for making a sedentary intervention. This has been a good debate and it has been handled admirably by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. Under the previous Government, how much SERPS money did such mothers receive when looking after their kids?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has forgotten that we put in train the availability of SERPS—
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The previous Government did not introduce it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It was to be introduced in 1999. I would have loved to have been in government in 1999; unfortunately, the wrong party is now in power.
<P>
Until now, I have resisted mentioning that, by reducing women's access to an additional pension by 10 years, the provision will make yet another hidden cut in the Department of Social Security's budget. I was also appalled by the Under-Secretary's complacent attitude towards the question of part-time working mothers of children above the age of six having access to additional pensions. She seemed happy for full credit to be given until children are aged six. However, in essence, she said that mothers who work part time for low pay—even she agrees with our figures on the number of women who work full time—will have five years of less than full credit, until they enter full-time employment when their children reach the age of 11.
<P>
The Government are compelling women to work as soon as their children reach the age of six. They are prepared to allow low-paid mothers to lose credits for about five years. They are trying to save £1.3 billion or £2.6 billion a year, depending on whether one applies the 11-year-old or 16-year-old threshold. Yet, at the same time, according to the explanatory notes, they are prepared to spend more than £18 billion on stakeholder pension rebates. That is illogical. Moreover, the total cost of the state second pension exercise will be £5 billion.
<P>
Our amendment reflects the work pattern that women want and have developed, and would help them to enjoy the best possible retirement. We recognise that women want flexibility and choice, and it is not for the Government to dictate when someone should work and when they should not.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 165, in page 25, line 1, leave out from `satisfying' to the end of line 2 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the conditions set out in paragraphs 2(a) or 3 and 4 of the Social Security Pensions (Home Responsibilities) Regulations 1994.'.<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 182, in clause 32, page 30, line 26, leave out `prescribed'.
<P>
No. 183, in clause 32, page 30, line 28, after `State', and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`This information must be provided by the end of the first year following the year in which the qualifying caring activity took place.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I need to spend a little time explaining the amendments. They have a similar theme, which is to set out more clearly what the Secretary of State will prescribe under further regulations in various circumstances. A complication arises because amendment No. 165 refers to clause 28, while amendments Nos. 182 and 183 refer to clause 32. Those clauses may seem some distance apart, but the implication is much the same in each case.
<P>
Amendment No. 165 refers to the Social Security Pensions (Home Responsibilities) Regulations 1994. Under the Bill, home responsibilities protection applies to someone on the condition of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``his satisfying such other condition as may be prescribed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the explanatory notes define those conditions more closely. People are eligible if they receive income support because they care for a sick or disabled person, or if they spend at least 35 hours a week caring for a person who receives attendance allowance or the care component in disability living allowance at the middle or highest rate.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If that is the only prescription, the Bill should say so. If it is not the only prescription, we would like to know what the other prescriptions are. Otherwise, the wide statement in the Bill might allow the Secretary of State to bring in all kinds of other provisions without consulting Parliament. We all know how the opportunities that Secretaries of State have been given to make their own regulations and decisions have led to some interesting results.
<H4><center>[MISS JULIE KIRKBRIDE in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
I think that the Minister alluded to clause 32 in an earlier debate, when he spoke about tightening the amount of time for which somebody can apply for home responsibilities protection. I was therefore slightly surprised by the bracketing together, but I understand that it is because we are considering the same regulations. I understand why the Government might want to tighten that up. As the Minister said, the provision has been in place since 1978, and people's memories fade over time, especially if the records of 22 years ago are not as good as they could have been.
<H4><center>[SIR DAVID MADEL in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
The Government are planning to require notifications to be made by the end of the third year following the year in which the qualifying caring activity took place. Amendment No. 182, would delete the word ``prescribed'', while amendment No. 183 would reduce the period to one year. We acknowledge that that is a tough proposal. Given that it is only a year in which one can accrue S2P credits, it would provide plenty of time for the notification. The Government's intentions should be clarified. The ability to prescribe gives the Secretary of State wide powers to change other conditions.
<P>
The Minister referred to the ability to claim dating from 1978. I immediately wondered whether that ability will continue from 1978 until the Bill is enacted, or the regulations come into force, or whether it will be backdated so that people who have not yet claimed will not be able to do so unless they fall within the scope of the three years. Some clarification of that point would be useful.
<P>
The matter is complex. It centres on an issue to which Conservative Members frequently return—that is, the power of the Secretary of State to make regulations with no specification as to their nature or whether they may be subject to additions, deletions or other changes. Will the Under-Secretary assure us that the Government have no intention of widening or closing down the options? These are probing amendments, but it would be helpful if she would accept their underlying intention, if not their wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall be brief, because we shall return to this subject when we reach the clause 32 stand part debate.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary give us some feel for the numbers of people who will be affected by the change and the way in which the current system works in terms of the numbers that present at different times? When I asked about that before, I was told that no information was available. I accept that when one asks such a question the response depends partly on how the question has been framed; if it has been framed incorrectly, the answer, while being what one asked for, will not necessarily be the one that is required. On this occasion, I hope that the Under-Secretary can tell us how long people leave it before they apply for home responsibilities protection.
<P>
I am concerned about one of the amendments, which would further tighten the period in which someone would be able to claim HRP. Unless the scale of the campaign to which the Under-Secretary referred is great enough to raise awareness of HRP—which is complex to explain and not generally well appreciated until later in life—it is possible that a large number of people will wake up to it too late and develop a sense of grievance. A one-off campaign to raise awareness would be insufficient—a continuous campaign is required to ensure that each succeeding generation of pensioners is aware at an early enough stage. In the context of the clause, that is within at least three years of ending their caring responsibilities; under the Conservative proposals, it would be within a year.
<P>
The Government should be considering ways in which notification from the Benefits Agency to those in receipt of invalid care allowance can be automatically triggered at end of their period of caring responsibilities to inform them that they now have an entitlement to HRP and ask them to claim it. Some benefits, such as child benefit, automatically clock up credits; ICA is not one of them. Surely it is not beyond the wit of those who revise the computer systems to programme in the necessary automatic notification so that there is no doubt that the person knows that they should be making the application for HRP that is necessary in order to get those credits. That is crucial to making this significant change work out fairly from the point of view of the individual.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The Government recognise the important and valuable work that is done by those who care for small children or the disabled. The introduction of the state second pension will give carers the opportunity to build up entitlement to a second-tier pension for the first time. We estimate that 2 million carers will benefit. In the state second pension a qualifying carer will be treated as if they had earnings of £9,500, which means, in broad terms, that they will get £1 a week of second pension for each qualifying year of caring.
<P>
A qualifying carer will be someone who is entitled to invalid care allowance, is receiving child benefit for a child under six or has been given home responsibilities protection because they are caring for a disabled person. We have specified the first two groups in the Bill, but the qualifying criteria for HRP for caring for a sick and disabled person are set out in secondary legislation, as the hon. Member for Beckenham recognised.
<P>
Amendment No. 165 would require the criteria to be set out in the Bill. Following legal advice, we did not consider it appropriate to refer in the Bill to criteria set out in secondary legislation. However, I can confirm—I hope that this will reassure the hon. Lady—that we intend that the criteria to be prescribed will be those set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Social Security Pensions (Home Responsibilities) Regulations 1994. The regulations provide for a person to be treated as being precluded from regular employment by responsibilities at home if they receive income support without needing to be available for work because they are caring for a sick or disabled person or if they spend at least 35 hours a week caring for a person who receives attendance allowance, constant care allowance or the care component of disability living allowance at the middle or highest rate.
<P>
I want to correct a mistake that we discovered in the explanatory notes, in case anyone is confused by it. It is in the third paragraph on page 58, which refers to new section 44A(2)(c). The error was to include paragraph 2(a) of the 1994 regulations, which relates to receiving child benefit, in the conditions to be prescribed for qualifying for the state second pension. We have already specified in the Bill receipt of child benefit for a child under six, so it does not need to be specified again. We are concerned here with paragraphs 3 and 4 of the regulations, which set out the qualifying criteria for those who receive HRP because they care for a sick or disabled person. It might have been slightly confusing. It was an obvious error, for which we apologise. We pointed it out when we circulated to the Committee the tables which, because of the antiquated way in which Committees work, we are not allowed to show on the wall at the back of the Room to explain how state second pension accruals work.
<P>
Clause 32, which enables us to make regulations to require that a person who wishes to have periods of caring taken into account when their pension entitlement is assessed, supplies us with the necessary information. I shall explain the current position. HRP is designed to protect the basic pension position of those who cannot work regularly because they are caring for a child or a sick or disabled person. HRP reduces by up to half the number of years that a person needs to qualify for a full basic pension. It cannot be claimed to protect an individual's additional pension entitlement.
<P>
The Bill changes that by adding entitlement to additional pension for the first time. A person who is receiving child benefit for a child under 16 is automatically given HRP for any year in which they have no earnings or have earnings below the lower earnings limit, but someone who cannot work because they are caring for a sick or disabled person and has not claimed ICA must apply for HRP. That is because we have no way of identifying such people unless they contact us to tell us that they are caring for somebody. At present they can do that at any time up to state pension age for periods going back to 1978.
<P>
I cannot answer the question from the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, because we do not know how many people will be affected. There may be people who intend to inform us—but have not yet done so—for HRP with respect to SERPS that they have been caring for a number of years. Under current regulations they do not have to do so until they retire.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When an application is made a considerable time after the period of caring, it can be difficult if not impossible to verify the information. Such a claim may be made 20 or 30 years after a period of caring. That also increases the risk that carers will forget to ask for the qualifying period to be taken into account, because the relevant events occurred so long ago. It may be impossible to verify information in such cases.
<P>
Giving carers access to the state second pension will be much more generous than the current regulations, which involve reducing the number of qualifying years that are needed to obtain the basic pension. Crediting people in to the state second pension will be much more generous. There will be no limit to the number of years that can qualify. A lifetime carer would not be entitled to a basic pension because HRP cannot reduce by half the qualifying number of years and it certainly cannot reduce them to zero. A lifetime carer will be entitled to up to 49 years of state second pension, which will be a huge extra boost to the additional pension for lifetime carers.
<P>
In view of that approach, accurate verification will be much more important. The potential loss to carers of overlooked claims will be greater. We intend to deal with that difficulty by introducing a time limit, which we discussed earlier. It will require the claimant to notify us by the end of the third year following the year in which the qualifying caring activity took place. Amendment No. 182 would prevent us from taking that sensible step by removing the relevant powers from the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendment No. 183 would require individuals to supply information every year. We believe that that would be over-bureaucratic and would place a significant burden on carers and on the Department. Our approach strikes the right balance. It will allow records to be checked to confirm entitlement and any entitlement to be recorded when the person reaches retirement age.
<P>
Under the state second pension, those receiving child benefit for a child under six years of age will automatically be given entitlement to the state second pension where they have no earnings or earnings below the lower earnings limit. Similarly, carers receiving, or with underlying entitlement to, invalid care allowance will also automatically be given entitlement to the state second pension. Only those who choose not to claim ICA but who are entitled to home responsibilities protection because they are caring for a sick or disabled person will need to supply the necessary information within the new time limit.
<P>
Some people will be credited automatically because they are in contact with us and we know which categories they fall into, but others will have to apply.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Under-Secretary is probably coming to this point, but I encourage her to return to retrospection.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> That was literally the next point that I was going to raise. The hon. Lady and I obviously have a similar structure to our minds.
<P>
The requirement to provide information within the time limit will apply to periods from the introduction of the state second pension onwards. There will be no retrospection; the proposal will start when it starts. The previous SERPS entitlements will continue until the proposal is introduced. We shall not attempt to credit in people retrospectively. I hope that it makes sense to say that the scheme will start when it is introduced.
<P>
We intend to publicise the change extensively in ways that are targeted at those who are most likely to be affected. Committee members are aware that similar proposals have failed to work previously.
<P>
For basic pension purposes, people will still be able to provide information that relates to periods between 1978 and the introduction of the state second pension until they reach retirement age. There will be a split in the benefits that HRP will confer. The basic state pension will remain the same, but access to state second pension credits will begin when the state second pension has started. The system is hard to explain but quite simple when one thinks about it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> May I perhaps express the matter in a different way? The conditions for home responsibility payments under SERPS will remain until everyone has passed through the system.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Yes, clearly.
<P>
With those explanations in mind, I hope that Committee members will appreciate the importance of verifying information given, accept that a time limit of three years strikes a reasonable balance, and reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful for that explanation. I am certainly relieved about the lack of retrospection, because I could foresee queues of people at our constituency surgeries. On amendment No. 165, I am glad to have the reassurance that the regulations will go no further than the explanatory notes suggest. Can the Under-Secretary assure me that the regulations will not leave loopholes for future conditions—we are all familiar with catch-all phrases—and that only the two conditions that we discussed will apply?
<P>
On amendment No. 183, it is purely a matter of opinion as to whether a time limit of three years or one is necessary, and I suggest that the latter is not a bad idea. When caring comes to an end, the issue will be fresher in the mind after one year than three, and certainly fresher than after the 20-odd-year limit that has applied until now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Does the hon. Lady accept that, all too often, caring responsibilities do not end when the person who is being cared for dies? After death, some of the carer's time is spent dealing with the deceased's affairs rather than his or her own. Reducing the time limit to a year will increase the pressure and the possibility of rough justice.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I would have a lot of sympathy with that point, but I doubt whether the Government would, because they introduced a six-month limit for a widow returning to work, on the ground that the grieving has been done by then. Of course, the Minister and the Under-Secretary were not privy to debates on this subject that took place last year. If a widow is capable of returning to work after six months, she is equally capable of applying for these credits.
<P>
Had the Government been willing to accept our amendments, we might not have reached this point, and a limit of three years might have seemed more reasonable. When someone has been bereaved, part of the grieving process is downloading such administrative matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Let me put this thought to my hon. Friend. As with widows' benefits, perhaps we should look to the other place to bring justice.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Indeed, on clause 28, Members of the other place have been doing quite well. Let us hope that they have equal success with our own clause 32, and that the Government think again about the time limit.
<P>
I can see arguments on both sides. To reduce the time limit from 22 years—which is the period from 1978 to the present day—to three years would be a terrible shock. To reduce it yet further to one year would be an even bigger shock. After a year, people are still focused; after three years, the issue may become more diffuse. Moreover, the Department might be able to check records more easily within a year than after three years.
<P>
Finally, I agree with the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam about the necessary advertising campaign. The Minister spoke recently about the advertising campaign that he plans for—
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The minimum income guarantee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the Minister.
<P>
I did not have time to comment on it, but it struck me that he was talking about a standard campaign involving leaflets, posters and television advertisements. We know from our experience over the years that such a campaign will not work. SERPS involves a different argument and I look forward to the Government's decision about widows' inheritance in relation to SERPS. I expect it in 2002, because nothing that the Minister has said so far leads me to expect anything else.
<P>
Dealing with information in this manner—as those of us who live and die by the printed word, the computer, the television and the radio are beginning to discover—does not necessarily have an impact on those who really need to know about their benefits. We take it for granted that everyone wants to read leaflets, but they do not—no matter how jazzy we make them. It is difficult to get information across, and the Government should adopt a more proactive campaign to inform people of this change and of those relating to the minimum income guarantee. We can no longer rely on leaflets, radio, television and posters. People do not respond to those methods, as we have seen over the years.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am told that I have, on occasion, mentioned home responsibilities protection for SERPS, which does not exist. I should, instead, have referred to home responsibilities protection for the basic state pension. If I made such a slip of the tongue, I take this opportunity to correct it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham is right about the advertising campaign. I hope that, with the introduction of annual statements, people will focus more on the issues relating to pensions. We know how difficult it is to get anyone to do that, and how complex those issues can be for experts, let alone for people who do not want to think too much about them, especially when they are young.
<P>
I recognise that this is a difficult area, but we shall do out best to get our message across to carers that they must notify us within three years. I hope that carers' organisations will help us with that. We have decided, on balance, that three years, rather than one year, will be about right. It will certainly be better than the current 22-year limit, as the hon. Lady pointed out. Had SERPS carried on, that requirement could have gone up to 40 years. Clearly, that would not be compatible with the extra benefits that will be available under the state second pension. We must guard the gateways to those with proper, verifiable information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Minister ensure, in developing the publicity campaign, that new, clear guidance will be given to the front-of-shop staff in Benefits Agency offices on the advice that they should give to those seeking information on caring benefits?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I will do my best to ensure that. The rules relating to those benefits can be very complex, and not all Benefits Agency staff are as up-to-date on their details as those who administer them. We shall issue the information and hope that it will receive an appropriate response.
<P>
Finally, on the question of loopholes in relation to home responsibilities protection, we do not anticipate adding anything to the provision, although I cannot speak for any future Government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sure that we shall return to this matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> On a point of order, Sir David.
<P>
I have not had a chance to come back to the Committee on a matter that we debated earlier. When we were discussing amendments Nos. 147, 148 and 149, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam withdrew the amendment more quickly than I expected, and I have been handed a correction regarding something that I said. I want to clarify the matter for the record.
<P>
I gave the distinct impression that it was possible to mix and match different benefits in the same year, in order to accrue credits for the state second pension. It is not possible to do that within the same year. I take full responsibility for that error made during the course of the debate.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Kevin Hughes.]

Adjourned accordingly at two minutes past Seven o'clock till Thursday 10 February at Ten o'clock.
