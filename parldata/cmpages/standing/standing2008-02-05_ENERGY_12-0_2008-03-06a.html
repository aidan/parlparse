						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000223"></a>The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Good morning
to you, Mrs. Humble, and to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="08030642000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make a
very brief introduction to the clause. As hon. Members know, one of the
themes in the Bill is the decommissioning of various infrastructure
involving oil and gas drilling and exploitation, as well as gas storage
in the future. The Bill also focuses on the decommissioning around
carbon capture and storage in the future, decommissioning relating to
nuclear, which we discussed at useful length recently, and the
decommissioning of renewables.</div>
					<a name="08030642000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause concerns renewables
and their eventual decommissioning. The Government are committed to
ensuring that renewables play an increasingly important role in the
UK&#146;s energy mix. It is anticipated that a large proportion of
the renewable electricity in the future will be generated offshore. The
reforms of the renewables obligation, as we discussed in part 2, are
intended to support that growth by providing increased levels of
support to the offshore wind
industry.</div>
					<a name="08030642000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a signatory to the United Nations convention on the law of the sea, the
Government have international obligations to ensure that redundant
offshore installations are removed from the sea bed to ensure safety of
navigation and to ensure the protection of fisheries and the rest of
the marine environment.</div>
					<a name="08030642000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08030642000224"></a>
							<b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): I am grateful to the Minister for
giving way quite so early. Can he tell us how many turbines he is
considering in relation to this? In particular, the Government have
talked about  33 GW of offshore wind, so that is the 8 GW plus
25 GW. Does he expect that to be the installed capacity or the
available power? In other words, if there was a 40 per cent. load
factor, one would need more than that to get 33 GW. Therefore, is that
the total capacity or the actual output?</div>
					<a name="08030642000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000225"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Perhaps I can come back with the details later. The
Secretary of State has indicated that, in a future licensing round,
that kind of capacity will be available. It will be subject to
environmental assessment and so on, so it is difficult at this stage to
predict precisely the number of offshore wind turbines. As I understand
the developments&#151;and this is a matter for the commercial
sector&#151;we may well see much larger 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>wind turbines in the future. There is a lot of work going on offshore
and I know that our new Energy Technologies Institute is interested in
the implications of offshore wind and whether future technology might
be different from the onshore wind turbines that we have had. If I can
return to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific question at some stage,
I will.</div>
					<a name="08030642000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">In line with
the &#147;polluter pays&#148; principle, sections 105 to 114 of the
Energy Act 2004 introduced a statutory decommissioning scheme for
offshore wind and marine energy installations. The provisions in
chapter 2 of the Bill are intended to strengthen the decommissioning
scheme in the 2004 Act. The clause will add associates of the developer
into the list of persons from whom the Secretary of State may require a
decommissioning programme.</div>
					<a name="08030642000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 65
ensures that funds set aside for decommissioning cannot be accessed by
creditors in the event of a company becoming insolvent and will be
available only for the purpose that they were originally set aside for.
Clause 66 ensures that the Secretary of State has access to the
necessary information when making a judgment on the suitability and
financial viability of a decommissioned programme put forward by an
operator.</div>
					<a name="08030642000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
mentioned, clause 64 amends the Energy  Act 2004 by adding
associates of the developer, such as a parent company, to the list of
persons from whom the Secretary of State may require a decommissioned
programme. The ability to require a decommissioned programme from an
associate follows practice in the offshore oil and gas sector, which is
set out in section 30 of the Petroleum Act 1998. It seeks to ensure
that the costs of decommissioning can be met without recourse to the
taxpayer in cases where the developer does not have the financial
resources to meet those costs, but the associate does. The issue of not
having recourse to the taxpayer is central to our decommissioning
programme.</div>
					<a name="08030642000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08030642000226"></a>
							<b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): As the Minister says, the clause
defines an associate, and again we have the issue of definition. When
we queried the threshold last time, the Minister said that we would
come to it&#151;I think with reference to oil and gas but it applies
here as well. Under the clause, an associated company would own more
than half of the share capacity, but under the nuclear provision, it
would be 20 per cent. of capacity. Does the Minister not think that
there is a risk of companies organising their business to get under the
50 per cent. threshold here? If it was necessary to add a 20 per cent.
threshold for nuclear, why does the same consideration not apply to
this clause as
well?</div>
					<a name="08030642000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000227"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I think, as we discussed when we considered the
nuclear issue, that the issues at stake when it comes to nuclear are
mighty big ones in terms of the decommissioning costs. As we noted,
hundreds of millions of pounds are involved, and then there is the
sheer importance of an effective decommissioning of a nuclear plant and
of disposing of the waste in the ways that we have discussed. That
might be why we were advised to be more rigorous when it comes to
nuclear, but the provisions here, by looking at associated companies,
are prudent in terms of safeguarding the taxpayer.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div>
					<a name="08030642000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Provided
the associate has adequate financial resources, the new power will
enable the Secretary of State to approve a decommissioning plan that
would otherwise have had to be rejected if it had come from a developer
with inadequate financial resources of its own. The clause will provide
greater clarity and certainty for developers and investors by giving
the Secretary of State more options to approve decommissioning
programmes in a wider range of circumstances, with a wider range of
developers. As a result, we will have firmer foundations for growing
the robust and internationally competitive offshore renewables sector
that we all wish to see.</div>
					<a name="08030642000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the purposes of the
provisions in this chapter of the Bill, the clause includes a test used
to define associates. A company&#151;let us say company A&#151;is
an associate of another company, B, if A controls B or if a third
company controls both A and
B.</div>
					<a name="08030642000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, these provisions will further improve the business environment
for offshore renewables by providing the Secretary of State with
greater flexibility in approving decommissioning programmes. They will
now allow the Secretary of State to look to a controlling associate for
a decommissioning programme where the developer does not have
sufficient assets of its own. That is already the case for oil and gas.
These new provisions should allow more programmes to be approved, which
in turn will assist more offshore renewables  projects to
proceed.</div>
					<a name="08030642000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">On associate
definitions, definitions are consistent with the oil and gas regime.
The difference from the nuclear regime reflects, as I was saying, the
greater liabilities and we mentioned as an example somewhere between
&#163;600 million and &#163;900 million. The hon. Member for
Northavon is interested in the noughts and there are quite a few
noughts there.</div>
					<a name="08030642000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that that is the answer&#151;we just need greater rigour and
greater safeguards when it comes to nuclear energy, so we have
&#163;600 million or more compared with, say, &#163;10 million for
offshore wind energy. I do not think it is a full answer to the hon.
Member for Wealden&#146;s question but it might help if I say that at
the moment there are currently some 394 MW of installed offshore
renewable energy generating capacity in the UK, with a further 3.1 GW
of capacity consented. There is a further 2.1 GW of generating capacity
under consideration, with another 3 GW expected from developers that
have been issued with round 1 or round 2 licences from the Crown
Estate.</div>
					<a name="08030642000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question about 33 GW in the future, we are not in a
centrally planned state, so one cannot predict that that will be the
amount. We have tried to facilitate those kinds of developments, but I
am advised that it is roughly 2 MW per turbine at the present time.
However, as I indicated, the feeling I get from industry is that in
future, some of these offshore capacities could be much larger, so the
number of turbines would therefore be smaller than the current
arithmetic might
dictate.</div>
					<a name="08030642000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000228"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mrs. Humble. It is also a great pleasure to find that our
friends from the Liberal Democrats are here with us today, still in
their
posts.</div>
					<a name="08030642000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">

that.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div>
					<a name="08030642000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000230"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Exactly. Had I had a chance to get to it earlier,
I would have done so. However, whether the Liberal Democrats are here
to abstain in person or whether they will be voting against one another
remains to be seen.</div>
					<a name="08030642000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
touched on some important issues during the Minister&#146;s speech.
We have to get a greater understanding of the order of magnitude that
we are looking at. He says that we do not live in a centrally planned
economy&#151;sometimes it feels a bit like that, but I realise that
we cannot determine exactly how many turbines there should be. However,
there is a fundamental issue as to whether the Government&#146;s idea
for 33 GW is for installed capacity or total output. If it is total
output, one needs many more turbines to deliver that, because the load
factor offshore is typically about 40 per cent. If one wants to get 33
GW of output, 80 GW of installed capacity is needed. So, we are looking
at a massively different order of magnitude. To understand the
decommissioning process, we need greater clarity on this
issue.</div>
					<a name="08030642000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08030642000231"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): Does my hon. Friend share
my concern about the lack of attention that has been given to the
possible effect on our very busy shipping lanes&#151;particularly
between Britain and France&#151;if there is to be an explosion in the
number of offshore wind
farms?</div>
					<a name="08030642000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000232"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> In some cases, I am relatively relaxed about it.
Many of the offshore turbines will be built on sandbanks, which is the
logical place to put them&#151;shipping should not be going where
there are sandbanks. In most cases that would be all right. However, if
one looks at the potential numbers, an enormous amount of the turbines
would have to be put into deep waters. To take that a stage further, 33
GW of output, if it was 2 MW per turbine, is 16,000 turbines. If one
needed the 80-plus GW to deliver that amount of
output&#151;</div>
					<a name="08030642000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000233"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> To help the hon. Gentleman, the  33 GW is
for installed
capacity.</div>
					<a name="08030642000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000234"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Right. Now that raises an entirely different
challenge for the Minister, which is that if one has only 33 GW of
installed capacity, the total output from that will be about 8 GW. The
Government cannot meet their European commitments with 8 GW of wind
power. If we are getting only 8 GW of power from
them&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Sorry, I mean 12 GW; I
bow to the economics graduate maths of my colleagues. We will be unable
to get close to the European commitment of 15 per cent. of our energy
to come from renewable sources by 2020. The Government cannot have it
both ways&#151;we need greater clarity from them on
this.</div>
					<a name="08030642000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are, however,
still looking at a huge number of turbines. If one wants 33 GW of
installed capacity, at  2 MW per turbine that will come out at
16,000 turbines. Even if one goes to the highest expectation for how
powerful those turbines could be, which is potentially 5 MW, one is
still looking at an enormous number of turbines&#151;7,000. The
physical construction programme implications of that&#151;how many
can be built each day&#151;present a major challenge.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div>
					<a name="08030642000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
now have a gaping hole between the renewables that they think they can
achieve and what will be their commitment to the European Union to meet
their 2020 target. I hope that the Minister can give us some assurances
on how we can deliver this, because the Government are trying to have
it both
ways.</div>
					<a name="08030642000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
other issues need clarifying. Who will be responsible for inspecting
offshore renewable installations to ensure that they are still safe? We
are looking, potentially, at thousands of offshore turbines. They will
have sophisticated remote monitoring systems to show how they are
working and how much electricity they are generating. However, that is
not the same as having up-to-the-minute information on the safety of an
installation. Just this week, we saw pictures in the papers of a wind
turbine disintegrating in the force of the wind. What will happen if
they start to break up? How will the process work for requiring the
immediate dismantling of the residual elements of a turbine? A
fractured turbine is a much greater danger in relation to shipping and
others issues than a turbine with all its blades in
place.</div>
					<a name="08030642000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably,
this also relates to underwater installations. How will they be
monitored and by whom? Who will determine that such installations have
stopped working permanently and are genuinely at the end of their
lives? Will there be a certification of worthiness, so that an
inspector can say that an installation&#146;s useful life is over,
even if the operator does not
agree?</div>
				
					<a name="08030642000199"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
					<a name="08030642000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000235"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> There is also the question of installations being
liable to possible terrorist
attack.</div>
					<a name="08030642000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000236"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> That is always going to be a risk in our current
environment. One needs to be able to react quickly when there is a
terrorist atrocity and to ensure that the installations affected have
been made safe and decommissioned effectively.</div>
					<a name="08030642000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister also tell us
more about how the decommissioning fund will work? Over what period
will the operator contribute to the fund? Will there be a standard
formula or different options? How much will need to be put into the
fund before a wind farm starts operating? Who will manage the fund, and
who will establish how much needs to be put in and whether it needs to
be topped up from time to time?</div>
					<a name="08030642000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final point relates to the
Severn barrage or potential Severn lagoons. I am not certain whether
that counts as an offshore or between-shore installation, but it would
be useful to know from the Minister whether it is covered. I assume
that a Severn barrage would be designed and constructed to be
permanent, and not to be decommissioned at all. The hope is that it
would be generating power over many decades, with parts replaced as
necessary. Therefore, does there need to be a decommissioning fund for
a project such as the Severn barrage or would it be exempt from the
rules that the Minister is
suggesting?</div>
					<a name="08030642000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000237"></a>Steve
Webb:
						</b> Good morning, Mrs. Humble. In this
section on offshore renewables, it seems appropriate to ask a couple of
questions about the connection between offshore renewables and the
grid.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>
					<a name="08030642000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s model,
as I understand it, is that if I want to set up an offshore wind
turbine, I might be responsible for the connection to the mainland. I
am not sure about that. Presumably, in the context of the clause, I
would be responsible for decommissioning the connection when I am
done&#151;not just the turbine, but the infrastructure. As it is
critical for the roll-out of wind turbine networks, how is that
interconnection process going to
work?</div>
					<a name="08030642000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an operator
not only has to get a turbine out there and running, but is also
responsible for the connection to the mainland and from there to the
grid, and if that is a purely private obligation, that could be a
serious disincentive to the roll-out of offshore wind power. If there
were some concept of a grid&#151;a trunk network akin to the
motorways&#151;perhaps with the state paying, or at least ensuring
that it was non-competitive, there would be more of a boost to the
offshore renewables we are talking
about.</div>
					<a name="08030642000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has not yet been clear about where that infrastructure will come from.
Decommissioning arises only if the private sector provider has put in
the infrastructure. I may be hazy about that as I am new to the issue,
but I get the sense from the industry that there is considerable
concern that the roll-out of offshore renewables will be hindered if
the Government require the offshore renewable developers also to put in
place the infrastructure to bring the power onshore. If there is an
area offshore where several providers&#151;several energy
companies&#151;are in place, is it rational to expect them to have
their own separate infrastructure to bring the power onshore and,
indeed, from the point where it touches land to the point where it
accesses the grid, or is there any scope for sharing? If everybody has
to do everything for themselves, there is great multiplication and
additional decommissioning costs at the end of the process.</div>
					<a name="08030642000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier in
the Bill, we looked at renewables obligation certificates and giving
extra incentives to different sorts of technology. Presumably, that is
a key part of the Government&#146;s renewable energy strategy, so
they will want to remove barriers. How does the Minister see the
infrastructure working and being operated between these offshore
renewable installations and the mainland and then the grid? Who would
own it, who would provide it and who would decommission it in the
context of the
clause?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> Again, this has been a useful debate and happily,
small sections of it were relevant to the clause. I say that because
there could be a debate about offshore wind, but this is not that
debate; this is something rather narrower about
decommissioning.</div>
					<a name="08030642000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me try to
be helpful, because the hon. Member for Wealden was interested in
capacity and how it relates to generation. I am advised that 33 GW of
capacity equals about 8 GW of generation, so I hope that that is
helpful. I am trying to work out the arithmetic and I think that is
where we are, for the obvious reason that the wind does not blow all
the time. Let us just make the obvious point, because I get a lot of
correspondence from constituents of MPs saying, &#147;What happens
when the wind stops?&#148; Basically, because of the national grid,
there is a mix of energy sources and we need the base load and so
on.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>
					<a name="08030642000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say at the outset that we have never said that where we are now with
our planning will necessarily get us to the European target, although
of course if we move towards real capacity offshore, as we hope to,
that will help. As I said in earlier sittings, in the light of the
European target, which is likely to be 15 per cent. or
thereabouts&#151;we are still discussing that&#151;we are now
developing a new renewable energy strategy. We hope to be able to
consult on that and to issue a paper sometime during the summer. I see
it in two phases. What we have done in the past, and what we were
planning prior to the Euro target of 2020 gets us quite a long way, but
it does not get us to the 15 per cent., or whatever it will be. That
will require something of a revolution, which is good because we need a
wider revolution in terms of decarbonising our economy, so we are
working hard on what steps we now need to take. I certainly recognise
that the gigawatts and how that translates into generation will not, by
itself, enable us to hit our
target.</div>

							<a name="08030642000239"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I will not go into further extended discussion
about gigawatts as I realise that the Committee&#146;s eyes are
glazing over, but does the Minister agree that to get 15 per cent. of
our energy from renewable sources translates into about 35 to 
40 per cent. of our electricity having to come from renewable sources?
That is what independent people are generally saying: in order to reach
the European target of 15 per cent., a much higher proportion&#151;35
to 40 per cent. of our electricity&#151;will have to come from
renewables.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000240"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I would not want to be tied to a certain
percentage, but I think the hon. Gentleman has the right order of
magnitude. In terms of hitting our European target, whatever it turns
out to be&#151;let us say, for the sake of argument, 15 per
cent.&#151;clearly the easiest way of doing that is in terms of
electricity. Obviously we want to make progress in other ways, on motor
transport for example, but the easiest way is in terms of electricity,
so the implication for the future proportion of our electricity
generated from renewables is significant. Therefore, I agree with the
hon. Gentleman on that.</div>
					<a name="08030642000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal
with some other issues. The hon. Member for East Devon asked about
shipping. Principal shipping lanes will be avoided. We are not going to
plant wind farms in the middle of a big, obvious shipping lane. For
non-principal lanes, developers would need to reach a commercial
agreement with those who use them. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is
reassured that we have that issue in mind. In terms of the safety
inspection of offshore installations, I think&#151;although sometimes
I am wrong, so I will check&#151;that it is the responsibility of the
Health and Safety Executive. If I am wrong about that, I will correct
myself in due course.</div>
					<a name="08030642000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Northavon
asked about a fund with regard to offshore decommissioning. Our
judgment is that unlike with nuclear power, that is not necessary
because of the orders of magnitude. Earlier I contrasted what may be a
&#163;10 million figure with the much larger number of noughts needed
for nuclear, and we do not think that that is necessary. It is
important for the Secretary of State to be sure that there is financial
security at the start of the life. That is where we need the
reassurances.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> Good. The hon. Gentleman is understandably worried
about terrorist attack. We are all worried about that, and a number of
measures are in place&#151;it is not just an issue for offshore wind.
However, because of the wide range of areas covered, a terrorist attack
on a single or multiple wind farm, or other renewable station, would
not have a significant impact on generating capacity. That is not to
say that we are relaxed about it&#151;of course we are not&#151;but
given the scale involved, I do not think that it is a big
issue.</div>
					<a name="08030642000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northavon asked about grid transmission. We had an earlier
discussion about the new regime on transmission under clause 40. On my
understanding, the regime that we are putting in place does not require
or even allow the installer to run the grid to shore. That will be
subject to competition; it is a new regime and other companies will be
players in installing those grids.</div>

							<a name="08030642000243"></a>Mr.

by overhead power lines? If they will be overhead power lines, what
effect will that have in areas of outstanding natural beauty, which are
often around the coast where the power will be coming
onshore?</div>

						</b> I may need to come back to the hon. Gentleman on
the exact arrangement there. Certainly, the power lines will run under
the sea, but I will come back to him about what I suspect may be
slightly different arrangements for when they come onshore. In terms of
areas of outstanding natural beauty, the lines will only affect that of
fishes and other sea creatures, as they will run under the sea. I am
advised that such power lines tend to be underground, but it would
depend on particular licensing and
consents.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000247"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> The Minister will be aware that there is a real
issue here. Of course I appreciate that the power lines will be under
the sea when they are offshore, but they have to come onshore at some
point in order to connect to the grid. My question is simple. When the
power comes onshore on our coastline, will it still be underground? If
it is overground, there will be huge cables and pylons and so on, and
they are unsightly and would disfigure our coastal landscape. This
warrants more than a slightly flippant remark about it endangering fish
and other such life.</div>

that I can best deal with it later, if there is an opportunity to do
so, or in correspondence. I can well imagine that the arrangement might
be rather different, depending on matters such as terrain and proximity
to the grid and so on. I shall have to come back to the hon. Member for
East Devon on this issue; I do not think that there is one particular
answer. I have visited a number of such sites and I am trying to
remember the arrangement, but I suspect that it will vary. I appreciate
that the hon. Gentleman wants to protect natural beauty. I do not know

Wicks:
						</b> Some humour! I thought that it was quite good. I
thank my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet for his intervention,
but it is far too early in the morning to pursue that particular issue.
To help the hon. Member for Northavon, we discussed the matter of
transmission earlier. We are pursuing an approach based on competitive
tendering for offshore transmission, so the person who builds the
installation will not have the responsibility for wiring it up to the
shore and protecting natural beauty. We expect that all round 2
projects will want to connect directly to the shore&#151;round 2 is
where we are at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="08030642000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the grid, in future, given the issues
surrounding the gigawatts and the number of wind turbines, ideas about
some kind of grid become quite interesting. We discussed the idea of a
European grid&#151;not across the whole of Europe, but where
appropriate. Some kind of hub and spoke offshore transmission system,
with multiple developers using a single line to shore, is likely to be
what we will want in certain areas. That line would be owned by the
people involved in the process, and they would have the decommissioning
responsibilities for that as well.</div>
					<a name="08030642000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am now advised that I can be
more precise on health and safety. The Health and Safety Executive took
over administrative responsibility for the health and safety of, among
other things, offshore electricity installations in 2006. It is worth
noting that the formal statutory transfer of those types of
electricity-related safety functions forms part of the Bill. We will
probably come on to issues affecting electricity safety this afternoon.
I think that I have dealt with that point, which is again about
offshore lines connecting to
shore.</div>
					<a name="08030642000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subject to the
normal consent process, the developer will make a proposal that we will
consider. In doing so, we will consider issues such as visual impact
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div>impact on environment when deciding whether to grant consent under the
Electricity Act 2004. I shall try to come back to the hon. Member for
East Devon on the practicalities of what happens currently, but I may
not be able to do so
immediately.</div>

Hendry:
						</b> I raised the issue of the Severn barrage. The
Minister has not yet come back on that point and I would be grateful if
he did so. Will he also tell us how this aspect of the Bill relates to
hybrid facilities? We had a discussion in an earlier sitting about the
Eclipse Energy project, which you may be familiar with, Mrs.
Humble, as it is just off the coast of your constituency. It will be a
combined renewable wind and gas facility. When the wind is blowing, the
facility will be used to create electricity; when it is not, the gas
from a significantly depleted gas field will be used to honour the
project&#146;s electricity commitments. Will that fall under two
separate decommissioning funds or is there some element in these
measures to take account of such hybrid
facilities?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000256"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I do not think that there will be one specific
regulatory regime for hybrids. There are already regimes in place; the
Bill will reform and improve those regimes, but again I am sorry that I
will have to come back to the hon. Gentleman on how the two regimes
will work together. That is a detailed and important question, and I am
glad he asked me  about
that.</div>
					<a name="08030642000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Severn barrage is&#151;like the hon. Gentleman, I hesitate to say
&#147;offshore&#148;&#151;a rather especial project. The
Government have indicated their interest in it in principle, as he
knows. Following the work of the Sustainable Development Commission, we
are proceeding to investigate that, but it is going to take quite a lot
of study, not least in terms of the ecology and environmental impact.
We are looking at the kind of studies that we will require; it is not
going to be built
tomorrow.</div>
					<a name="08030642000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not a lawyer, but my guess would be that, were the project to
proceed, it might require new legislation. No doubt, as part of that,
we would look at some issues concerning eventual decommissioning. In my
mind&#146;s eye, I can see a movement in 150 years&#146; time to
save the Severn barrage. The successor to the hon. Member for East
Devon might say that it is an area of such natural beauty&#151;so
loved and featuring on postcards and photographs&#151;that it must be
saved, even though, after so many years, it may not be fit for its
original purpose, but I jest, at the risk of annoying
him.</div>

						</b> Thank you, Mrs. Humble, for reminding us
about that important amendment, which I did not immediately call to
mind.</div>
					<a name="08030642000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
will remember that we discussed protection from insolvency for
decommissioning funds in the context of nuclear waste. The clause will
ensure that moneys set aside for decommissioning of offshore renewables
installations cannot be accessed by creditors in the event of a company
becoming insolvent. It will do that by disapplying the relevant
insolvency legislation. It will ensure that any such moneys will not be
restricted or prevented from being used for decommissioning if the
company with the decommissioning obligations becomes insolvent. Similar
arrangements to safeguard funds already exist in section 29 of the Coal
Industry Act
1994.</div>
					<a name="08030642000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
such provision, if a company with decommissioning obligations were to
become insolvent, creditors could access moneys set aside for
decommissioning. In other words, payments could be returned to
creditors for purposes other than decommissioning. That could mean that
there would not be sufficient moneys remaining to pay for
decommissioning after those payments to
creditors.</div>
					<a name="08030642000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will also allow the Secretary of State to direct that the information
regarding relevant financial security arrangements be published by the
person responsible for the decommissioning programme&#151;for
example, in the financial pages of that person&#146;s website. That
will ensure that informed decisions can be made by creditors: they will
know that there are certain earmarked funds that they cannot
access.</div>
					<a name="08030642000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
ensure compliance with the direction to publish information about
relevant financial security arrangements, the clause also enables the
Secretary of State or a creditor of the person responsible for a
decommissioning programme to apply for a court order if the direction
is not followed. It is Government policy to ensure that developers make
adequate provision for the cost of decommissioning their
installations&#151;to protect the environment, but also to protect
the taxpayer and to meet our international obligations. By protecting
any funds set aside for decommissioning from insolvency, we are
minimising the risk to the
taxpayer.</div>

							<a name="08030642000258"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I have a couple of quick questions. Will the trust
fund have to be set up within the United Kingdom, or might it be set up
offshore&#151;at the risk of a pun, an offshore offshore fund? That
is a serious issue. If the fund is set up offshore&#151;for example,
in Liechtenstein&#151;it may not be subject to UK laws. How would it
be covered by the
legislation?</div>
					<a name="08030642000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister talked about the super-grid, which also raises an interesting
issue. The super-grid would have a range of offshore installations in a
range of different territorial waters. How is that covered? Will there
be a fund specifically for decommissioning the turbines in UK
territorial waters? What will be in place to stop that fund being used
to decommission the turbines that happened to be in German or Dutch
territorial waters? Will the use of such funds to decommission
facilities that have been set up in someone else&#146;s territorial
waters be explicitly
prevented?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000259"></a>Malcolm

						</b> The second question is for the future, because we
are not there yet. The European Union has asked the former German
Energy Minister, Mr. Adamowitsch, to look at the issue as
related to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>offshore wind&#151;we noted his role in earlier
conversations. I have had discussions with him, but he has not yet
reported. That is an important point for the future. No doubt those
issues will be looked at then, in an appropriate way. The hon.

does not require an urgent answer, because we are not there
yet.</div>

offshore offshore, I might need to take advice.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>

it fell to the ground immediately. The Secretary of State will clearly
have to be certain that there are appropriate arrangements for the
funds. I anticipate that funds proposed by a developer will be approved
case by case by the Secretary of State, so he or she&#151;who knows,
in the future?&#151;will make a judgment on the suitability of the

							<a name="08030642000264"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Part IV of the Petroleum Act 1998, which
consolidates provisions from the Petroleum  Act 1987, sets up
the statutory scheme for the abandonment of oil and gas facilities. We
are now moving on from renewables. Since the regime was established in
1987, there have been changes in business practices in the oil and gas
industry. For example, there has been increasing participation by
smaller players with fewer assets, who, as such, bring increased risks
that they might not be able to meet their decommissioning liabilities.
This issue is to do with the maturity of the fields on the UK
continental shelf in the North sea. Experience has shown that it has
not always been possible to share liabilities equitably between the
parties responsible for installations or pipelines. This provision will
strengthen the existing abandonment regime by amending part IV of the
1998 Act.</div>
					<a name="08030642000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will strengthen the provisions in three ways in response to the above
challenges. First, it will extend the list of persons who may be
required to provide a decommissioning programme upon receipt of a
section 29 notice under the 1998 Act. That will include licensees who
have transferred their rights to another company without the consent of
the Secretary of  State. Companies should not be able to avoid
their decommissioning liabilities by such unconsented action.</div>
					<a name="08030642000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it
clarifies the existing Petroleum Act provisions so that it is clear
that they apply to limited liability partnerships in the same way as
they apply to limited companies. That includes the existing provisions
for making associates, such as parent companies, responsible for
decommissioning when there are, for example, concerns about the
financial strength of their
subsidiary.</div>
					<a name="08030642000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
it will ensure that all those involved in a development share the
decommissioning obligation from the same point in time. The wording of
the current legislation means that the operator can be made responsible
for decommissioning when construction of the platform starts, but his
fellow licensees cannot be made responsible until one of the specified
activities, such as production, has commenced. That may leave a
significant period when the liability rests on a single company, which
I do not believe is
equitable.</div>
					<a name="08030642000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">By amending
the 1998 Act, the clause will help to ensure a clearer legal framework
of rights and duties for all concerned, which will provide greater
clarity and certainty for developers and
investors.</div>
					<a name="08030642000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08030642000265"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): To help the hon.
Member for St. Albans, the Scottish Presbyterian upbringing makes us a
lot harder and much more unforgiving than most people. That is linked
to why I rise to speak to new clause 19, which is tabled in my name,
and is a technical proposal designed to probe the Minister for
information. I hope that colleagues will not find it too boring, as I
am afraid that that is the end of the light-hearted
bit.</div>
					<a name="08030642000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware that now that oil and gas exploration and
production on the UK continental shelf is at a more mature phase of
development, it is often the case that a single licence governs the
development activities of various groups of licensees, all with
interests in separate blocks and unrelated infrastructure. Industry
representatives have told me that the subdivision of licence interests
has increased in recent years, particularly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column479" />Column number: 479</div>with the introduction of the fallow block initiative. It has been
further complicated in instances where blocks have been re-licensed
following decommissioning or partial decommissioning of existing
infrastructure.</div>
					<a name="08030642000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
discussions with the industry, officials from the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform have stated that their
policy is to ensure that a party to a licence will incur a liability
with regard to the decommissioning of an offshore installation only
where such a party owns, or has previously owned, a beneficial interest
in a specific offshore installation that requires decommissioning, or
is a related person in accordance with section 30(1)(d) and (e) of the
1998 Act. That liability is not intended to extend either to parties
who are licensees but have no ownership interests in the particular
infrastructure, or to parties who have re-licensed in a particular
block where an offshore installation has been constructed subsequent to
the transfer. I hope that everyone is following this. The existing
legislation is drafted so as to impose an obligation on the licensee or
a previous licensee and does not expressly refer to the ownership
interest in the offshore installation. Oil &amp; Gas UK and some of its
members are concerned that such liabilities might be attributed to
parties who have never been involved with the ownership of such an
installation. New clause 19 would clarify the current
situation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000266"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am very interested in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s new clause, but I would be grateful if he would
clarify what the problem is. Are people who do not own offshore
facilities going round applying for permission to decommission someone
else&#146;s facility? I am not sure why they would do that, although
perhaps Shell would find it helpful to decommission all BP&#146;s
facilities.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000267"></a>John
Robertson:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman asks a very good question,
but unfortunately I do not have a very good answer; I only have what I
have been told. I will direct his question through to the Minister, who
may find a way of giving a nice answer that he will be happy
with.</div>
					<a name="08030642000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, the new clause seeks to clarify the situation, and perhaps some
my remarks will help in that respect. Since the Secretary of State is
using the opportunity represented by the Bill to further define, as
part of the process that notifies companies that they have become a
decommissioning liability, which persons may be served with a section
29 notice, this seems to be an ideal moment to gain clarification on
that point. I suggest to the Minister that without the new clause it is
likely that companies engaged in the transfer of existing licence
interests to companies seeking innovative ways to extend the production
life of fields where existing infrastructure has been decommissioned or
partially decommissioned will request additional security to ensure
that no liability for decommissioning new infrastructure can be
attributed to them. Equally, co-licensees with an interest in separate
licence areas may seek security to back the indemnities provided under
the trust deed to ensure that they face no further unintended
liabilities.</div>
					<a name="08030642000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
clarification should assist with active training in the asset market
and encourage new investors by removing the potential for increased
licence entry costs. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 480</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000268"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> With your permission, Mrs. Humble, I
will clarify an earlier point which is, in a way, related. The hon.
Member for Wealden asked whether a combined hybrid project&#151;for
example, an offshore wind turbine on an oil and gas platform, a
development that is beginning to happen&#151;will be covered by two
decommissioning regimes. The answer is yes. I can envisage someone
making the debating point that that seems onerous, but it is
unreasonable to propose a new clause to deal with a variety of hybrid
types that might occur in future. The hon. Gentleman also asked whether
there are parties looking to decommission oil and gas installations for
which they have no interest. The  answer is
no.</div>
					<a name="08030642000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is
interesting. It relates to the maturity of the UKCS, where a number of
players are now involved, including some relatively new and small
enterprising companies. Our initial assessment is that the new clause
could apply to well over 100 licences. We are aware of the issue, have
considered it carefully, and will continue to do so. The new clause is
a significant proposal, but we feel that there are complexities that
need to be fully identified and discussed with the industry before
deciding on the right way to treat the different parties that might be
covered by it. One issue is that over the years companies have created
a patchwork of commercial arrangements within many of the licences by
splitting them into sub-areas. Some licensees have no interest in a
particular commercial sub-area but are still a party to the licence
that covers it. The wording of section 30 of the 1998 Act brings all
licensees within the scope of the Secretary of State&#146;s power to
make them responsible for decommissioning an installation in any part
of the licence area. Naturally, companies that have not had an interest
in the installation are reluctant to carry a liability for its
decommissioning.</div>
					<a name="08030642000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that view, and would like to explain how our policy tries to
reflect the different standing of licensees. It might be helpful to see
the policy as being based on three tiers of liability. The first tier
comprises those who have been served with a section 29 notice to
establish their statutory obligation to decommission an installation.
That will include the current field players and any previous partners
who have sold their interest but have not had their notices withdrawn
by the Secretary of State because of concerns about the financial
strength of the remaining
partners.</div>
					<a name="08030642000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second tier includes previous partners who have sold their interests
and have had their section 29 notices withdrawn by the Secretary of
State at an earlier stage, and are therefore not obliged to submit a
decommissioning programme. The third tier comprises licensees who have
never had an interest in the installation or been served a section 29
notice.</div>
				
					<a name="08030642000202"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div>
					<a name="08030642000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
policy is that decommissioning should be carried out by the companies
that are currently responsible for the installation: the current field
partners in what I call the first tier. Our proposals in the Bill
include measures to strengthen the arrangements for ensuring that those
companies are able to carry out the decommissioning. If a financial
assessment of the first-tier section 29 notice holders indicates that
they might have difficulty funding the decommissioning, provisions in
the Bill will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div>enable the Secretary of State to ask for security, such as a
bank&#146;s letter of credit, at any time during the project from any
of the first-tier notice holders.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000271"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> My point relates specifically to the issue to
which the Minister has just referred.</div>
					<a name="08030642000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is common practice now
within the North sea for different people to own and use the rigs, so
there are people who develop businesses by constructing the rigs and
hiring them out to others. In those circumstances, who would be
responsible for the decommissioning, the contractors or the
owners?</div>
					<a name="08030642000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000272"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I hope to come back to that point in due course, as
I certainly understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description of where
the industry
is.</div>
					<a name="08030642000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I was saying, with the provision to cover the higher-risk cases, there
should be little chance that the current field partners will fail to
decommission the installation. However, in the unlikely event that
those companies do default, the Secretary of State would have to call
on other notice holders in the first tier, and if those fail, on those
in the second tier. That would cover the companies that were
responsible for the installation until they sold their interest and
would, we believe, provide a kind of belt-and-braces approach that
should cover all but the most exceptional circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08030642000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
only two instances in the past 20 years when first-tier companies have
been unable to meet their decommissioning responsibilities, but I
cannot assure Parliament that our policy will cover 100 per cent. of
cases. There is the very remote scenario in which the second-tier
companies might also fail. On a multi-block licence, the question would
then be whether the taxpayer must step in or whether the Secretary of
State should call on the third-tier companies to do the decommissioning
work. The new clause would remove that choice of accessing the third
tier and mean that&#151;I emphasise this point&#151;the taxpayer
would have to fund the decommissioning in that remote
scenario.</div>
					<a name="08030642000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
from the breadth of existing powers in the Petroleum Act 1998 that
Parliament intended that every effort should be made to ensure that the
taxpayer does not have to pay for decommissioning due to the default of
companies involved in a field. Our policy is therefore not to rule out
the extremely remote possibility that it might be necessary in an
exceptional case to use the full powers of the 1998 Act to protect the
taxpayer.</div>
					<a name="08030642000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
pointed out to my Department that the potential liability for
third-tier companies on multi-block licences could discourage sales of
field interests, but there is an answer to that situation. The industry
and my Department have put considerable effort over the past two or
three years into developing a new model security deed to deal with
decommissioning liabilities. That deed could be used to indemnify
third-tier companies in multi-block cases. As the deed has just been
launched, ideally I would like some time to see how it beds
in.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div>
					<a name="08030642000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, given
the interest shown in the proposed new clause, I am prepared to
consider that further within the context of the Bill. That will require
the examination of hundreds of existing licences to consider the impact
of such a change, so it is a considerable undertaking that we need to
work on. There are complex commercial arrangements on some of those
licences, which make the process more complicated. It is not
straightforward, but I am committed to investigating it further,
although I emphasise that it will take some time. I cannot give a
commitment that that will lead to an acceptance of the proposal, but I
hope that, in view of this undertaking, my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, North-West will not press his new clause.</div>
					<a name="08030642000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked whether the
liabilities will be on the owners or the contractors. I am advised that
both the owners and licensees will be liable for the decommissioning;
they will both be tier 1
bodies.</div>
					<a name="08030642000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000273"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful
response, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West
will be grateful for the Minister&#146;s offer.</div>
					<a name="08030642000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister tell us a
little more about the decommissioning involved? Is it the entire
structure, meaning the rig, the pipe work that goes with it and the
areas below the sea bed as well? I was part of the British-American
parliamentary group trip to Texas last year where BP showed us how it
is identifying new reserves under 10,000 ft of water and 20,000 ft of
rock.</div>
					<a name="08030642000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
circumstances where it is possible to identify and to reach oil and gas
reserves that were simply unachievable a few years ago, an enormous
amount of pipe work is going to be in the sea bed and the rock beneath
it. I do not know whether it is already standard practice for that to
be removed at the end of the process or whether it is simply left
there. Will the Minister&#146;s decommissioning proposals require the
removal of all that infrastructure or simply that above the sea
bed?</div>
					<a name="08030642000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030642000274"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> My understanding is that it is certainly not just
that above the sea bed. I want to get this right, and we might have to
return to it or I will write to the hon. Gentleman. I think that, to
put it simply, the principle is to do as much as possible. In reality,
however, it might not always be possible to remove some very deep
infrastructure on the sea bed. I will not pretend that I have been out
to a number of oil rigs or that I am an
expert.</div>
					<a name="08030642000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">An important
question is what the obligation represents. The ideal principle is that
we remove as much as possible, but I do not think that it is always

							<a name="08030642000278"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am sure that my civil servants, who are looking
at hundreds of licences now, are grateful that we have had that useful
discussion.</div>
					<a name="08030642000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move
on to clause 68, which concerns financial resources. It clarifies the
information that may be required to satisfy the Secretary of State of a
person&#146;s ability to fund their decommissioning obligations. It
also brings forward the time when the Secretary of State can require a
person to take relevant action, such as providing the security of a
bank&#146;s letter of credit when the risk of default is deemed by
the Secretary of State to be unacceptable on the basis of a published
assessment process. The provisions in this clause therefore help to
ensure that the taxpayer is protected from the risk of a person being
unable to meet their decommissioning
obligations.</div>
					<a name="08030642000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
assess a person&#146;s ability to carry out decommissioning
obligations, the Secretary of State may require information such as
financial accounts to compare with the potential costs of the work.
This is achieved by amending section 38 of the Petroleum Act 1998,
which sets out the existing information requirements. Under this
provision, the Secretary of State can require information such as a
detailed estimate of the costs of the abandonment, predictions of
future revenue, the costs and benefits of any plans for further
development, and up-to-date management
accounts.</div>
				
					<a name="08030642000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
68 enables the Secretary of State to obtain some of this information
prior to serving a notice requiring a decommissioning programme. This
will enable the Secretary of State to assess the potential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>impact of the decommissioning liability on what may be a small company.
Later, more detailed information may also be required before the
approval of an abandonment programme, in order to assess whether
financial security is required. This information allows the Secretary
of State to assess the financial resources of a person earlier than
under the existing regime to further ensure that the risk of default on
a future decommissioning obligation is
minimised.</div>
					<a name="08030642000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
considering the information obtained and consulting the Treasury, this
clause allows the Secretary of State to require a person to take
action, such as providing financial security, to satisfy the Secretary
of State that the decommissioning duty can be discharged. By enabling
the Secretary of State to require action before an abandonment
programme is approved, he will be able to ensure that proper taxpayer
protections are in place at whichever point in time the assessment
process indicates a higher risk.</div>
					<a name="08030642000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is standard practice to draw
up programmes at the end of the life of a field when there is greater
certainty of available technologies. Given the nature of oil and gas
reservoirs, the levels of risk can vary across the life of a field, and
therefore we need to be able to adjust the security requirement to
match the risk. The flexibility in this clause will reduce the costs of
security to the companies, compared to a catch-all approach to
financial
security.</div>
					<a name="08030642000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Officials
will not be able to disclose the information unless required by law or
with the consent of the person who provided it. It will be an offence
to disclose information if it does not fall within the exemptions set
out in this clause. The penalty for such an offence will be a criminal
sanction. The same offence for disclosure of information is being
proposed in the Bill in the decommissioning provisions for nuclear and
offshore renewable installations. It is also important that the
Secretary of State has the power to obtain information so that he can
fulfil his functions under this chapter of the Bill. The industry will
benefit if the Secretary of State&#146;s actions to protect the
taxpayer and the environment are based on up-to-date and accurate
information.</div>

							<a name="08030642000279"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The Government are committed to maximising the
production of oil and gas from the UK continental shelf, often know as
the UKCS. That is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>worth emphasising. At a time of some interest and excitement around
renewables and nuclear, people can forget our still heavy reliance on
oil and gas from the North sea and the wider UKCS. I think that, at
present, some two-thirds of our energy comes from the UKCS. That is a
considerable resource and, as such, it is important that the regulatory
framework remains appropriate against a rapidly changing commercial
environment.</div>
					<a name="08030642000203"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div>
					<a name="08030642000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the most
noticeable changes in operations on the UKCS over the past five years
has been the increasing number of smaller players, as noted earlier.
Typically, such smaller firms are more focused on exploiting smaller
fields, where their less complex and more flexible financial and
operational processes can be an asset in helping to exploit new
opportunities on short time frames. However, some smaller players may
be less resilient and more exposed to financial risk, compared to their
bigger brothers.</div>
					<a name="08030642000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government must therefore look at what measures may be used to mitigate
the additional risks to the taxpayer of having smaller firms on
licences, while not discouraging viable new players from entering the
market. The clauses on oil and gas licensing update the regulatory
regime to do just that. It is important, for the protection of the
environment, that all wells are properly plugged and abandoned. It is a
term of a petroleum licence that licensees must plug and abandon their
wells at least a month before the end of their
licences.</div>
					<a name="08030642000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
also provisions, later in the Bill, to allow the Secretary of State to
order that a suspended well be plugged and abandoned at any time. If
parties to a licence cannot afford to do that when the time comes, by
which we mean when their licence requires them to do so, the cost of
doing so could fall to the taxpayer.</div>
					<a name="08030642000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause allows the Secretary
of State to require financial information at any point and in any
circumstance during the course of the licence. Being able to gather
such information will enable the Secretary of State to monitor whether
the licensee has sufficient resources to plug and abandon the well when
required to do so under the
licence.</div>
					<a name="08030642000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
obligation to plug and abandon a well arises either automatically, at
the end of the licence, or when directed to do so by the Secretary of
State. If the information is not provided or if, having looked at the
information, the Secretary of State is not satisfied that the licensee
will be capable of plugging its well in the future, then, after
consulting the Treasury, the Secretary of State can require it to take
certain action&#151;including providing financial security. That will
reduce the risk of licensees not being able to plug and abandon the
well at the end of their licences, thereby reducing the risk that the
taxpayer would have to foot the bill.</div>
					<a name="08030642000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure that this is an
effective tool and that licensees take heed of notices given by the
Secretary of State, the clause also makes it an offence for a person to
fail to comply with a notice from the Secretary of State requiring
either information or action. If found guilty, they would be liable, on
summary conviction, to a fine 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>not exceeding the statutory maximum or, on
conviction on indictment, to a fine, imprisonment up to two years, or
both. The clause will apply equally to licensees under the Petroleum
Act and to licensees holding gas storage and unloading
licences.</div>

							<a name="08030642000280"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I have a couple of small points for clarification.
The Bill
says:</div>
					<a name="08030642000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
section applies in relation to a person who has drilled, or commenced
drilling&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08030642000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">What does
&#147;commenced drilling&#148; mean? Does it cover exploratory
work, so that if someone is drilling with the hope of finding gas it
counts as &#147;commenced drilling&#148;, or does it refer to an
exercise once gas has been found and extraction is involved? What,
therefore, are the implications for someone doing exploratory work, and
do the same rules apply to people who find
nothing?</div>
					<a name="08030642000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, the
definitions towards the end of the clause say that
&#147;&#145;well&#146; includes a borehole&#148;. What is the
difference between a well and a borehole? The Minister may wish to
write to me about that, as it is a point not of fundamental objection
to the clause, but for my own
education.</div>

Ladyman:
						</b> I have taken my hon. Friend by surprise. I have
just a few questions for him, and I am trying to be helpful. I wonder
whether the clause is phrased as well as it might be, because it seems
to be embedding a logical inconsistency. If he finds that somebody is
incapable of plugging the well, he can consult the Treasury about
requiring them to plug it. If they are incapable of that, how can they
be required to do
so?</div>
					<a name="08030642000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">What my hon.
Friend means by this is that the Government wish to identify somebody
who is about to enter a process that might render them incapable of
plugging the well because they do not have the money to do it and wish
to intervene early to require them to do it before they enter that
process. The way that the provision is phrased, however, will not allow
my hon. Friend to take action until that person is not capable of it,
by which time it will be too late to intervene. Would he like,
therefore, to have a chat with the lawyers in his Department about
whether the provision is phrased in a way that will be useful to him in
the future?</div>

						<a name="08030642000283"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): Further to that,
I wonder whether the Minister can clarify whether, under circumstances
that we have already discussed, a licence will be granted for carbon
capture and storage, but be granted before the ending of a licence of
someone who has previously drilled a well or a borehole. Will that
licence therefore have to be terminated according to the conditions of
the clause, or will the person who wishes to undertake carbon capture
and storage by placing carbon through the well or borehole that is
about to be abandoned take over the process without the well having to
be capped or otherwise disposed
of?</div>
					<a name="08030642000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively,
does my hon. Friend intend the processes to be entirely
separate&#151;that the well be capped and that all business cease? If
so, presumably the person engaging in carbon capture and storage would
have to undrill the well and start again.</div>

							<a name="08030642000284"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> On that last point, I will take refuge in the fact
that CCS is still an infant technology. We are working hard on these
issues, not least in our working group with the Norwegians, which our
Dutch colleagues have now joined. We have taken regulatory powers in
the Bill and there is also the demonstration project. I cannot
therefore be precise about the answer to that question. Given that the
great hope is that vacated oil and gas works would be the repository
for CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, as a non-engineer I do not envisage that they would
be closed and then
reopened.</div>
					<a name="08030642000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
also the issue of enhanced oil recovery. One of the commercial
advantages is achieved through access to more oil and gas. That is one
of the factors that helps to make CCS&#151;I will not say financially
viable, because there is a gap&#151;part of a commercial set up.
Although, as a lay person, I do not see the thing being closed and
sealed and then reopened, I can see that there are interesting issues
about where the two regulatory regimes come together, which we will
need to explore in the future.</div>
					<a name="08030642000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was not by any means a
boring question, but I cannot at the moment describe the difference
between a borehole and a well. I will write to the hon. Member for
Wealden, given his great interest in the subject. On exploratory
drilling, we do include exploration because there is something to be
decommissioned. It is one of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 488</div>the risks of the business that not every investigation, exploration or
drilling leads to a find. There is, however, something there to be
remedied.</div>
					<a name="08030642000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for South Thanet asked about how we can require
someone to plug a well if they are unable to do so and whether we can
take action before they become incapable? The answer is that we can ask
for information as soon as they have started to drill a well. If we are
not happy with what we find, we can ask them to take action&#151;for
example, give financial security of some kind. We have therefore to be
vigilant and we can act early in the process. I have talked about the
different tiers that come into our
regime.</div>
