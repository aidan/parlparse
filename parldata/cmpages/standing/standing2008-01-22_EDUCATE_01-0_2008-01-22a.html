Chairman:
						</b> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets during
Committee sittings. Please would all Members ensure that mobile phones,
pagers, and so on are turned off or switched to silent mode during
sittings.</div>
					<a name="08012290000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind
the Committee that there is a money resolution in connection with this
Bill&#151;copies are available in the room. I also remind Members
that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule,
I and my fellow Chairman, Mr. Bayley, do not intend to call
starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be
reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012290000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are still in the early days
of taking oral evidence in Public Bill Committees, so it might help if
I briefly explain what is proposed, so that we can all be clear. The
Committee will first be asked to consider the programme motion that is
being circulated in the Committee room, which supersedes the motion on
the amendment paper. Debate on the motion is limited to half an hour.
We will proceed to a motion to report written evidence a motion to
permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral
evidence sessions, both of which I hope we can take formally.</div>
					<a name="08012290000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming that the second of
these motions is agreed to, the Committee will then move into private
session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and members
of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral evidence
session will commence. If the Committee agrees to the programme motion,
the Committee will hear oral evidence today, on Thursday 24 January and
on Tuesday 29 January before starting clause-by-clause scrutiny on
Thursday 31
January.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.

delighted that there is consensus on the programme motion, because the
purpose of these evidence sessions is, as the Modernisation Committee
report said last year, to inform Members of an evidential basis to the
Bill; and&#151;this is a very important role of evidence
sessions&#151;to raise the reputation of Parliament amongst the
public. This Select Committee-type style is part of that process. I
think the Government agreeing to the list of witnesses proposed by the
Opposition&#151;the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives&#151;is
part of that process, and we are grateful that was done on this
occasion.</div>

with us today. On the survey  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>of opinion, in your brief you say that young people who you have
surveyed said that choice is best. The British Youth Council said that
it found that 46 per cent of young people were against compulsion. What
did you find from the survey that you conducted of young
people?</div>

								Martin
Narey:
							</b>
						</i> Anne can say more about the survey, but it
certainly confirmed our view that choice is vital, which is from our
experience of working with many young people who have fallen out of
education. Alternative sorts of provision and choice are very
important, giving the opportunity for a young person to find somewhere
they can do well. Nevertheless, ultimately, after all the safeguards
within the Bill, our position is that we support compulsion as a means
of ensuring that the most disadvantaged young people have their
horizons broadened and are prepared for a world of work, rather than a
world of benefits and long-term
poverty.</div>

								Anne
Pinney:

						</i> To expand on that. These were young people in
our alternative education and training services. They were
overwhelmingly from disadvantaged and vulnerable backgrounds and all
had very complex barriers to learning: homelessness, substance abuse,
mental health problems, long-term under-achievement, low self-esteem
and so on. These young people did not feel they had a choice at the
moment because of their very poor experience of education to date. The
challenge in this Bill is to give those young people a real choice by
making sure there is the right provision for them and the support to
enable them to
engage.</div>

						</i> It would be ironic, indeed, if action that had
been taken to make sure that a young person&#146;s life chances were
transformed by making sure they were given the qualifications to be a
member of the work force then damaged those chances by giving young
person a criminal record that followed him or her into adulthood. We
feel there are steps that could be taken to prevent that happening,
with amendments to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act and perhaps
taking the record from the police national computer. There are a number
of solutions that should make it possible to ensure that the slate
would be clean at 18 and a young person would not be disadvantaged in
looking for a job because of immature actions he had perhaps committed
at
16.</div>

panel. We would want the reasonable excuse for non-participation that
must include consideration of the support provided. We would welcome a
much clearer articulation of an alternative pathway for young people
who have additional support needs, as an alternative to the enforcement
process. Advocacy is not mentioned in the proposals at the moment but
clearly some young people may have difficulty representing their own
position, why they are not participating, and what has gone
before&#151;the history behind it; they may need advocacy. We would
want them to have it, particularly if they have learning or
communication
difficulties.</div>

						</i> I think it is the latter which is the more
important, from our experience of working with a lot of young people
and getting many more of them believing that the world of work is
something to do with them. A real problem in my experience, both in
Barnardo&#146;s and previously running prisons, is that there is a
frightening minority of young people who think the world of work is
simply nothing to do with them&#151;that work is something that
people like you and I do. You have to break through that. Compulsion is
ultimately important, but it is much more important to convince the
young person that they have abilities&#151;that there are things that
they can do well in&#151;and to give them a huge amount of support.
It is naive to expect a young person from a chaotic background simply
to turn up at a training course by themselves, for example. You need a
huge amount of support to get them there. In my view, some of those
young people will have to be literally delivered to their place of
training, if really want them to benefit. We should not think that
doing that is being soft on the individual.</div>

at the age of 16 or so, are condemned utterly as unemployable, for all
time. We would be very happy to show members of the Committee that if
they ever have time. Our work takes a long time; we cannot do it in a
few weeks&#151;at one of our projects in Harrogate where we teach
catering skills, it sometimes takes two or three years&#151;but, at
the end of that process we have young people who are employable and can
look forward to a life of work. Part of that is sticking with people

sticking with them until they can find the way to

participate. One of the amendments that we will be seeking is for local
authorities to be required to audit the sufficiency and diversity of
provision, in terms of both the learning provision and the support
available, as a prerequisite to the duty to participate applying to the
young person. The question to ask before putting the duty on them to
participate is: can we be confident that there is a real learning

McCarthy-Fry</b> (Portsmouth, North) (Lab/Co-op): I want to
follow up the point about the particular difficulties of very
vulnerable groups. You said that young people may have to be physically
delivered to the point of training. Do I take it that for those groups
you are expecting that there would be specialised training? Surely you
are not suggesting that we would physically deliver someone who was
living such a chaotic life to an employer? It would be very difficult
to give that support in an employment situation.</div>

								Martin
Narey:
							</b>
						</i> It is vital that we have huge variety of
training and education opportunities and that we find the right thing
for the right young person. Our experience is that you can do that even
with gravely disadvantaged people. My point about delivering them arose
from both my career in Barnardo&#146;s and earlier in my career when
working with offenders. As those of us who have brought up children
know, we as parents spend a lot of time making sure that our
children&#151;well into their 20s&#151;get to where they need to
be: we take them to school, we take them to FE, we deliver them to work
and we offer the sort of support that sometimes young people need. But
for our most disadvantaged young people, we often
offer no support like that at all. We expect them to all this on their
own, and they will fail. Adequate support&#151;one-to-one support for
many young people&#151;is really vital if we want them to
succeed.</div>

						</i> Often, that is needed just on a transitional
basis. Perhaps three to six months of intensive one-to-one support to
help a young person to address their key problems&#151;debt,
substance abuse, housing difficulties or whatever it is&#151;can be
enough to help them to re-engage, to start believing in themselves and
to think about their aspirations and what they want to do. I have had
examples from our projects of the sort of one-to-one support that they
do. Someone from one of our projects in Cardiff was telling me that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>they have gone so far as to buy a young man an alarm clock because he
just seemed incapable of getting out of bed in the mornings, and that

for young people &#147;choosing to participate was critical to their
motivation to attend and achieve.&#148; Are you worried that if we
have to get some of these young people involved in education and
training through compulsion, we may have real problems motivating them

						</i> We want to be very clear. There is a long list
of organisations that like us, we understand, are opposing compulsion.
We do not want to give the impression that we are gung-ho about this.
Essentially, we think that compulsion will be a mark of failure and we
should do everything we can to avoid it.</div>
					<a name="08012290000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that ultimately there
are a group of young people, mainly young men, who may resist any sort
of participation at all. We now meet young people in Barnardo&#146;s
who represent the third generation of their family who have never
worked. The belief that work is nothing to do with them is really
important. I think it was Michael Gove who said on Second Reading that
you cannot take a horse to water, but my experience is that you can. I
am not suggesting that you do not try to get people there voluntarily,
but my experience with offenders in prison for example, when they were
literally captive, was that we could take young people who had fallen
out of education, often from the age of 13, and put them on to a
vocational training course where they would do remarkably well. I am
not saying that this often happens in prison because prisons are
overwhelmed in numbers, but I have seen lots of evidence of young
people compelled to participate in education who have done extremely
well.</div>

there are a lot of young people for whom, for all sorts of reasons, the
normal model of school and classroom-based learning simply will not

employers were perfectly willing to accept a certain element of social
and corporate responsibility. The one obstacle to them taking young
disadvantaged people on to their books was that they didn&#146;t have
the skills. I found with offenders, who are often an unpopular bunch of
people to place in employment, that if we turned offenders out of
prison with the right skills, employers were willing to give them a go.

begins well before 16 and if we think of this as a reform for only 16
to 18-year-olds, it will not work. It needs to be in the context of
reform of the 14-to-19 curriculum, but also a much wider look at
support structures all the way through school. Something that
Barnardo&#146;s recommends, which comes directly from the young
people in our projects, is the need for key workers in secondary
schools and colleges to give young people someone fairly independent
whom they can talk to in confidence who can help them to access the
support they need. They did not feel it was appropriate to talk to
teaching staff, but they were dealing with such pressure outside school
that they simply could not engage in the classroom

						</i> I think an early concentration on literacy and
numeracy is very important, but actually there is something to be said
about variation for children of a younger age, because it is right
that, by year 11, a lot of people have dropped out. Either they have
truanted, or a lot of young people are being excluded from school. I
used to see swathes of excluded young people coming to young offender
institutes a few years later, so I know what damage it can
do.</div>

giving another bid for a bit of Barnado&#146;s work, so I volunteer
the fact that other organisations do this as well. I think that there
are a lot of young people&#151;who can be identified at a much
earlier age than 16&#151;who cannot thrive in a classroom of 30
children, for whatever the reason. I could take you to some of our
residential schools where young people who have often been multiply
excluded do extremely well in a residential setting&#151;but
crucially, in a class size of frequently six or eight. Identifying
young people at an early stage who cannot flourish in mainstream
education is really important. Otherwise, there is a danger that we
wait until they get to prison and we teach them to read
then.</div>

on in colleges, stay on in school or go to some work-based training

to crack that problem, and I stress again that we are not advocating
compulsion. If you use compulsion simply to force a 16 or 17-year-old
back into the same classroom environment from which he has been
truanting since year 11, it will fail. But, if you use compulsion to
open his or her eyes to a different form of education or training, it
can work.</div>

of money when I was director general of prisons for drug treatment for
1998. I was told over and over again that I was wasting my time because
prisoners forced into drug treatment would not flourish. The research
four years later was absolutely straightforward&#151;there was no

some of the challenges facing them throughout their education are very

certainly a serious issue of stigma, with young carers not wanting to
admit to their situation at their school. Teacher unions acknowledge
that it is difficult to recognise the plight of young carers. I accept
that that group might need additional support, which, I suggest,
generally needs to have been delivered long before their 16th

recall some of the aspects of the Second Reading debate, when we had an

put&#151;I disagreed with it&#151;that 16 is an age when we should

early age and bring their children up in poverty&#151;all the while,
generation after generation of that group are not working. Just as we
would do for our own children, we need to bear some heavy influence on

those young people who do not have the advantages that most of us will
have afforded to our children&#151;the emotional, financial and
practical support that helps young people to find their way in the
world, either getting them to university or getting them to work. I
have worked for many years with many young people who have utterly
chaotic lives and are effectively completely on their own at 16 years
of age. Indeed, we have several young people&#151;I am delighted to

There are two important points, though, that I wanted to feed in. There
is a need for parity across different routes. We have a crazy situation
where three different learners are working in a factory, doing a
similar role but paid different levels of support, because of the
learning route that they are on. That must not continue, because it
will influence people&#146;s learning choices, perhaps
inappropriately. There also needs to be a minimum income guarantee for
young people living independently, who are twice as likely to be in
poverty as those living with family. They are a vulnerable group, and
we need to do better for
them.</div>

						 It is fair to
say we do not have a black-and-white view, which is probably unhelpful.
We have great concerns about compulsion. If we are looking at the
experience of the Prince&#146;s Trust with the young people on our
programmes&#151;basically, what we do is get young people into
education, training and work, and we did that with 40,000 young people
last year&#151;the bulk of those young people came through on a
voluntary programme. However, some young people, particularly those who
were dealt with by the court system and the probation service, came to
us as a condition of their probation. As Martin said in relation to the
research that Barnado&#146;s had done, there was no difference
between the outcomes of either group.</div>

						 I guess that the
question is what you do with the young person who just says,
&#147;No, I&#146;m not doing it.&#148; The big issue is the
assumption that every young person has an adequate adult behind them,
but most of the young people who we come across do not. The other part
of the debate is that the bulk of the 40,000 people who we worked with
last year had issues with drugs and alcohol. What do you do with a
young person who is already going down the path of taking too many
drugs and drinking too much and who just says, &#147;I&#146;m not
going to do it&#148; and disappears? That happens not just in the age
group that we are talking about. I was talking to a young person
yesterday who started drinking at eight and who was on heroin by the
time he was 11; he certainly was not in school after that time. The
question is how you deal with that. Do you increasingly criminalise
young people and just say, &#147;Right, we&#146;re going to lock
you all up,&#148; or do you find some way of trying to reach them and
sort out some of their issues?</div>

Gibb:
						</b> I went to one of the Prince&#146;s Trust projects
in Glasgow, and I was hugely impressed by the way it brought these
challenging young people into the workplace, so that they could set up
their own businesses and so on. What role do you believe the voluntary
sector should play? Does this legislation pay enough attention to the
voluntary sector?</div>

						 The honest
answer is probably no, it does not. The voluntary sector has a strong
role to play, and the reason why a lot of these young people are not in
the system is that they see it as part of the enemy. I think that it
was Phil Hope who said in a speech recently&#151;he did not know that
I was in the audience, incidentally&#151;that it is no coincidence
that so many young people who go through the Prince&#146;s Trust
initially become youth workers when they leave, because the
Prince&#146;s Trust was their first positive experience with an
adult. They do not have a positive experience of adults at school and
certainly not in their families, and on the whole, they do not have a
positive experience of adults with the police or in their community.
So, to an extent, the Bill has hit something much bigger than keeping
young people in school.</div>

						</b> Indeed. I recently sat in on an interview for Teach
First. One young woman was studying for her postgraduate certificate of
education while holding down four jobs. There must be many 16 and
17-year-olds who are holding down one, two or three jobs simply to keep
the wolf from their family&#146;s door. What effect could the Bill
have on such people? In your briefing, you say that the trust believes
that all young people have potential talent but not all people can work
towards an accreditation and that, in the minority of cases, it is
clear that they will not achieve certain qualifications and that they
would be set up to fail. How do we help those people not be set up to
fail by this legislation?</div>

						 That is where
you use the voluntary sector, and that comes back to the thorny issue
of funding and how much money is going to be available to work with
those who are more disadvantaged. As Martin just said, some of these
young people are not going to be turned around in a few
months&#151;it takes years. The Prince&#146;s Trust team programme
is a 12-week personal development programme, which takes only
unemployed young people and the NEET group. In our experience, we do
not see many who are holding down jobs to be able to achieve
something.</div>
					<a name="08012290000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have an
issue on the team programme regarding mental health, so we have just
funded, through the King&#146;s Fund, a pilot programme to see
whether we can use some kind of assessment tool to find out whether a
young person is on the right programme, whether they are they going to
benefit or whether their needs are actually so acute that the Trust
cannot help them at this point and they need to go to a different
agency.</div>
					<a name="08012290000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is very
early days&#151;we are halfway through the pilot&#151;but the
information that we have had back is that at least a third of the young
people on something like the team programme have a recognised mental
health issue and at least one, if not two, on each
programme&#151;each will take only 15 young people&#151;have such
an acute mental health issue that they actually need key intervention.
We have been able to use local mental health groups&#151;in one case,
a young woman opted for treatment through her GP&#151;to enable them
to get that treatment. They have gone off the programme, had the
treatment and come back six or nine months later to a similar
programme. That is all before they could even think about sitting down
and starting a pre-apprenticeship programme. You are looking at that
kind of need with some of the young people who we work
with.</div>

						 I think that
there probably is not. We are definitely broadly in support of the age
being raised. The devil is always in the detail&#151;where you deal
with the compulsion and where you deal with the young people who we
work with who are already very marginalised.</div>
					<a name="08012290000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that it is
complete doom and gloom. I think that with the right intervention and
the right programmes&#151;the Trust certainly is not the only one
doing it&#151;you can make a significant difference. Of the 40,000
people in our groups last year, 78 per cent. went into education,
training or employment, which I think is phenomenal, given the
backgrounds that most of them were from. It is not easy; it is not
cheap; and it requires a lot people doing a lot of the right
things.</div>

the young people who you talked about with drug and alcohol addiction
problems or teenage mums&#151;have not been met and those people are
excluded from compulsion, would you then have a problem with compulsion
in dealing with those who willingly and deliberately just do not want
to do it? They do not really have any support needs; they just do not
want to

						 Yes. I have
three teenagers myself. Sometimes compulsion is very useful. I think
that, on the whole, we all work it out and get there somehow or
another. As Martin said, most of us do it because we have great support
from our families and our schools. How do you replace that? I know that
you probably think that I am being very woolly, but I do not know
exactly how you do that. I do not think that there is some kind of
great answer where you can say that if we removed this and we just
dealt with the difficult ones then life would be fantastic. I think
that being a teenager is a challenge&#151;perhaps being a parent of
teenagers is more challenging, I do not know. I do not have an issue
with getting young people into training, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>education or employment; it is what we should be doing as a society.
This is about how we do it, so that it makes the situation better and

						 We have sought
the views of businesses about getting these young people into some kind
of training. Our great worry was that, on the Prince&#146;s Trust
team programme, you took them through the 12 weeks, you built up their
expectation and they fell off the cliff face. So we started a
programme, which is mentioned in the paper called &#147;Get
Into&#148;&#151;which means get into whatever trade or
pre-apprenticeship that we are trying to get them into. The response
from employers has been overwhelmingly positive. We are struggling at
the moment to meet the demand of both employers and young people, but
you always get little issues with funding. We took 400 young people
through it last year; we will take 1,000 through it this year, so it is
ratcheting up very quickly.</div>
					<a name="08012290000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The big issue that we have
found with employers is providing enough support and resources to train
the employers to understand, in our case, the category of young people
who they are going to be taking in. I can give you a really trite, but
none the less quite pertinent story. The Ritz was one of the first
employers to sign up with the trust, and they did something called
&#147;Get into hospitality&#148;. I think that they have run three
or four where they have taken five of our young people, often from an
offending background, and trained them in various trades within the
hotel. The Prince was going for a dinner there, so they thought that it
would be great if he went to meet them. One of their best and brightest
sparks did not turn up that day and nobody could understand why; she
had been doing fantastically well. After lots of phone calls, she was
eventually found in a heap in the corner sobbing her heart out and
refusing to come in, because she had been told that she could not wear
trainers to meet the Prince of Wales; she had to wear shoes and she did
not have any. Bless them&#151;they whisked her off to Oxford street,
got a pair of shoes, and she stood in line and everything was fine. On
the whole, our young people cannot cope with what they perceive as
those kind of knocks. Whereas you or I would just say, &#147;Fine,
I&#146;ll just go and get a pair of shoes&#148; or whatever, it
does not happen in their  world. Another example was with Marks
and Spencer, we had&#151;</div>

will be quick. We had someone who had been promoted. After two years,
he suddenly did not turn up for two weeks, and they did not know why.

embarrassed to tell them. It is about trying to work with employers and
saying that these are the kind of things that you have got almost to
allow for if you are prepared to take this target group. Bovis will
tell you that, where you get it right, you get the most loyal and
fantastic work force that you can have.</div>

						 The primary
reason is probably that they want to do something different with their
lives, and they have got themselves to a point where they want to see
something else happening. The comment that I hear most often is,
&#147;I was fed up of sitting at home getting wasted.&#148; The

						 No, and I would
like to see that improved. The issue for all of us is understanding
quite how chaotic some of these young lives are. If you do nothing
else, read a book called &#147;Wasted&#148;. It will take you about
two hours, but it explains very clearly, in the voice of a young
person, how chaotic a lifestyle he lived until he was able to sort
himself out. We are not talking about someone under the age of 18; by
the time that he started to want to change, he was in his late
20s.</div>

						 Many programmes
already do that, and they help. There is something about ensuring that
they are adequately funded, not necessarily bringing in new people with
new programmes, that will make a difference. A lot of your answer is
already there. If you make it compulsory and you put in adequate
resources&#151;a lot of resources will be needed&#151;then it would
make a big difference because, yes, you would get that shift on the

prepared to listen to what young people are telling you then, yes, you
could make a significant
difference.</div>

						 Certainly,
businesses that we work with are extremely supportive, as I said
earlier. We are launching an alumni scheme for the businesses funded by
the Prince&#146;s Trust on 25 May, which all of our businesses will
join. Part of what those businesses will be asked to do when they
become established is to take young people in&#151;not necessarily on
apprenticeship courses, since some of them are small
businesses&#151;for work experience and help with CVs, for example.
Obviously, if they become wealthy businesses they will be asked to
donate some profits to the trust; some have done that by
themselves.</div>
					<a name="08012290000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
butchers are one group that I have been talking to recently. We are
running a series called &#147;Get into butchery&#148;, because
butchers cannot get young people at the moment. I know that there have
been lots of jokes about us honing knife skills, but there we go. I go
and talk to schools; for example, I asked a group of teachers in
Swindon, &#147;How many of you, in the last year, have suggested that
any of your young people might like to try butchery?&#148;, and the
answer was, clearly, &#147;Nobody&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012290000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Young people need to understand
the different apprenticeships that could be available to them. With
many current apprenticeships, the threshold is, certainly, too high for
our young people if they require NVQ level 3 to get on to the
apprenticeship programme. The bulk of our young people come to us
without NVQ level 1. If our butchery thing works&#151;we have run
two, and have plans to run some more this year&#151;I hope that we
can put the two groups together. We are looking very much at skills
areas where there are shortages of young people going into
industries.</div>
					<a name="08012290000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another area
is the markets, as in Borough market as opposed to financial markets,
which are again finding it increasingly difficult to attract young
people. However, you can earn a good living there. With the first group
that we took to Borough market, they did not bother showing them the
fruit and veg stalls; they took them out the back, showed them the
Porsches and said, &#147;If you do well, this shows what you can
earn.&#148; You then get the young people interested, and they want
to come on the course. However, you need back-up from the schools and
employers and you need to look at the threshold for current
apprenticeship schemes.</div>

						 Yes; you name
it, and I think we get into it at the moment. The other issue concerns
the support for the trainee. That is why many small businesses have
been reluctant, particularly with our target group. They have had
issues; I know that my shoe example was a bad one, but they have to
overcome that sort of thing, so we as the voluntary sector offer that
support to help a young person. Our big &#147;Get into&#148; is
with the construction industry; we are doing a six-week course where we
encourage the young people to take their site certificate. That
industry is then taking them straight into the apprenticeship courses.
It was finding that it had low retention rates there, because they were
getting bored by having to do the site certificate
first.</div>

						 One difficulty
for us is the demarcation of adults at 18, because the team programme
is for 16 to 25-year-olds, and there is a reason for that, which is
that the positive outputs increase. I find it quite difficult to
separate out. We have all met people who at 22 were more childish than
the 16-year-old down the road. That is the difficulty. From the
trust&#146;s point of view, the more that can be done&#151;we were
very encouraged by some of the noises coming out about the 19-plus
group&#151;the better, because we work across that age range. We do
not hold statistics&#151;I looked beforehand&#151;on the
differences between those under 18 and those over 18. I have not really
answered your question, but I just do not know the
answer.</div>

						 If I could talk
personally, from  the trust&#146;s point of view, an
unintended consequence of the cut-off is likely to involve the team
programme,  for example, because the LSC will fund the 19 to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>25-year-old bit and the local authorities, we are told, will consider
funding the 16 to 18-year-old bit. The difficulty is that I do not know
in advance which person from which age group will go on to the
programme. The programme is for 16 to 25-year-olds, as I said, because
we get more positive outputs, and in the mix that happens you get a lot
of peer mentoring. The issue with the cut-off at 19 is this. Although
we would welcome any extra support, and it certainly provides
that&#151;on the whole, the LSC has done a very good job with that
group and we would want that to continue&#151;the fact that we now
have one programme that has to find funding from all different bits
will make it quite difficult to sustain. Ten thousand young people went
through that programme last year, most of whom are now in education,
training or
employment.</div>

for them to engage in the education and training opportunities that the
Government want them to have between 16 and 18 on a compulsory basis,
before sorting those problems out. First, have I got that right, and
secondly, if that is a legitimate concern&#151;returning to Sarah
McCarthy-Fry&#146;s point&#151;is it better, in your view, to amend
the Bill to make the obligation one that is not focused just on
education and training but could be about sorting out those problems
before allowing young people to take up an education and training
entitlement? Or do you think that does not really add much and we
should just focus on putting more money and backing behind the services
that will deal with those problems for the minority of youngsters who
will have those very severe social, health and other
problems?</div>

						 The move to push
the funding to local authorities will work, providing local authorities
are given adequate training and time, and I suspect that some kind of
transition funding is available. The local
authorities that we have approached for funding
post-2010&#151;obviously we cannot wait until then suddenly to
discover that we have to dismantle the infrastructure or whatever; we
have to do some planning&#151;have said that they are not even ready
to start thinking about it, and that is a real
concern.</div>
					<a name="08012290000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some local
authorities will be fantastically brilliant at it and the
partnerships&#151;we kind of know almost now where they
are&#151;and some will be really bad at it. I guess that somebody in
Government has got to work out where the bad ones are and what kind of
training they will need in order to be able to make this provision
relatively quickly and to the people who really need it. So that would
be my first point on local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012290000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms
of provision in schools&#151;particularly for, I think you said,
under-14s&#151;we run xl clubs, which are actually for 14
to16-year-olds, for young people who are already going down the
exclusion route, but they are small, so we would take six at the most,
maybe eight, into an xl club, and work with them. Again, we have had
quite a lot of success&#151;as have other voluntary sector
organisations&#151;at keeping those young people in school and
stopping them going down the route they were already
taking.</div>
					<a name="08012290000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It comes back
yet again to resources and to class sizes. I know there was a programme
on television recently about a school that somebody had set up for kids
who had been excluded&#151;again, keeping them in very small classes
with targeted support. We also work in xl with the pupil referral units
with some success, and where it works well it is fantastic. I have met
so many young people whom it has made a real difference to, and where
there is a real partnership between the voluntary sector and the
school, it is brilliant. But where you do not get that, it does not
work. It does not matter really how much money you put in. So I suppose
that one of the difficulties that society has is how you legislate for
human behaviour, and where you get the head teacher who just says
&#147;Well, all right,  do it, but I am not really
interested,&#148; on the whole it does not
work.</div>

in particular in the age group we were talking about. You have also

I am saying that we would have genuine concerns about compulsion and I

lend Mr. Williams the book but it is a signed copy and he
should just buy it. Mark Johnson was in his 30s when I met him. He got
into drugs at a very young age and his experience at school was
appalling, but he is an intelligent person. Do you find that a lot of
your clientele have had very bad experiences at school, because the
schools are not providing education? In particular, may I pick up on
the questions that Mr. Heald asked about literacy levels.

						 The literacy
levels are mixed. We have had young people from university on our

as saying that it is all the fault of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>school, or that the young people have had a bad experience with school.
The experiences probably start at home, and some of that anger they go
into school with is then translated in their behaviour at school, and
then that causes a clash with the teachers and the whole thing starts
to unravel. Certainly that is the experience of the teachers that I
have spoken to. So, on the whole probably not, and it is not quite as
simple as it may seem when you read Mark&#146;s book. He did have
huge issues at home, did he
not?</div>

You will know that the Department produced a report in 2005 that said
that &#147;the significant flaws in the current arrangements mean
that they are not sustainable in today&#146;s education and economic

						</i> The provisions in the Bill as outlined are
the right way forward. I think the House of Lords last year made the
right observation when it said that insufficient independent advice is
given to all young people who are making significant decisions about
post-16 education. The Connexions service has at the moment a
differential effect across the country. That is one of the problems
with it. It is not necessarily the case that one gets the same
advice&#151;the same choice of advice&#151;in all localities. The
provisions in the Bill will certainly aid the opportunities of young

between the respective responsibilities of schools in Connexions

responsibility to local authorities. We could end up with a duocracy,

careers advice, and an adult careers service dealing with a different
range of people. Would  that be

						</i> It is important that the emphasis in the
legislation should be placed on schools advice. That is where the
majority of young people receive their advice from their existing
teachers, parents and peer group. Therefore priority should rest with
the local authority to improve young people&#146;s access to
information in schools. Whether the service needs to be the same for
adults is debatable. I do not think that it does. I think that access
to adult information and advice can as well be achieved in other
localities, and that they are

AOC says, &#147;The issue of compulsion is controversial, but for the
policy to have legitimacy there has to be an
incentive for participation.&#148; The Bill imposes a duty on
educational institutions to promote good attendance. How do you
interpret the duty to promote good attendance? How will colleges work
with LEAs to enforce those arrangements? Are colleges geared
up&#151;are they equipped&#151;to deal with

						</i> That is a good question. Already colleges are
tracking student attendance very effectively in terms of the education
maintenance allowance requirements. As you are probably aware, every
college in the land has to submit very detailed analysis of
learners&#146; attendance, in order that people qualify for the EMA.
I see that duty effectively as an extension of that requirement. It is
obviously onerous on institutions to have to collect that level of
detail, but if compulsion is necessary here, having a system that does
not track effectively would make it impossible to monitor and

their natural territory. In areas where institutions have not

about clauses 66 and 68 on advice and then briefly about transport.
First, on advice, the Bill introduces the fact that advice to the young
person should be impartial or independent, but it also says that they
should be between 16 and 18. Do you not think that the critical time is
more likely to be the age of 14, particularly given that the diplomas
will have been fully rolled out across the country when the Bill comes
into effect? The critical decision that people will have to make will
be at the end of key stage 3, rather than at the end of key stage
4.</div>

						</i> Let us put the problem in perspective. The
vast majority of school pupils between the ages of 14 and 16 have quite
adequate access to information. What the Bill requires is that those
schools that do not currently allow that to be accessed by all students
will now have to comply with the impartiality clause. In answer to your
question about timing, I agree with you that proper advice and guidance
should occur as early as possible, so that proper choices can be made.
Getting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>people on the right course is potentially the most important aspect of
the Bill, so I believe that the clause is as important as some others
in getting us to the point where participation increases. At the

system.</div>

training until those problems were sorted out. Under the Bill, some of
those youngsters could end up coming into the colleges that you

						</b> At present, young people can work a maximum of 40
hours. It is proposed in the Bill that, for those post-16 who choose to
work, they should do up to 280 hours a year of training towards an
appropriate qualification. As your services from FE colleges become
more demand-led, to what extent do you think those qualifications could
be taught in the evenings and at weekends, so that those who, by mutual
agreement with their employer, want to carry on working five days a
week could still access that sort of
training?</div>

						</i> It will be essential that colleges of further
education offer that flexibility. That will materialise in a number of
different ways: different start times throughout the year and different
modes of delivery, whether on a block basis or a part-time evening
basis. Colleges are quite well used to operating on that basis,
particularly in an adult market. This measure would require an
extension of that, but do not forget that the opportunities for
work-based training would also give additional
flexibility.</div>

solely would be a mistake and that there should be different routes for
different types of young people. Presumably, your members are pleased

						</i> It might be a good idea if I call on an
example at this point. Last week, I visited Thurrock and Basildon
college, which is working in partnership with South East Essex college.
They are in a consortium of 15 providers that include colleges, private
providers and the voluntary sector. They have essentially three levels
of apprenticeship offer: pre-apprenticeship, whereby they offer
essentially level 1 and 2 numeracy and literacy skills and
employability skills, moving through to apprenticeship at level 2 and
then advanced apprenticeship. The volume of learners who are going
through that programme now equate to more than 2,000 in one year. That
is the fifth largest provider of work-based learning in the country,
led by two further education
colleges.</div>
					<a name="08012290000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to your question, I would say that that type of relationship
between local employers, the community and different types of provider
seems to get us to the solution that we are looking for, certainly on
apprenticeships. I am absolutely clear that the same type of working,
when applied across other routes, such as 14 to 19, is better achieved
through partnership.</div>

that association is a school-based representative body with some
sixth-form college principals membership as well. Our point on the
resource required is that the number of 16 to 18-year-olds in this
cohort at the time of the Bill&#146;s implementation will obviously
reduce. Therefore, there could be a shift in resources from where they
currently stand, to these new arrangements.</div>

recognise that there will have to be some transformations in the way
that colleges currently operate, given the new arrangements. I do not
underestimate the distance that will have to be travelled for full
participation to become a reality. I have hinted at some of the things
that will have to change&#151;the curriculum offer, the work force
issues, the comparable pay issues between those in existing schools and
colleges of further education. The reason why I have not yet
highlighted those issues is that nobody has yet asked me that question.
However, I agree with the analysis made by the previous speaker, who
suggested that a shift in resources will have to happen for this to
become a reality.</div>

Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): How do you view the capacity
and resource level of colleges in coping with the increased
participation of special needs students? As you mentioned earlier, some
of these people just need to acquire employment skills, but there will
be a much greater range of requirements among special needs students.
Could you reflect upon the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>implications of travelling time? Students who attend special schools
often need specialised transport if they have mobility problems. A
circuitous route is often taken from home to school, because more than
one child is collected. That will naturally apply to colleges as
well.</div>

will inevitably challenge the sector in the ways that you have

paragraph 11 of your brief that the provision of affordable transport
is vital to assist young people in accessing the right course. You then
go on to say that the Bill is disappointing, because it does not
strengthen the obligation of local authorities to ensure that
affordable transport is available. Paragraph 6.10 of the regulatory
impact assessment prepared by the Government states: &#147;We do not
expect this change&#148;&#151;the change about taking time into
account in transportation&#151;&#147;to place any additional cost
burdens on local authorities&#148;. What is your view on that? Does

						</i> I go back to the learner experience, as that
seems to me where this is most important. It cannot be right that
individuals who need to access particular types of
specialism&#151;vocational specialisation, for example&#151;are
disadvantaged because they have chosen that particular route. As we
know, there will not necessarily be choice within the immediate
locality of a learner&#146;s home. The same would apply to specialist
education provision; it is not necessarily the case that something will
be conveniently around the corner.</div>
					<a name="08012290000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The association would make the
point&#151;this is certainly the experience of the majority of
colleges&#151;that if you want people to exert choice and the option
that they choose is different from somebody else&#146;s, because of
their particular background and needs, the cost of transport should not
prohibit them from taking up that choice. In reality, total coverage of
the options will not be available to every young person in their

home.</div>

at the employers&#146; place of work. Inevitably, there will be areas
in the country where it is not possible to secure sufficient employer
involvement&#151;or, indeed, employer specialisation&#151;to let
that be a reality. Let us be absolutely clear: we have a problem with
the number of employers, particularly small and medium-sized employers,
who are coming forward to support apprenticeship programmes. My
understanding is that new arrangements will be put in place to
encourage more employers to support
apprenticeships.</div>

						</b> I have two points. You will know that the National
Institute of Adult Continuing Education reports a collapse in adult and
community learning, which has had profound
consequences for colleges and communities. Also, Lord Leitch recommends
that we will need to upskill and reskill the existing work force,
including many mature learners. The new emphasis on younger people will
presumably skew colleges&#146; attention and resources away from
those two areas.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sue
Dutton:
							</b>
						</i> Two things are happening simultaneously, as
you rightly point out. One is the reduction in access to adult
learning, which has occurred because of the new priorities that have
been established on qualification levels&#151;first, level 2 and now
level 3 provision. Over the past two years, colleges have fundamentally
shifted the delivery of adult learning to those priority areas. That
has seen a reduction in previous arrangements of around 700.000
learners over the past year, to new priorities on Train to Gain and
equivalent courses. So you are right that there has been a fundamental
shift in the prioritisation of those points. What was the second point
you were asking
about?</div>

need to upskill and reskill the existing work force, which clearly
involves a lot of mature learners. Will the new concentration on young

						</i> If you take into account the reduction in the
number of 16 to 18-year-olds who will be in the cohort by the time that
this is enacted, I think that the proportion of young people will be
the same. For most colleges, around 66 per cent. of funding is routed
through young people. I think that the point that you are making is
about the reskilling of the work force at levels 3 and 4. Indeed, that
is not now a Government priority, and we are moving towards a position
in which individuals will pay for their own learning, or that learning
will be paid for by the employer.</div>

challenge in respect of those new young people. You said yourself that
they will be a different group of young people and many
young people with challenging circumstances and
special needs are being brought into the system. Numerically there may
be equivalence, because of the fall in the cohort, but the need to
concentrate your attention and

						</i> My argument would not be quite the same as
yours. I think that colleges already concentrate on the harder-to-reach
and the widening participation of young people. They are also the
largest provider of A-level provision. I was alluding earlier to the
fact that I do not necessarily accept the proposition that all the
people at present sitting outside education, training or employment are
difficult and recalcitrant individuals. I put it to you that many of
them have not chosen to be in education or training, because the right
options have not been available to them, and many do not have the
confidence as learners to enter education and training. Rather than
being the disruptive element of society, which is how
they might typically be characterised, they are found by colleges to be
under-confident individuals who often do not have social networks to
support them. The Bill will galvanise the system to ensure that
everyone is working to their benefit.</div>
