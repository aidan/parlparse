</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Good morning, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Clause 7 concerns the audit of best value performance 
plans. It sets out how the auditor is to be appointed and 
what he will consider once such a report is prepared. The 
principal issue that I wish to raise is contained in 
amendment No. 10, which concerns who the auditor is 
to be.
<P>
In the private sector it is common practice to follow the 
Cadbury committee's recommendation and change 
company auditors on a regular basis. It is recommended 
that a public limited company should not have the same 
auditor for more than three years running. The auditor 
should then be changed because there is a danger of a 
cosy relationship developing between him and the 
company. Local government, however, is different 
because the Audit Commission and the district auditor are 
permanent features. The district auditor often audits local 
authorities ad infinitum.
<P>
Best performance plans should be considered by 
someone who is distanced from the authority's operation. 
If an authority's auditor was to become involved with 
auditing a best value performance plan, that would be too 
much like an auditor auditing his own work. Amendment 
No. 10 proposes that clause 7(1) should stipulate that the 
auditor should be different from the one employed by 
the authority.
<P>
Amendment No. 161 is a probing amendment and 
concerns provisions for the auditor's appointment in 
clause 7. We would like the Minister to explain the 
background to subsections (7), (8) and (9) so as to clarify 
the Bill's intentions.
<P>
Amendment No. 162 proposes that the auditor should 
not be a provider of consultancy advice, as that would 
lead to conflict. A situation may arise in which an auditor 
audits the authority's annual accounts and also provides 
consultancy advice on constructing a best value 
performance plan. If the auditor was then asked to audit 
such a plan, he would not bring the necessary freshness 
of view.
<P>
Experience demonstrates that district auditors, as a 
breed, can be reluctant to take up complaints about 
contracting and contracting out. However, auditors will be 
required to pursue such matters in the audit of best value 
plans. Complaints made to the district auditor about poor 
value in a local authority are often passed on to the 
Department of the Environment, Transport and the 
Regions. That is because such matters are regarded as 
political issues rather than audit issues. The Audit 
Commission is paid to carry out consultancy advice, and 
it is important that such responsibilities are kept separate.
<P>
One local authority went through the process of letting 
a refuse collection contract, the lowest bidder for which 
was a private sector contractor. However, the council kept 
the contract in-house for the direct labour organisation. 
When the contractor complained, the district auditor 
simply claimed that it was a matter for the DETR, not the 
auditor. I shall not name the authority. It would be 
invidious to name public officials in the district audit 
office.
<P>
The auditor should be independent if the person who 
holds that post is to assume a proper enforcement role. 
Amendments Nos. 10 and 162 would effect that, subject 
to clarification of clause 7(7) and (8).
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): I should like to 
support my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex 
(Mr. Jenkin).
<P>
The current link between a local authority's auditor and 
the Audit Commission is fairly tenuous. It is a 
pay-and-rations arrangement. We have an opportunity to 
ensure that the auditor has a more hands-on role in best 
value. Therefore, it would be appropriate to have an 
independent auditor, with a more direct link to the Audit 
Commission.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend's comments about a 
closeness not a collusion between local authorities, 
especially smaller authorities such as district councils, and 
local authority auditors. I do not believe that that is 
intentional, or that it happens in major local authorities, 
but a definite closeness exists. I shall give an example.
<P>
I approached the treasurer of a local authority, which I 
shall not name. I had some links with the authority and
I was disturbed by the way in which its budget was 
assembled. I was especially disturbed because that small 
local authority's balances were greater than the total 
revenue that it collected. The balances were so high that 
the authority seemed to be acting unlawfully. It was 
explained that the councillors wanted the balances to be 
high and that the treasurer was happy. I asked about the 
auditor, who had endorsed the system for a long time. I 
said that, as a council taxpayer, I would seriously consider 
taking the council to judicial review. When the relevant 
committee met, it received a letter from the auditor 
explaining that the authority should lower its balances.
<P>
The procedure, which involved the same auditor and 
treasurer, had gone on for many years. The local Liberal 
Democrat-controlled council's bank account had huge 
balances when council tax payers would have preferred 
the money to be spent on services or to remain in their 
own bank accounts where at least some interest could 
accrue on it.
<P>
Until the boot had been put into the closeness between 
the auditor and the treasurer, nothing happened. Without 
such action, the system would have continued.
<P>
There should be an independent, new auditor, who can 
bring a breath of fresh air and different thinking to 
matters. Of course, that auditor should use some of the 
results, facts and figures gained from the treasurer and 
the council's auditor, but he should also be able to rattle 
the cages.
<P>
Many small district councils present their figures every 
year and claim that they are fine and in the middle 
bracket. But they are in the middle bracket every year. 
They make no progress; their performance figures show 
no improvement. There is currently no incentive for them 
to improve. My hon. Friend is right to propose the 
appointment of someone from outside, who can act 
without feeling impeded by any friendships that may 
have developed.



<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): Why is an 
auditor supposed to be doing the job that we are 
considering? Auditors check the probity of expenditure, 
they examine specific mechanical details; for example, if 
balances are low it may appear as if expenditure has been 
illegally directed. However, what we are considering is 
all about efficiency, economy and efficacy, or whatever 
the three Es are that keep appearing as a leitmotif in the 
Bill. If the purpose of the plan is to set out the way in 
which the authority will meet the relevant criteria, spend 
money more efficiently and meet certain targets, should 
not the job be given to experts in management rather than 
in auditing? Should not there be recourse to, perhaps, 
management consultants, or even a peer review body from 
within local government, rather than to auditors, who are 
not qualified for the job in question? I want to know why 
so great a burden has been placed on the auditing 
function, which is different from the management process 
that the clause seems to be concerned with.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> As the hon. Member for North Essex said, the clause sets out in detail how an authority's 
auditor would report on its local performance plan and 
how that report should be disseminated. The auditor's 
report on the plan would be part of the rigorous process 
that we promised in the White Papers to check both the 
local performance plans and the management systems 
underpinning them. In that sense the right hon. Member 
for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) is right to say that the 
arrangement goes beyond what has traditionally been seen 
as audit.
<P>
The auditor would have to report on whether the plan 
was prepared and published in accordance with clause 6 
and any guidance. The report would have to state any 
amendments that he believed were necessary for the plan 
to accord with legislation and guidance, and recommend 
any action to be taken.
<P>
The clause presents a range of possible actions to be 
taken by the auditor if he were not satisfied that the plan 
accorded with legislation or that best value was being 
achieved. In that case, the auditor could recommend that 
remedial action be taken by the authority, or, in cases of 
more serious failure, could recommend inspection by the 
Audit Commission or that a direction be given by the 
Secretary of State.
<P>
The clause makes provision for the authority's plan to 
be audited by an external auditor appointed by the Audit 
Commission. In normal circumstances, the best value 
auditor for any given year would be the auditor who 
audited the accounts for the previous year. That would 
ensure that the approach was consistent and that the 
person auditing the plan could provide a meaningful and 
informed check on provisional financial information that 
might have to be included in the plan.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I think that we all understand the 
clause, and this is not a stand part debate. Our real interest 
is why the Minister feels that a totally independent 
auditor, who could quickly understand the service by 
using the figures and other material from the local 
authority's treasurer, chief executive and auditor, could 
not provide a decent and competent service, if not a better 
and more enlightened one a fresh view, perhaps than 
would be provided under the Government's proposal. The 
latter is not new Labour, but staid Labour.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, variety 
already exists in this context. The district audit service 
does not conduct all audits these days. They are conducted 
variously by the district audit service and the private 
sector. That results in moves, shifts and changes for 
authorities, but, as I have been trying to explain, while 
we are, I accept, changing to more than traditional audit, 
auditors in local government have traditionally had clear 
responsibility for value for money as well as probity. It is 
in that respect that we are asking them to expand and 
develop their activity, in the context of best value. The 
Audit Commission is currently working hard reviewing 
both the skills and the practice required to undertake this 
wider audit under best value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is it the Audit Commission's intention to 
produce a list of approved auditors who have been 
through the course and who know what best value is 
supposed to mean in these terms so that we can have 
confidence that people hired by the local authority have 
the necessary training and are up to date with their new 
functions?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Audit Commission will draw up 
a code of practice a sort of itinerary that applicants for 
auditor under the best value regime will have to meet. 
ŠŠ213‹‹That does not mean that there will be an approved list; it 
means that applicants will be clear about what is expected 
of them, and know that they must meet those criteria if 
they wish to work in local government audit under the 
best value regime.
<P>
As Opposition Members have said, amendment No. 10 
would introduce the requirement for an auditor not 
familiar with a local authority to audit its performance 
plans. I understand what the hon. Member for Mole 
Valley attempts to say, but am not sure that I agree.
<P>
Local authority external auditors appointed by the 
Audit Commission have to be appropriately qualified as 
specified in the Audit Commission Act 1998. Although 
independent of an authority, they build a relationship with 
it and an understanding of how it operates, as the hon. 
Gentleman said.
<P>
A key objective of auditing performance plans is to 
ensure that they are appropriate to the authority and to 
the requirements of its stakeholders citizens, businesses, 
voluntary organisations and so on. The amendment would 
entail a second external auditor familiarising himself with 
the workings and financial circumstances of each 
authority. I understand that for many reasons the hon. 
Gentleman think that a good idea. However, it would 
increase fairly substantially both the burden on and the 
cost of the process to local authorities.
<P>
I can see the benefit of local authority plans being 
examined with fresh eyes, but our proposals far outweigh 
that. An auditor would be aware of the context in which 
the plan was prepared and, therefore, be better able to 
comment on it in the light of local circumstances. An 
external safeguard is provided in the best value 
framework by regular inspection and by consideration of 
fundamental performance reviews by the best value 
inspectorate, or other specialist inspectorates.
<P>
We acknowledge the necessity for a fresh look at these 
matters by an outside eye. However, as we are already 
proposing an inspectorate, to accept the amendment 
would simply result in an overburdened, over-expensive 
and possibly bureaucratic method. The hon. Member for 
Mole Valley has at times argued against that, but now he 
appears to argue for it.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> On the one hand, the hon. Lady 
says that an independent external auditor would have 
difficulty learning an authority's circumstances on 
account of not being close enough, and so on, and on the 
other proposes an independent group from way outside 
that will go in and do exactly what we have suggested. 
Such a group would be further out, and less able to 
understand. The hon. Lady underestimates the ability of 
such people be they from private sector or the so-called 
ex-district auditor system to work closely and efficiently 
with local authorities. They will look at only specific 
performance details, so will rely to some extent on the 
opinions of the local authority, the council and the 
council's auditor. I doubt that there would be an enormous 
increase in expenditure. These people are extremely 
competent.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman 
said that. He seemed to imply earlier that their collusion 
with local authorities was such that they were not doing 
ŠŠ214‹‹their job effectively. I am pleased that he has moved from 
that position. I understand his perspective. We believe that 
that is covered through the inspection regime and that the 
amendment is therefore unnecessary and simply imposes 
an extra burden. I hope that on consideration the hon. 
Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Essex for 
tabling Amendment No. 162, which raises important 
issues which go to the heart of probity and financial 
propriety in the best value framework. We are all anxious 
to ensure that scrutiny of local performance plans is 
carried out in an impartial manner and that auditors should 
not be in a position to carry out such work in a manner 
which may confer financial advantage upon themselves. 
It is for that reason that we have, under clause 8, placed 
the Audit Commission under a duty to produce a code of 
practice for best value audits, and obliged best value 
auditors to abide by it. I hope that that covers the issue 
that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon raised.
<P>
The code will cover those issues such as probity, good 
practice and the application of professionally recognised 
standards which hon. Members are concerned about. The 
code is the right place to deal with these issues, rather 
than the Bill. In providing for this, we have followed 
closely the successful precedent of the Audit Commission 
Act 1998, and I am confident that we will achieve a 
similar degree of protection for all interested parties in 
this Bill. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw 
this amendment too.
<P>
We have, throughout our debates, heard much about the 
need to safeguard the interests of the public. The creation 
of an effective, rigorous and fair system of audit is central 
to that. Amendment No. 161 is, therefore, both surprising 
and disappointing, although I understand that it is a 
probing amendment. It seeks to remove the powers which 
would allow the commission to produce a code of practice 
for best value audits, and a requirement for auditors to 
abide by it. It would therefore remove many of the things 
that I have been talking about and would remove the 
means by which consistency of treatment of best value 
authorities can be achieved. That is not fair to the 
authorities or the people they seek to serve.
<P>
The amendment also seems to remove the provision in 
clause 7(7), which provides for continuity in vest value 
by requiring that the best value auditor will be the same 
person who audited the authorities' accounts the previous 
year. We have introduced that provision for the sake of 
continuity but also to ensure that the best value auditor, 
in working with unaudited financial data in the local 
performance plan, will be able to apply his historical 
knowledge of the authority's financial circumstances to 
supplement the material with which he works for best 
value purposes.
<P>
Again, that addresses an issue that the hon. Member for 
Mole Valley raised earlier. He is concerned that 
performance data in the performance plan may be well 
out of date if it is simply the audited material. We want 
councils to include more recent data in the performance 
plan. Having the person who audited the accounts looking 
and commenting on that will help continuity and will also 
help to assure the public that things are working 
effectively. It might help the Committee to know that the 
Audit Commission, as well as introducing in the code of 
best practice, will instigate regular quality controls of the 
auditors to ensure consistency in respect of quality and 
best value. I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex 
will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Can the Minister help with a point of detail 
on timing? The financial year runs from April to April, 
but when does she expect the performance plan to be 
voted on in the council before or after the financial year 
starts? The auditor has to report by 30 June, a quarter of 
the way into the year. June is followed by July and August 
and the Minister will know that trying to elicit replies to 
consultation from local government in those months is 
an impossibility.
<P>
If the auditor then asks the Secretary of State to 
intervene, we will then have two pretty dead months, and 
before we know where we are we will be six months into 
an existing performance plan before the council even 
knows that the plan is inadequate and will need to be 
revised. When does the Minister expect the plan to be 
established by the council? Is she satisfied that having the 
auditor's review of the plan by the end of June is not too 
relaxed a timetable? If action is pursuant to the review, is 
not the holiday season too far down the road in the 
financial year to have a reasonable chance of pulling the 
plan back?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have to find a balance between 
ensuring that the process is rigorous and enabling 
councils to take proper action if the auditor is 
dissatisfied with the performance plan, which has to be 
published by 31 March. I understand the problem that 
the right hon. Gentleman is talking about, but I would 
not expect an authority to delay matters beyond the 
summer recess, if they have one some do and some 
do not.
<P>
Clearly, a bad report on the performance plan in June 
will require councils to demonstrate that action is being 
taken, otherwise they might be in trouble from other 
quarters. We want to ensure that councils themselves are 
responsible for taking action to reassure the district 
auditor or anyone else with an interest, such as the 
public and the inspectors if they are around that 
necessary steps are being taken. Delay will not be in 
their interests.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That last exchange was about dates, and I 
suspect that the Secretary of State will use powers under 
subsection (6)(b) to bring forward the date by which the 
auditor should expect to receive a report as set out in 
subsections (1) to (4). It will be interesting to see how it 
works in practice. My right hon. Friend the Member for 
Skipton and Ripon has hit on an important matter for the 
Minister to consider, perhaps on Report.
<P>
Regarding the probing amendment No. 161 and 
amendment No. 162, I am simply not convinced by what 
the Minister said and I ask her to reflect further. She said 
effectively that the auditors of annual accounts and best 
value plans will themselves be checked on by the Audit 
Commission to ensure that they are complying with 
appropriate codes of practice. However, as in the private 
sector, the auditors should audit each other's work and, 
by having different auditors to do so, they will catch each 
other out. Whether or not they are professionally 
qualified, there is a tendency in human beings, if they 
discover a mistake that they made last year, to attach less 
importance to that mistake than they might have done had 
the mistake been made by someone else. That is why there 
should be a different auditor for performance plans.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The private sector does not have an 
inspection regime.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Why rely entirely on a bureaucratic 
inspection regime when, by creating the right regulatory 
framework, the need for such intervention would be 
reduced? The hon. Lady said that we need not worry 
about the performance plans because there will be 
inspections under clause 10 when people are not satisfied, 
but why wait until things are further down the track? Why 
not include the safeguards, protections and transparency 
as early as possible?
<P>
We will not waste time on unnecessary divisions, but I 
ask the Minister to reflect on the issue raised. She 
gracefully acknowledged that there is an issue to be 
considered and the Department has obviously thought 
about it already. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): I beg to move 
amendment No. 183, in page 6, line 35, leave out 
from`with' to end of line 36 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sections 3 and 6 and any order or guidance under either section'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment 
No. 184, in page 6, line 38, leave out from `with' to end 
of line 38 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sections 3 and 6 and any other or guidance under either section'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The amendments are designed to ensure 
that auditors reflect on an authority's adherence to the 
principles of best value, as well as to the performance 
plan. Subsection (6) does not reflect the best value 
principles and thus it is not clear whether the audit will 
make any reference to those principles and, consequent 
upon that, whether auditors can pick up on an authority's 
failure to follow equal opportunities principles, for 
example, or to act in a sustainable way. The importance 
of the matter should be reflected in the Bill.
<P>
Even more importantly, the proposal fails to pick up on 
the duty to consult, which is a central plank of the process. 
Although as previous discussions have shown, the 
Government do not view the duty to consult as a central 
plank of best value, it should be part and parcel of the 
auditing process.
<P>
The submission of the Chartered Institute of Public 
Finance and Accountancy to the Select Committee 
showed that there is anxiety about the proposed role of 
the auditor in identifying failures of substance and the 
auditors' expectations in that respect.
<P>
These simple amendments have a clear objective in 
what they wish to achieve and we look forward to the 
Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We share the concern that the Bill's 
objectives should be reinforced at every opportunity and 
in that respect we are sympathetic to the amendments. We 
want the Minister to say that the amendments are 
superfluous because the objectives are well entrenched in 
the Bill, that it will not be possible, for example, for a 
performance plan to fail on that count and that, therefore, 
the amendments are unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I could simply give the hon. 
Gentleman that assurance, but perhaps I should go into 
more detail.
<P>
Compliance with the general duty of best value is 
implicit in the legislation on preparing the local 
performance plan. The auditor's power to make 
recommendations on best value performance plans is 
designed to ensure that those plans deliver the kind of 
plan required to facilitate delivery of best value. If a plan 
is not prepared in compliance with clause 3, the general 
duty of best value, it is hard to imagine how an auditor 
could certify it as being a best value performance plan.
<P>
Hon. members should remember that the performance 
plan will need to contain a statement of the manner in 
which the authority is balancing its objective to take 
account of the three Es, how it is complying with the duty 
in terms of standards and targets, and how it will set out 
plans for and outcomes of reviews. It is also important to 
remember that the auditor will be certifying the process 
that the authority has gone through to produce its plan. 
The process implicitly requires the authority to meet the 
duty of best value. It is unnecessary to adds specific 
references to clause 3 at this stage. However, if the 
process does not comply with the best value principles 
laid down in the Bill, the auditor's powers are robust 
enough to ensure that the plan complies with the duty of 
best value.
<P>
I hope that that will reassure hon. Members that the 
duty of best value is central to the performance plan and 
that the amendments are therefore unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I thank the Minister for making such a 
clear-cut statement on the matter, in the light of which I 
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment

<P>
No. 151, in clause 12, page 9, line 31, leave out from 
`Part' to end of line 33.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for 
Torbay (Mr. Sanders) and I do a double act; when one is 
up the other is down.
<P>
I shall not take up too much of the Committee's time 
on the first few amendments as they are the first tilt at the 
powers to be given to the Secretary of State under clause 
13. We shall discuss the matter more fully in our 
substantive debate on that clause, which, because it gives 
the Secretary of State powers to make directions, is 
probably the worst part of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 147 gives us a chance to probe the 
Government's intentions in clause 13. Is it their intention 
that the scrutiny of best value should rest with the people, 
or with the Secretary of State? The Government do not 
seem to have much faith in the democratic process if they 
feel that they have to overturn, in a heavy-handed way, 
what may have been a recent vote by local people or the 
result of the consultation process in which they expressed 
their views.
<P>
Amendment No. 94 is probably the most substantive 
amendment of the group. It provides that if the auditor's 
report recommends that the Secretary of State makes a 
direction and the authority has to prepare a statement of 
the action it intends to take and the timetable within which 
it will implement that action, the statement should be 
debated at a meeting of the full council by all members 
of the authority.
<P>
As hon. Members know from debates elsewhere, we are 
most unhappy about the proposal for single party cabinet 
committees in local government. It raises the spectre of 
such an important statement being debated behind closed 
doors by such a group. There should be proper scrutiny 
by the Opposition, the ability to ask questions and debate 
the issue, and public scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie 
Ballard) said, the amendment starts the trail that leads to 
the all-important clause 13, under which the Secretary of 
State can take the most draconian actions to deal with 
any shortcomings, starting with a shortcoming in a best 
value plan.
<P>
Subsection (4)(f) underlines the importance of best 
value plans because they have recourse to the Secretary 
of State's powers under clause 13. We understand where 
the Liberal Democrats are coming from: they do not think 
that the Secretary of State should have any powers, and 
they are entitled to their view. However, it is important to 
point out that this is the beginning of the draconian part 
of the Bill. The Secretary of State will be empowered to 
determine authorities' practices far more widely than 
under the competitive tendering scheme, and on a 
comprehensive basis in terms of the functions that are 
under scrutiny. There has to be a fallback position. The 
onus is on the Minister to justify, especially to her hon. 
Friends, giving the Secretary of State recourse to those 
powers at such an early stage ostensibly before anything 
has been done.
<P>
We support the idea of reports being published. 
Government amendment No. 56 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A best value authority shall publish"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a report in accordance with clause 7(5)(a). We also have 
sympathy with Government amendment No. 57, although 
we have our own ideas about what action a local authority 
should take when it receives a statement advising it that 
the best value plan does not comply with the Bill's 
objectives. We shall come to that on a later amendment 
in a different group.
<P>
The main point is that the Minister should justify the 
draconian powers in clause 13 being available to the 
Secretary of State at such an early stage, almost before 
there has been proper discussion between the DETR and 
the local authority about the best value plan. It is 
extraordinary, especially given the noises that the 
governing party made about competitive tendering. The 
Bill was advertised as the abolition of competitive 
tendering Bill, but this suggests that competitive tendering 
is not being abolished, rather that the Secretary of State 
will be enabled to use the powers under competitive 
tendering more widely and comprehensively than before.
<P>
Will the hon. Lady reflect on one question? What will 
be the position when a Conservative Secretary of State is 
once again in Marsham street, exercising the powers? The 
hon. Lady may think that she is legislating for her 
Government, whose popularity in the polls may have 
convinced them that that is all they ever need think about, 
but it is unwise of a Government to legislate on the basis 
that they will be in office permanently. The hon. Lady 
must ask herself how a Conservative Secretary of State 
would exercise the powers. If we were in office again we 
would use them to pursue competitive tendering. 
Everything is there and, what is more, we could begin at 
an extremely early stage in the process, virtually before 
the ink had dried on the plan even before the financial 
year had begun if the Secretary of State pulls forward the 
date by which the auditor must send him the report.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The thought has just come to me that 
perhaps the Minister trusts a future Tory Secretary of 
State more than he trusts existing Labour councils. Does 
the hon. Gentleman agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I apologise to the hon. Lady, but I missed 
the point.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I was suggesting that perhaps the 
Minister trusts a future Tory Secretary of State rather 
more than she trusts existing Labour councils, and that 
perhaps that is what this is all about.



<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Either way [Interruption.] I think that 
the point was against the hon. Lady, not against me. Either 
way, when Labour Members reflect upon what they are 
doing, they, rather than we, will have a crisis of identity 
on account of the true nature and potential of the Bill.
<P>
The Minister must justify why the draconian powers 
under clause 13 should be available at such an early stage 
in the best value process. That speaks volumes about all 
this flexibility she keeps talking about. The flexibility is 
with the Secretary of State when he wants to start 
clobbering the Council in question. We have views about 
a great many hugely inefficient Labour-controlled local 
authorities and my hon. Friends, particularly those who 
served as Ministers with responsibility for local 
government, may look lustfully at these powers. They 
were constrained in office by the rather modest legislation 
that was in place.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Clause 13 has been mentioned 
a couple of times during this debate. We shall come to 
clause 13 and debate it very thoroughly at the appropriate 
time. I understand that clauses are linked and some 
reference must be made occasionally to other clauses, but 
I would prefer it if we did not embark upon a debate on 
clause 13 now.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Jon Owen Jones):</B> I can assure you, Mr. Gale, that I have no wish to debate clause 13 in advance. I do 
not intend to refer it in my speech other than in passing.
<P>
Government Amendment No. 56, which is grouped 
with amendment No. 147, is an amendment to clause 9 
which will improve the accessibility of the reporting 
process to stakeholders. It may be helpful if, with your 
permission, Mr. Gale, I circulate a copy of clause 9 as 
it would look taking into account amendments Nos. 56 
and 57.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I appreciate that the Minister is 
seeking to do this for the convenience of hon. Members, 
but ordinarily, if papers are to be circulated, they should 
be placed in the Room in the appropriate fashion and not 
circulated during the debate. Exceptionally, and I mean 
exceptionally, I am prepared to allow it to happen on this 
occasion if it proves to be for the assistance of hon. 
Members. I would not wish it to become a habit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> My thanks, Mr. Gale. We will circulate 
papers in advance if required in future.
<P>
Amendment No. 56 requires best value authorities to 
publish any report received following the audit of their 
local performance plan whether or not the report 
recommends that the Secretary of State or the Welsh 
Assembly give direction. It also triggers the requirements 
to prepare a statement of action in response to any type 
of recommendation in the auditors report and incorporate 
it in the next local performance plan. As previously 
drafted, such statements were required only where the 
report contained a recommendation for a direction by the 
Secretary of State under clause 13.
<P>
Government Amendment No. 57 will ensure that 
authorities include a statement in the next performance 
plan where any type of action has been recommended by 
the auditor. Previously, the requirement for such 
statements to be prepared applied only to 
recommendations for intervention and enforcement by the 
Secretary of State or the Assembly. The amendment will 
ensure that stakeholders are aware of all types of action 
being proposed by their authority to put right any 
shortcomings that have been detected, whether of 
substance or process. The amendment does not alter the 
previous provision where authorities are required to send 
their statement to the Secretary of State only when the 
audit report recommends that a direction is issued under 
clause 13.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 56 and 57 will largely 
overtake amendments Nos. 147, 148 and 149 and so I 
cannot accept those three amendments. I shall deal with 
amendment No. 147 first. If the options available to the 
auditor are limited to recommending changes to the 
performance plan or recommending that an inspection is 
carried out, it will deny him the full range of tools which 
we believe are necessary to carry out his functions. The 
auditor will not be able to guarantee compliance by an 
authority that has wilfully failed to comply with the 
legislation and guidance on the preparation of 
performance plan whereas the Secretary of State can, and 
in extreme cases, the auditor will need to be able to 
recommend that the Secretary of State takes steps to 
ensure compliance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> How does an auditor know whether 
somebody has wilfully failed? It is possible to fail to do 
something, but the Under-Secretary clearly said "Wilfully 
failed" in other words, take the decision to fail. How is 
an auditor supposed to know whether a local authority 
has wilfully failed to do something as opposed to simply 
being incompetent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I am sure that auditors who are, by virtue 
of their profession, careful and guarded people, would not 
wish to use the word "wilful"	. However, it is possible 
for local authorities deliberately to fail to comply with 
guidance, although they would presumably not admit to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> But how does the auditor find that out? 
How does he establish that an authority is not just 
incompetent but clever enough deliberately to decide not 
to comply? How does the auditor decide whether to send 
the report to the Audit Commission a small smack on 
the back of the hand or to the Secretary of State, which 
is a kick in the backside?
<P>
<B>Mr Jones:</B> As I have already conceded, it is unlikely 
that auditors would use the word "wilfully", but by virtue 
of their experience they would be able to judge the degree 
of incompetence or deliberate action and make 
recommendations accordingly.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Under-Secretary said that the 
auditors would know by virtue of their experience. It was 
conceded earlier that auditors' experience lies mainly in 
examining costs rather that auditing the process. Here we 
are talking about the process of performance plans, not 
financial issues, so where will the necessary experience 
come from particularly in the first few years to enable 
them to start a process that will bring in the draconian 
powers of the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> We are not legislating for what might 
happen in only the first or second year of operations; we 
are legislating for best value a process by which local 
authorities drive up standards over the next decade and 
perhaps beyond.
<P>
As for amendment No. 148, without a copy of the 
auditor's report on the plan, the Secretary of State would 
not be able to intervene. The auditor's or inspector's 
report will be the principal source of objective 
information to the Secretary of State or Assembly on the 
way an authority is implementing the best value regime.
<P>
Amendment No. 149 seems to be flawed in its practical 
application as well as in its intent. The amendment would 
mean that the Secretary of State was sent a copy of all 
statements that would increase the administrative burden 
on him or her. The Secretary of State or Assembly will 
receive feedback from the Commission on the overall 
performance of authorities that are failing and it would be 
unnecessary for him to receive a copy of each statement.
<P>
As I have explained, Government amendments Nos. 56 
and 57 to clause 9 will largely overtake this amendment 
as they will require all best value authorities to publish 
the auditor's report and then to prepare a statement of 
how they will respond to the report. Copies of the 
statement would be sent to the Secretary of State only in 
cases where intervention was recommended. I therefore 
ask that the hon. Member withdraws the amendments.
<P>
Let us consider amendment No. 138. Useful lessons 
and best practice will emerge from the audit and 
inspection processes. The Audit Commission and bodies 
such as the Local Government Association's new 
development and improvement agency will distil and 
publish key messages from the best value framework. The 
Audit Commission proposes to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"identify what works, to inform policy nationally and practice 
locally",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as one of the key principles in its recent public 
consultation, which was entitled, "Developing principles 
for public inspection"	. It would be preferable for the 
Secretary of State or the Assembly and others to receive 
informed analysis of the outcome of audit and inspection, 
rather than a large number of reports on individual 
authorities, as amendment No. 138 suggests.
<P>
Amendment No. 94 proposes that the external auditor's 
report should be debated and approved by the authority. 
It is vital that authority members know the contents of the 
plan and the auditor's report, even if it does not 
recommend action by the Secretary of State. However, it 
is not appropriate for a recommendation to be approved 
by the authority.
<P>
Amendment No. 151 would remove the provision 
whereby the reports of the Audit Commission's 
inspector's are sent to the Secretary of State or the 
Assembly when there is a recommendation for the 
Secretary of State or the Assembly to issue a direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The Under-Secretary said that it was not 
appropriate for the authority to approve a 
recommendation. Would not it be appropriate for an 
authority to note a report, after debating and considering 
it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Clearly, it would be appropriate for an 
authority to see the report. However, we do not want to 
burden local authorities by making the measure too 
bureaucratic.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does the Under-Secretary know what he 
sounds like? The report may be highly critical of a local 
authority's conduct, yet the Under-Secretary claims that 
he does not wish to overburden the authority with an 
obligation to take a view on the matter. That is 
extraordinary. He should say that it is vital that local 
authority members respond to the report. His 
extraordinary comment reveals that best value is about 
bypassing council members. The process is one of audit, 
inspection and, ultimately, enforcement by the Secretary 
of State. It has nothing to do with local authority 
members, who are responsible for providing the services. 
The Under-Secretary has given the game away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> To quote from an earlier debate, the hon. 
Gentleman wilfully wishes to misunderstand the process. 
Of course, it is important that local authority members and 
their constituents know how the authority is performing. 
However, if the auditors provide clear, objective evidence 
of a need to perform differently, that verdict should be 
accepted.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> One of the problems with the 
Under-Secretary's comments is that data on which the 
report is based will be out of date. The local authority 
might have acted on the data on which the performance 
plan was based on and which the auditor was 
commenting, and have rectified the difficulty, without, as 
the Liberal Democrats have suggested it is painful to 
support them being given an opportunity to make it 
clear that it had learnt from its sins, or that the 
incompetent Liberal Democrat-controlled council had 
been tossed out at an election in the meantime, allowing 
a decent Tory council to sort out the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> The hon. Gentleman raised the question of 
delay in the report, which we have dealt with previously. 
The delay will be the minimum practicable. Debate will 
not be prevented.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> It should be a requirement.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> There is a responsibility on local authorities 
to act on the recommendations that the auditors make.
<P>
Amendment No. 151 would remove the provision for 
recommending that the Secretary of State or Assembly 
give a direction. The Amendment would leave no 
mechanism to trigger swift and rigorous remedial action. 
The inspector's report would be one of the key pieces 
of objective information that the Secretary of State could 
consider when deciding whether it would be appropriate 
to intervene. Objective information would enable him to 
make consistent decisions about intervention and that in 
turn would reassure and protect authorities.
<P>
The Bill will ensure that local stakeholders have access 
to information to enable them to hold best value 
authorities accountable for their performance. It also 
provides for the Secretary of State or Assembly to be sent 
those reports that recommend that a direction be given 
under clause 13.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 56 and 57 will ensure 
that local people are provided with the information that 
they need to enable them to judge whether their authority 
is providing best value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): Will the 
Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister has sat down. If 
the hon. Gentleman wants to speak he may do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Given the current state of play in local 
government, and current levels of efficiency, which the 
Under-Secretary has had 18 months to review, how many 
times a year does he expect the Secretary of State to have 
to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and the Deepings): I 
am moved to speak by some remarks of the 
Under-Secretary that were chilling in two respects. The 
word "wilful" was used in connection with the notion that 
councils would choose to frustrate the process of 
providing good quality services and best value. It was 
suggested that that would happen not through 
incompetence or lack of diligence, such as has sometimes 
been shown on the Labour Benches in Committee, but 
through a wilful decision. That caricature suggests a way 
of thinking about local democracy that is prevalent in 
the Government.
<P>
Then we heard the extraordinary suggestion that the 
local authority's power to comment on, debate or respond 
to the independent and objective report I make no 
judgment about its objectivity would be limited. 
Democratically elected local representatives would not 
have the power to respond to the auditor's judgment about 
their decisions, wilful or otherwise. That is a negation of 
the very principles of local democracy and good local 
government. I have attended many local authority debates 
at which the auditor's letter in relation to local authority 
services has been discussed. It is a matter for proper 
consideration, comment and scrutiny. The Bill will turn 
back the clock and return us to the days when central 
Government had enormous power over local affairs 
without reference to elected local people.
<P>
The Minister gave the game away when he said that 
the Government would appeal over the heads of local 
people to stakeholders. That is the model for this 
Government. As they go over Parliament's head by 
appealing to focus groups and opinion polls, so local 
assemblies will be sidelined. That is chilling. We have 
seen the Government's real face behind their approach to 
local government, and learned exactly what they think 
about local democracy. I hope that that message is 
broadcast loud and clear to local authorities throughout 
Britain, whether Labour or Conservative.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The clause has been marginally 
improved by the Government amendments, so we will not 
oppose them. We will discuss later issues raised
by amendments dealing with Secretary of States's direction-making powers under clause 13, so I will focus on amendment No. 94, which has provoked the most 
debate.
<P>
The Minister said that local authority members must be 
aware of the auditor's report, even though they may not 
necessarily be given a copy. However, it will not be 
appropriate for the authority to debate a recommendation 
in the report. We disagree: it is essential that the authority 
debate the auditor's recommendation. Legislation may, 
however, prevent such debate changing the auditor's 
recommendation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jon Owen Jones:</B> May I correct the hon. Lady's 
misapprehension? There is no question of preventing the 
local authorities from debating the auditor's proposals. 
However, local authorities should not have the power to 
approve or disapprove the proposal.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The amendment would require the 
local authority to debate the auditor's recommendations 
in full council. There is a great danger that the Bill will 
drive a further wedge between local and central 
government. Central Government is taking on even more 
powers than it had under the Conservatives. Such a 
process could lead to a complete divorce when an 
authority is at loggerheads with the Secretary of State over 
recommendations in the auditor's report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> Amendment No. 94 does not simply refer 
to debate. It mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the statement and report for debate and approval".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have difficulty with a council approving 
or disapproving a report that has been objectively set out.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Am I to understand that the Minister 
would be willing to support an amendment which 
proposed that the report should be debated and that the 
statement made by the authority in response should be 
debated and approved? It would be acceptable for the 
report to be merely debated because it is a factual 
statement and so cannot be approved or disapproved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I will draw another parallel with the 
private sector. When auditors frame a report on a 
company's business, the board of directors make a 
minute, stating that it has examined the report and 
accepted its findings or asked for those findings to be 
reconsidered. It would be ludicrous for it not to do that. 
However, the Minister's comments reveal that once the 
best value audit process has started, ordinary members of 
the Council are out of the loop. We seek an improvement 
on the best value process and the Under-Secretary talks 
about consent and involvement, but they are distinctly 
lacking from this part of the process. Consent may be 
gained by the board as we will find later in the Bill 
but improvement and involvement should be an important 
part of the best value process. If the hon. Lady chooses to 
divide the Committee on this amendment, we might well 
support her.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his 
helpful intervention.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 147, 
but I shall seek to divide the Committee on amendment 
No. 94.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I see perplexity on the face of the hon. 
Member for Taunton. She will find 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Taunton 
will be able to seek to divide the Committee on 
amendment No. 94 when we reach it later. The hon. Lady 
is not alone in her confusion: I shared it too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 159, in 
page 6, line 44, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) if appropriate, recommending how it should be amended so 
as to take into account any relevant information concerning the 
performance and financial outturn of the immediately preceding 
financial year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment 
No. 160, in page 6, line 44, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) stating whether he believes that it conforms to any relevant 
model for best value performance plans issued by the Audit 
Commission.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> These two simple amendments would 
improve the relevance of the audit of best value plans to 
the operation of a council whose members would have 
more information to act on. The audit overlaps the end of 
the financial year. There is an assumption in amendment 
No. 159 I accept that it may be ambitious for many local 
authorities that regular management and financial 
information will be available in a matter of weeks so that 
it can be included in the process.
<P>
Let us consider an example. The performance of a 
leisure centre being run by a local authority could be 
sensitive to economic conditions, the weather and other 
factors and it might be clear at the outset of the financial 
year that it is underperforming. If it is also the subject of 
a best value performance plan, which is being audited, 
information from it would be highly relevant to the 
authority's business plan for that function later in the year. 
The auditor should be required to take such information 
into account the simple purpose of the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 160 is more a question to the Minister. 
We understand that a best value performance plan will 
also be laid down by the Audit Commission and that a 
model plan will be established. The amendment would 
ensure that the report states whether the auditor believes 
that the performance plan
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"conforms to any relevant model for best value performance plans 
issued by the Audit Commission".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We believe that that will be the case and that what appears 
on what page will be prescribed so that the information is 
properly ordered.
<P>
However, what else will be in this model? For example, 
will it prescribe, as with competitive tendering, a rate of 
return on assets? Under the present legislation, the 
Secretary of State can determine a rate of financial return 
on the assets in a function carried out by a direct service organisation or a direct labour organisation. In a best value performance plan, is the Audit Commission likely 
to lay down such a requirement?
<P>
We have performance indicators and performance 
standards, but will other requirements be laid down 
informally in the best value performance plan which will 
nevertheless be benchmarks to which the auditors of the 
best performance plan will be working? Would it be 
unreasonable to suggest that there should be a 5 per cent. 
return on assets in a best value performance plan? How 
the Audit Commission will supervise the audit of best 
value performance plans is still a mystery and I should be 
grateful if the Minister could explain.

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> We have gone the rounds on an 
aspect of this date difficulty and I should like to support 
my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex. One of the 
difficulties is apparent when one considers the dates. If 
the auditor looks at the plans and publishes his response 
in June 2001, he will use as an assessment of those plans, 
the results for the years 1999 and 2000 so they will be 
at least 12 months out of date.
<P>
Local authorities have a reputation for being slow and 
incompetent, but in reality many of them are very quick 
to react. Many of them I am sure that there will be a cry 
from Labour Members, but Wandsworth is an example 
react very quickly. The chairmen and directors of the 
appropriate committees receive monthly reports on 
progress which are extrapolated to the year end so that 
they can react at an early stage. The local authority may 
well have reacted and corrected the difficulties that are 
shown up in the figures before the auditor.
<P>
Could the Under-Secretary possibly consider rethinking 
the dates or the order or putting in a requirement for the 
local authorities to move faster on their end of year figures 
so that they are relevant? There are three possible 
scenarios. First, the local authority may have already 
reacted in which case the criticism is unfair and 
unfounded. Secondly, in mediocre authorities where there 
has been no change, the council tax payers and recipients 
of services could see that their authorities continue to be 
mediocre and that there has been no progress.
<P>
The third scenario involves actions that may be wilful, 
to use the Under-Secretary's words. I was intrigued by 
the Under-Secretary's remarks and thought of the match 
in Scotland. Could we accuse the Welsh and the All 
Blacks playing for the Welsh of wilfully losing to the 
Scots? But perhaps that is not quite relevant. The word 
"wilful"	 is as outrageous as that. The local authority could 
have failed in the year for which the figures are being 
assessed and in the following year could be even worse, 
but that would not be looked at by the auditor in his 
report.



<P>
I am sure it is not beyond the wit of the Department, 
assisted by the Under-Secretary to leave the date as it is 
now but perhaps to shift the requirement of the local 
authority to report on its annual figures earlier. Some local 
authorities are particularly incompetent Lambeth springs 
to mind. Sometimes the figures were out of date year after 
year and, eventually, nothing was relevant. However, for 
the majority of local authorities this would be much 
more appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Drawing on his experience, does my hon. 
Friend agree that monthly management information is 
obligatory? Monthly management information on 
departmental accounts, incomes and outflows should be 
produced on a regular basis. Does that apply in local 
authorities? Would not the amendment help to make it a 
requirement that local authorities produce timely 
management information for future business plans?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> My hon. Friend is right; if such 
information is not a requirement, it should be. In the 
majority of local authorities such practices are up and 
running, as they are in many, if not most, business 
companies. A few are utterly incompetent; I will not name 
their complexion, but none is blue. The amendment would 
provide an opportunity for the Under-Secretary to put the 
squeeze on incompetent local authorities while allowing 
competent ones the opportunity to present their case 
under criticism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I remind the Committee that the Bill 
gives enormous powers to the Welsh Assembly, although 
we have no idea about its efficiency and adherence to 
timetables. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for 
Mole Valley that we should insist that up-to-date 
information is used. From April, we are flying dark about 
the efficiency of the Welsh Assembly and the competence 
of its members. It should be incumbent upon them to take 
decisions on up-to-date information.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan Meale):</B> Amendment No. 159 is designed to add to the 
list of items that an auditor must include in his report on 
a local performance plan. It would add a requirement for 
him to make recommendations about the inclusion of 
financial and other performance data relating to the 
financial year just concluded.
<P>
We understand Opposition Members' anxieties about 
this important issue, which we have already discussed at 
length. We share their concern that the local performance 
plan should reflect as fully as possible a picture of the 
authority's recent performance in order that ir should be 
meaningful and relevant to local people. However, the 
Bill as drafted achieves that satisfactorily. Clause 7(4)(c) 
contains a requirement for the auditor to make 
recommendations about how the plan could be amended 
so as to accord with clause 6, which sets out what 
authorities are required to do in producing the local 
performance plan.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can 
pause from his written word and note down a few dates. 
The audit is generally done by 30 June; there is a 
three-month delay. At that point, the auditor can only see 
whether the LPP is complete and whether it contains 
properly calculated indicators and measures. He will not 
be able to comment on the previous year's performance 
because those figures are generally not published until 
after the date mentioned.
<P>
The amendment may be incomplete and not phrased 
correctly, but in spite of the Minister being asked to read 
his brief, the reality is that the auditor will be looking at 
figures that are out of date and irrelevant, to the detriment 
of local people if the local authority is incompetent, or 
to the detriment of the local authority if it has reacted 
to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his 
comments. I hope he will bear with me until I reach my 
next explanation.
<P>
The auditors will assess, among other things, the extent 
to which the authority concerned has properly summarised 
its performance against indicators in the previous financial 
year and how that performance compares with what it has 
achieved in previous years. Those requirements are set 
up in clause 6(2)(f) and 6(2)(g); guidance issued by the 
Secretary of State could deal with how authorities might 
approach the practical issues involved in providing topical 
performance information. Such an auditor assessment will 
achieve precisely the effect that Opposition Members 
want. Amendment No. 159 would therefore be an 
unnecessary duplication and I urge the hon. Gentleman to 
withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The Under-Secretary's ministerial 
colleague talked about a wilful council. A wilful or 
incompetent council that is not up to date, does not have 
the current figures and perhaps only just managed to get 
the figures that applied 12 or 18 months previously will 
leave the auditor flying blind. That may be deliberate; an 
incompetent authority could stall in providing the figures, 
unless it was required to present them.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said that 
either there should be a delay in the date, or, preferably, 
that local authorities should be required to produce their 
figures earlier. No such requirement exists currently, and 
an incompetent or wilfully obstructive authority will 
provide the figures later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I am advised that it is possible to bring 
forward the date for the publication of the final accounts. 
We are in discussion with the Chartered Institute of Public 
Finance and Accountancy to try to achieve that.
<P>
We believe that it is possible to get the information to 
the auditor through the auditing services for which 
clause 6 provides. However, in the light of the arguments 
such as those that the hon. Member for Mole Valley 
presented, we are holding talks to ascertain whether we 
can bring dates forward.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Will that be in the Bill? Yes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin</b> rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Hon. Members are bobbing up and down.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Under-Secretary has the 
Floor. Are you giving way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I was giving way to the chap at the back, 
but Opposition Members are all on the hook, and I leave 
it to you, Mr. Gale, to decide.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Forgive me, but it is not up to the 
Chair to decide to whom the Minister wishes to give way.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> As the chap at the back, I 
understood that there would be an amendment in the Bill 
to bring the dates forward. The Under-Secretary nodded 
assent and said yes. In that case, I am satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I did not say yes. I said that talks were 
continuing and that we would report to the House in due 
course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Before the Under-Secretary mentioned 
clause 6, I reread it carefully. Subsection (2)(g) requires 
comparison with the authority's performance in previous 
financial years. That does not necessarily mean the 
preceding financial year. Clause 6(2)(h) requires an 
authority.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to summarise its assessment of its success in meeting any 
performance standard which applied at any time in the previous 
financial year".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, nothing in the Bill suggests that the 
performance plan should be constructed in the light of the 
financial year in which the plan is drawn up.
<P>
The auditor is likely to examine the plan after the 
beginning of the new financial year. We want him to be 
obliged to take the previous financial year which was 
the current financial year when the plan was made into 
consideration when he performs that task.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's remarks. 
I believe that the words "previous financial year"	 in the 
clause cover those points, and that the information will be 
available to the auditor. We shall make every effort to 
ensure that the measure provides for that. We believe that 
the clause is a catch-all provision that can deliver.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex referred to
Clause 6(2)(g). We share the anxieties about ensuring 
that local authorities provide the right amount of 
information for the auditor. However, we do not want 
councils, through delay for one reason or another, to 
cause further delay in the publication of the local 
performance plan. As the hon. Gentleman knows, 
circumstances could arise that would cause an indefinite 
delay. We want to avoid that at all costs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The auditor examines the performance 
plan. If he finds it deficient, does he report to the Audit 
Commission or the Secretary of State that the plan is 
deficient and that they need to take action, or does he 
say that the plan is deficient because of this or that, and 
recommend a course of action? That will have a crucial 
effect on the timetable. If he lobs it to the Secretary of 
State, saying that it is hopeless, the Secretary of State 
must then decide what is needed to remedy it, and the 
time scale will expand. Will the auditor have to identify 
the problem, or will his job, in practice, be to write a 
new improved report to recommend to the Commission 
or Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Again, the auditor's job will be to assess 
as fully as possible, from the information supplied to him, 
the complete audited details of the local performance plan. 
ŠŠ231‹‹We believe that sufficient information will be available 
for that. We are trying to ensure, through continuing 
discussions with CIPFA and others, that we create the 
circumstances for that. But, even without final agreement, 
expect this catch-all clause to be sufficient.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The point that I am trying to get at is, if, 
in practice, the performance plan is inadequate, will it be 
the auditor's job to write a new plan, which he would 
then recommend to the Commission or, ultimately, the 
Secretary of State, to impose on the local authority, or 
does he merely identify the deficiency the holes in the 
plan and leave someone else to do the darning?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Again, we differ over where ownership of 
the local performance is. It will lie with the local 
authority. The Audit Commission may provide an 
illustrated example of such a plan, but it would be in the 
form of guidance and would not have statutory force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> By admitting that Government are in 
negotiations with CIPFA, surely the Minister has given 
the game way and shown that amendment No. 159 is 
needed to rectify a faulty Bill. Why is there no 
requirement for a new date in the Bill, and why are we 
not discussing that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Having negotiations does not mean that 
there will be an agreement. We believe that we are in the 
right position now; it is up to CIPFA to convince us 
otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I should like to be clear about what will 
happen. The auditor will, as a result of his investigations, 
give illustrative examples of where the plan has failed. 
What will be the process and the timetable after that? Who 
will take responsibility for dealing with that, and how 
does it interface with, for example, existing legislative 
arrangements in authorities that already are obliged by law 
to produce plans, in the way that, for example, police 
authorities are?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, ownership 
of the LPP lies with the local authority itself. He also 
knows that clause 8 contains a wide diversity of types of 
plan, and obligations. If he will let me move to that, he 
may have the reply that he seeks.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The Minister, having told us that 
the Department is in discussions with CIPFA, has 
accepted that the crux of the amendments is the 
importance of shrinking the timing so that the data that 
the auditor examines is relevant. Is the Minister listening? 
The Committee needs to know whether he will bring 
forward an amendment, at least on Report, to clarify the 
issue and set the Bill right because, as now drafted, it is 
seriously flawed
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> There can be no guarantee, prior to any 
talks between Ministers in Departments and outside 
organisations, that we will table an amendment. As I have said, the Bill is a satisfactory catch-all measure. We are always looking at ways of improving it and of 
guaranteeing that the information provided to the auditor 
will give as full a picture as possible. If the opportunity 
to revise occurs in this place at some future time, we shall 
take it, but at the moment we have no agreement or 
thoughts otherwise.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am sorry, but I cannot accept 
that. The Minister has already accepted that discussions 
are taking place. He is talking to CIPFA, and he has 
admitted that the Government are considering legislating 
on this matter. It should be a key part of the Bill, which 
is flawed without it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I cannot elaborate on what I have already 
said. At this stage, there are no guarantees. Talks are 
continuing on such matters and a range of other issues. In 
future, we may table an amendment, if we think that that 
is appropriate. Should the hon. Gentleman wish to pursue 
his objection to the Government's position, that is a matter 
for him and his colleagues.
<P>
Amendment No. 160 would require the best value 
auditor to consider whether the authority's local 
performance plan conforms with any relevant model 
produced by the Audit Commission. We do not support 
the amendment, but it raises some important matters, and 
I am grateful to Opposition Members for giving me an 
opportunity to address them.
<P>
One such matter concerns rigidity and uniformity. 
Committee members do not need to be reminded that we 
are legislating for a rich variety of organisations. Because 
local and other authorities are so diverse in character, we 
have resisted the inclusion of restrictive rules in the Bill. 
However, local performance plans should be broadly 
consistent in terms of quality, accessibility and the 
comprehensiveness of what they cover. That is why clause 
6 makes provision for the Secretary of State to have a 
guidance power on the form and content of plans. That 
will enable the Government to set out broad principles 
that authorities will be expected to follow.
<P>
Within that broad framework, authorities must be free 
to develop their own approach. For that reason, I do not 
believe that we could develop a single-model approach 
covering all authorities of a single type, unless we 
introduced a level of central determination. However, we 
have consistently said that we do not want such 
determination, and I hope that Opposition Members will 
accept that.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I think that my memory is going 
and Alzheimer's disease is setting in. Will the Minister 
give me a little assistance on the guidance procedures? 
Will such procedures be discussed in a Committee of the 
House?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> As I understand it, the guidance will be 
considered by the Department of the Environment, 
Transport and the Regions, and we will make a judgment 
on it. If appropriate, an amendment would be tabled to 
make such guidance statutory, and it would then be 
subject to the usual formulas in this place.
<P>
I agree that the dissemination of best practice is 
important. That is why I welcomed the creation of the 
improvement and development agency, which will play a 
key role in involving local government in the 
development of the framework. We will thus foster a 
sense of ownership of best value, which will be crucial to 
its success. I remind the hon. Member for Mole Valley 
that lack of ownership fatally undermined compulsory 
competitive tendering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> What will be the procedure on guidance 
in Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> As I understand it, the Welsh Assembly 
will deal with any amendments to national guidance. I 
will provide the hon. Gentleman with further details.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> What will be the role of partnership 
councils?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I will get advice from civil servants and 
give the hon. Gentleman an answer. I hope to do that 
soon.
<P>
The Bill's provisions represent the most constructive 
way forward, and I therefore urge hon. Members to 
withdraw their amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Further to the point about Wales made 
by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), will the Minister clarify whether the same rules will apply to police authorities? He 
generously mentioned that authorities can be very 
different. How will the changes interface with the 
existing status of police authorities in view of the 
legislative requirement to produce a plan, consult and 
have it audited? There is great concern about the 
uniformity if that is not a pun of provisions relating 
to police authorities. Can the Minister give an assurance 
that police authorities will be allowed to keep their 
distinctive local plans necessary for the particular 
requirements of policing in their areas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I apologise for not answering the query 
that the hon. Gentleman raised in our debate on a 
previous amendment.
<P>
We considered the issues of uniformity, rigidity and 
the variety of available models and looked into what was 
already operational. As the hon. Gentleman rightly 
pointed out, under existing arrangements, Her Majesty's 
inspectorate of constabulary is required to publish its own 
reports but the responsibility rests with the police 
authorities and the Home Secretary. Alternatively, there 
are local authorities and Ofsted. They will remain as they 
are because of our belief that it is inadvisable to have a 
single model for determination in such cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I am grateful. Is the Minister saying that 
existing statutory requirements on police authorities will 
effectively become the new requirements and that there 
will be no duplication in drawing up performance plans, 
organising consultation and auditing them? If existing law 
will apply, why is it not made clear in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I can tell the hon. Gentleman that policing 
plans will deal with efficiency and effectiveness. Much 
relevant information will go into the performance plan. 
The responsibility for producing reports will remain with 
the current authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I am terribly sorry because the Minister is 
trying to respond reasonably, but I want to be clear. Are 
we talking about parallel processes in which overlapping 
matters will be considered or are we talking about existing 
process taking the place of the requirement placed on a 
local authority as a result of the Bill? If so, that should be 
stated clearly in the Bill.

<P>

<B> Mr. Meale:</B> Can I just repeat that several bodies 
the police, social services and the fire inspectorate, for 
example will continue to produce plans as normal and 
that they will be complementary to the process? Some of 
the information will be incorporated into the local 
performance plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On these two relatively modest 
amendments, we have had more of a debate than we 
expected. Putting it charitably, the Under-Secretary has 
not got a grip on the issues. Whether the auditors of best 
value plans are obliged to have regard to the most recent 
financial information remains a real question. The danger 
is that local authorities might say that certain information 
is not ready and not relevant because the relevance of 
such information is not specified in the Bill. Clarity is 
essential over this potentially draconian process.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Under-Secretary's exchanges 
with my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley I 
hope that the Under-Secretary is listening to me and the 
requisite clarity did not emerge. I ask the Under-Secretary 
to take the provision away and have another look at it. If 
he is in negotiation with third parties about this part of 
the Bill, it is reasonable for the Committee to hear from 
him again about how the outstanding issues will be 
resolved.
<P>
On amendment No. 160, I ask the Under-Secretary to 
clarify one point. Is he giving an assurance that the Audit 
Commission will not produce a model for best value 
plans? He seemed to be saying that the amendment is not 
relevant and that a model will not be laid down, because 
that would be too prescriptive. He spoke eloquently about 
the rich variety of local councils, the inappropriateness of 
the approach, and the fact that guidance is already 
available. Will he clarify matters for us, because I think 
that the Audit Commission thinks it is to produce a model 
best value performance plan. He had better tell the Audit 
Commission if it is not to do so, because it may not know. 
If it is to produce one, that should be mentioned in the 
Bill, so that we know where we are.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> As I said, we believe in a rich variety of 
plans. We do not intend to use a single plan. I can 
confirm that.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire asked about 
Wales. The Assembly will make the statutory guidance 
orders and regulations. They will go before the legislative 
scrutiny committee and, if they survive that, they will be 
approved by the Assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am sorry to pester the Under-Secretary, 
but I am not quite clear about what he was confirming. Is 
he saying that the Audit Commission will not produce a 
model best value performance plan?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> That is what I am saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, in

Amendment No. 187, in page 7, line 9, leave out from

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that the amendment may have been 
overtaken by events. Clearly, if the Government are to 
move amendments Nos. 56 and 57, providing for 
publication, they must have considered our point so 
eloquent and our tabling of an amendment so inevitable, 
that they tabled one ahead of us. I do not know what to 
add, except to ask whether the Secretary of State should 
be obliged to arrange publication of the report whether or 
not it contains a direction. I may have misunderstood the 
Bill, but I think it would be useful if the report were to 
be published automatically, in the interest of openness and 
public debate about local councils, and made available to 
anyone who wants to read it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
suggesting that if he receives assurances he will withdraw 
the amendment. As we explained in debating earlier 
amendments, Government amendment No. 56 provides 
that each best value authority should publish the auditor's 
report as soon as it receives it. That is clearly more 
appropriate than requiring the Secretary of State to 
publish such reports. All auditor's reports will be 
published, whether or not they find evidence of failure. 
Publication will be dealt with locally, not centrally.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) the maximum fee for the audit of a best value performance 
plan shall be a fixed percentage of the annual turnover of a plan 
according to a scale of percentages to be determined by the Audit 
Commission.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The clause raises issues about the sheer 
scale and volume of the work to be undertaken by the 
Audit Commission and the auditors working to its remit. 
The first amendment is merely a probing amendment. I 
would be grateful if the Minister could explain the 
relevance of subsections 4(3) to 4(6) of the Audit 
Commission Act 1998 and how the code of audit practice 
shall have effect in relation to the audit of best value 
plans.
<P>
Amendment No. 164 brings us back to an issue that we 
have discussed in earlier clauses. It seems peculiar that 
when the commission is consulting it should consult only 
people who appear to it to represent best value authorities 
rather than councillors, for example, who might represent 
best value authorities. I think it is for best value 
authorities to decide who best to represent them. The 
amendment therefore simply seeks to delete the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"appearing to the Commission to represent"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so that it should simply consult persons representing best 
value authorities. The same goes for subsection (7)(b) in 
relation to fees.
<P>
Finally there is the question of fee scales. Amendment 
No. 166 adds a new subsection suggesting that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The maximum fee for the audit of a best value plan shall be a 
fixed percentage of the annual turnover of a plan according to a 
scale of percentages to be determined by the Audit Commission."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Auditing a best value plan ought to be fairly 
straightforward. It ought to be possible to provide fixed 
fees. How much does the Minister think that a best value 
audit should cost? I believe that it is a regulatory burden 
that falls upon the council tax payers of the authorities in 
question. They will have to pay it.
<P>
A large authority with a great many functions might 
have many best value plans to audit. There might be best 
value plans for separate functions. I do not know whether 
that is the way the Minister envisages the process 
working. Must there be a single best value plan for all an 
authority's functions, in which case it will be rather like 
a budget, or will it be split up by function so that different 
functions are audited in different ways? If it is to be a 
fairly standard audit, it should be a fairly standard fee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I wonder why we have not gone in the 
opposite direction and suggested that local authorities 
should go out to tender for the auditing. After all, Ofsted 
inspection teams bid to come into the schools and the 
school board of management hires a particular auditing 
team. Would it not be a good idea if, to keep the costs down, local authorities were able to bid for auditors on the non-list of approved auditors that will be drawn up by 
the Audit Commission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I share my hon. Friend's enthusiasm for 
some kind of bidding process, but unfortunately because 
of what we have already decided in clause 7, the auditor 
is predetermined; it will be the authority's auditor. There 
can be no bidding process because in the interests of 
efficiency the Government clearly believe that the best 
value performance plan client, which is the authority, 
should stick to the monopoly supplier which is the 
authority's auditor. I have great sympathy for the idea of 
competitive tendering for the audit of plans. That is what 
the private sector does but that is not the way the 
Government have chosen to proceed. Perhaps the Minister 
can give us some thoughts on that.
<P>
I am seeking to establish how much the process will 
cost. There are hundreds of local authorities so there will 
possibly be thousands of best value performance plans. 
The Audit Commission will obviously have to expand its 
empire quite considerably. How much does a best value 
audit cost? Should there be a mechanism by which to 
stipulate a maximum to protect council tax payers? When 
there is great demand for an inadequate supply the price 
goes up. With thousands of best value plans being audited 
every year there may not be enough people available to 
do the work. Local authorities should not be forced to pay 
over the odds for an audit of best value plans. I should be 
grateful for the Minister's comments on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The Minister may remember that 
I raised this issue on Second Reading. I suggested that 
she and the other Ministers in her Department took a deep 
breath and talked to Westminster council, which is 
probably an authority on fees for district auditors doing 
investigations. New clause 5 proposes a scale of fees.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in respect of inspections carried out under section 10",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and recognises that there will be variations from that scale 
of fees, which could be substantially more or less. It is 
the crux of our argument that fees could be "substantially 
more"	 will worry council tax payers. We ask the 
Government to consider placing a ceiling on fees, perhaps 
paying fees in excess of a certain amount or including 
some form of safeguard so that the costs do not run out 
of hand to such an extent that they devalue any gain from 
the inspection itself.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Will the Minister tell us how she envisages 
the structure of the Audit Commission developing in the 
next few years? The Audit Commission, which plays a 
key role in the Bill, is a quango. It is an admirable 
organisation and we do not want to attack its functions, 
but, as it admits, it will need more staff. The Audit 
Commission's functions have been established, but I want 
to know how it fared in the fundamental expenditure 
review. What is its budget? What is its staffing? What 
does the Minister anticipate that they will be in the next 
few years? What has been built into the plans to enable it 
to operate? How much of its budget will be recoverable 
from the fees that it levies and how much will come from 
the Government? It would be helpful if the Minister would say how the Audit Commission will respond to the challenges placed upon it. Perhaps she will write to the 
Committee on the subject.
<P>
The Audit Commission has an admirable new 
chairman, Mrs. Helena Shovelton. The commission has 
the role of the seventh cavalry but Mrs. Shovelton is no 
General Custer; she is much better than that. If she had 
had an opportunity, the Sioux would have had no chance 
at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I echo the comments of my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. There will be 
a supply and demand effect, nowhere more so than in 
Wales where, as the Minister will remember, an Auditor 
General will be appointed for the Welsh Assembly. There 
will also be an auditor to audit the Auditor General's 
accounts. There will be pressure on the auditing 
profession. Has the Minister done any research into the 
number of available businesses prepared to take on the 
work? If not enough are available, there will be pressure 
to put up prices. Has the Minister considered making extra 
funds available? Has she looked into the future of the 
issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The Minister probably does not have 
pinpoint accurate figures, but I am sure that 
notwithstanding what I said earlier, she will have notional 
figures on the costs involved, nationally and broken down 
by area.
<P>
The burden on the authorities was mentioned and the 
Minister has not given us a satisfactory answer. She may 
wish to take this opportunity to comment on her notional 
estimate of the cost burden on authorities, and on the 
Audit Commission.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am appreciative of hon. Members 
who are raising important issues about the cost of audit 
and inspection, which is an important part of the Bill. I 
should like to deal with general matters first and then 
move on to individual amendments.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We expect best value to lead to efficiency savings of 
2 per cent. per year in each authority, which more than 
outweighs any additional costs arising from audit 
inspection arrangements. Audit inspection will be a vital 
element underpinning best value both to ensure a robust 
approach by local authorities and accountability to the 
public. Additional funding to meet the cost of inspections 
will come from the revenue support grant or from a direct 
grant to the commission, and we intend to table a 
Government amendment to make provision for it. That 
will enable the Welsh Assembly to give grants to the 
commission as well.
<P>
Officials are in discussion with the commission of the 
likely cost of audit and inspection, which has yet to be 
finalised. As the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon 
acknowledged, we have appointed a new chair who is 
cognisant of the Audit Commission's new undertakings. 
The Audit Commission itself, as well as carrying out the 
fundamental management and performance review, has 
undertaken a review of its own internal structure more 
effectively to face the challenges of the Bill.
<P>
Hon. Members will know that an annual fee increase 
for 1998-99 of 3.9 per cent. was announced in December 
with an additional 1 per cent. to shore up reserves 
depleted by the reorganisation costs of district audit and 
the legal costs of the Westminster case.
<P>
Amendment No. 163 would remove the requirement 
that auditors should have regard to the code of practice 
laid down by the Audit Commission Act 1998. I 
acknowledge that the hon. Member for North Essex 
moved it as a probing amendment, but it would prevent 
auditors from having to follow the best professional 
practice on standards, procedures and techniques. It would 
also remove the requirement that a code should not come 
into force until approved by each House of Parliament. It 
would prevent Parliament from subjecting the code to 
regular review and remove the commission's flexibility to 
amend it.
<P>
Removing subsection (8)(3) would make the Bill's 
provision different from that in the Audit Commission Act 
1998 and would also remove the safeguards afforded by 
subjecting the code to rigorous parliamentary scrutiny. 
Opposition Members have argued for more safeguards 
and we certainly need them in that respect. In the light of 
my explanation, I hope that the hon. Member for North 
Essex will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister anticipated annual efficiency 
gains in local government of 2 per cent. Can I ask her to 
explain where that figure comes from, given the enormous 
range of authorities? For example, there is Manchester 
council led for many years by the hon. Member for 
Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Stringer) with a large 
budget; and in my constituency there is Craven district 
council, which is minuscule. Is it 2 per cent. on average, 
or across the board? What sort of target does the Minister 
expect from the better authorities and what from the 
laggards, which we agree are the authorities at which 
attention most needs to be directed? The 2 per cent. is 
frightfully convenient, a bit like the anticipated annual 
increase in agriculture yield which we build in for Agenda 
2000. It is just too convenient to ring true. Where does it 
come from? On what basis does the Minister expect a
2 per cent. efficiency gain, and will it eventually be 
reflected in the SSA formula?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We negotiated this through the 
comprehensive spending review. It is not to be taken out 
of revenue support grant. It will ensure that money is 
available for innovation and the development of good 
practice by local authorities. We expect the 2 per cent. 
efficiency gains to be across the board. It comes from 
experience of what is possible in the service sector, in 
both public services and in some services that are largely 
the private sector's responsibility. We think that it is an 
achievable target that goes alongside the sort of 
continuous improvement that we have in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I know that so many interventions are 
tiresome, but this is part of the process. Will it be 
required of each authority, or will it be across the 
board. We have talked about high quality authorities. 
ŠŠ240‹‹The teasing out of incremental additional amounts will 
be difficult. Equally, 2 per cent. as a target for the 
most ghastly local authorities is not at all ambitious; it 
is a funking of the process. We are talking about a 
target. I assume that they have built the target into their 
spending processes. What happens if they do not hit it? 
Will they be audited to get the 2 per cent? The Minister 
cannot suddenly introduce this 2 per cent. into the 
conversation without our having an interest in how it 
works in practice. The fact that the fundamental 
expenditure review retained it as some kind of criterion 
does not indicate that anyone has negotiated it, except 
perhaps with the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is trying to 
pretend that I said much more than I did. I said that we 
think that best value can reasonably expect authorities to 
make across-the-board efficiency savings of 2 per cent. 
That is not a negotiated figure; it is not reflected in 
reductions in RSG or anything else. It is simply what we 
think good efficient services can deliver year on year. It 
is the sort of target which, as I have said, is prevalent 
throughout the service industry, especially in the private 
sector. With best value, we hope to achieve the very best 
outcomes paraded before us by the hon. Member for 
North Essex that the private sector expects to achieve. 
There is a difference between public sector and private 
sector services, but this sort of expectation is clearly taken 
as normal in other circumstances, and we shall take it as 
normal in the delivery of public services. The public have 
a right to expect that standard of efficiency and 
performance from both large and small authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The Minister gave examples when 
justifying the 2 per cent. across-the-board saving. She 
talked about public and private sector organisations. 
Could she give us a feel for a public or private sector 
organisation of a similar type to the broad range of 
authorities? It is hard to imagine a private sector 
organisation with a range as broad as that covered by 
tiny councils in distant rural areas and large 
metropolitan authorities. From where does she draw her 
figure of 2 per cent? She has given us some examples 
but we should like them to be a little more tangible. 
We are concerned about this for the local authorities.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have great difficulty in taking the 
hon. Gentleman seriously. This is about year-on-year 
improvements and any organisation involved in service 
delivery must have that ambition at the heart of what it is 
doing. If the hon. Member was responsible for looking at 
the quality of service at his local supermarket, he could 
expect that supermarket to be conscious of the range of 
things that people were looking for, to make sure that it 
was up to date, to introduce new products without adding 
to costs and to do all efficiently.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will doubtless remember that his 
Government had a 3 per cent. annual efficiency target for 
the national health service which was reflected in NHS 
budget. I have made it clear that this is not to be reflected 
in the budget in terms of the revenue support grant, but it 
is there to challenge and let every authority know that this 
applies to them. It cannot get out of it by saying that it is a small authority or a big authority with a complex organisation. It is right and appropriate that every 
organisation related to local government should be 
expecting year-on-year approval. Opposition Members are 
trying to take us down an interesting road.
<P>
Amendment No. 164 seeks to remove from subsection 
8(6) the Audit Commission's legitimate discretionary 
powers about whom to consult before preparing or 
altering the code of practice or when prescribing the scale 
of fees for best value audits. The amendment would 
restrict the commission's freedom to take views and force 
it to consult only with those directly or explicitly 
representing best value authorities.
<P>
That is not to say that the Audit Commission will not 
consult those representing best value authorities, but there 
may be other organisations or groups that have an impact 
that it would be appropriate for it to consult even if they 
are not the direct representatives of local government. For 
example, it may be appropriate for it to consult one of the 
companies that was involved in the delivery of public 
services.
<P>
The wording of the clause enables the Audit 
Commission to work out who has an appropriate interest 
and who should be consulted. I cannot imagine a proposal 
in which the local authorities would not be part of the 
consultation. When I read the amendment I thought that 
the hon. Member for North Essex was trying to restrict it 
to the Local Government Association again we had 
similar amendments to an earlier clause. I wondered 
whether that was what the amendment related to. As I 
have given him that explanation, I hope that he will now 
understand.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If that is the case it is a good case why 
does the Bill use the word "represent". The Minister has 
described consultation not with people who represent best 
value authorities but with those who have an interest in 
best value. Therefore, the words in the Bill do not cover 
the circumstances that we are considering. The word 
"represent"	 has a clear meaning in English. Will the 
Minister undertake to amend the Bill later to make it clear 
that those who have an interest in best value can be 
consulted? Otherwise, the Bill does not convey the power 
that the Minister described.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We are all subject to parliamentary 
counsel. The wording of the clause gives the Audit 
Commission the flexibility to decide whom to consult. I, 
too, am sometimes confused by the actual words that 
appear in the Bill. However, I am sure that the current 
wording covers the points that we have been discussing. 
Hon. Members would not want to remove the flexibility 
or discretion that allows the Audit Commission to take 
account of a proper range of views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am genuinely confused. I acknowledge 
that the Minister has to fall back on briefing for technical 
matters. However, how can a company that performs a 
function or service for a local authority "represent"	 a best 
value authority? Again, I am worried that we are giving 
the Secretary of State or the Audit Commission discretion 
to consult whoever the Secretary of State believes to be 
representative of best value authorities.
<P>
I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Skipton and Ripon that the Secretary of State should have 
the freedom to consult anyone he wishes, but the clause 
does not convey that. The Minister's comments have 
confused matters further. I understand that the Secretary 
of State might not want to be restricted to consultation 
with formal representatives of a local authority, such as a 
chief officer a finance officer, or a group of councillors 
rather than all the councillors. I thought that the Minister 
was about to say that, but she did not. She has further 
confused matters.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman has totally 
confused me. The amendment that we are considering 
does not relate to the Secretary of State. The hon. 
Gentleman is talking about the wrong amendment. He has 
not allowed me to get to the amendment that deals with 
the Secretary of State. I was talking about the amendment 
on the Audit Commission. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Wind her up somebody.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I think that the Hon. Gentleman would 
prefer me not to get wound up, as he might find himself 
the target of the winding up, and that would not be 
pleasant. I do not want to do that; I am keen for us to 
discuss matters in the best order.
<P>
Amendment No. 165 purports to remove from 
subsection 8(7) discretionary powers for the Audit 
Commission over consultation in prescribing the scale of 
fees for best value audits. However, the subsection refers 
to an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult the 
commission and those who appear to the Secretary of 
State to represent best value authorities. I expect that that 
is what Opposition Members tried to achieve when they 
tabled the amendment. The amendment is flawed, though 
I never worry about that. I shall try to help the hon. 
Member for North Essex by clarifying matters.
<P>
The amendment would restrict the Secretary of State's 
freedom to take views, and force him to consult only those 
who directly and explicitly represented best value 
authorities. The clauses would allow the Secretary of State 
the flexibility to decide whom to consult. Removing that 
flexibility and discretion would inhibit his ability to do 
what was required, and to take account of a proper range 
of views.
<P>
Amendment No. 166 would set limits on the level of 
fees for best value audits, by attempting to create a link 
between the fee and the turnover of the authority. I 
understand the concerns that underlie the amendment, but 
they are misplaced. We understand the need for some 
parameters on the amount that authorities pay for best 
value audits. That is why we have placed the Audit 
Commission under an obligation, in clause 8, to prescribe 
an appropriate scale. It is not appropriate to qualify that 
scale according to the size of the authority as reflected in 
plan turnover.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister seems to be saying that a 
plan will apply to a whole authority. Is that correct, or 
will there be separate plans for different functions within 
an authority, which would seem a sensible approach? 
Some local authorities are very big businesses, covering 
a wide range of activities.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We covered this issue earlier in 
Committee, when we discussed the possibility that 
authorities might want a review to operate across 
functions, and, for example, cover all the services for 
children or for the elderly. We have said that there should 
be a five-year rolling programme for reviews and that the 
performance plan should follow that.
<P>
Each year just one local performance plan would be 
expected. We should not want authorities to produce so 
many as to give rise to the problem suggested by the hon. 
Member for Mole Valley, which is that the number of 
plans in the public domain would leave the public fed up 
with them, or confused. If we allowed or encouraged that 
approach, it would make things easier for authorities that 
wanted to escape the rigour of best value. I do not believe 
that most local authorities want to do that. I am heartened 
by the enthusiasm with which they have already embraced 
the concept, even before the Bill is passed. On the other 
hand, a degree of rigour is needed. That will mean that 
authorities study best value and reflect it in the 
performance plan so that local people have good, easy 
access to it.
<P>
The approach set out in amendment No. 166 is crude 
in the extreme and would place an unnecessary restriction 
on the Audit Commission's professional judgments about 
what was appropriate. I remind hon. Members that the 
Audit Commission is well accustomed to such tasks, as it 
already performs a similar function in relation to fees for 
audit of accounts under the Audit Commission Act 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> How much extra manpower will the Audit 
Commission require to manage best value? Perhaps more 
crucially, from the authorities' point of view, what is the 
cost of compliance? What additional cost, in aggregate, 
will implementing the legislation place on local 
government? Obviously, the measure will pay for itself if 
it secures the efficiencies that we hope for, but what will 
be paid in fees for audit of best value plans?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We anticipate that the annual costs of 
a strengthened audit and inspection framework will be in 
the order of an additional £50 million a year, once the 
best value framework is fully operational. That is a 
modest increase and if, for that level of cost, we can 
achieve what we envisage, it will be exceptionally good 
value for the council tax payer. It will mean significant 
improvement for a modest increase in costs across local 
authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Will the Minister repeat what the
£50 million refers to?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It refers to the strengthened audit and 
inspection framework. It therefore includes additional 
work don by the Audit Commission. We took account of 
that in the comprehensive spending review.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): It might be 
helpful to establish the context of the extra spending by 
comparing it with the extra spending on the poll tax, 
which cost every local authority £9 million to £10 million.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Indeed. The previous Administration 
also incurred additional costs when they introduced the 
Office for Standards in Education, but I shall not say 
anything further about that.
<P>
I have said enough to persuade the hon. Member for 
North Essex to withdraw his amendment. Government 
amendments in this group are minor, technical 
amendments which correct typographical errors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The evaluation of an additional
£50 million is dramatic. What percentage increase does 
that represent on the current regime and who will pay it?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not been 
listening. I have already explained how the increase will 
be accounted for and how it will be paid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Minister give a percentage?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am sorry, but I do not have a 
percentage: that is not our approach. We have been far 
from profligate: we examined needs and pared them down 
to ensure that a proper framework is created. Compared 
with the additional costs that the previous Administration 
placed on local government, the settlement is very 
reasonable. I repeat that any additional funding necessary 
to meet the costs of inspection will be met through the 
revenue support grant or made by direct grant to the 
commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response. 
The Treasury will provide extra money, but the additional 
cost of expensive audits will fall on local authorities. 
Nominally, such costs will be included in the revenue 
support grant settlement, but bills will be sent to local 
authorities themselves. Grant is given directly to the Audit 
Commission, but the Minister did not say that it would 
receive an extra £50 million to cover additional costs.
<P>
I am grateful for clarification on the fee arrangements. 
We will wish to consider the question of fees for local 
authorities in future, but I now beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
