announcements from the Chair. First,  as a humanitarian
gesture, hon. Members may remove  their jackets. In return for
that humanitarian gesture, I request that all hon. Members ensure that
their mobile phones are either switched off or in silent mode 
during meetings of the Committee. There is a money resolution in
connection with the Bill, and copies are available in the
Room.</div>
<a name="09061636000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind hon.
Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a

to the business of the Committee, first, we shall be considering the
programme motion, which is on the amendment paper. A debate may take
place, but it is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to a
motion to report written evidence, which is also on the amendment
paper. I hope that we can take that formally.</div>

Mr. Bercow we can make good progress in handling this

occasion the eight scheduled sittings should be enough to give proper

1</h4><a name="09061636000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">NHS
Constitution</div><a name="09061636000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000336"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 1, in
clause 1, page 1, line 7, leave
out first &#145;the&#146; and insert
&#145;any&#146;.</div><a name="09061636000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000337"></a>The

<a name="09061659000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and approved by each House of
Parliament&#146;.</div><a name="09061636000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000338"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Clause 1 effectively establishes the subject of
the first chapter of the Bill, the NHS constitution. My two amendments
are mutually reliant and make sense together, and I shall therefore
seek to address both in one
approach.</div><a name="09061636000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would change the initial phraseology to refer to
&#147;any&#148; document and would remove the need to be date
specific&#151;they would remove the specificity from the Bill and
seek to probe to some degree what the Government mean by this
constitution. I hope, Mr. O&#146;Hara, that you will give
me a little latitude on these amendments as, I hope you agree, it will
be useful for me to set out the questions of the constitution from this
side of the House. That may enable us to move through later amendments
more quickly. However, I will be guided by you to remain in
order.</div><a name="09061636000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Committee goes through the Bill, time and again&#151;as with so
much Government legislation&#151;we will meet regulations. The
justification is always not to have too much detail in the Bill. How,
therefore, does the Minister justify the specific reference to a
document published on 21 January 2009? I hope that he will tell the
Committee about analogous provisions in other legislation where a
document is defined by its name and date but not its
content.</div><a name="09061636000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also seek to reassert the power of the Houses of Parliament
on the NHS constitution. When the Prime Minister launched his
leadership bid, he said:</div>
<a name="09061636000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One
of my first acts as prime minister would be to restore power to
Parliament in order to
build</div><a name="09061636000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">the
trust of the British people in our democracy. Government must be more
open and more accountable to Parliament&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="09061636000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his statement to the
House last Wednesday, he
said:</div><a name="09061636000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
are removing ancient royal prerogatives and making the Executive more
accountable to Parliament&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 10
June 2009; Vol. 493, c.
797.]</div><a name="09061636000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">He uses
&#147;we&#148; and claims that the Executive are restoring power to
Parliament, whereas that is, of course, a responsibility for the
House.</div><a name="09061636000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Prime Minister announced the review, which will be chaired by the
Labour Chairman of the Public Administration Committee, the hon. Member
for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright). The review will consider how Parliament
can strengthen its scrutiny of the Government and how control of
Parliament&#146;s daily business can be wrestled away from them and
their Whips. Yet, the Government are bringing to the House legislation
that enshrines something, the contents of which the House has no power
over. In light of the claimed democratic accountability and the move to
more open and transparent government, and particularly, taking into
account the Government&#146;s rhetoric on restoring power to
Parliament, how can the Minister justify an undebated constitution?
What has been published and put forward as a document is, effectively,
a settled
item.</div><a name="09061636000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
only has Parliament had no opportunity to debate the contents of that
constitution, but the constitution was launched in a closed signing
ceremony at No. 10, where it was given legitimacy, if not force, by
the  hand of the Prime Minister&#151;again,
sidelining  Parliament. Furthermore, if the amendment succeeds
and the constitution gets the parliamentary debate that our NHS
deserves and is amended as it should be, how will the Minister justify
the cost of pulping all the documents that have been
printed?</div><a name="09061636000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, there is now an illogicality in the legislation. The
Government rightly accepted the amendments put forward by my noble
Friend Lord Howe in the other place that introduced clause 3(5). That
means that the guiding principles of the constitution cannot be changed
except by regulations made by the Secretary of State. However, if
Parliament must be invoked to change the guiding principles&#151;I
argue that it should be&#151;then surely it should be invoked to
establish them. The precedent is dangerous, because, as I understand
it, the Minister is saying, &#147;What I say goes, and if you want to
contradict me, you must change the law.&#148; Where would we be if,
for instance, Justice Ministers operated in a similar way? It might be
right to debate this when we come to that clause, but will the Minister
confirm that regulations made under clause 3(5) will be made under the
negative resolution procedure? And will he tell us whether the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has advised on that
power?</div>
<a name="09061636000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
Back Benchers should not pass over that question lightly. They know
that the guiding principles set out in the constitution are not the
excellent principles of the NHS plan, which takes us back a good 10
years. Those are the principles that we have argued should be put
forward as part of the constitution and which were implemented before
the Prime Minister came up with his
proposals.</div><a name="09061636000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
one compares the constitution with the principles in the NHS plan, the
redaction of those principles was undertaken by the current Secretary
of State for Health, who was a Health Minister back in 2006-07.
Government  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>Members know that that redaction, which the current Secretary of State
was instrumental in ensuring took place, removed the key principle
that</div><a name="09061636000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Public
funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to NHS
patients&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061636000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should Parliament not
have a say in
that?</div><a name="09061636000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the heart of the amendments lies the question of what is a
constitution. Is it something which, in regard to a public body, or
even a body which predominantly serves the public&#151;the statutes
of universities and Royal Colleges come to mind&#151;should have some
statutory democratic oversight of its content, even through a body such
as the Privy Council, although I have to confess that that example does
not necessarily help my argument? Or is it simply a useful noun that
can be put at the head of a piece of paper, so that the Government of
the day can get some relatively easy headlines, but which remains
ontologically
meaningless?</div><a name="09061636000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question is a moot one, given the Prime Minister&#146;s statement
last week that he favours a written constitution for the country. So
what precedents will we set as a Committee if we say that this House is
perfectly content with constitutions that are solely the product of the
Executive rather than of the legislature? Lest anyone think that the
comparison is spurious, at a little over 3,000 words this NHS
constitution is three quarters of the length of the original US
constitution. That comparison was made by none other than Lord Naseby
in the other
place.</div><a name="09061636000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then
there is the further question of precedent-setting, which is why these
amendments are so fundamental to the whole tenor of this part of the
Bill. The last time the Government included a document of
constitutional importance in legislation without giving either House
the opportunity to debate and amend it, the then Minister, the right
hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), told the House that the
document had all the legal force of <i class="I">The </i><i class="I">Beano</i>. The
document was the European charter of fundamental rights. In 2005, it
became clear that it was being referred to by the European Court of
Justice in its judgments, but it is not yet justiciable in England and
Wales within our jurisdiction pertaining to that part of the law. The
rulings of the European Court of Justice are legally binding on England
and Wales, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and thus it bites.
That document is part of the Lisbon treaty, which the Government keep
reminding us that they support, but which they are not prepared to give
the country a referendum to
endorse.</div><a name="09061636000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to justiciability, if the constitution is meant to have some real
effect, then one might envisage that, initially, people would be
encouraged, even excited, by the prospect. They now have a means by
which they can seek to enforce rights on access to, and the quality and
type of, healthcare. Even if it can be argued that it does not go that
far, that it does not actually create entitlements and that what is in
place is already enshrined in statute, there is an issue about whether
this is going to give rise to justiciability for what is known in the
law&#151;the Minister is a highly-reputed, qualified lawyer, so he
will understand the importance of this&#151;as remedy in equity. That
involves things such as injunctive relief and any of the other specific
enforcement processes that are possible by way of
reference.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="09061636000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
there is a special species of legal action, which is particularly known
to the public sector&#151; the question of judicial review.
That relates to whether the constitution and the way in which it has
been framed in the legislation will give rise to the opportunity for
litigants to pray it in aid in support of any kind  of judicial
review of ministerial or other public office decisions. That leads to
the question whether there would be not only injunctive relief, but any
kind of compensatory provision for those enforced to take action that
they did not wish to take, or to have to correct an action or inaction
that they have found was not part of the administrative process that
they should have
adopted.</div><a name="09061636000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000339"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I want to be clear on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s position. Is he saying the constitution should be
fully justiciable or
not?</div><a name="09061636000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000340"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> My first question is whether doing what is
proposed makes this a justiciable document, and if fact and precedence
give rise to that. This point is relative to another amendment in a
later group, but what we have said in relation to the type of
constitution that we wish to put in place is that such matters are
covered by legislation. I suspect that the Minister will seek to pray
in aid that point in any defence that he wants to make against
justiciability, but the question will arise that by virtue of the way
in which this is being done, will it give rise to injunctive relief,
particularly if it is done through delegated powers? That is a question
of law and fact rather than of
desire.</div><a name="09061636000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not trying to pass an opinion on merit. I am trying to establish
whether this gives rise to justiciability. It is therefore not an
advocacy position but more a question of whether the law under
discussion creates the type of opportunity at law which is intended or
not. That is what I am trying to tease
out.</div><a name="09061636000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000341"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is
asking me what the Government&#146;s position is on the extent to
which the law may intervene in relation to these clauses. I am seeking
to ascertain the Opposition&#146;s view on whether other laws should
intervene in relation to the constitution and whether it is a
Conservative position that it should be
justiciable.</div><a name="09061636000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000342"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> We are in grave danger of getting into
lawyers&#146; banter, which is the most polite way of putting
it.</div><a name="09061636000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister should be careful not to press me on the Opposition&#146;s
wishes. It is the Government who are proposing this law, not us. What
they are doing is not that far away from what we would wish to do,
which is to enshrine the core values and principles of the NHS into
law. In that case, there would be a real sense that they have impact
and, through the provisions in the Bill, some degree of fungibility as
time moves on depending on circumstances changing as to whether there
will be a proposal. We have some points on that to which we will return
at a later stage.</div>
<a name="09061636000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
not whether I want the constitution to be justiciable, because the
question is whether rights to healthcare, for example, are capable of
being enforced 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>or made available as a matter of other legislation. The point is to find
out what the constitution is establishing. I am concerned that the way
it has been drafted and incorporated makes it justiciable from the
point of view of injunctive relief&#151;a remedy in equity under
law&#151;or whether it gives rise to enforcement action in terms of
rights and entitlement on the part of patients. The honest truth is
that I do not know the answer.</div>
<a name="09061636000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
conscious of the precedent set by the former Minister, the right hon.
Member for Leicester, East, in relation to the charter of fundamental
rights, when, having described it as having no more force than <i class="I">The
Beano</i>, he eventually had to concede, after discussion with the
former Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith, that, having started from that
position, it had much more force than <i class="I">T</i><i class="I">he Beano</i>, because
it was something on which those who were advocating cases in court
could seek to assert gave rise to a presumption of a right, which has
since been repeated by judges in judgments handed down from the
European Court of Justice. It is by that means that it has been found
to be justiciable&#151;by biting on an English or Welsh citizen
within that jurisdiction and, separately, in the Scottish courts and in
the courts in Northern Ireland. That is my point and while it would be
nice for us to have a lawyers&#146; indulgence about these matters,
we need to be clear that this proposed law in this Bill may or may not
give rise to justiciability at the points that I have just outlined.
Having sought to take me well off my script, I hope that that has been
of some
help.</div><a name="09061636000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000343"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have been listening carefully. It is
important to establish these principles early on, but I wonder whether,
having expatiated so well on them in discussion on the first group of
amendments, it will be necessary to expatiate so much on clause stand
part.</div><a name="09061636000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000344"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Not only is that extremely welcome advice, but I
had no intention of getting into this matter in the debate on clause
stand part. I want to tease it all out at the outset, otherwise we will
simply suspend an argument that needs to be had. I hope that the
Minister will guarantee that the constitution is not necessarily
justiciable. If he insists on pressing me on the question on which he
has intervened twice, my instinct is that we should not be designing
something that is justiciable. That is where I would seek to err, in
constance, I suspect, with the Minister, who might be looking not to
make it justiciable. The question is, is it, rather than do we want it
to be. Even if there is the remotest chance that it is
justiciable&#151;as there must be, in my view&#151;I think it
incumbent on the Government to bring the substance of the constitution
before the
House.</div><a name="09061636000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me conclude on this group of amendments by mentioning that the
regulatory impact assessment states that many of the
principles</div><a name="09061636000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are
not explicit or secured&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061636000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is on page four of
the RIA. Will the Minister explain what &#147;secured&#148; means
in this context, and if not, will he write to me on that point? This
first iteration of the constitution has not been debated or passed by
both Houses of Parliament, which shows, despite all their rhetoric,
what I would argue is a complete sidelining of Parliament by the Prime
Minister and his Government. It is reflected in the legislation, which,
as drafted, over-specifies and is inconsistent. Not to have this first
iteration receive any Parliamentary scrutiny before it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>was published as a done-and-dusted deal sets a dangerous precedent for
the constitutional debate that the Prime Minister has now set running
and risks opening a legal can of worms in the
future.</div><a name="09061636000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have asked the Minister to justify the specificity here, bearing in
mind that he will reject specificity elsewhere, to provide the
Committee with analogous examples of such legislation, to substantiate
the Prime Minister&#146;s rhetoric and retain power to Parliament, to
justify how a closed signing ceremony in No. 10 can mean anything with
regard to the legislation that we have before us and to justify the
dangerous precedent set for national constitutional debates and as
regards possible future justiciability. I have also at least asked
Government Back Benchers whether they are content to abandon the
principle that public funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to
NHS patients. That is a very serious challenge, given that we are very
clear that that should be included and have made that point repeatedly,
including before the Government published their proposals. I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09061636000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061636000345"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I add my welcome to you to the
Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I do not want to prolong the
debate too much further. I support the point that there may not need to
be date specificity in the Bill. I want to put forward a slightly
different argument, because I sometimes worry when both Houses of
Parliament always have to approve everything. The hon. Member for
Eddisbury has probably not paid sufficient regard to the fact that a
great deal of work went into involving the public and various patient
groups in forming the constitution. It is a credit to some of the
organisations involved in that work that nobody is now beating a path
to our doors to highlight problems with it. Sometimes, it behoves us as
parliamentarians to relax a little. Do we have to be such control
freaks about everything that we cannot allow NHS staff, and the people
who use the NHS, to make these decisions?</div>
<a name="09061636000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment provides greater potential
for the constitution to become a political football in future. One
accusation frequently levelled at the Government in recent years is
that they do not let anything bed down. We see an initiative;
everything is in place for a couple of years; everybody starts to get
used to working under it; then everything changes. If you want a quick
round of applause or a quick win at any NHS gathering, just suggest no
change. Say, &#147;Let&#146;s have a period of stability,&#148;
and although one might not get a standing ovation, one can almost
guarantee a round of applause. Why, then, can we not relax a bit and
let the constitution have a period for the public to get used to it,
and for staff to get used to working under its principles and for them
to control this?</div>
<a name="09061636000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">To make a
party political point, I am not quite sure how the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument fits in with his party&#146;s stated aim
of removing the Department of Health and politicians from controlling
what happens in the health service. It seems completely counter to that
train of thought. The Minister probably does not need to respond to the
point, but I felt that there was an alternative way to look at this set
of amendments.</div>
<a name="09061636000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000346"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The hon. Member for Romsey is right. The NHS
constitution is the result of widespread consultation with various
stakeholders in the health service. Those stakeholders include not only
employees, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>doctors, nurses and patients&#146; groups, but a whole range of
organisations, which have come together to set out their view on what
should be in the NHS constitution. As a result, the document has been
brought forward. It is primarily declaratory, in that it sets out the
broad principles of the NHS. In terms of its legality, it produces no
new areas of legal intervention or causes of action that do not already
exist. In other words, it declares the current law broadly as it
exists, but brings it together in one document, the NHS constitution,
which sets out precisely what all the various areas of law have already
done.</div>
<a name="09061636000256"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">It is right, as
the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Eddisbury, has said,
that we do not want to see a document that causes large-scale, new
legal action. We already have enough litigation going on in relation to
the NHS not to want to contribute significantly to that, so the extent
to which this is justiciable is important. Perhaps I might deal with
that first. We needed to take a balanced view on whether we want a
document that is merely declaratory in a general sense or a proper
constitution which is fully justiciable and legally enforceable that
people can use in court
action.</div><a name="09061636000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09061636000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
balance needed to be struck between the extremes of something which was
virtually irrelevant and something which was so relevant it could
probably take over the running of the health service itself and cause
the courts to be massively involved. We need to avoid both extremes. We
have sought therefore to strike a balance with a document which
declares what the law is, and which sets out broadly the principles and
objectives of the NHS but does not create a series of new causes of
action.</div>
<a name="09061636000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Eddisbury asks if it is justiciable. It can be referred to
in relation to court cases. It can be prayed in aid, but it does not of
itself create any new cause of action. Therefore it should not produce
a whole series of new areas of law or causes of action which will
produce a lawyers&#146; charter. We wanted to avoid, and we believe
we have succeeded in avoiding, the creation of a lawyers&#146;
charter. As both the hon. Gentleman and I are lawyers, I am sure he
will be delighted by that outcome.</div>
<a name="09061636000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000347"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I have not practised for 20
years.</div>
<a name="09061636000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000348"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I have not practised for about 15 years, so we
are probably both pleased that we have not created an opportunity for
lawyers to run rampant in the health service. We have, however, created
a declaration of where the law is so that people can see what rights
they have, what the objectives of the NHS are and also ensure that they
have things that can be referred to in courts cases but which do not
produce new court cases. In relation to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
view about injunctive relief and some of the equitable remedies and
judicial review, it is the case that the document can be referred to. I
am not sure it will add a great deal to any case, but it could be
brought into a case as a result of an action and referred to by the
courts. The courts may therefore give effect to some of its provisions
by way of injunction, but only if there is a cause of action already in
existence today.</div>
<a name="09061636000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061636000349"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen </b><b class="B">O'Brien:</b> I understand both the
Minister&#146;s intent and what he believes has been achieved. If I
understood him correctly, he said in effect this is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>consolidation-type approach. This consolidates existing law; it does not
create any new causes of action. Whether or not as a result, it becomes
the source of that law or whether the previous legal provisions will
continue to be cited in any legal action is not completely clear.
Providing no new law has been created, that may be, to use a
lawyer&#146;s phrase, otiose.</div>
<a name="09061636000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">If something
is absent from the current law, as a core principle framed in the
constitution, it prompts a question about the use of NHS money for NHS
patients. I suspect that the Minister may be coming on to that, but it
may be one of the tests as to whether this is truly declaratory or
whether it will define the range of issues which are currently covered
by the law and can be
justiciable.</div><a name="09061636000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000350"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> To finish the point in relation to the
justiciability of the constitution, I would not necessarily use the
word &#147;consolidation&#148;. The constitution declares what
already exists, rather than consolidates it. It does not bring
legislation from other Acts into this measure, which is what is
normally referred to as consolidation. They remain in the other Acts.
This measure refers to other pieces of legislation and declares in a
document, which it will be possible to refer to, what those pieces of
legislation amount to and what their effect is. It does not create a
new cause of
action.</div><a name="09061636000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
public funds, our view is that they will be used only for the benefit
of NHS patients. It is certainly not our wish that they should be
otherwise used. However, there is a legal point. In relation to some
NHS facilities there is a charge. A contribution must be made by the
patient. Prescriptions are the obvious example. In those cases, we need
to avoid the view that NHS money can exclusively be used for a
particular purpose, because it may be a purpose for which there is a
charge. In the case of a prescription, for example, there is a
contribution from the patient and there is a contribution from the NHS.
That is not exclusive, so our view is that NHS money should be for the
use of NHS patients. That is the approach that we are taking. As for
the legal point made by the hon. Gentleman, he would be wrong to say
that a level of exclusivity should be brought into the legislation, as
that is likely to raise questions about whether there can be joint
funding by the patient and the NHS for a particular item, such as a
drug on prescription. We will come back to that later in our
discussion.</div><a name="09061636000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000351"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> As the Minister said, we will probably
return to that in future. He raised a question about prescriptions, and
I accept that in that case there is a charge, which is why there is a
caveat in the process. How does that relate to the recent decision by
the previous Secretary of State concerning the inquiry and the
Government&#146;s policy on top-up
payments?</div><a name="09061636000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000352"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> We are venturing into a discussion that we shall
be having later today. As far as the Government are concerned, NHS
money will be applied to NHS patients. There will be circumstances,
such as with prescriptions, in which some funding is contributed by the
patient, so we need to ensure that the law enables that to happen and
does not create an artificial barrier. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>The core principle of the NHS&#151;that it is funded by the taxpayer
to ensure that the provision of healthcare is available when it is
needed, sometimes with a charge, but more often without&#151;must
remain intact. We have not announced anything that would undermine that
principle.</div><a name="09061636000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to other points that have been made, the hon. Gentleman made a broad
political point about the Prime Minister and Parliament. We could all
wax eloquent on that, but perhaps, Mr. O&#146;Hara, you
would restrain a general debate at this stage. I will avoid that
eventuality, except to say that the Government have brought the NHS
constitution before Parliament and we are now debating it; Parliament,
therefore, has the opportunity to discuss these issues. As for the
question of the date, we have received legal advice that the
constitution needs to be clearly defined, which is why we have referred
to the date on which it was published&#151;21 January 2009. The hon.
Member for Eddisbury wants to remove that reference, but if the
original constitution was not identified with sufficient clarity,
confusion could arise as to which document was being referred to and
being revised.</div>
<a name="09061636000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
referred to the date primarily for reasons of clarity, to pin down the
exact document. The issue is how we ensure that there is clarity about
the document. There are a number of ways in which that could be done,
but our draftsman chose to take this approach. It could have been
published as a Command Paper and referred to as such&#151; there are
a number of ways in which these things have been done in the past. The
document was published before the Bill, so we took the view that it
would be better to refer to it simply with a particular date. It could
then be amended appropriately. A date is also given in the Bill that is
relevant to other aspects of provisions dealing with the constitution.
Any revision of the document must take place under clauses 3
and 4, which require a particular date for the three-yearly and
ten-yearly reviews that need to take
place.</div><a name="09061636000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061636000353"></a><b class="B">Mike
Penning</b> (Hemel Hempstead) (Con): Can I take the Minister
back to the other methodologies that could be used to introduce such a
document? By bringing this document out and launching it in that way,
there was a presumption that the House would agree to it entirely.
Otherwise, he would have introduced a White Paper, which we could have
amended in the usual way. What is so difficult to understand is that if
Parliament is, quite rightly, debating it today, why was it brought out
in its finished form? I know the Minister said that it could be
amended, but the document, which was published as part of the
constitution, would have to be completely pulped, whereas if it had
been introduced through another method, perhaps as a White Paper, that
would be the correct way for Parliament to scrutinise it. We could then
have introduced the actual legislation, rather than publishing
something which is highly likely to be defunct after this exercise in
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000354"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> In a sense, Parliament has already debated much
of this, because if a legal cause of action arises as a result of a
statute, Parliament will have passed that statute. All that the
constitution does is, in effect, to declare the law that currently
exists and bring it together in a clearer, more convenient way for the
staff of the NHS, for those who contract with it and for
patients.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div><a name="09061636000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Previously,
such a measure did not exist; it is a declaratory document, saying what
Parliament has already decided and what the courts have already decided
by way of common law. It is therefore useful in itself and can be
referred to in the courts, once the legislation is passed. However, we
are not creating a whole series of new avenues in which the law can
intrude. As for the question of whether Parliament needs to debate the
measure, it is effectively doing so. On the issue of whether Parliament
is pretending that this something which it is not, we have not sought
to do so. We have made it clear that this is a declaratory document,
setting out for those who use the NHS exactly
what its constitution is.</div>
<a name="09061636000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
been no sidelining of Parliament, which has a role in determining the
legislation underpinning the constitution&#151;that is, most of the
principles as they are rooted in legislation, and each of the rights.
In addition, Parliament has a role in approving any changes to the
principles of the constitution. We listened to debates in the other
place, and responded by obliging the Secretary of State to amend the
principles via regulation. In doing so, we have ensured that no
Government can change the guiding principles of the NHS without
parliamentary scrutiny.</div>
<a name="09061636000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to remember that the final constitution was not dreamt up in
Whitehall; it is, as the hon. Member for Romsey has said, the result of
extensive research and full consultation with patients, the public and
NHS staff, and it reflects what matters to them. In summary, Parliament
has already had a say on the legislation underpinning the constitution,
and no changes to the principles that it sets out can be made without
parliamentary approval. There are several provisions in the Bill
obliging the Secretary of State to consult patients, staff and other
affected bodies&#151;that is, the people who have created this
constitution&#151;before any changes can be made.</div>
<a name="09061636000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
hope that I have covered most of the points that have been raised, and
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. However,
he asked, too, about clause 3(5), and I can confirm
that the regulations to which it refers are subject to the
negative resolution procedure. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee advised officials that it did not need to see the new
power. I understand that that was because of the change made in the
other place. It was agreed that it did not have
to be referred at that stage, so it did not have to opine on it. I
gather that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee was
happy with the original drafting of the Bill, and did not express any
concerns. Because of that concession in the other place, that is how
the matter was dealt with.</div>
<a name="09061636000257"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether other Acts immediately came to mind as
measures in which dates were set. I cannot think of another such
measure, but I have explained why, the Bill gives clarity to later
provisions. We refer to a particular series of reviews that need to
take place, and it is useful to have the date in the legislation. He
asked me to write to him about the word &#147;secured&#148;, and I
am happy to do so.</div>

John Horam</b> (Orpington) (Con): I am interested to hear what
the Minister said about the procedure and process that went into the
formulation of the constitution published by the Secretary of State in
January 2009. He explained that there had been a long process involving
all kinds of stakeholders and so on. Did the resulting declaratory
constitution, which he has explained, lead to no changes? Was it simply
a clearer summary of the existing situation with no changes, or were
there any revisions of words, thoughts or principles in the new
constitution that were not in the existing legal
situation?</div><a name="09061636000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we were trying to get a clear summary of the situation, it would be
surprising if there was no change at all in what had gone before. If
there is any change that could be seen as a change by a lawyer&#151;I
am not a lawyer&#151;even if it was only a subtle change or a change
of emphasis rather than a change of fundamental principles, surely that
would mean there would be a new element that might be justiciable. Is
there a contradiction, therefore, given the Minister&#146;s assertion
that there is nothing new, and nothing that could be newly justiciable?
That is unlikely to be the case if the result of this comprehensive
process is that there will be some new perception of the arrangements
for the National Health Service? Could he enlighten me on that
point?</div><a name="09061636000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061636000359"></a><b class="B">Mr.</b><b class="B">
Mike</b><b class="B"> O'Brien:</b> I am happy to say that three new
rights were set out clearly in the constitution as a result of the
consultation. One was in relation to vaccines, another in relation to
choice and another in relation to rational decisions on the funding of
drugs. Each has directions and regulations underpinning it, so in
effect other regulations and directions underpin those rights. As a
result of the consultation, however, I am informed that the proposals
were altered, and brought into the constitutional set-up so that they
could become part of the way in which the NHS is run under the
constitution. As a result of that consultation, yes, there were
changes. The three changes I referred to were already in law but have
now been brought into the constitution following the
consultation.</div>
<a name="09061636000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asks whether the creation of this new element&#151;the
constitution&#151;creates a level of justiciability that did not
previously exist. He suggests that surely it must. To some extent he is
right, in the sense that it may be referred to in court, but I cannot
guarantee to him that as a result of those references, some case law
might not arise that draws a particular point from the constitutional
document that has been referred to in a court case and which may not at
some point, as a result of the operation of the common law and the
courts, produce a new way of looking at the NHS and a new area of law.
We do not know that. Any time we make legislation we are to some extent
at the mercy of the judges to see how that legislation operates in
practice. Parliament would have to look at the measure again in the
future to see whether it approves of the way it has been dealt
with.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="09061636000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right to some extent but not wholly right: yes, the
document can be referred to and yes, it may lead to affecting the view
of judges in a particular case. However, a new cause of action cannot
arise as a result of this constitution, because it is based on causes
of action that exist now. Anyone who brings a case now would have to
have a cause of action that arises now. Under existing law, they would
not get one merely from the constitution. However, when the matter goes
to court, can it be referred to? Yes, it can, because it is in law. I
hope that answers the points, but I am happy to give
way.</div><a name="09061636000080"></a>

<a name="09061636000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a complete
non-lawyer, I am still puzzled by the fact that something can be

because it helps his case, and is a point in its favour&#151;and will
be used and given some weight in the law courts, even though it may not
be technically judiciable in the sense a lawyer might understand. It
will none the less be used to some extent, which creates an area of
uncertainty, as I think the Minister has admitted, that may in the
future throw up case law that may well change the law. Is that the
Minister&#146;s
understanding?</div><a name="09061636000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061636000361"></a><b class="B">Mr.

uncertainty, in the sense that judges always say they merely declare
the law as it exists, not as they might want it to be&#151;unless
they are the late Lord Denning. It is the case, however, that judges in
practice have to look at new circumstances and the relation of the law
to those new circumstances. Therefore, they will, in effect, create
law, so whether or not that is an area of uncertainty, the whole aim of
the law is to create certainty, so I dispute the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s wording. If he is asking whether this, at some stage
in the future, could produce changes in the law and the way in which we
look at the NHS, the answer is yes. Does it create a new area that
could produce a case that could not be taken now? No. That is an
important distinction, and probably his Front Benchers and the
Government are broadly in the same place in terms of what we would like
to see&#151;that we have a constitution that is clear, which people
can understand, which declares what their rights are, but does not
create a lawyers&#146; charter enabling a whole series of new
interventions by the law in the NHS that do not exist
today.</div><a name="09061636000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000362"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> That last set of exchanges was
particularly helpful, and was useful in setting the context to widen
slightly our discussion beyond the immediate amendment, which is on the
date-specificity of the document referred to in the proposed statute.
The broader issue leads back to the judgment to be made on the
amendment. The Minister has been very clear that it is the
Government&#146;s intent to be declaratory. In his last set of
interactions with my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington, he talked
about there not being an area of uncertainty, but in the way he
described it, it does carry the area of possibility&#151;as it might
be referred to in legal proceedings&#151;without creating new causes
of action. I think I have understood him correctly in that
analysis.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="09061636000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be some
years before we go down this track, but in the course of any cases that
come before the courts and in the precedent-setting, which is obviously
in the nature of the law in this country under the common law, it will
be interesting to see whether in a judgment&#151;as both judges and
legal academics look back on cases decided over the years with this law
in place, in addition to all the other legislative provisions that give
rise to the causes of action that, on the Minister&#146;s analysis,
pre-exist this piece of legislation&#151;reference to the
constitution in these legal provisions ends up being obiter dicta, not
central to the decision made by the judge, or what is known in legal
terms as ratio decidendi, a core stream of thinking that leads to the
judgment and any remedy that is then
imposed.</div><a name="09061636000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
many ways, we are discussing what may or may not turn out to be the
legal journey that takes place from here. That is why the discussion
has been important. We need to be absolutely clear that&#151;even by
the record of these proceedings&#151;it will be possible to refer to
this discussion were it to become important whether or not a new legal
right has been created. It is clear that the Minister has asserted the
Government&#146;s position that the provision is intended to be
declaratory and, therefore, is not intended to create new legal rights
or causes of action. We must ensure that all that has been well heard
and is on the
record.</div><a name="09061636000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remain concerned about the date specificity, although not because the
Minister gave a particularly weak answer. His justification was that
referring to a document by its date provided clarity. He could not
immediately call to mind any other legislation that had taken that
approach, although he said that it might have been done by reference
to, say, a Command Paper. However, it strikes me that the difficulty is
that if there is the potential for the provision to be something that
is prayed in aid and referred to, it is extraordinary that, as a matter
of reference, we do not continue to have a document that is referred to
as an extant document of the constitution, which is what the cumulative
attempt of the Bill intends to carry. Any extant NHS constitution,
however, is not seen to have been something that has been approved by
both Houses of Parliament. The two amendments go together&#151;the
substantive one is amendment 2&#151;but to make the point emphatic,
and to test the opinion of the House, I will be content to divide on
just amendment 1, which is the first of the group.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000379"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Amendment 4 would add a duty for NHS bodies to
have regard to the core principles of the NHS which would, by
amendments 5 and 6, be enshrined within the legislation. Amendment 5
lists the core principles 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>of the NHS according to its plan. Amendment 6 sets out the redacted core
principles as they now appear in the NHS constitution.</div>
<a name="09061636000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
recurrent theme in the regulatory impact assessment, with phrases such
as</div>
<a name="09061636000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
legislative duties reinforce the benefits of the Constitution, reducing
the likelihood that these benefits will be eroded over
time.&#148;</div><a name="09061636000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is in paragraph 7 of the cover note. It also
states:</div><a name="09061636000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
constitution should mitigate the risk of the erosion of core
values&#148;.</div><a name="09061636000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is unclear whether this is an adviser extending the assessment&#146;s
word count, or if it is a slightly unnecessary and unfortunate attempt
to suggest that the core values of the NHS would be under threat in
advance of a general election and another Government. We would
certainly argue that this is unjustified.</div>
<a name="09061636000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that the Government themselves have been responsible for the erosion
of, if not the values that lie behind the core principles, at least the
core principles themselves. Nine years ago the NHS plan set out
10 NHS core principles, which were endorsed by 25
organisations representing both NHS staff associations and patient
groups. In that intervening period, those have become increasingly well
regarded, enforced and emphasised. They are good principles and the
official Opposition are committed to enshrining those principles in
legislation, hence amendment 5.</div>
<a name="09061636000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
the Government have chipped away at those core principles for the last
nine years, which, inevitably, is a cause for concern. My right hon.
Friend the Leader of the Opposition has consistently confirmed our
commitment that, under any incoming Conservative Government, the NHS
will continue to be a public service free at the point of need, with
equality of access based on need, not ability to pay. I am keen that
the Government should seek to support
that.</div><a name="09061636000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the December 2006 consultation on the core principles of the
NHS&#151;which we have committed to enshrining in legislation and
which were referred to during our debate on the previous group of
amendments&#151;undertaken by the former Minister, now the Secretary
of State for Health, the Government committed to the principle
that</div><a name="09061636000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Public
funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to NHS
patients.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061636000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I heard what the
Minister had to say and intervened on him in relation to his example of
prescriptions. I wanted to ensure that we fully understood this in
light of the Government&#146;s own review, the report received and
the Government&#146;s reaction in relation to top-ups, which had
caused great anxiety to patients and Members throughout the House, not
least on the Government&#146;s Benches. This principle, which appears
in paragraph (f) of amendment 6, remains notable by its absence. As a
sub-point to principle 6&#151;I am glad to say that we had a hand in
making this happen&#151;the Government reintroduced the
phrase:</div><a name="09061636000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Public
funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to the benefit of the
people that the NHS serves&#148;.</div>
<a name="09061636000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;People that the
NHS serves&#148; is, of course, a much less secure category than
simply &#147;NHS patients.&#148; I am sure that will not be lost on
hon. Members.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div><a name="09061636000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The original
core principle 4, that the NHS will respond to different needs of
different populations&#151;in truth, communities&#151;has fallen
off the agenda in such specific terms. It is important that we
recognise that different communities and those with different genetic
antecedents have different health needs. It is of particular concern
that this original core principle of recognising the response required
by the NHS for different needs in different communities has
disappeared from the Government&#146;s stated position and agenda. I
am not making a party political or contentious point, but it just
happens to be at a time when all of us across the House need to join
shoulder to shoulder in resisting anything that could give credence to
some of the most appalling, outrageous and obnoxious electoral
approaches of people who stand for a party such as the BNP, where they
are looking for excuses to underpin their racist, class-based,
anti-communities approach. I hope that the Government will consider
rowing back from this area because the original core principle 4 needs
to be looked at, particularly in the light of that political context,
let alone the health
context.</div><a name="09061636000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Extraordinarily,
core principle 6,</div>
<a name="09061636000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the NHS
will support and value its
staff&#148;</div><a name="09061636000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">has
been ditched without apparent replacement. I need hardly say more: it
is just extraordinary. I will listen carefully to what the Minister has
to say on that, because it seems to us to be an appalling
omission.</div><a name="09061636000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original core principle 9 specifically and explicitly addressed health
inequalities. That phrase does not appear in the constitution&#146;s
core principles. It may be simply to hide the Government&#146;s
embarrassment over their failure, over time, to reduce health
inequalities, but that remains a broader debate for another day and I
can assure the Minister that we will continue to have that
debate.</div><a name="09061636000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s failure to secure compliance with the final core
principle of the NHS plan, on confidentiality, has, I am sorry to say,
become legendary. It is no surprise, but it is to the
Government&#146;s shame that this, too, has fallen off the agenda. It
is right that the impact assessment should be concerned about the
ability of a Labour Government to chip away at the principles of our
NHS. We have remained committed to them while the Government have
consulted on them, through the NHS plan, have set up a new set for NHS
Choices and now a new set in the constitution. It is precisely for this
reason that the principles that were in the original NHS plan, as we
have consistently proposed, ought to be in the
Bill.</div><a name="09061636000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a fit of generosity to the new Minister, I have included the core
principles as laid out in the NHS constitution in amendment 6. If he is
unable to support his Government&#146;s original proposals, by way of
supporting amendment 5, the NHS plan core principles, I hope that he
will at least be happy to accept what is proposed in amendment 6. I
hope that sets the scene for this very important series of
amendments.</div><a name="09061636000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000380"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Amendments 5 and 6 place principles of the
NHS in the Bill, with amendment 5 listing principles from the NHS plan
published in 2000 and amendment 6 abbreviating the principles published
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>the NHS constitution. Amendment 4 would require the bodies listed in
clause 2(2) to have regard to these
principles.</div>
<a name="09061636000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of
the Committee will be aware that clause 2 already sets out a
requirement to have regard to the constitution. This requirement
relates to the whole of the constitution, including its principles. It
is therefore unnecessary to restate here the need to have regard to the
principles.</div><a name="09061636000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not lost sight of some of the principles set out in the NHS plan,
so I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that no principles from the NHS
plan have gone missing from the constitution at all. We do not want
that to happen. We engaged key stakeholders extensively when drawing up
the constitution and the results of that work allowed us to refine the
principles set out in the NHS plan. Where they do not appear as
principles, they are reflected elsewhere in the constitution, either as
pledges or as rights. For example, the principle around valuing staff
is reflected throughout the constitution, in its pledges to staff and
in the third principle, which sets out the importance of the education,
training and development of
staff.</div><a name="09061636000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000381"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The Minister makes an interesting point, but I was
very taken with the arguments of the hon. Member for Eddisbury. Is the
Minister saying that the public have no regard to health inequalities?
That seems to have been eroded from the original NHS
plan.</div><a name="09061636000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000382"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Health inequalities are certainly important and
that is why we have an Equality Bill, which the House wanted to see
introduced. Equalities, in health and in a range of other things, are
part of the Government&#146;s wider agenda. I reassure the hon. Lady
that the Government continue to believe that equality in the health
service is enormously important. For the very reason that we are
including the health service in the Equality Bill, I hope that she is
reassured that that remains the case. Equally, the principle around
public funds being devoted solely to NHS patients has not been lost. It
has simply been stated differently in order to move away from the idea
of people who use NHS services being classified as NHS patients. All
those who use NHS services are not necessarily NHS patients. They may
be using a service to get information and may not regard themselves as
accessing an NHS service as a patient. They may merely be seeking to
obtain information about how that service operates. They may be seeking
to access it for all sorts of reasons, even to enter into a contract. A
doctor seeking, for example, to work with the health service is not
engaging as a patient; he is engaging as a doctor and therefore is in a
different category. Some of the wording, therefore, has been changed.
The sixth
principle:</div><a name="09061636000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Public
funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to the benefit of the
people that the NHS serves&#148;,</div>
<a name="09061636000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">is an important
one.</div>
<a name="09061636000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The outcome
of the review into top-up payments was that public funds can be used
only for the benefit of NHS patients and not to subsidise private
health care. Following the review, the Government clarified that NHS
care should not be withdrawn when a patient wishes to purchase
additional private care separately from their NHS care. There should
not, however, be any mixing of publicly and privately funded care. That
is an important point. We need to look at this in relation to other
areas of the health service to be sure that that is properly
recognised.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div><a name="09061636000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
consulted on the draft constitution last summer, our consultation
document specifically explained how each of the 10 NHS plan principles
had been incorporated into the constitution. We now have a set of
principles that, after full consultation, have the support of
patients&#146; groups, the public and the staff. The large majority
of respondents to the consultation thought the principles were
articulated in broadly the right way. A large number of improvements
were suggested and the final published version of the NHS constitution
reflected these comments, as I have already indicated to the hon.
Member for
Eddisbury.</div><a name="09061636000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important to remember why we have chosen not to include any of
the NHS constitution in the Bill. As I have indicated, we do not want
to create a lawyers&#146; charter. This is why a declaratory, not a
legal document is important, and why we are cautious about following
the route suggested by the hon. Gentleman. My concern
is that we would be doing exactly what I thought we had
agreed in the last debate we both wanted to avoid, which is to create a
lawyers&#146; charter so that we create new routes into the NHS and
we end up with judges determining NHS priorities rather than the NHS
structures.</div>
<a name="09061636000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Enshrining
the NHS principles in primary legislation sets them in stone until that
legislation is changed. I am firmly of the view that the principles are
enduring and it is certainly not my intention for them to
change in  any significant way, but I also believe we need a
degree of flexibility as the NHS grows and evolves. These
amendments do not allow for that flexibility. There is a
range of new services and a range of new demands from patients and we
need to be able to reflect that in a positive
way.</div><a name="09061636000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have listened to the Opposition&#146;s concerns on these points while
the Bill was in another place and I believe we have reached a sensible,
balanced position in relation to the constitution. As the Bill stands,
it allows parliamentary scrutiny of any changes to the
constitution&#146;s principles by addressing those changes in
regulations, and they will therefore have to be brought before the
House. This solution avoids the dangers of placing them in the Bill,
which could lead to precisely the problems that I thought both the hon.
Gentleman and I agreed we wanted to avoid.</div>
<a name="09061636000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given my
reassurances, I hope the hon. Gentleman will be able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

is familiar, as we all are, with our local involvement networks, which,
on behalf of local communities, can scrutinise what is going
on in primary care trusts or trust hospitals. Are their rights
enshrined in the constitution and principles of the NHS or are they
susceptible to a degree of local discussion? For example, do they have
the right under the constitution to go to a board meeting, ask
questions and receive the agenda beforehand? Equally, is it their right
to inspect a hospital with 24 hours&#146; notice? I want to be clear
whether this is laid down in the constitution or whether it is subject
to any local discussion and negotiation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000384"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> With regard to the rights of LINks, among other
organisations, which we will be discussing later in relation to
amendment 12, we have agreed in relation to any changes in the
constitution to consult broadly, including organisations that represent
patients. The rights of groups to visit a hospital, to access papers,
to ensure that they are fully informed about what is happening in the
NHS, do not need to be enshrined in the constitution. They arise as a
result of other requirements, which are laid down in regulations and in
guidance from the Department. A number of rights exist for doctors,
nurses, patients&#146; organisations and other groups. They do not
all have to be in the constitution.</div>
<a name="09061636000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
constitution is the skeleton structure on which other things have to be
attached, rather than a document delineating all the rights that people
may have. It is a broad declaration of principles. I hope that deals
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns. Any rights that LINks,
patients&#146; groups and other organisations may have will remain
the same, to the extent that they may refer to the constitution and say
to a PCT, &#147;Make sure you are complying with your own
constitution.&#148; They will be able to do that, so there will some
strengthening of rights, but there will be no new ability for
organisations to claim rights that they do not currently have. I hope
that deals with the point. We take the view that the legislation is
properly drafted and I hope that hon. Members will be able to support
it.</div><a name="09061636000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061636000385"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000386"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> All that appears to be happening here is that,
with some minor adjustments, the Opposition seek to enshrine in the
Bill issues that are set out broadly in the constitution. We do not
want them in the Bill because that will produce an opportunity for
litigation, which we do not want the NHS exposed to at this
point.</div><a name="09061636000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not a matter of arguing broadly about the principles. There are some
issues regarding the wording, which we will come on to in further
amendments, but we believe that the NHS constitution sets out those
principles adequately. The references in the legislation to the
constitution give it enough declaratory effect without producing the
problem of the lawyers&#146; charter, which we seek to
avoid.</div><a name="09061636000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000387"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I am not a lawyer. We have too many of them, but
perhaps on this occasion we need some clarification. How is it a
lawyers&#146; charter to have in the Bill that the NHS will provide a
universal service based on clinical need, not on the ability to pay, or
that the NHS provides a comprehensive service available to all? How is
that a lawyers&#146; charter in a 21st-century
NHS?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div><a name="09061636000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000388"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> If I was a lawyer acting for a patient who had to
pay prescription charges, looking at the Bill, I might say, &#147;We
have some core principles here. All universal services must be produced
on the basis of clinical need, not the ability to pay, so under no
circumstances should there be any prescription charges,&#148; and I
will take that to court and argue it. The lawyers, in effect, would get
a charter&#151;it is precisely the point that the hon. Gentleman
raises. It is easy for a lawyer suddenly to decide that they will take
a point on
that.</div><a name="09061636000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I was on the defence side, I would look at paragraph (f) in
amendment 6, which states that</div>
<a name="09061636000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the NHS is
committed to providing best value for taxpayers&#146; money and the
most effective, fair and sustainable use of finite
resources&#148;.</div><a name="09061636000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
on the other side, the NHS would argue, &#147;Let&#146;s balance
out the principles set out in paragraph (a) with those set out in
paragraph (f).&#148; We could have a nice, fine argument before a
High Court. Indeed, we would undoubtedly take it to the Court of Appeal
and the House of Lords to argue the difference in the balance on the
face of the legislation and which of those paragraphs should have
precedent. It would be great, a lawyers&#146; charter. Some lawyers
would make a lot of money out of it. It would be very easy if it was on
the face of the Bill. We want to avoid precisely that point. I hope
that reassures the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09061636000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000389"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> Not in the
slightest.</div><a name="09061636000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000390"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The hon. Gentleman says, sotto voce, &#147;not
in the slightest&#148;, but his colleague on the Front Bench argued
that he did not want to create a lawyers&#146; charter either. My
concern is that if that is put on the face of the Bill in that way, it
is precisely what will happen. Lawyers will find it pretty easy to find
a way of choosing a point here and ending up with judges making
decisions that neither his Front Bench nor mine want to see made by
judges, but rather, by the appropriate organisation in the
NHS.</div><a name="09061636000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000391"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> It is an interesting defence. The
Minister has sought to use the example of prescription charges,
particularly in that last exchange. It is quite timely to remind
ourselves that, to some degree, that was rehearsed at some length in
the other place. They came up with what the Minister described fairly
as the concession that was made. It was to try to find the balance
between &#147;declaratory&#148;, which encapsulates what has
already gone before while not getting quite as far as using the word
&#147;consolidation&#148;&#151;inevitably, all those words have
legal consequences; they are not just words that are useful in an
English dictionary&#151;and avoiding new causes of action, which is
where the issue about a lawyers&#146; charter comes from. It is not
so much that one might succeed, but giving one a sufficient and
credible cause of action to get something started is the actual area of
concern.</div>
<a name="09061636000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
grave danger here that two professional lawyers will share too much,
but I share the Minister&#146;s concern. But it was interesting when
on Third Reading in the other place my noble Friend Earl Howe, as a
result of the debate on that precise point,
said:</div><a name="09061636000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
fear that some people had that an amendment of this kind might open the
floodgates to litigation against the NHS was never one that I
considered to be well founded. I still do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>believe that. It would have validity if the scope of these amendments
were to extend more widely than they do&#151;if, for example, they
were to embrace specific rights. However, in so far as the guiding
principles are already underpinned by existing primary legislation,
there cannot reasonably be a fear that, by linking the constitution
directly to the parliamentary process, we will be creating the
potential for a lawyers&#146; charter.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 12 May 2009; Vol. 710, c.
928.]</div><a name="09061636000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was
a fair point.</div>
<a name="09061636000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reluctantly,
therefore, the Minister may find himself in agreement with me in this
debate, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington.
Taking that logic, I have to say that I have some difficulty with the
matter. The Minister has said that he is not worried that the original
core principles 4, 6 and 9 have disappeared, as has the final core
principle on confidentiality. He said that they do not need to be put
in the Bill. Given the access to advice that the Minister, the
Government and all their advisers have, they have said that they are
confident that they are not creating a set of new legal rights or an
opportunity for new causes of action. If this is truly declaratory, I
cannot see why they are reluctant to put the NHS constitution in the
Bill. If they did that, it would carry the one thing that we all want
to see.</div>
<a name="09061636000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parking the
justiciability issue, which we have done to some degree, the other
issue is that we would not want to see any amendment to the NHS
constitution that is not highly explicit, highly visible and in
response to a change of primary legislation&#151;the underpinning
legal rights would probably have to be done by primary legislation,
otherwise they are not pre-existing legal rights. Therefore, there is a
logic that drives us to say that we should have the constitution in the
Bill because the principles would create no more legal rights but at
the same time they would be as equal as pre-existing primary
legislative legal rights. The prospect of change drove a former health
Minister, Lord Warner&#151;who seemed to be the sinner who
repenteth&#151;to
say:</div><a name="09061636000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Circumstances
change and Governments have to respond to them. With the NHS now taking
a very large chunk of the public finances, we have to be wise about not
putting primary legislation on the books that unreasonably ties the
hands of future Governments when dealing with the economic
circumstances that they face.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House
of Lords, </i>23 February 2009; Vol. 708, c.
GC9.]</div><a name="09061636000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
might almost be an argument for chipping away at the core principles
when we face tough economic circumstances. However, we resisted that
and said that we need the principles in the Bill so that there can be
no diminution of the explicit requirement to change the NHS
constitution, which we are trying to ensure is put in the Bill and in
the right terms. When the hon. Member for Romsey touched on health
inequalities, she got an interesting reply about the Equality Bill,
which was not where the debate lay. Talking about health inequalities
is more to do with access under the NHS and the fact that we need an
egality of access right across the country, even with our devolved
institutions. It has been difficult to square off the argument that the
Minister prays in aid in order to resist the lawyers&#146; charter
argument and to ensure that no new primary legislative sourced rights
have been created and, at  the same time, to resist putting
this into primary  legislation so that we can always be
explicit if there was any
change.</div>

Mike O'Brien:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is the case that we wish to avoid
creating a whole series of new courses of action, but the hon.
Gentleman wants to include that in the Bill. After looking at the
matter again, it is clear that that would give lawyers ample

thing, how would he not create a new course of action by saying, in
proposed new subsection (3)(c), that</div>

O'Brien:</b> The Minister raises an interesting example. In
many ways, I am glad that he does so, because he gives me an
opportunity to spell out the difference between amendments 5 and 6. He
referred to amendment 6 and what would be subsection (3)(c), which is,
in effect, a copy-and-paste job from the Government&#146;s set of
core principles. He is saying that it would create a new area that is
not underpinned by primary legislation. I ask for that to be taken in
context with the argument that there is a separation between what is
set out in the Government&#146;s proposed constitutional provisions
and what is underpinned by primary legislation. Most importantly,
however, amendment 5 would copy and paste in what was in the NHS plan,
which my party has adopted as its official position. It includes the
principles that the Government have had in their NHS plan, which they
say have always been underpinned by legislative provision, not least
because the equivalent provision is
that</div><a name="09061636000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
NHS will shape its services around the needs and preferences of
individual patients, their

standards of excellence and
professionalism&#148;,</div><a name="09061636000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is what the Minister read out. That is a different issue. I gave an
example of writing in the different needs of different populations, as
the hon. Member for Romsey picked up, to ensure that we can address
health inequalities more
explicitly.</div><a name="09061636000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s interesting points lead me to decide whether to press
the amendment, unless he wants to intervene again&#151;I do not want
to truncate the debate. Clearly, amendment 4 does not go into the
substance of the matter, but amendments 5 and 6 do. To some degree,
they are alternatives. I will not press amendment 6, but I shall press

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000400"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Amendment 107 is an attempt to tease out the
phrase &#147;have regard to&#148; in the constitution and to
replace it with &#147;abide by&#148;&#151;that is not intended to
sound like a hymn. In addition, amendment 108 seeks guidelines for
assessing the delivery of the duty so that we may have something
concrete against which to measure the effectiveness of the regard and
the
principles.</div><a name="09061636000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me be clear at the outset that I am not convinced that &#147;abide
by&#148; is much better than &#147;have regard
to&#148;&#151;that might give the Minister a sense of victory.
However, hon. Members must agree that either NHS bodies are bound by
the constitution, and thus it has bite, or it enters the great panoply
of guidance spewed forth from Richmond house on a daily basis to pause
briefly, if at all, on its journey between the inbox and, one hopes,
the recycling
bin.</div><a name="09061636000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting to note that Lord Walton of Detchant stated in the upper
House:</div><a name="09061636000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
we debated the Bill at Second Reading it was stressed, rightly so, that
the NHS Constitution is not a code or a statute but a set of
guidelines.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>23 February 2009; Vol. 708, c.
GC6.]</div><a name="09061636000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
challenge for hon. Members, in this debate, is to examine whether they
think that that is adequate. If we are going to all this trouble to
create an NHS constitution, we need to ask whether it is simply a
restatement of the existing law, an aspirational or declaratory
document, or nothing more than a set of guidelines. If it is only a set
of guidelines, why, as we make our way through the Bill, are we going
to take up quite a lot of time discussing the nature of the handbook,
which is also statutorily
provided?</div><a name="09061636000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
needs to be complete clarity from the Minister, who sought in our first
debate to make it absolutely clear why the Government intend the
constitution and the Bill to be declaratory. We also need continual
clarity about the way in which all the documents interleave and
interrelate, as well as about the degree to which they are things that
may simply be referred to, even in court proceedings, or things about
which people can say, &#147;I wish to rely upon them. The Government
must have had a real intent in passing them. I, as a citizen of the
United Kingdom, am looking to my own needs. They say that I can have an
expectation as a result of the document, which parliamentarians took a
long time discussing. They can&#146;t have just put it up for
window-dressing purposes; they must have meant something by it, so what
am I able enforce and
claim?&#148;</div><a name="09061636000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is therefore meant by &#147;have regard to&#148;? I suspect that
the Minister, like many before him, will respond by saying that it is a
well-established legal phrase. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>might well be the case, but it has not stopped disputes on that
particular legal phrase being brought forth. It is not, therefore, a
phrase that carries the confidence of certainty. If anything, it is a
phrase that has, dare I say it, given rise to a lawyer&#146;s
charter, which takes us back full circle to the previous set of
amendments. The fact that we had an interesting final run-out on that
previous group on the difference between the genesis of amendment 6 and
that of amendment 5, and between the Government&#146;s thoughts today
and their thoughts about the NHS plan 10 years ago, shows that we have
to be very mindful of the intent behind the Government&#146;s
words.</div><a name="09061636000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
noble Friend Earl Howe said in another
place:</div><a name="09061636000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
Grand Committee, the Minister indicated in, I thought, a somewhat
nonchalant way that there was a well established legal meaning to the
phrase &#147;have regard to&#148;. The trouble is that he
singularly failed to tell us what that meaning
is.&#148;</div><a name="09061636000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the majority of legislation in which the phrase is used, that which
must be regarded is generally quite
straightforward.</div><a name="09061636000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
noble Friend continued by pointing out:</div>
<a name="09061636000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Local
Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 obliges
a local authority to have regard to every local improvement target
specified in a local area agreement. It is fairly obvious what a local
authority should and should not do in compliance with that duty, as it
is very
specific.&#148;</div><a name="09061636000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the counter point to our argument about the specificity of a
document&#146;s deep detail and whether one wants something to be
fixed in stone or pinned down so that it can be referred to, or whether
one wants a document&#146;s content to be a clear set of principles
that might be introduced by primary legislation from time to time. My
noble Friend
continued:</div><a name="09061636000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Healthcare Commission had a legal duty to have regard to government
policy in exercising its functions. What this meant was very clear: in
everything it did, the Healthcare Commission had to bear in mind the
Government&#146;s priorities in the delivery of healthcare and, as
far as possible, to build those priorities into the ordering of its
work.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28 April

157.]</div><a name="09061636000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
improvement targets are fixed, and although Government policy is less
so, it is still made clear through guidance, directions and other
publications. The principles of the NHS constitution are, as has just
been argued, somewhat more nebulous and unspecific; they are values and
principles. What, therefore, does it mean to &#147;have regard
to&#148; a set of values or
principles?</div><a name="09061636000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must also look at who is doing the regarding. Although the NHS
organisations listed in clause 2(2) are legally constituted entities,
it is presumably their boards, not their staff, who are bound by the
duty to &#147;have regard to&#148;, which is the somewhat difficult
and odd situation that Lord Darzi failed to clarify in the upper House.
I will therefore be grateful if the Minister will clarify that point.
Will the duty to &#147;have regard to&#148; be included in the
employment contracts of current and future staff? What power is there
to sack a member of staff who fails to have regard to the constitution,
and how will the employer enforce it?</div>

states:</div><a name="09061636000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to parliamentary approval, all NHS bodies, and private and third-sector
providers supplying NHS services in England will be required by law to
take account of the Constitution in their decisions and
actions.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="09061636000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does the
Department&#146;s website use the phrase &#147;take account
of&#148; when that is not in the Bill, but &#147;have regard
to&#148; is? How is taking account different from having regard to?
Does the latter mean, &#147;I have taken a look at it&#148;? Does
taking account of it mean, &#147;I have taken account of it, and have
taken into account all, some or indeed none of it, and I am prepared to
justify my actions&#148;? There is a genuine question as
to why such an inconsistency should have arisen on the
Department&#146;s website.</div>
<a name="09061636000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point is
a nod back to our discussion on justiciability. I suspect that a judge
would have some fun when deciding what was meant by &#147;having
regard to&#148;. People might not associate the word
&#147;fun&#148; with the courts, but there is a certain
intellectual attraction to debating the point. We therefore have to ask
what legal force this would have in a case brought against the NHS.
Will the Minister confirm that it has the legal force of <i class="I">The
Beano</i>&#151;that was the aspect of justiciability raised by his
former ministerial colleague, the right hon. Member for Leicester,
East, who is now the Chairman of the Select Committee on Home Affairs?
Another way of testing it would be to ask what legal force it would
have in a judicial review.</div>
<a name="09061636000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
important, as the Minister will realise, is the fact that this has a
major effect on complaints, which we were not allowed to discuss when
debating the Bill that became the Health and Social Care Act 2008. The
hon. Member for Romsey will recall that a series of concerns arose as a
result of the demise of the Commission for Social Care Inspection, the
Mental Health Act Commission and the Healthcare Commission about what
would happen to complaints. We were told that all complaints would have
to go the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, and that is
so.</div>
<a name="09061636000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
on &#147;have regard to&#148; remains completely unclarified. We
are still concerned about the ability to make complaints about the
substance, the absence, or the inappropriateness of health or social
care treatment for individuals. At the moment, referrals to an
ombudsman tend to be only on matters of maladministration, which is
familiar to us all. The question then arises of what the phrase
&#147;have regard to&#148; means, especially in the context of the
recent report by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. I
understand that an ombudsman can order any remedy considered
appropriate, but such orders are no more than recommendations, as we
found most recently with the extraordinary experience of  the
Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman having to issue a second report on
Equitable Life, after the recommendations in her first report were not
acted upon and she could not enforce them. It is fair at this point for
us to raise the question of what is meant by &#147;have regard
to&#148; in relation to the complaints procedure envisaged by the
Government for health and social care.</div>
<a name="09061636000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also query
why bodies should &#147;have regard&#148; to only their NHS
functions, and what those NHS functions are. I know that my hon. Friend
the Member for Tiverton and Honiton will discuss at some length the
questions on foundations trusts arising from the Bill. Does it mean
that if foundation trusts provide private care, they do not need to
adhere to those principles? Is that within or without the term
&#147;NHS functions&#148;? What about air ambulances, whose work,
which is valued by all, is often funded totally by charitable
donations? Those who have air ambulances in their constituencies spend
a lot of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>time ensuring that people are keen to support them; we do our best to
encourage such altruism, as it keeps those vital services going. The
work of the air ambulance is interwoven with that of the NHS. Does what
they do form part of the NHS function or not? Hospices are another
group that works as closely as possible alongside the NHS. I have good
reason to know that, as my wife is a nurse in a local hospice. Will we
have a situation in which an NHS-funded patient in a hospice bed will
have to be cared for with regard to the constitution, but a charitably
funded patient in the next bed will
not?</div><a name="09061636000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
clause 2(3) notes that an NHS function
is</div><a name="09061636000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
function under an
enactment&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061636000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">a
wonderful phrase to get a certain type of politician going. Why is the
phrase &#147;under an enactment&#148; there at all? The provision
would seem to be effective if it
read</div><a name="09061636000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
function...concerned with, or connected to, the provision,
commissioning or regulation of NHS services.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061636000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The phrase
&#147;under an enactment&#148; is limited to the statutory
behaviour of the NHS only. Will the Minister confirm whether everything
that the NHS does is based wholly on statute? For example, I assume
that the NHS mechanic servicing an ambulance is not doing so
statutorily, although I thought of that example late last night, so it
might not be watertight. What are the Government trying to include or,
more particularly, exclude with that phrase? It must be deliberate or
it would not be in the Bill, so there must be an intention behind
it.</div><a name="09061636000310"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
<a name="09061636000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of
the Committee will no doubt have received, and maybe read, the British
Medical Association briefing on the Bill, which I have to hand. It
calls for further clarification on the
duty:</div><a name="09061636000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not clear what this duty entails and what standard or uniform
criteria will be used to judge whether or not relevant bodies have
acted adequately in this regard. A clear indication is needed of the
mechanism that would enable challenge of an organisation&#146;s
behaviour if it was found not have upheld this
duty.&#148;</div><a name="09061636000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
dare say that the Minister has seen that submission, and I hope that he
has an answer to that
point.</div><a name="09061636000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
guarantees can the Minister give that NHS organisations will not simply
badge up what they are already doing, creating a new layer of
bureaucracy but no new practices, to demonstrate a spurious
&#147;regard&#148;? The Minister will have to give guarantees on
quality accounts in a similar fashion at a later stage. How can a right
be a right unless it is unassailably asserted? What would happen if the
Government had only to &#147;have regard&#148; to a free press, to
universal suffrage, to property and to privacy? Those analogies make
the point strongly. This is perhaps the best measure: what does the
Minister expect introducing the constitution to
change?</div><a name="09061636000197"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000401"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I welcome the amendments, because they go to the
heart of one of the problems with the Bill and the status of the
constitution. I mentioned earlier that a lot of work and consultation
went into the preparation of the constitution, but the whole idea is
doomed if the public do not have faith in the documents, and there are
early examples of that. The constitution lacks clarity about how
patients get rights. It is not just me who says that. Lord
Darzi&#146;s report, &#147;High Quality Care for All&#148;,
says:</div>
<a name="09061636000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the Constitution to be meaningful it must have bite, with means for
enforcement and redress, not just warm words or
aspirations&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="09061636000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">My strong feeling is
that we have &#147;warm words or aspirations&#148; and they can
only take us so far. We need a framework that people can understand, so
they cannot be fobbed off easily. When a patient brings any sort of
complaint, they usually do so with some reluctance, because they fear
reprisals. I always think that that is a misplaced fear, but that is
what constituents say to us when raising concerns about hospital
practices without wanting to make a
fuss.</div><a name="09061636000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure where the buck stops on some of these matters. Just to give
a simple example, one of the aspirations of the constitution
is</div><a name="09061636000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
ensure that services are provided in a clean and safe environment that
is fit for purpose, based on national best
practice&#148;.</div><a name="09061636000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
in a hypothetical case, what if a patient developed an infection and
there were poor hygiene practice relating to the same patient in a
ward&#151;those two things may not be connected or it may be
difficult to establish a link&#151;but, on examination, the NHS trust
was found to have fairly robust policies in place and this was a
one-off event? Has the trust then discharged its duty by saying that it
has policies and checks in place, but that those were missed on this
one occasion, or is the buck passed down to the individual in charge at
ward level, who should, perhaps, had greater responsibility for
noticing such a problem? Or does the hapless cleaner get the blame?
Where does the buck
stop?</div><a name="09061636000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is quite a lot of wriggle room in the document. I believe that the hon.
Member for Eddisbury seeks more clarity and a tightening
up.</div><a name="09061636000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000402"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I am listening carefully to what the hon.
Lady is saying. However, when talking about where the buck stops, I am
not sure whether she is asking me where the liability in relation to
legal case lies or where the responsibility lies in relation to the
obligations&#151;the duty&#151;on a trust or another organisation.
Obviously, the responsibility to apply the constitution lies with the
trust, but the trust may not be responsible for a dereliction by an
individual member of staff. Nevertheless, the trust may be liable, even
though it is not responsible, for any damage that may result to an
individual patient. So there is a distinction between liability and
responsibility. The hon. Lady is talking more generally, and I am not
entirely sure which she is asking me
about.</div><a name="09061636000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000403"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I was not going down the liability road at this
stage. Patients must have faith in the constitution. They may look at
their handbook, realise that certain things are supposed to happen and
complain to the trust, at which point the trust can easily say,
&#147;We&#146;ve had regard to this aspect of the constitution.
We&#146;ve got policies in place. It was a failure by a member of
staff.&#148; That weakens the document considerably, because there is
not really a right to redress and there is no aspiration to learn from
the failures of the system. It seems that the trusts can, as long as
they have all the right bits of paper, quite easily wriggle out of
responsibility with regard to delivering what is in the constitution.
We could spend all day thinking up similar examples, but I was merely
trying to qualify where the buck stops and who had responsibility
where.</div><a name="09061636000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
simpler answer would be to support amendment 108, under
which the Secretary of State could issue guidance on this matter. I
wonder whether this potential provision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>could be reviewed in some way in future, because although the Secretary
of State may feel that he does not need it now, if there are problems
with the constitution at a later date, it would be a shame to have
missed an opportunity to provide a
remedy.</div><a name="09061636000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000404"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Committee members have raised a number of
important points during this debate. We all want the constitution to
have a meaningful, positive effect, so that it ensures that patients,
and anyone who deals with the NHS, whether as a contractor or in any
other role, know where they stand when they go into a hospital or use
NHS facilities. However, we also want to ensure that while it has some
practical effect, it does not create problems for the NHS that do not
currently exist.</div>
<a name="09061636000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
listened carefully to the messages that came out of the extensive
consultation and engagement that we conducted as we drew up the draft
constitution. A consistent message was that the constitution should be
used to bring about cultural change in the NHS. It is seen as a way of
getting away from the idea of rival interests or a transactional
relationship between staff and patients. It is about having a framework
document that will set a sense of direction and a clear vision for the
way in which the NHS is to go forward. That was reinforced by the
constitutional advisory forum, a body of leading stakeholders who
oversaw the consultation, which advised the Secretary of State in its
report against top-down performance management of the constitution. We
therefore do not believe that we should enforce compliance with the
constitution to the
letter.</div><a name="09061636000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000405"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The Minister&#146;s interpretation of top-down
is interesting, because we are talking not about minutiae, but about a
framework for checking that due regard has been taken of the
constitution at all levels. I agree that too much detail would be bad,
but surely we need more than we have.</div>
<a name="09061636000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000406"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b><b class="B"> </b>The NHS has a plethora of rules,
regulations and statutory obligations that guide it and give substance
to the way in which it operates, but the aim of the constitution is not
to add to those significantly. We seek to frame all that so that
patients, staff and those who deal with the NHS know what the
organisation is about. What we are discussing is, therefore, a
framework, and not a consolidation of all the NHS&#146;s obligations,
but that does not mean that the constitution has no bite.</div>
<a name="09061636000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The words
&#147;have regard to&#148; have meaning and are used in other
legislation. The Health and Social Care Act 2008 lists matters that the
Care Quality Commission must have regard to. Section 4(2)
states:</div><a name="09061636000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
performing its functions the Commission must also have regard to such
aspects of government policy as the Secretary of State may
direct.&#148;</div><a name="09061636000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
chapter entitled, &#147;Supervision of management and use of
controlled drugs&#148;, in the Health Act 2006
states:</div><a name="09061636000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Designated
bodies and responsible bodies must have regard to any guidance under
this section in exercising any functions to which the guidance
relates.&#148;</div><a name="09061636000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
has been said in the other place, there is a long legal lineage to
those words. In a sense, that is why we have used them rather than
&#147;take account of&#148;, which are the plain English words used
in the consultation so that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>people understand what it all means. Here, we are using legal English,
which has a legal lineage that judges can fully understand. The detail
does not need to be set
out.</div><a name="09061636000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Lord Mackay of Clashfern said in agreeing with the Government&#146;s
position from the Opposition
Benches:</div><a name="09061636000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Guidance
as to what is meant by &#147;have regard to&#148; would either be
extremely brief, or possibly, if it were extensive, a bit confusing, to
say the least...I have seen some attempts at this kind of work and
they are not always crowned with success.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 28 April 2009; Vol. 710, c.
159.]</div><a name="09061636000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">He is
quite right; judges know what &#147;have regard to&#148; means. It
means that in making any decision they will have regard to the
constitution but will not create a whole series of new causes of action
out of it.</div>
<a name="09061636000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">What does
that mean in practice for organisations within the NHS? Because a court
dealing with a case will be able to have regard to, take account of or
whatever other phrase people want to use, the judge will be able to
acknowledge the existence of, and somebody will be able to pray in aid,
the constitution. A case might have been brought because of a cause of
action arising in current law, but any organisation within the NHS must
know that if it is before a court, it will have to be able to show that
it had regard to the constitution. If it did not, it might well be in
trouble, because the person praying in aid will be able to say that
that body has a legal obligation to have regard to constitution and
that it
failed.</div><a name="09061636000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09061636000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, how would organisations such as PCTs and trusts have regard
to the constitution? They would have to ensure that they take account
of or have regard to the document when they make decisions, to ensure
that such decisions do not contradict the constitution. The hon. Member
for Romsey asked whether the constitution has bite. It has bite, but
that does not mean that we have created a whole new area of legal
interventions. It has bite in the sense that when a PCT or trust makes
a decision, it must look at the document and ensure that what it is
doing is not contrary to it, unless it can give a very good reason why
not. In those circumstances, it would have to justify its
actions.</div>
<a name="09061636000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Eddisbury has asked whether the staff will be bound. They
will be bound only in this sense: if a nurse takes action in a hospital
that in some way breaches the constitution, the trust will become
liable. Will the individual become liable? No, they will not. Will the
trust be responsible for ensuring that it complies with the NHS
constitution? Yes, it will. It will have to justify any failure to
comply. The trust will become liable, but the individual will not have
a new liability as a result of the measure. That is one of the reasons
why we do not want to set everything out newly and differently in the
legislation.</div><a name="09061636000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">David
Nicholson, the chief executive of the NHS, has written to all
chairpersons and chief executives to give them advice on the types of
steps that they will need to take to ensure that they have regard to
the document. That might involve, for example, having a regular item on
the agenda of board meetings to consider how the organisation is
performing against the constitution; assessing existing policies and
activities such as annual reports, or staff or patient surveys, to
ensure that they are in line with the constitution; and looking for
opportunities to build the constitution into any policy 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>making, and checking against the constitution before publishing any new
policy or document of the trust or organisation. That is how the chief
executive suggests &#147;having regard to&#148; might be
applied.</div>
<a name="09061636000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not
therefore mean that the constitution is entirely legally
justiciable&#151;we have already gone through that point, and I will
not rehearse the argument&#151;but  it has enough bite. The
pledges represent state and departmental policy, and many of them are
underpinned by performance mechanisms, but we must not forget that
there are other important elements of the
constitution &#151;principles, values and responsibilities. I
cannot see how we can reasonably ask the NHS to abide by the values of
compassion, patients&#146; responsibilities or excellence. Requiring
the NHS to have regard to the constitution means that it must take
proper account of everything in the constitution in all that it does,
but it does not bind it to an impossible legal
duty.</div><a name="09061636000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
&#147;have regard to&#148; is a well established legal term, and I
hope that I have put my argument so that members of the Committee know
that it has an effect, but not an onerous one. It will give direction
to the NHS in future, because the NHS now has a constitution that says
what it is all about&#151;a framework document, as I have described
it. However, it will not produce a whole series of legal interventions,
which we seek to
avoid.</div><a name="09061636000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that I have dealt with most of the points raised by the hon.
Member for Eddisbury. He asked about other organisations. If an
organisation is not part of the health service, it is not bound by the
constitution. However, if an organisation provides a service for the
NHS, it will need to have regard to the NHS constitution. An outside
body that provides a service not framed by the NHS constitution is,
obviously, outside it. If an organisation provides paper to the NHS,
for instance, there is a limit to the extent to which it needs to have
regard to the constitution, but if it provides a medical facility, it
will need to have regard to it.</div>
<a name="09061636000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000407"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09061636000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000408"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Let me just clarify this issue, because the hon.
Gentleman asked about NHS functions and what they are. Then I will give
way.</div><a name="09061636000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Neither
foundation trusts nor anyone else need have regard to the constitution
when, for example, they are performing functions that are not for NHS
patients. If a private patient provides funding to the trust for their
medical treatment, the NHS constitution does not have a locus in
relation to that, because it is not an NHS service. It may be provided
by an institution contracted to the NHS, but it is not therefore part
of the NHS constitution. We only have a locus as far as NHS services
are concerned.</div>
<a name="09061636000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
applies to ambulances, hospices or any other organisation providing a
service that is of itself outside the remit of the NHS. They may assist
the NHS voluntarily, and they may choose of their own volition to have
regard to the NHS constitution in how they do so, but they are not
legally obliged to, unless they have entered into a contract obliging
them to do so.</div>
<a name="09061636000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000409"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, and I will
not stray into what might be the winding-up remarks on this group of
amendments. It is interesting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>that air ambulances, hospices and indeed suppliers generally, which are
not NHS bodies&#151;if they do not carry out NHS functions, they are
part of the NHS supply chain&#151;will not be covered. It is
potentially problematic, but I suspect that I will have to leave
foundation trusts and the treatment of private patients to my hon.
Friend the Member for Hemel
Hempstead.</div><a name="09061636000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well, under the top-up fee arrangement announced by the
Minister&#146;s predecessors, it may or may not be
necessary&#151;we are not sure yet&#151;for people to receive
non-NHS top-up treatment off NHS premises while the rest of their
treatment takes place on site. Either there will be a difficulty with
examples that need to be thought through and have not been, or the
Minister feels confident that the measures will not bite. If he is
relying on the flow-through to be effectively in the procurement
process, under contract, it strikes me that we will need not only a
series of guidelines but an explicit recognition that if patients are
to benefit from the rights given by an NHS constitution, there will
have to be a whole series of new protocols for anybody who interacts
with the NHS who is neither delivering an NHS function themselves nor
an NHS body. That will have to carry through via contract, and the only
enforcement will be through the privative contract rules, so it will
happen on the usual contractual basis.</div>
<a name="09061636000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
useful interaction, but I hope that by using those terms, I have made
the Minister aware of my concern that the intent behind the
constitution does not necessarily capture all those who need to have
regard to it or what that might mean in
practice.</div><a name="09061636000228"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000410"></a>Mr.
Mike O&#146;Brien:</b> I fear that the hon. Gentleman is
straying into an area of law that would apply if the proposals were
enshrined in statute in the way in which he wants them to be, but that
will not necessarily apply to the extent that he suggests as a result
of how we have chosen to do things. We are able to have regard to the
constitution, which is not enshrined in the Bill. As I have already
said, providing that a trust can show that it is working in the spirit
of the NHS, there may be reasons why it will take the view that it is
not held in a straitjacket by the constitution. It may wish, for good
reason, to deviate from
it.</div><a name="09061636000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is the case that we say that NHS provision&#151;funding&#151;should
be only for the benefit of NHS patients. However, it is also the case
that the objective of the provision is to benefit NHS patients. If
something would occur because of a restrictive application of the law
that would not benefit the patient, the trust may well have good reason
for taking a decision that it will do what is proposed none the less.
For example, provision of a drug that might be partially funded by a
top-up could be provided on NHS premises&#151;to use the example that
the hon. Gentleman gave&#151;because it is for the benefit of the NHS
patient. It is primarily funded by the NHS, but it is topped up
privately.</div><a name="09061636000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
it the case that that drug cannot be provided on NHS premises? A trust
may take the view that, if it were in the statute, it might well become
a justiciable issue, but because it is not in the statute, the trust
can take a view, providing that it can justify it, that it will be able
to deliver the drug in an appropriate way for the benefit of its
patient, who is an NHS patient, in premises that are owned by the NHS,
even though there may be some contribution from the
patient.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000411"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> Will the Minister be kind enough to clarify the
position of one provider, the air ambulance service? That is funded in
myriad different ways throughout the country, but in many areas it is
partially funded by the NHS&#151;it is commissioned by the PCT or the
ambulance trust&#151;although the helicopter and pilot are almost
certainly provided by a charitable organisation or private benefactor.
The paramedics and the major trauma surgeons and so on who are on the
helicopter, which provides such a vital service, are paid for, or
possibly employed, by the NHS. This is an anomaly: are those people in
or out? The ambulance trust may well be providing funding and the
helicopter will almost certainly be from a charity. It is private
provision, partially funded by the NHS. Where does it fit inside the
constitution?</div><a name="09061636000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000412"></a>Mr.
O&#146;Brien:</b> Again, we are brought back to the problem
that would arise if we did what the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues
want to do, rather than the problem that we face. We just do not face
that problem and I shall explain why. As the hon. Member for Eddisbury
has said, if all this was in the Bill, privity of contract would be the
only basis on which rights and obligations would arise. Actually, the
provision is declaratory. Any obligations that currently exist will
continue to exist. As far as we are concerned, we are not in any
straitjacket as a result of this legislative provision. In the way in
which we have chosen to do it, it merely sets out what is currently
legally enforceable. However, it may be referred to&#151;had regard
to&#151;in a court
case.</div><a name="09061636000258"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">We
do not have the problems that would arise if we did what those on the
Opposition Front Bench propose and stuck the measure in the Bill,
because in those circumstances real legal rights could arise. Questions
would arise about the meaning of words. In a very detailed way, lawyers
would be able to take a whole series of points. Privity of contract
would be the basis on which things would arise, because it would all be
legally
hidebound.</div><a name="09061636000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09061636000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the air ambulance, a whole series of questions would arise about
what exactly its legal position was, but, because we have chosen to do
it in this particular way, all those problems are voided. It is
possible that at some stage they might be referred to, but there is no
new cause of action that could possibly arise with regard to the air
ambulance service that would not arise now. The constitution will not
create a new problem for that service. It will not create an anomaly in
relation to staff employed by the NHS or the air ambulance service. Any
anomaly that might exist exists now. It does not create a new one. But
if we do what the hon. Gentleman advocates and stick it in the Bill,
who knows what would arise? We would have a whole new area of law and
all sorts of new questions could arise as to exactly what would happen
in relation to issues such as the air ambulance
service.</div><a name="09061636000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
how does the NHS constitution apply to the air ambulance service? Only
in the sense that if a trust employs a member of staff, that member of
staff is constrained by the obligations that the trust has, because
they are an employee. But where a service is commissioned by a
PCT&#151;for example, if it commissions the air ambulance
service&#151;the PCT has to have regard to the constitution. In
addition, any body contracted to provide an NHS service, such as an air
ambulance, would then be in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>position where it has to have regard in respect of those NHS services,
but not in respect of any other, say, charitable function that it might
perform.</div><a name="09061636000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as we are concerned, there is not a problem for the air ambulance
service other than any issues that it might currently have. However, I
do not know what problems would arise if we were to do what the hon.
Gentleman proposes; no one knows. His approach would create a whole new
legal basis.</div>
<a name="09061636000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000413"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The mention of the air ambulance service raises
another, slightly unusual, question, because that service often makes
use of the British Association for Immediate Care doctors. Those
doctors do not have a contract with the air ambulances as such. They
usually work in another part of the health system during the day and
they provide the BASICS services as volunteers. It is not a service
that is commissioned. BASICS doctors and paramedics provide services in
a voluntary capacity, and so will not be covered by the responsibility
of staff, because, in this context, they are not staff. I am sure that
people would be very glad of the attention of a BASICS doctor, so this
issue may not arise, but where does that voluntary area fit into the
picture, because the service is not commissioned and the doctors are
not
staff?</div><a name="09061636000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000414"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> In exactly the same way as it does now. There is
no significant change in the way the service is provided as a result of
the constitution coming into play. It does not substantially alter the
position of the staff who are employed by the trust. Those who are in a
voluntary capacity, however, are in a different position. Are they
entirely voluntary? Are they acting to some extent in a situation where
they hold themselves out as people trained by the trust, by the NHS, as
having certain capabilities to perform a medical function? And
therefore does the NHS have liabilities? It might well have, and those
liabilities arise now. But there will not be any new and significant
liabilities arising as a result of the NHS
constitution.</div><a name="09061636000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty in dealing with questions regarding the air ambulance
service&#151;it is a good, but also difficult and therefore bad, way
of trying to delineate the obligations&#151;is that it operates
across the country in a multiplicity of ways. Some air ambulances
operate in ways that are entirely charitable; others are under
contract. It is not possible to cover all the areas for the air
ambulance service in one brief paragraph, as the service depends on
particular circumstances in each locality. However, where a liability
currently arises, it will continue to arise. In the future, when the
constitution is in play, it should not bring about a new cause of
action that does not currently exist. Will it create any new problems?
It should not create any new problems for the air ambulance service at
all. However if, in legal terms, an air ambulance service has a
contract, then it may well have to have regard to the constitution, but
only when it makes any decisions in relation to the performance of the
NHS parts of that contract, not in relation to its charitable
functions.</div><a name="09061636000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000415"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> This area is very important. In a previous
incarnation as a full-time fireman, I went to major traumas, not least
on the M25. In those days, we sorely lacked the major trauma skills
that people such as BASICS provide. There is no issue where an
organisation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>or an individual, such as BASICS or the air ambulance service, has a
contract, because it has been commissioned and that is fine. However,
if it is working in an unpaid, voluntary capacity on behalf of the
NHS&#151;without a contract, but providing a service&#151;does it
have to abide by the constitution, or is it outside the constitution? I
know that that is very technical, but it is very important to the
volunteers who provide this service around the
country.</div><a name="09061636000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
moment ago, the Minister said that some air ambulance services are
employed and some are not. London is a good example, where the
helicopter is provided by a third party, but the London ambulance
service provides the specialist technicians on the helicopter. So, we
have different services. Where people are volunteering for the NHS, but
are not physically employed by it or contracted to it, do they have to
abide by the
constitution?</div><a name="09061636000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000416"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> In a sense, the hon. Gentleman makes my
point&#151;there are a multiplicity of different arrangements that
exist in regard to the NHS and the ambulance service. The real
questions that a volunteer, or someone else, is likely to ask are: is
the constitution going to put me at more risk; will it put me under
obligations that I was not previously under; and will it create an
ability for me to be brought before a court, which I was not previously
subject to? The answer is that there is no new obligation and no new
cause of action that will arise as a result of this. Therefore, the
volunteers, or others, in whatever arrangements they are in, need not
feel that the constitution puts them in a more vulnerable position,
because it does not. If they are acting in an entirely voluntary way
and there is no contract, then they do not have to have regard to
anything they do not have to regard to now. They may choose, as an
organisation dealing with the NHS, to have regard to it, but that would
be
voluntary.</div><a name="09061636000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000417"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> With that in mind, would there be an obligation
on behalf of those commissioning the voluntary work to require that
organisation to abide by the
constitution?</div><a name="09061636000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000418"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> That would be the case only in the provision of
NHS services. A trust or PCT entering into a contract with any
commercial or charitable organisation would have to consider the extent
to which the patient could secure the protections that they were due
under the constitution. If the trust or PCT felt that that was the
appropriate way to ensure that the patient got what they were entitled
to, they could make particular reference to the
constitution, which would be a decision for them.</div>
<a name="09061636000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will such an
arrangement produce a problem that does not exist now if the person is
a volunteer, an air ambulance service or a charity? No. The person may
be subject to legal liabilities. Will that change? No. Will the
circumstances of the trust that enters into a contract with that person
or that accepts services from them change? There will be no new cause
of action, but the trust must have regard to the constitution in
entering into any agreements.</div>
<a name="09061636000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are not
careful, we can end up counting the number of angels dancing on a
pinhead. Let us try to avoid that by saying that we can provide the
reassurance that the air ambulance service and charitable organisations
need in terms of practicalities. At the same time, we can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>ensure that the patients get the reassurance that they need that the
constitution has some bite, some importance and some relevance and that
it puts some obligation on the various NHS organisations, because those
organisations must have regard to
it.</div>
<a name="09061636000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061636000419"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, who has
tried to explore the issue at some length. He is right that we need to
be careful not to end up counting angels dancing on a
pinhead.</div><a name="09061636000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is less to do with an anxiety about what &#147;have regard
to&#148; means in terms of the everyday life of somebody involved in
providing NHS services, although I fully followed everything that the
Minister said about that and shared his analysis. Of course, these
issues have an impact on whether people feel safe to volunteer their
effort and confident that they will to not be tripped up by something
that is additional to what they face
today.</div><a name="09061636000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my constituency, there is a phenomenal and long-running controversy
about community first responders, who have been providing an
outstanding service to constituents, particularly in rural south
Cheshire, because we have abominable problems with the performance of
the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust. That is partly because it
is quite tricky to service an area from Carlisle to Crewe&#151;the
area is far too remote, and everything is run from Bootle. It is
inevitable that there will be considerable concerns about the way in
which the proposals could impact on volunteers, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Hemel Hempstead highlighted my example of the air ambulance.
Hospices are also obviously an important point.</div>
<a name="09061636000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has prayed in aid the CQC, which was established last year, and the
Health Act 2006. He says that we should have regard to them, but they
are both cases where there are more specific issues to have regard to.
A judge may well say, &#147;I&#146;m not going to create any new
causes of action,&#148; unless he is Lord Denning, who happened to
admit me as a solicitor. However, most judges will not create new law,
and that is well understood.</div>
<a name="09061636000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real
problem is that there will be an increase in accountability and,
therefore, I fear, in bureaucracy, as bodies demonstrate that they have
had regard to the constitution. That concerns me, because it will mean
that there will be an audit trail as people defend their position. If
that reads over to volunteers, it will change the nature of their
activity.</div><a name="09061636000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept the Minister&#146;s assurance that we are unlikely to create
any new forms of liability. The situation is like an overlapping Venn
diagram. At the same time, however, there may be an increase in
bureaucracy because, as with all these things, we will end up with an
audit trail, as people seek to demonstrate that they have had regard to
the constitution in all their practical applications.</div>
<a name="09061636000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having had a
full explanation, and fully admitting, as I did at the outset, that the
words &#147;abide by&#148; are no more felicitous than the words
&#147;have regard to&#148;, let me say that the important point is
the intent of the words as used and what lies behind them. On that
basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09061636000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
