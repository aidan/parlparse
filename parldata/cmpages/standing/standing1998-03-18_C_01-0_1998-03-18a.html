<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local and other public authority contracts: restriction of duty to disregard non-commercial matters</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King </B>(Bethnal Green and Bow): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 5, leave out from beginning to end of line 8 on page 2 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". (1) The Local Government Act 1988 is amended as follows.
<P>
(2) In section 17(9) (provisions to which duty to exclude non-commercial considerations in relation to public authority contracts is subject) after the word "below" there is inserted `and orders under section 19(1) below'.
<P>
(3) For section 19(1) to (3) (power to add to matters which are non-commercial matters for the purposes of section 17) there is substituted 
<P>
`(1) The Secretary of State may, by order made by statutory instrument, provide for matters specified in the order to cease to be, or to be, non-commercial matters for the purposes of section 17 above or for the purposes of that section as it applies for particular purposes.
<P>
(2) An order under subsection (1) above may, in particular, provide for a matter specified in the order to cease to be, or to be, a non-commercial matter for the purposes of section 17 above as it applies in relation to public authorities, functions or contracts of a specified description or specified public authorities, functions or contracts.
<P>
(2A) No provision shall be made under subsection (1) above for a matter to be a non-commercial matter unless the matter appears to the Secretary of State to be irrelevant to the commercial purposes of public supply or works contracts of any description.
<P>
(2B) An order under subsection (1) above may make provision for the same purposes as section 17(6) and (7) above in relation to a matter which is to be a non-commercial matter by virtue of the order.
<P>
(3) An order under subsection (1) above may 
<P>
(a) make different provision for different cases or descriptions of case (including different provision for different areas),
<P>
(b) include such supplementary, incidental, consequential or transitional provisions as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient (including provisions amending, repealing or otherwise modifying any provision of this Part).'
<P>
(4) After section 19(4) there is inserted 
<P>
`(4A) If, apart from this subsection, an order under subsection (1) above would be treated for the purposes of the standing orders of either House of Parliament as a hybrid instrument, it shall proceed in that House as if it were not such an instrument.'
<P>
(5) After section 19(9) there is inserted 
<P>
`(9A) A public authority, in exercising any function whose exercise is affected by an order under subsection (1) above, shall have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State in relation to the exercise of the function.'.".<P>

<P>
The Bill relates substantially to securing high-quality public services. My deliberations on the matter were influenced significantly by the joint opinion of the private sector, local government and the trade unions. I wish first to acknowledge the remarkable amount of constructive dialogue that has been brought to the debate by the social partners. It centres on finding a new way forward, new politics and a new employment agenda that are based on a co-operative relationship between the private and public sectors.
<P>
The turf warfare of the 1980s has come to an end. It was not good for employees or business. I am delighted that we can now work together and pave the way for best value. The Bill represents an interim measure, one called for by the Confederation of British Industry, private contractors' associations, the trade unions and local government. A wide spectrum of problems has been identified with the current compulsory competitive tendering regime. Although consensus for change is clear, any changes must comply with the social partners' agreed criteria of being clear and workable, but not a barrier to business.
<P>
The Bill is an enabling measure. It amends on an interim basis part II of the Local Government Act 1988. It will permit the Secretary of State, where necessary, to allow local authorities to take proper account of quality, equality and work force matters in the tendering process. It represents a new, sensible approach to public procurement, which is based on the politics of partnership. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the Committee for their huge support. I am particularly grateful to the Government for having accepted the thrust of the Bill and for suggesting such a sensible amendment, which will allow us to move forward to the next stage.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) on presenting the Bill. It concerns an issue that has been much discussed among the social partners long before they got together to see how they could move things on practically. It is an issue about which people have been concerned and the Government have been happy to co-operate to ensure that the Bill is a measure that we can support and one that can enable the social partners to work together to form a consensus on how to proceed.
<P>
The amendment would not affect the purpose of the Bill, which is to enable the Secretary of State to specify by order matters that would cease to be non-commercial matters for the purposes of section 17 of the Local Government Act 1988. It would make the proposed new powers sit more easily with the provisions of that Act. That will be done by placing the amendment at section 19 of the Act, where there is already provision for the Secretary of State to add to the categories of non-commercial matters. I am therefore happy to support the amendment.
<P>
The Bill is a timely and welcome contribution to the Government's work in updating the statutory framework within which local government has to operate. Part II of the Local Government Act 1988 was intended to prevent local authorities from introducing political or other irrelevant considerations into the contractual process. Few could argue with the intent, but the practice has often strained good tendering procedures rather than eased them. The Government believe that value for money in procurement should always be the paramount consideration, but best procurement practice has moved on since the 1980s. We want to ensure that local authorities can work with the best of the private sector, but some have argued that part II of the 1988 Act is an obstacle to that.
<P>
The Government are embarking on a radical programme of reform. We recently published our proposals on best value, and I assure the Committee that we shall use the Bill's provisions in the furtherance of best value. If, through the best-value review process, local authorities succeed in interesting others in alternative ways of providing services, they may seek to provide services on a partnership basis.
<P>
Part II of the 1988 Act is sometimes seen as an obstacle to achieving more effective collaboration between local authorities and the private sector. If a consensus emerges on how part II of the 1988 Act might be changed to facilitate better working arrangements, we would consider it. If the case on best value was made by the pilot authorities, there might be merit in relaxing the provisions of part II to assist us in deciding what might be the ultimate best-value framework.
<P>
Representatives of the private sector, local government and trade unions have been working together to secure a consensus on what needs to be done. It is an important way of moving forward, which the Government are seeking to develop in many areas. It is sensible to enable changes to be made to legislation once agreement is reached on the way forward. We would wish to build on consensus when proceeding with draft orders made under section 19 of the 1988 Act as it would be amended by the Bill. Indeed, we shall not propose such orders unless and until we are sure that the key players are agreed on what needs to be done and that the proposed changes will promote an efficient and effective tendering process.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Margaret Ewing </B>(Moray): I had not intended to speak, but as I am the only Member on the Opposition Benches, I feel that I should comment.
<P>
I welcome the Bill because of the flexibility that it would achieve. We all see the problems that our localauthorities sometimes face in providing facilities. The Bill will be a good enabling factor. For instance, Moray has been complimented on the fact that it has involved in child care both the private sector and the voluntary sector. We are all looking at that particular phase of development in the provision and delivery of services in our own areas.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow on her Bill and for the very positive way in which it was moved. I feel sure that the whole Committee will accept it.
<P>
