							<b class="B">Mrs.
Jacqui Lait</b> (Beckenham) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Illsley, would it be in order to ask the
Government when we can expect to see the consultation
on the draft regulations on the community infrastructure levy? I
understand the need to press on so that we can spend as much time on
the measures as they deserve, but until we have seen the draft
consultation it will be difficult to debate the clauses in any depth
and with any knowledge of how the bodies concerned will be affected and
what their reaction will be. May I also ask when we can expect to see
the clauses relating to the powers of the Welsh Assembly?</div>
					<a name="08012280000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome you back to the
Chair, Mr. Illsley, and hope that you are not as croaky as
you sound and are not suffering too much from the bug that many people
have.</div>
					<a name="08012280000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000419"></a>The

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000420"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (John Healey):
						</b> On a point of
information, we propose to publish, as we have signalled, a
consultation document that will flesh out that issue in more detail and
help the Committee in its consideration of the details of the community
infrastructure levy when we get to that point in the proceedings. That
consultation will look  at how we propose to develop the
community infrastructure levy, but not at the draft regulations
requested by the hon. Lady, which will clearly come later. I will
ensure that that is published in good time so that members of the
Committee can consider it alongside any amendments which they might
wish to propose when we come to that part of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012280000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation to matters
affecting the powers of the Welsh Assembly Government, the hon. Lady
will already have heard me say that that relates to a later stage in
the Bill. She will have heard me give an undertaking that any
Government amendments will be tabled within the conventional
times for the Committee. I will endeavour to do better than that, and
aim to ensure that any Government amendments are tabled a week in
advance of the likely proceedings. Clearly, that will depend on the
progress that we make in Committee, but I hope that that is helpful to
the hon. Lady and to members of the
Committee.</div>

						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. The
Minister referred again to the devolution of powers to the Welsh
Assembly Government, but I am perturbed that, as I understood the
briefing held by the Wales Office some three weeks ago, we are also
talking about the devolution of legislative competence to the Welsh
Assembly, which is rather more significant. Will the Minister please
explain whether the Government still intend to include devolutionary
powers in the
Bill?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000427"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> That mistake is easily undertaken,
Mr. Illsley. My hon. Friend the Minister for Local
Government has carried the whole Government burden for this Bill so
far, with assistance from our right hon. and hon. Friends, so I am
pleased to be able to assist him today. It is a pleasure to see you
presiding over the Committee this morning, Mr. Illsley, and
I am sorry that you do not sound in the best of health. I have not yet
had the opportunity to welcome you and am happy to take the chance to
do so now. I hope that you will allow me a little licence to make some
general opening remarks in moving the amendment, as there are some
similarities between its drafting and that of a number of the other
Government amendments relating to clause 13.</div>
					<a name="08012280000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause lists the type of
projects that we consider to be of national significance, subject to
the thresholds in clauses 14 to 26. Many of those replicate the
thresholds already in existing legislation. It is important to make it
clear, therefore, that the majority of projects that we define as
nationally significant are those which have already been decided by
Ministers. We have taken decision making away from local authorities
only in the small number of cases in which there is a strong case. In
most cases, given the national significance, we would have expected to
call those in anyway. For instance, as the UK&#146;s indigenous gas
supplies decline and we become increasingly dependent on imports, gas
infrastructure will become much more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>important to the security of our national energy supply. Failing to
modernise that infrastructure in a timely fashion might mean that we do
not have enough capacity to meet our energy
demands.</div>
					<a name="08012280000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
however, we are also exploring options for devolving decision making in
relation to transport schemes that fall under the thresholds in the
Bill, such as local highway and local light rail schemes. The
Department for Transport will be discussing that with the Local
Government Association and other stakeholders over the coming months,
with the aim of identifying possible options for implementation. The
Government remain committed, as set out in &#147;Strong
and Prosperous Communities&#151;The Local
Government White Paper&#148;, to ensuring that decision making is at
as local a level as possible, so that it can fully reflect local
circumstances and
needs.</div>
					<a name="08012280000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes in
amendment No. 96 and the other Government amendments have come about
for three main reasons. First, they have come about as a result of
consultation responses to the planning White Paper. As members of the
Committee are aware, over 30,000 responses were received, and it has
therefore taken time to fully digest all the comments. Some of
the amendments, such as that on including an air freight threshold in
clause 19, are in direct response to that process.</div>
					<a name="08012280000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the changes have come
about because we are bringing together elements of legislation within
13 different Acts from the past 40 years. Due to the nature of creating
a single consent regime, it has taken us time to iron out the precise
terminology that must be used to ensure the correct legal
framework for the infrastructure planning commission to operate and to
ensure
consistency.</div>
					<a name="08012280000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
the changes have come about to ensure that we have captured the
necessary geographical scope. For instance, the power to add a new type
of nationally significant project needs to extend to English waters as
well as to England itself. The infrastructure essential to the
UK&#146;s response to climate change could relate to offshore
sources, and we cannot be certain that new, innovative technologies
would necessarily fall under the definitions in clause 13. It is,
therefore, a sensible precaution to ensure that new types of nationally
significant projects in English waters can be added when there is a
strong case to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08012280000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The specifics of
amendments Nos. 115, 117, 119 and 120 change the types of gas storage
project that are nationally significant infrastructure projects and
would thus fall within the remit of the IPC. The amendments add
thresholds consisting of a specified working capacity and a maximum
flow rate. The alteration of facilities is covered, as well as their
initial creation or
use.</div>
					<a name="08012280000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
96, 114, 116, 118, 121, 157 and 158 are drafting and definitional
amendments, which are needed as a result of the changes that I have
just outlined. Under the amendments, projects must satisfy one of two
thresholds to qualify for consideration by the IPC. Either the expected
working capacity should be at least 43 million standard cubic metres,
or the expected maximum flow rate should be at least 4.5 million
standard cubic metres per day. The starting point for the capacity test
was that it is roughly equivalent to 1 per cent. of the current storage
capacity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>in Great Britain, which stood at 4,366 million standard cubic metres in
April 2007. The flow rate is based on 1 per cent. of the highest day
demand in Great Britain, which was 450 million standard cubic metres on
7 January 2003. We have discussed those figures with industry, and it
is generally
supportive.</div>
					<a name="08012280000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alterations
will need to meet one of the threshold tests in their own right, either
by an expected increase to the working capacity or an expected increase
to the maximum flow rate of the facilities by the relevant threshold
amount. The tests will ensure that a range of capacity projects can be
considered by the IPC in order to make certain that the market as a
whole can provide both endurance and deliverability
benefits.</div>
					<a name="08012280000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
already have some underground gas storage, more is needed. In the face
of declining North sea production of gas, the UK will increasingly rely
on having the infrastructure to store gas close to demand so that peaks
in the system can be met. Large gas storage projects benefit the UK
because they can store more gas and therefore contribute to the
endurance of supply. That is a well-established practice in countries
that do not have an indigenous source of gas to ensure a reliable
supply during periods of high demand, such as winter. Smaller storage
capacity projects are important because of their potential to deliver
to the market more quickly as they may be located closer to
demand. I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012280000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000428"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I must apologise because we have come to the techie
bit of the Bill. If I do not understand it, I am sure that the Minister
will take great delight in ensuring that I do by the end of my remarks.
I apologise if I sound less than
expert.</div>
					<a name="08012280000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister,
quite rightly, set the range of the Government amendments in context. I
would be grateful if he answered a number of points, either as we go
through or in general because many of them bring up the same issues. A
key element that I am most interested in is the functioning of the IPC.
As we go through each point, perhaps the Minister could give an
estimate of how many proposals he expects the IPC to have to deal with.
I know that the answer to that could be, &#147;As long as a piece of
string, depending on changes in technology.&#148; I accept that, but
on the basis of current technology and what is known at the moment, it
would be useful to have some indication of the number of proposals that
he expects the IPC to consider. He said that the changes under this
group of amendments would bring forward a range of proposals.
Approximately how many will that
be?</div>
					<a name="08012280000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
concerned about the development of better regulation, a cause that the
Government maintain that they are committed to. I apologise for
returning to an issue that I have raised before, but it is to this
group of amendments that it is most apposite. There have been many
complaints that in any planning application for an infrastructure
project, the applicant has to ask for a range of different consents.
That has happened because as technology has developed over the years,
separate legislation has been created to encourage the industry, such
as the Electricity Act 1989 and the Gas Act 1995. God help me, I can
even remember the historical Pipelines Act 1962 being passed. The
Department of Trade and Industry and successive Departments have, in
essence, been responsible for the planning.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>
					<a name="08012280000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the amendments, the
Government are moving quite rightly towards legislating for all those
national-infrastructure-sized projects to come under a single regime,
and we support that. I am interested, however, in why the Government
have not taken the opportunity at the same time to repeal the
legislation as it affects national infrastructure projects because we
will potentially have parallel consent regimes. Questions could be
raised about the capacity of a scheme and whether it is a national
infrastructure project or not. I can see potential challenges in that
area. Still having the legislation in place will allow people to
challenge which consent regime a development should be operating under.
For the benefit of better regulation, why have the Government not taken
this opportunity to move the remaining powers that the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has under the various Town
and Country Planning Acts, as these industries are now
mature?</div>
					<a name="08012280000386"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="08012280000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parallel
regimes for national infrastructure and smaller projects could lead to
challenges, delays, confusion and expense, which the Government do not
want. If they are committed to better regulation, as they maintain, I
suggest that they amend the Bill to abolish the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform&#146;s control over
planning under the current regime, and move it to the appropriate
Department.</div>

Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The amendments bring applications for
liquefied natural gas and gas reception facilities within the remit of
the IPC when they are in England. Thresholds for the liquefied natural
gas facilities that are to be governed by the IPC are set at the levels
that I have already outlined for gas storage facilities&#151;that is,
that the expected working capacity is at least 43 million standard
cubic metres or the expected maximum flow rate is at least 4.5 million
standard cubic metres per day. LNG facilities could meet either one of
those thresholds; however, gas reception facilities do not store gas,
so only the maximum flow rate threshold would apply to determine when
development consent for that type of facility will be decided by the
IPC.</div>
					<a name="08012280000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a proposed
alteration to liquefied natural gas and gas reception facilities meets
the applicable threshold test in its own right, that alteration will
require development consent from the commission, which means that
proposals to improve existing infrastructure projects significantly
will also fall under the new regime.</div>
					<a name="08012280000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have already explained why
the Government believe that decisions on gas supplies should be taken
at national level. I commend the amendments to the

Fitzpatrick:
						</b> We hope that the new clause will replace
clause 18, which sets out the highways thresholds. It provides a fuller
definition of what types of highway development would fall within the
remit of the IPC to determine. It is designed to ensure that the new
regime captures the construction, improvement or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>alteration of the country&#146;s strategic road network&#151;the
network run by the Highways Agency and for which the Secretary of State
for Transport is the highway authority. Government
amendment No. 98 is consequential to that
change.</div>
					<a name="08012280000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall explain why these projects are so nationally significant and it
is so vital that the thresholds capture them. In doing so, I hope also
to address amendment No. 87, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe, which would delete trunk roads from clause 18.
I hope that in explaining what we are doing with clause 18, I will
convince him of the importance of including trunk roads within the
scope of the new regime and so persuade him not to press his amendment
to a vote.</div>
					<a name="08012280000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The network
consists of the main national network of motorways and major roads in
England which link our cities, areas of population, ports and airports.
Most motorways and some A roads are strategic roads, also referred to
as trunk roads. The proposal will maintain the current level of
national decision making, but with the IPC carrying out the role
instead of Ministers. Those roads are essential to the economy and
economic prosperity of the country. They allow people and goods to move
around the country quickly and efficiently, and it is essential that
they are kept in good condition to contribute to the safety, efficiency
and comfort of our journeys, reduce vehicle wear and tear, and minimise
costs to the
taxpayer.</div>
					<a name="08012280000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
certainly true that some of the projects that we might carry out on
this network are small, but the ability of road links and junctions to
deal with traffic flow can impose constraints across the entire length
of major roads and across the network as a whole. It is worth noting in
this context that one of the key conclusions of the Eddington study was
that investment targeted on pinch points and bottlenecks in the
strategic road network could deliver some of the highest returns for
growth. As such, it might be misleading to equate the physical size of
a project with its potential impact on the network and its potential
national significance. A single junction improvement can deliver
significant benefits across a wider area of the network.</div>
					<a name="08012280000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that hon. Members
will agree that works on our strategic road network need to be planned
and considered holistically at national level. I therefore commend
amendment No. 98 and new clause 7 to the
Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000438"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining what he
is trying to do. Does he recall the evidence by the chairman of the
Local Government Association and his concern, which we share, about the
sheer number of national infrastructure plans that may go forward to
the IPC because of the definition of trunk roads? I do not for a moment
condemn anyone to slow roads. I use the A21, which is known
affectionately as the snail trail. It has been known as that for a long
time. I would be happy to have it speeded up, but I am equally
conscious that many road proposals are exceedingly contentious and
would remain so even under a national policy statement.</div>
					<a name="08012280000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the LGA that the
IPC could operate much more effectively and with fewer delays if it was
possible for local authorities to continue to maintain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>their role on trunk roads, particularly the smaller and less well used
ones. That needs to be looked at much more closely, because I know how
exasperating it is trying to get a bypass even, having been closely
involved in the consultation on the A259 and knowing how the National
Trust frustrated that particular improvement to the road
system.</div>
					<a name="08012280000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any road will
be contentious. The national policy statement on roads will be
contentious. It will take an enormous length of time, and
pre-application inquiries and pre-inquiry hearings could reduce some of
the time taken to develop those road schemes. I cannot understand why
the definition of a trunk road is drawn so widely. If it does clog up
the IPC, as one suspects it might, the argument for speed
disappears.</div>
					<a name="08012280000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise if the Minister has explained why footpaths are included. I
understand that there is a valid reason for it, but most people have
looked at that measure with a degree of scepticism and horror. It would
be appreciated if he could explain that in more detail.</div>
					<a name="08012280000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also ask the Minister
about the implications for cross-border roads, because the measure
refers specifically to England? Thinking of Scotland in particular, the
M6 leads into the M74. If they do not link up and miss by a yard or a
metre, we have a small problem. What proposals are there to ensure that
the Scottish body politic, in all its variety, is properly consulted to
ensure that any cross-border roads that are regarded as trunk roads or
motorways can progress more speedily? I should be grateful for answers
to those
questions.</div>
					<a name="08012280000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012280000439"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe)
(Lab): Following on from hon. Lady&#146;s comments, two
issues still concern me. I recognise that the Government are trying to
be helpful in filing down to some extent those roads that will be dealt
with by the new IPC process and those that will go through the existing
planning process. My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the discussions
to be held with the LGA about that. It would help to know the scope of
those negotiations and when we might hear their
results.</div>
					<a name="08012280000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Lady said, one of the issues that emerged from our hearings was the
view of the LGA. It thought that the applications to be dealt with by
the IPC should be in single figures. The difference between its
understanding of what the figures might be and the Minister&#146;s
understanding are probably almost totally down to the inclusion of
trunk roads in that process. Has my hon. Friend any idea of the
percentage of applications that the IPC will handle in a year which
will fall under the definition set out in new clause
7?</div>
					<a name="08012280000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, there are
proposals to improve, expand and develop trunk roads where the impact
is limited to a particular area. Where the impact is pretty
substantial, it can affect the rest of the transport arrangements for
that area. The new integrated transport authority for the area and the
local council may have major concerns about how those proposals link to
other transport proposals, regeneration schemes and so on in the area,
although the proposals may have a very limited impact in terms of
national consequences for the road network between our towns and
cities. Where there was a proposal to improve a trunk road which had
just local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>consequences, would that still have to go through the IPC, or could it
be dealt with by the existing planning
processes?</div>

						<a name="08012280000440"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): I support what the hon.
Gentleman and my hon. Friend said. The LGA made a very good point when
it said:</div>
					<a name="08012280000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Groups of councils
working together would also be best placed to make decisions about the
infrastructure needed to support and grow their economies&#151;in
keeping with the spirit of the Government&#146;s sub-national
review.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012280000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">How does the
Minister feel that this matter dovetails with those concerns? Coming
from Newbury, perhaps I know better than anyone how local roads have to
fit in with roads of national strategic importance. There is much
concern in local government about the potential loss of control when
local roads connect with important national strategic
routes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000441"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I want to echo my hon. Friends&#146; points. In
particular, I want to raise the question of cross-border roads.
Government new clause 7 relates entirely to highways in England.
Cross-border issues, cross-border public services and cross-border
roads are matters of significant interest in my part of the world. The
current improvement of the link between the A5117 and the M56 has
engaged politicians on both sides of the border for many years. The
concern is that while the proposals aim to streamline and speed up the
process of consents, there is silence on cross-border routes. Will the
Minister explain what regime will apply for important cross-border
routes and new road schemes, particularly in
Wales?</div>
					<a name="08012280000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000442"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I will respond to the questions raised by
Opposition Members collectively because they are similar. There are
also some similarities with my hon. Friend&#146;s points.</div>
					<a name="08012280000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not giving the IPC the
ability to make decisions on local authority trunk roads, only on those
roads for which the Secretary of State is the highway authority. We
have worked out the case loads and they are outlined in the impact
assessment. We will resource the IPC appropriately and have no reason
to deviate from the case
estimates.</div>
					<a name="08012280000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
cross-border roads, roads and rail are devolved matters in Scotland and
that will continue. As with other similar matters, we will consult
carefully with the devolved Administrations to ensure that motorways
join up at the right places, as described by the hon.
Lady.</div>
					<a name="08012280000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000443"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> It seems that the streamlining process proposed by
the Bill will not apply to cross-border routes. Is that
correct?</div>
					<a name="08012280000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000444"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> It is fair to say that in a number of areas
where there are cross-border elements, we are not deviating from the
devolution settlement. In areas where responsibility has been devolved,
that will continue. We are not confusing the situation, but maintaining
that it will continue to stand as it does at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="08012280000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000445"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> That begs the question of whether the devolved
Administrations have the same speed of decision making as the IPC will
have.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>
					<a name="08012280000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000446"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> Obviously we will be in dialogue with the
devolved Administrations. Things do not go on in Westminster, Cardiff
or Edinburgh that are not acknowledged.
Discussions will take place and arrangements will be made to ensure
that we work as effectively and creatively as possible. In general
terms, the devolution settlement has worked well. It is our contention
that by ensuring that we do not deviate from it, or tamper with it, it
will continue to work
well.</div>
					<a name="08012280000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">On local
authority trunk roads, it is our expectation that half the applications
will be under the single commissioner route because of their nature and
size. That takes me on to cycle tracks and footpaths, which were raised
by the hon. Lady. I did not mention those in my initial remarks, but we
had an informal discussion about them the last time the Committee met,
after business had closed. I understand her concerns and questions
about how that might look like a strange addition for the IPC. However,
there are instances where cycle tracks and footpaths are closely
connected to strategic road network developments and are part of the
current consent regime under which decisions are taken by the Secretary
of State. Those consents are mostly used in connection with a wider
development to a main carriageway. However, there are occasional
examples in which they are used in
isolation.</div>
					<a name="08012280000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance, the Highways Agency has started work to provide a safe means
of travel on the A38 between Dobwalls and Doublebois, which is
pronounced &#147;double boys.&#148; It is a single carriageway with
hedges and embankments close to the road. No work is being carried out
on the carriageway itself, but a new segregated footpath and cycleway
are being created. That will help to relieve congestion on the A38 and
deliver general safety benefits to cyclists and other road users. It
will also connect the industrial area of Doublebois to the town of
Liskeard for pedestrians and cyclists. For the purposes of establishing
the IPC now, we should ensure that the consent regime is not
fragmented.</div>
					<a name="08012280000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect
of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe, and of the impact of amendments on a number of
cases and the discussions with the Local Government Association, the
Government amendments would clarify the drafting to ensure that we
capture the appropriate procedures planned for in the impact
assessment. In that instance, there is no change to the numbers
estimated within the
assessment.</div>
					<a name="08012280000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In keeping
with the White Paper commitment, as my hon. Friend said and I mentioned
in my introductory remarks to the original amendments in clause 13, the
Department for Transport is investigating the potential to devolve
consent powers, under the 1980 Highways Act, to local authorities. He
asked when that will be consulted on. It will be part of the
sub-national review consultation, which is due out in mid-February. We
will have to legislate as a result of that, in due course, but those
discussions will start shortly. We will flag our intention to engage in
those matters to the LGA, which is clearly keen, as we heard from its
evidence last week.</div>
					<a name="08012280000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion and for the sake of clarification, the 25 schemes are those
currently decided by the Secretary of State, not local authorities.
Many of them are, however, likely to link up with local authority
roads.</div>

						</b> Amendments Nos. 99 and 125 change the
airports threshold to ensure that it is wide enough to capture any type
of airport development that creates additional capacity, either as a
new build or as an alteration to an existing site, by at least 10
million passengers per year, or 10,000 air transport movements per year
in relation to
freight.</div>
					<a name="08012280000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 153 and 154 are drafting amendments needed as a consequence of
amendment No. 125, which is an important change in response to the
consultation on the planning White Paper. It will ensure that the new
regime captures all those airport projects that are likely to have
nationally significant
benefits.</div>
					<a name="08012280000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
will have noted that the threshold for passenger transport has been
raised from 5 million, as given in the planning White Paper. That
reflects the responses to the White Paper, which indicated that the
proposed threshold of 5 million was inadequate. The new threshold of 10
million passengers per year captures the additional airport capacity
supported by the air transport White Paper. The new freight thresholds
reflect the differences in types of airport
development.</div>
					<a name="08012280000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
differences in sizes and types of airports, and their scope for future
development, we believe that those thresholds set a much clearer policy
on the types of airport development that constitute a nationally
significant infrastructure
project.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000450"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I welcome the changes, because they were ones that
we advocated on Second Reading to take account of air freight, and
sensible points on them were made by the British Chambers of Commerce
and the CBI. Will the Minister give us an idea of the size of an
airport that deals with 5 million passengers and that element of
freight, as I am completely non-technical on that matter? Are we
talking about an airport the size of Manchester or Luton&#151;we
cannot talk about Scottish airports because that is a matter entirely
for Scotland? Understanding what size of airport we are talking about
would give us some grasp of the issue.</div>
					<a name="08012280000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thing that is
interesting&#151;I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
comments on it&#151;is that Government amendment No. 125 defines an
alteration in subsection 19(5)(a) as &#147;a runway&#148;, which is
understandable, but in paragraph (b) it is defined as &#147;a
building&#148; and in paragraph (c) as</div>
					<a name="08012280000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a radar or radio mast, antenna,
or other apparatus at the airport.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012280000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have great difficulty understanding why
those are regarded as nationally significant if they are not already in
the planning regime. Also, &#147;a building&#148; is a possible
alteration. That might be a new freight or passenger terminal, but
could be a hut for the security men. Can we have a bit of clarification
on that?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>
					<a name="08012280000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the Minister has
at his fingertips the number of expected applications, but will there
be any increase in the number of airports that have to apply under the
change of definition? I am conscious that one of the longest and best
runways in the country is sited at what used to be RAF Manston and know
that there is some thought that the facilities there could be extended
into a more effective airport. Do the Minister and the Department have
in mind the development of an airport there or anywhere else that would
be regarded as potentially coming within those
criteria?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000451"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I am happy to supply the information that the
hon. Lady requests, certainly with regard to her first two points. The
Bill threshold infrastructure is infrastructure capable of providing
services for air passenger transport services for at least 10 million
passengers per year. To give her an idea of the scale, the terminal at
London Luton was originally designed for 5 million passengers per year
and in 2006 handled more than 9 million, as did Birmingham. Manchester
handled about 22 million passengers per year, Heathrow handled 67
million, Gatwick handled 34 million and Stansted handled 24 million. I
hope that that gives her an idea of air passenger numbers.</div>
					<a name="08012280000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give an idea of the scale of
air transport movements for cargo aircraft, that would represent
roughly a 50 per cent. increase in cargo transport at East Midlands
airport, which is the No. 1 UK cargo airport, or roughly a doubling of
the cargo traffic at Stansted, which is key for the London area. That
demonstrates that we are talking about substantial increases. With
regard to the list and the impact assessment, we are confident that we
have accurately assessed what we expect to come forward in the next 10
years. For aviation, it says that there will be one airport every 10
years, and one would imagine that if the Heathrow consultation were to
get approval and go through the appropriate planning regime, that would
be one airport that might well be within those
figures.</div>

							<a name="08012280000452"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that elucidation.
I am being rather selfish and wonder whether Biggin Hill, which does
quite a bit of freight air transport movement, could ever come within
the freight transport bounds. I suspect that the answer is probably no,
but my constituents would be delighted to hear from the
Minister.</div>

Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The hon. Lady tempts me to engage in
crystal-ball gazing by answering her question. No one is in a position
to say never, but the figures that I gave should reassure her
constituents that we are talking about a huge increase in what goes
through Biggin Hill currently. It is significant even for airports
within the present configuration, whether they are for passengers or
freight.</div>
					<a name="08012280000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
antennae on buildings, what matters is how much extra capacity the
change allows over the threshold. Those elements may have an impact on
the capacity threshold. Sometimes small changes allow very large
increases in capacity, and in respect of radar and antennae there might
be command and control facilities. It is appropriate to include them
because of the impact they may have in due
course.</div>

Fitzpatrick:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 100, 126 and 128, and
amendment No. 127 in another group, will ensure that the IPC can
consider significant alterations to a harbour as long as they increase
a harbour&#146;s capacity by the thresholds set out in clause 20.
With similar amendments to other clauses in part 3, they will make the
terminology used consistent with the rest of the Bill. It also applies
to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend,
East, which we may discuss later.</div>
					<a name="08012280000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of amendment No.
129, after careful consideration of the responses to consultation, the
Government felt that although the threshold we set is appropriate there
is a case for including an additional split threshold, given the types
of development that are proposed for harbours. The thresholds we set
for those developments are based on the potential impact that a port
facility of that size could have on the national rail and road
infrastructure, as well as its importance to the national
economy.</div>
					<a name="08012280000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
hon. Members will be aware that port developments are often mixed-mode
developments consisting of extensions or upgrades to facilities for
different types of cargo. We therefore need to ensure that applications
for development consent that seek to increase a port&#146;s ability
to handle container, ro-ro and other cargo ships fall to the IPC to
determine where together they are nationally significant.</div>
					<a name="08012280000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment introduces a
formula that specifies that if the proposed increases in capacity
divided by the relevant threshold and then added together equal one or
more, the proposed development is nationally significant. For example,
a proposed development that would create a port capable of handling 350
TEUs&#151;20-foot equivalent units&#151;from container ships,
200,000 units from ro-ro ships and 4.5 million tonnes from other cargo
ships, would clearly be a significant project but would not fall to the
commission to determine without the amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012280000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 81 and 82,
tabled by the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East, would reduce
the thresholds at which a harbour project would be considered by the
IPC and is neither necessary nor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>appropriate. In its response to the planning White Paper, the United
Kingdom Major Ports Group suggested reducing our proposed thresholds as
suggested by the hon. Gentleman, but the thresholds set out in clause
20&#151;500,000 TEU for container ships, 250,000 units for ro-ro
ships and 5 million tonnes for other cargo&#151;were based on careful
analysis of recent port applications and their potential
impact.</div>
					<a name="08012280000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the
recent major applications have been for container ships&#151;for
example, that of London Gateway for 3.5 million TEU, Felixstowe South
for 1.65 million, Bathside for 1.5 million and Teesport for 1.5 million
are all well above the 500,000 TEU threshold. Other significant harbour
developments, such as Bristol, are also expected to be above that
threshold. To give some idea of context, 500,000 TEU equates to about
300,000 heavy goods vehicle movements per annum in and out. In relation
to ro-ro ships, 250,000 units equates to roughly the same number of HGV
movements. Given that a development of that scale almost anywhere is
likely to raise significant issues of road and/or rail capacity, we
believe that this is the right level at which a harbour project
should be considered nationally significant. I therefore commend
Government amendments Nos. 100 and 126 to 129 to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012280000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000457"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am grateful to the Committee for allowing me to
speak to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Rochford and Southend, East. I do not know whether hon. Members know
that he is celebrating the birth of a son and has taken paternity
leave. I am sure that they would all wish to join me in sending
him and his wife our congratulations, but it means that I have had to
pick up yet another techie subject.</div>
					<a name="08012280000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the Minister
for his explanation on harbours. We had some very convincing evidence
from the ports and harbours associations and Associated British Ports
on the need for change in what is seen as a nationally significant
project. I was glad to see that the Minister had picked up my hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment to remove the extension to ports. As we are
all aware, there has not been, and is not expected to be, a huge rush
of applications for new ports of national significance. However, we
remain a trading nation. The Prime Minister has been in China and India
trying to drum up further trade. Nobody would argue with that. We
therefore need efficient and effective ports that can handle
the most advanced types of ships and containers of whatever sort so
that our trade can be dealt with efficiently and
effectively.</div>
					<a name="08012280000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The major
concern that remains is the need to reduce the threshold sizes for
facilities for container ships and ro-ro ships in new ports.
The Government&#146;s amendments do not really address that, whereas
my hon. Friend&#146;s amendments are designed to facilitate that
reduction in threshold sizes. We must do what we can to facilitate our
ports and harbours, and I would be grateful if the Minister could have
another think about that and perhaps have a further discussion with the
ports and harbours associations to see whether some sensible compromise
could be worked
out.</div>
					<a name="08012280000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 129 includes a formula for where a port handles more than
one ship. Again, Associated British Ports comment that the proposed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>development could, in theory, be for containers plus ro-ro, in which
case it might do some good. However, I would expect most such
developments to be either containers or ro-ro, so the effect is likely
to be very limited. It is not a substitute for addressing the threshold
issue. I should be grateful if the Minister could undertake to have
some further discussions on that.</div>
					<a name="08012280000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return briefly to the
Scottish issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West will tell me
whether Wales is affected in the same way. I am very conscious of the
fact that this measure applies only to England and Wales, yet we are
talking about infrastructure ports that are adjacent to England and
Wales and waters that are adjacent to England and Wales. While there
are clear definitions for territorial waters, I am sure that the
Minister will know that there has long been a huge dispute about
whether Scotland&#146;s oil is Scotland&#146;s oil. Much of that
argument depends on the definition of a territorial
water.</div>
					<a name="08012280000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I am sure
that the Minister will assure me that he has no intention of disturbing
the devolution settlement, he may have noticed that there has been a
change of Government in Edinburgh, and a Sewell motion may not perhaps
be the solution to any discussions about reports on harbour facilities
adjacent to Scotland. If he would clarify and reassure us that there
will not be a major constitutional issue over the development of ports
and harbours on the Scottish-English border, I, for one, would be very
grateful.</div>

							<a name="08012280000458"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> On behalf of the whole Committee, I am
grateful that the hon. Lady has shared the good news of the hon. Member
for Rochford and Southend, East with us. I cannot imagine that anyone
in the room would not rather be supping champagne with him now than
working in Committee. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Sorry, Mr.
Illsley, I got that the wrong way around. Having said that, I am sure
that the hon. Lady will convey to the hon. Member for Rochford and
Southend, East all our very best
wishes.</div>
					<a name="08012280000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">By asking me
whether I can assure her that there will not be any constitutional
dispute between London and Edinburgh, the hon. Lady again tempts me to
engage in crystal ball-gazing. I am grateful that she said that the
Scottish oil question had not passed me by in the past 30 years, which
demonstrates a generosity of spirit for which she is famous. I know
that it is a bit of a mantra, or it certainly will appear to be by the
end of parts 3 and 4, but we are not doing anything to unsettle the
devolution arrangements as they apply at the moment. In this instance,
that is why there is a distinction between England, Wales and
Scotland.</div>
					<a name="08012280000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s substantive point was about the evidence given by the UK
Major Ports Group and Associated British Ports. Both are organisations
for which we have high regard, and we listened carefully to what they
had to say about the thresholds. However, the analysis and modelling
done by the Department for Transport indicate that we have set the
appropriate thresholds. Were such important organisations to come
forward with more hard evidence, we would never refuse to listen to
them. We are confident, however, that the assessments that we have made
and the thresholds that we have set are appropriate, so I would not
want to give the hon. Lady false hope that we are likely to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>change them. I have discussed the matter with officials outside the
Committee to ensure that we have double-checked our figures. We are
confident that they are absolutely
accurate.</div>

							<a name="08012280000459"></a>Mrs.

agreed those
figures?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000460"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I think that it was clear from their evidence
that they were suggesting a different figure. They did not, however,
furnish evidence, other than that their judgment and assessment was
that their figure would be better. I understand that, given that they
represent the industry. The industry would want to see as many ports as
possible come within the scope of the IPC, because it agrees that it
will be a better arrangement and will make life simpler. Equally, there
is a balance to strike. Much of the previous discussion with my hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe and the Local Government
Association concerned the fact that we do not want unnecessarily to
take responsibility for planning decisions away from local authorities
where it is appropriate for them to have
it.</div>
					<a name="08012280000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under later
clauses in the Bill, there are powers to come back to the matter and
make alterations in future when times have changed and different
factors apply. At this point in time, however, we are comfortable with
the thresholds that we have set. In respect of the discussions with
both the UK Major Ports Group and Associated British Ports, we do not
dispute the figures. The figures are accurate, so it is a judgment
call.</div>
					<a name="08012280000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to
the hon. Lady for raising the amendments tabled in the name of the
Member for Rochford and Southend, East, but I hope that with the
explanation that I have been able to furnish, she would feel able to
withdraw them on his behalf. Otherwise I would have to ask my hon.

comment that I have to make concerns whether any cross-border impact
will result. There could be issues due to the frequency of trains for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>a new or expanded interchange or the use of tracks by trains
from Scotland. It does not take much imagination to see why I am asking

the appropriate authorities. However, the amendments are relatively

previous one concerning highways. I am aware of the delays in getting
major dam and reservoir projects under way. There is one to the north
of my constituency in Oxfordshire that has taken years and years to get
under way. I will give the Minister a parallel problem. A well-known
offshore wind farm down the Thames estuary was given consent under the
Electricity Act 1989, but was delayed for many years by the local
authority not giving permission for a sub-station. What will happen
under the Bill if a major reservoir project is given the go-ahead, but
local authorities delay the project through an application to reroute
roads or footpaths or other matters that have been raised? How will the
Bill speed up the process while also involving local people, without
holding back infrastructure projects as has been the case in the past?

disapplied in response to nationally significant infrastructure
projects. The outline consultation arrangements ably articulated by my
hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government are a genuine improvement
for the local communities and the proposed time frame will
ensure that matters are dealt with more expeditiously. We are confident

					<a name="08012280000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that the hon. Member for
Copeland, who has taken a long interest in the issues of radioactive
waste and the future of the nuclear industry, is in his place.
Clearly, members of the public watching our
deliberations will have those sorts of facilities in mind, as the
provisions refer to deep storage, for example, which tends to imply
that sort of development.</div>
					<a name="08012280000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that the
Government have said publicly&#151;the Minister may correct
me&#151;that they would be interested in exploring the sort of
approach taken in other countries whereby communities volunteer, if
that is the right phrase, to explore the idea of a hazardous waste
facility in their area, particularly in relation to radioactive waste.
That approach allows the community to debate what potential benefits
might come to them as part of the investment in the local economy and
facilities.</div>
					<a name="08012280000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
by taking such a decision away and handing it over to the IPC, our
process will be different and will give far less scope for the local
community, represented by its local authority, to consider the impact
of the facility on the area, ways in which that impact could be
lessened and other benefits that might be offered to the local
community for taking that
on.</div>
					<a name="08012280000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">In part 7 we will
discuss provisions that will be included when development consent is
granted, including the possibility of causing a developer to fund other
developments in a local area consequent on that development, and I am
sure that we will explore that later. However, were that process to be
in the hands of a local authority when considering an application, it
strikes me that the local authority would very much have the needs of
that community and the history of the local situation at heart and
would therefore be better placed to argue for such benefits than the
IPC.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): Does my hon.
Friend agree with me that a local community would be much more likely
to want to help the delivery of the Government&#146;s agenda with
regard to identifying a site for nuclear waste, for instance, if it
felt that it was central to that process instead of the decision being
taken away and handed to the commission?</div>

							<a name="08012280000485"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> My hon. Friend raises an excellent point. If
such a process were to take place, the hope would be, as the Government
have discussed, that there would be a genuine engagement with that
community about what might be on offer and what the benefits might be.
He is absolutely right to say that the fact that the IPC is
considering the proposal might arouse a healthy dose of
suspicion, so that is worth consideration.</div>
					<a name="08012280000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also note that the other
amendments in the group seek to expand the definition of hazardous
waste facilities, and also look at thresholds in relation to future
development. Therefore, if permission has been granted for a facility
of a particular size, there are provisions here for it to be expanded.
Again, that would take all the cards away from the hands of the local
community because, once something has been provided for and constructed
in an area, provisions in the Bill would allow it to be extended
considerably. Local communities will be particularly concerned about
that type of facility being handled as part of that process, so I will
be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the potential
conflict between a sort of voluntary approach for local communities to
come forward and the provisions of the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="08012280000486"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I hope that the Minister will have enough of an
opportunity to explain what the amendments mean, as a number of us are
having difficulty grasping it because they appear to be so wide. On the
one hand we are talking about nuclear waste facilities and on the
other, about the transport of soil from a contaminated area, such as
the Olympic site, which would easily fall within the terms of the
proposals as I understand them. It appears to include everything in
between. If the Government could clarify whether they truly mean
everything from spoiled earth to nuclear waste, it would be very
helpful. I suspect that we will return to that because it is
worrying.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="08012280000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Environmental Services Association has said that, owing to requirements
for changes in how we deal with hazardous waste, there will be
thousands of applications in future years because we will no longer
have landfill. To take just one small exercise, I point out that East
Sussex is nearly through the system in getting full planning permission
for an incinerator at Newhaven, from which the town will get
electricity. It has taken some 10 years, because it took eight years to
get the waste management plan through the system; that is for dealing
with waste in just one county. If it takes eight years to get a local
county waste management plan through, I can just imagine how long it
will take to get a national waste management plan, and it has taken two
years to get the planning permission just for the county. That is
dealing with 236,000 tonnes of waste, which comes well
within the definition, as I understand it, of a national
infrastructure project. I cannot believe that the Government truly wish
the IPC to deal with the equivalent of one county&#146;s waste for
every planning application, so I hope very much that there will be
thorough clarification of what the Government mean by &#147;hazardous
waste&#148; here.</div>

					<a name="08012280000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need, dare I say, to
talk about the Scottish question. I notice from a piece in <i class="I">Planning
Daily</i> that the Scottish Government have come up with proposals for
six nuclear waste stores. Whether they expect those to be deep facility
waste stores is not entirely clear, but we could well find that, if
they can get their six waste facility stores, there could be an
agreement that Sellafield and deep waste storage may not be the
solution to England&#146;s problems. There is a Scottish element that
we need to address clearly on this matter. If the definition of
hazardous waste could be clarified, many of us would be reassured, and
we may not have to return to
it.</div>

alongside the Foreign Secretary to abolish that organisation. Other

					<a name="08012280000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers
will be aware that the Government have made progress on radioactive
waste management matters over the past three years, particularly on the
disposal of higher activity radioactive wastes, under the aegis of the
Committee on Radioactive Waste Management&#151;CoRWM for short. CoRWM
recently submitted a series of 15 recommendations to the Government
about the process of taking forward radioactive waste and management
safely. In their response, the Government
said:</div>
					<a name="08012280000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the UK should look
to develop partnership arrangements, linked to appropriate involvement
and benefit packages, with local authorities/communities as a means of
securing facility

said:</div>

circumstances surrounding the geological disposal of higher activity
radioactive wastes are
unique.&#148;</div>

that in mind.</div>
					<a name="08012280000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like the Minister to address a very specific question, but not
necessarily immediately. I do not assume that he has a crystal ball.
Does the definition of &#147;hazardous waste&#148; include
radioactive waste? Do the Government believe that CoRWM&#146;s
recommendations are in any way contravened by the Bill? Does he believe

<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>that the concept of volunteerism, which is the very essence and basis of
a satisfactory resolution to radioactive waste management issues, is
compromised by the Bill? Has CoRWM been consulted about the Bill? Will
the Minister give me and other interested Members assurances that the
principle of voluntarism is in no way weakened by the provisions of the
Bill, with regard to finding a policy solution to radioactive waste
management?</div>

					<a name="08012280000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the inclusion
of hazardous waste facilities in the Bill, let me reassure the hon.
Member for North Cornwall and other colleagues that we intend that the
commission will deal with hazardous waste facilities that are
nationally significant and serve the national need only. To illustrate
that, there are currently only six hazardous waste landfills and one
deep storage facility in the UK that exceed the 100,000 tonnes per
annum threshold. I hope that most hon. Members will recognise such
major facilities serve a national need and warrant consideration at
national rather than local level. Similarly, there are only two
commercially operated high temperature incinerators in the UK, both of
which exceed the 30,000 tonne per annum threshold. Both serve a
national need and I suggest that any similar treatment plant would also
do so. We have no intention of taking decision-making powers away from
local authorities, except in the most significant projects, where there
is a clear case for national decision
making.</div>

							<a name="08012280000491"></a>Tom

question.</div>
					<a name="08012280000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sort of
hazardous waste projects that the Bill will capture are of a scale and
complexity that will almost inevitably have national benefits or
impacts that go far beyond the immediate impact on local communities.
As such, it would not have been unusual for such projects to be called
in for decision by the Secretary of State in the past. In addition, as
the Minister for Local Government described in our debates on parts 1
and 2 of the Bill and as we have mentioned today, under the new system
there will be strengthened consultation requirements. Those apply at
the policy development stage in relation to national policy statements
and at the project development stage. That will be done before an
application is submitted to the IPC and at its examination. It is also
worth mentioning that because hazardous waste has the potential to
cause greater harm than other types of waste, its management is subject
to strict controls, which will apply to any projects approved by the
IPC.</div>

first deal with the points that were raised in the course of the debate
on the amendment. The point that I was trying to make is that the
management of such facilities will be subject to strict controls, which
will apply to any projects approved by the
IPC.</div>
					<a name="08012280000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 104, 141 and 142 will ensure that the IPC can consider
significant alterations to a hazardous waste facility as long as it
increases its capacity by the thresholds set out in clause
25. With similar amendments to other clauses in part
3, the measures will make the terminology consistent throughout
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012280000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend made a number of points. As set out in the planning White Paper,
the Government have been consulting on proposals relating to the
storage of higher activity radioactive wastes. The consultation closed
in November, as he said. The Government have since published a summary
of responses in which we have committed to publishing a White Paper in
the first half of the year that will set out the way forward for the
implementation of geological disposal, including of higher activity
radioactive waste. Such facilities are not included in clause 26. If we
eventually decide that radioactive waste should be dealt with by the
IPC, we would have to bring forward a statutory
instrument to have it included. That would be
subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, thus ensuring
parliamentary debate and a decision from both Houses.</div>
					<a name="08012280000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government remain committed
to exploring a policy of voluntarism and partnership&#151;my
hon. Friend and the hon. Member for North Cornwall made this
point&#151;as recommended by CoRWM in the development of any such
facility. The final point raised by my hon. Friend was the question of
consultation with CoRWM. As he knows and as he outlined, the committee
was reconstituted only in October, and we have not yet had an
opportunity to consult it. However, I can assure him that we will
consult the committee in due course.</div>
					<a name="08012280000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend and several
colleagues asked about the definition of hazardous waste and whether
such facilities deal with nuclear waste. For the purposes of statutory
regulation, the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations
that specify the substances that are to be subject to controls. That
provision is currently made by the Planning (Hazardous Substances)
Regulations 1992 S.I. 656, as amended by the Planning (Control of
Major-Accident Hazards) Regulations 1999 S.I. 981. Hazardous waste can
arise from a wide range of materials, from chemical residues from
industrial processes to everyday items such as televisions and car
batteries. I assure the Committee  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div>that the types of facilities we are discussing do not deal with
radioactive waste. Radioactive waste, as defined in section
18(4) of the Radioactive Substances Act 1960, is
excluded from the controls exercised in relation to hazardous
substances under the Planning (Hazardous Substances) Act 1990, and
transposed into the development consent regime that will be operated by
the commission. That is because such waste is controlled under
other legislation.</div>

different impression&#151;I am even more confused than I was to start
with. Perhaps, in due course, we could have a clear explanation of
exactly what the measure will mean, rather than the citing of many
complex pieces of legislation. Frankly, I find the 30,000 tonnes limit
very
worrying.</div>

transporting waste. Disposal of contaminated soils will be covered
by the measure. Transport will still be covered by the
Environment Agency, not the IPC. She asked about removing decision
making on hazardous waste from local authorities. Decisions on the
largest hazardous waste facilities only will be transferred to the IPC.
They will provide vital facilities for the safe disposal of a wide
range of materials, not only industrial items, but everyday items such
as TVs, car batteries and fridges, as I said. The IPC
alone will grant development consent. Other regulators, such as the
Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive, will ensure
that they comply with strict controls to protect the environment and
human health.</div>

Betts:
						</b> One of the more interesting features of our
discussions on the definition of nationally significant infrastructure
projects is that we have spent an awfully long time being precise about
the definitions of certain projects and about what might or might not
come within the definition. There has been a lot of detailed debate on
trying to understand precisely what the Government intend to include.
It is almost as though the whole of that debate is swept away by
subsections (3),(4) and (5) of clause 13, which basically state that
whatever we have already discussed and put into the Bill can be changed
or added to if the Government so decide in the future.</div>
					<a name="08012280000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I have misunderstood the
precise intention of those subsections, I am more than happy to be
corrected by the Minister. However, it seems that it is almost not
worth while being so precise when going through clauses 14 to 26 and
the particular definitions of what projects may or may not be included
if, at some stage in the future, much more general definitions can
simply be added in. In some ways, that can override those that have
Ministers acting upon them because it states that the Secretary of
State may do so by order.</div>
					<a name="08012280000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that orders can be
subject to parliamentary procedure, but the amount of discussion that
those orders have is obviously far less than can be given in Committee
stage and there is no ability to amend them, so it is a wide power. I
have moved the amendment in the hope that the Minister can convince me,
although hon. Members opposite might not be so generous in their
approach to matters.</div>

anticipate such generosity
continuing.</div>
					<a name="08012280000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
give one example. I recognise that there will be further discussions on
light rail. The Local Government Association clearly has concerns about
whether light rail systems should be caught by the new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>procedures. Would not it be possible for a Minister simply to stick
down, in section (1), a paragraph (n) for light rail schemes, which
need not be subjected to any further conditions, depending on what the
order says? They could simply be added in by order, despite the fact
that other projects that are caught by the legislation are much more
precisely defined, because of the detailed explanations currently in
clauses 14 to 26, including those that have been added by the various
Government amendments this
morning.</div>
					<a name="08012280000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why do the
Government need such wide powers? Will any new orders to<i class="I"> </i>add any
further categories and types of project have to be within the fairly
broad definitions of subsections (5)(a) to (e)? Is there no possibility
by order to add any types of infrastructure project that do not fall
within those categories or to add a new paragraph (f), which would add
another generality of category to those in subsection (5)? We have
spent a lot of time discussing the details of what is included, but
there is almost an open door for Ministers to push through anything
that they want to add, without the sort of scrutiny that we are trying
to give the various aspects of projects that will be caught by the
Bill.</div>

too, tabled amendments because we are concerned about the potential for
an even wider reference to the IPC with the inclusion of the words in
the Bill. As far as possible, we want to ensure that there is no
mission creep. Our discussion on nuclear waste illustrates the
difficulty. While I applaud the thought that the Secretary of State
will retain final decision-making powers over nuclear power, it seems
slightly illogical for that to happen when every decision on major
infrastructure projects that cause great controversy is theoretically
meant to go through the IPC because it will be quicker. The logic of
that position escapes me unless it is an entirely political decision,
which rather puts into context some of the arguments about the
Secretary of State&#146;s or Ministers&#146; quasi-judicial role in
planning.</div>
					<a name="08012280000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">We support
the deletion of these subsections. With their inclusion, will we see an
instant change, if not in this House perhaps in another House, to the
proposals that we are expecting in the marine Bill? We are debating the
Energy Bill, which has an impact. We have debated the Climate Change
Bill and we are expecting a marine Bill. They all potentially affect
nationally significant infrastructure projects, yet no cross-reference
is made to them. We can immediately see rafts of amendments being made
elsewhere to deal with this. I hope that the Minister will be able to
reassure us and we can at least get it on the record that the
Government have no intention of widening the criteria beyond energy,
transport, water, waste water or
waste.</div>

						</b> This is a sensible discussion for us to be
having. We must look at how the Bill is viewed by two opposing schools
of thought. One is that vital things must be done for the national
economy to keep the country ticking over, and that the provisions in
the Bill will allow that to happen. The other way of viewing the Bill
is from the local community&#146;s point of view, which is that,
perhaps in line with a policy or a technology that may become outdated,
they have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div>have something unpleasant imposed upon them. With that latter school of
thought in mind, it seems sensible that we try to restrict the
possibility of the provisions being extended much more widely than they
are already. Therefore, the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe and the discussion that it has provoked are very
useful, and I support him in raising those concerns with the
Minister.</div>

						</b> I echo the concerns expressed by the hon. Member
for Sheffield, Attercliffe and my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham.
Without wishing to extend the debate, I would like some information
from the Minister as to the provisions of subsection (5), which limits
the exercise of the power conferred by subsection (3) to projects in
England in the fields set out beneath. It appears that not all the
fields referred to in subsection (5) are presently the subject of
devolution to the Welsh Assembly and the Welsh Assembly Government.
Will the Minister explain, therefore, why it is proposed that the power
conferred by subsection (3) should be confined to England and not
extend to Wales in those areas where competence is not already
devolved?</div>

by responding to the concerns raised in relation to amending or adding

any change should be made by further primary legislation, so that
Parliament would have a say in whether to accept any changes in
additions to the list in clause 13(1). The Government believe that that
is unnecessary. We have already provided that the power is subject to
the affirmative resolution procedure. That will ensure parliamentary
debate and approval in both Houses for any change to that list, but
also takes care to sufficiently limit the power to projects that relate
only to energy, transport, water, waste and waste
water.</div>

that it does not include nuclear waste in the clauses discussed.
However, in response to the question raised by the hon. Member for

could be if it is considered appropriate by the Secretary of State.
However, that would be subject to consultation, there would have to be

changes are being made because it will not always be possible to say
with certainty what the capacity will be at the point of making an
application for development consent. For instance, if the capacity of
an overhead electric line is expected to carry 20 kV, it is right that
it falls to the IPC for consideration, even if, on completion of the
project, the average operating capacity falls below that. We must
operate on the principle of the level at which a facility is expected
to operate to service the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>national need. The amendments will ensure that there is no unnecessary

						</b> Amendment No. 76, which stands in my name, deals
with the thresholds. I understand why the Bill requires thresholds, but
I am concerned that they might distort the applications. If a developer
feels that it would be beneficial to be covered by the IPC, it might
artificially inflate the capacity of its generator. I have focused on
electricity generators, but the point could apply to any of the other
areas covered by thresholds. A developer might draw up its scheme in
such a way that it is over the threshold set out in the Bill. For
example, I would prefer applications for wind farms in my constituency,
of which there are a number, to be considered thoroughly by the local
council. I have made it clear to the Committee that I am not opposed to
wind farms generally, but that they should be considered
thoroughly.</div>
					<a name="08012280000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that one scheme in particular is very close to the 50 MW
limit, which might provide an incentive to the developer to increase
the capacity of the scheme slightly to bring it under the provisions in
the Bill. That would take away the decision from the local authority
and move it to the IPC. My amendment would require the Government to
review annually that threshold and to consider whether it has had
unintended effects on applications. Arguably, such a threshold could
depress the number of applications for smaller schemes and more
devolved energy networks. I am focusing my remarks on energy, but there
might be other thresholds included in other categories that might have
a similar effect. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
response on that.</div>

							<a name="08012280000532"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> On amendment No. 367, which was tabled by the hon.
Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, we have heard a lot about the
Government&#146;s anxiety not to disturb the devolution settlement.
That highlights an attempt by the Welsh Assembly Government to disturb
the devolution settlement: for some considerable time, they have been
pressing for an extension of competence in respect of generating
stations with capacity beyond the 50 MW to which they are currently
confined. I remind the Committee that in the Welsh Assembly, Plaid
Cymru and the Labour party are in coalition. Of course, they are not in
coalition here, but I am interested to know why the Government
have maintained their adamant opposition to the extension of competence
for Welsh generating stations with capacity above 50
MW.</div>
					<a name="08012280000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000533"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I shall start with amendment No.
76. The hon. Member for North Cornwall made a good case for keeping the
thresholds in the Bill under review. He flagged specifically the
threshold for onshore generating stations, given the importance that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>renewable energy projects of all kinds will have in helping us to meet
our climate change targets.</div>
					<a name="08012280000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I set out earlier, we have
set the thresholds for electricity generating stations to be consistent
with existing legislation for the most part. The changes we
are introducing are not primarily about shifting
boundaries on what is considered nationally significant, but about
where and how decisions on such projects are made. The obvious example
in the energy sector is offshore renewable projects, where we have
raised the threshold for nationally significant projects to reflect the
fact that offshore wind farm developments have significantly increased
in size in recent years. The adjusted threshold means, in this case,
that only genuinely larger projects will be handled by the IPC. We
therefore believe that the thresholds in the existing
legislation on the whole accurately capture the range of projects that
are nationally significant.</div>
					<a name="08012280000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is right to
say that projects that will help us to meet our climate change
objectives are important, but that is an argument to which local
authorities should pay due attention in relation to the national policy
statement covering this infrastructure. They must take account of the
planning policy statement on climate change rather than directing
projects of below 50 MW to the IPC, which would risk overloading the
regime, making it less efficient and effective. We are very aware of
the need to ensure that we do not remove decisions from local
authorities except where there is a clear case for doing so. However, I
appreciate the thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s arguments and I
assure the Committee that if evidence were put before Ministers that
circumstances have changed, we would certainly consider it. However, we
do not expect circumstances to change that frequently. A statutory
requirement to review them annually would therefore be a trifle
excessive and a burden on Government.</div>
					<a name="08012280000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 367 would
increase the threshold for onshore generating stations to 100 MW.
Offshore turbines generally have about twice the generating capacity of
onshore turbines, so 20 offshore turbines will produce 100 MW, whereas
20 onshore turbines will produce 50 MW. I understand the concerns of
the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, but I have set out the
threshold that the Government believe to be appropriate, which
reflects the long-established threshold for large onshore generating
projects that is contained in the Electricity Act 1989, and we believe
that it will capture the type of project that will impact on a wider
area. The overall response to the planning White Paper consultation did
not contradict that view.</div>
					<a name="08012280000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, amendment No. 368
seeks to insert a reference to &#147;installed capacity&#148;. The
amendment is not necessary because consents are already granted on
&#147;installed capacity&#148;, which is the maximum amount that a
generating station can produce when it is operating at 100 per cent. of
capacity, as opposed to the amount that it would produce on a
day-to-day basis. The Bill does not alter that. The amendment is
therefore superfluous, so I hope that it is not pressed to a Division.
I hope that I have provided the necessary assurance to the hon. Member
for North Cornwall in respect of amendment No.
76.</div>

							<a name="08012280000534"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> With respect, the Minister has not dealt with my
point on devolution.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000535"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> On devolution, I said earlier in our
deliberations that we wish to maintain our position on the settlement.
However, I am well aware that Welsh Ministers have argued for the
devolution of energy consents of more than 50 MW, and that there have
been tripartite discussions on the matter between the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Wales Office and the
Welsh Assembly Government. However, the Government&#146;s view is
that reserving powers on nationally significant energy infrastructure
is the best way to develop the UK&#146;s long-term energy strategy.
The planning White Paper made it clear that the current devolution
settlement works well and the Government propose that it should
continue. Given that position, it is clear that such projects must be
included within the IPC&#146;s remit. If they were not, major energy
projects in Wales would continue to be determined by Ministers in
Westminster under the old regime.</div>
					<a name="08012280000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should add that our reform
proposals include a number of measures to ensure that when such
decisions are taken away from Whitehall Ministers and passed to the
IPC, the Welsh Assembly Government will have appropriate input to the
process. For example, two or three commissioners will be appointed on
the advice of the Welsh Assembly Government, and when a project relates
to land in Wales, at least one of them will be on the panel of
commissioners who consider it, whenever that is reasonably practicable.
I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point and I
apologise for not responding when I concluded my earlier
remarks.</div>

Lait:
						</b> We are not going to object to the clause, but this
is a useful opportunity to get some clarification on one of my
favourite or pet subjects&#151;Scotland. Will the Minister clarify
how paragraph 15(1)(d), which
reads</div>
					<a name="08012280000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;partly in England
and partly in
Scotland&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012280000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">relates to
clause 187, which is on the extent of the Bill, and which says that the
Bill extends</div>
					<a name="08012280000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to England
and Wales
only&#148;?</div>
					<a name="08012280000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">While he
is thinking about that, perhaps I could ask him to allay my concern
about the consultation with Scotland on difficult decisions. What
consideration have the Government given to situations in which
Scotland, under its devolved structure, has a reverse impact on England
and does not provide, thereby putting extra demand on England?
Hazardous waste is a particularly controversial example. How
will the Government and the IPC deal with applications within England
to deal with areas in which Scotland is not providing sufficient
capacity?</div>
					<a name="08012280000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Scotland
has historically provided much of the UK&#146;s
nuclear electricity. Hunterston, Torness and
Chapelcross have been key in that. Chapelcross is being decommissioned.
Hunterston and Torness have planning permission or presumption of
planning for more sites, as does Chapelcross. But the previous
Labour-Liberal Administration set their face against building any new
nuclear power stations, as has the new Scottish National party
Administration. Therefore the pressure is on England to provide for the
UK in a way that historically it did not have to do. This is going
slightly wide of the matter under discussion, but it gives the Minister
the chance to answer my question about clause 187 and to tell us how
the Government are approaching the issue of England having to
provide because Scotland is not doing its fair
share.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000538"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> I will study <i class="I">Hansard</i> to examine some
of the nuances that the hon. Lady is getting at because a more
considered response than I might be able to give is required. However,
I shall give that which I have in respect of power lines going across
borders.</div>
					<a name="08012280000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 15
sets out when the installation of an electric line above ground will be
a nationally significant infrastructure project. That will include
projects in England and Wales, projects that are partly in England and
partly in Wales, and projects that are partly in England and partly in
Scotland. To respect the devolution settlement, where projects are
partly in England and partly in Scotland, the commission will only be
responsible for approving the part of the line that is in England. All
projects will be within the IPC&#146;s remit except for the following
two types of project: installing a line that is intended to be used for
a single consumer and that does not exceed a nominal voltage of 20 kV;
and installing a line within premises in the occupation or control of
the person responsible for its
installation.</div>
					<a name="08012280000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
thresholds are consistent with existing thresholds under the
Electricity Act 1989 and include all the projects currently consented
by the Secretary of State which are deemed to be nationally
significant. Overhead lines may cut across a number of local authority
boundaries and have significant national as well as local benefits. As
such, the Government believe 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div>that they merit treatment as nationally significant.
In addition, each link of the electricity transmission and distribution
network is critical to the effectiveness and resilience of the network
as a whole. The network is of strategic national significance and it is
important that the overall integrity of the network is maintained
through consistent national-level decision making.</div>
					<a name="08012280000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The development control system
must also be able to take into account the
anticipated greater role of renewable energy, with the changes to the
network structures that implies, and the likelihood of a more localised
pattern of generation and distribution in future. Responses to the
planning White Paper consultation showed a large majority of those
responding on this issue in favour of including electric lines in the
commission&#146;s remit. The clause makes an electric line a
nationally significant infrastructure project only in relation to the
English part of the line.</div>

					<div class="hs_brev">&#145;but excludes
tramways, and guided transport as defined under subsections 81(2)(b)
and 81(2)(c) of the Railways Act
1993&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08012280000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
pleasure to be under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley, and I
hope that you are able to remain in your seat for the rest of the
deliberations. Clearly, there are some challenges
there.</div>
					<a name="08012280000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a great
pleasure to speak in favour of the amendment. It touches on a number of
points that have been raised throughout the Committee&#146;s
proceedings, particularly the question of overloading the commission,
which the Minister said he was keen to avoid. He also said that he was
keen not to remove from local authorities control over issues that are
significant in their areas.</div>
					<a name="08012280000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment, which relates to
tramways and guided transport, is favoured by the LGA, which has made
it clear that the commission should look at a  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>small number of proposals each year, rather than the sort of figure that
the Government have suggested. It has highlighted its concerns about
the commission taking on responsibility for tramways and guided
transport. The LGA does not deem those to be nationally significant
infrastructure projects, and I agree. It should be down to local
authorities to consider those.</div>
					<a name="08012280000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am fortunate to have the
Croydon tram close to my constituency, and it is clear that the
sort of deliberations that had to happen over the route, such as the
impact on local people of much of the tram route running through local
streets, clearly required the local authority to deal with them. Such
deliberations should not be tackled by the commission.</div>
					<a name="08012280000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, there is a strong
demand for, and many vocal advocates of, the tram to be extended to
Sutton, my area. I mention in passing Abigail Lock, if only because she
is the Liberal Democrat candidate for Sutton and Croydon for the
Greater London authority, who is leading the campaign to bring the tram
to Sutton. Should that happen, there would be challenges from residents
who object to having the tram coming down their streets, and the local
authority and the local councillors will have the best insight into
what would be acceptable and what would be the preferable route. It
should be within their hands to manage that application. There will be
a huge concern if the responsibility for considering that ends up with
a commission that, with the best will in the world, will not be able to
acquire the local knowledge itself and will find it difficult to bring
in others who have that knowledge, because it rests with local
councillors and
residents.</div>
					<a name="08012280000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
think that local authorities will not drag their feet in the case of
trams. In recent years, the Government&#146;s position on trams has
changed slightly, as hon. Members will know. They were going to provide
additional capacity and solve many of the congestion problems in our
major cities, but the Government have gone a little cold on them. Many
local authorities, however, have been bidding for, and are keen to
have, tram schemes in their areas. Therefore, they would be unlikely to
drag that process out unnecessarily, and that is similar to what the
Minister wants to do, as he wants those decisions to be taken quickly.
As a result of the important role that local authorities can play in
reducing congestion through tram schemes, they will want to facilitate
that process.</div>
					<a name="08012280000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000543"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proximity to the
Croydon tram and one of the projected extensions is in my constituency.
He is talking about local government making the decisions, but I
suggest that those will now sadly be made by the Mayor. I hope he
agrees that we should change
that.</div>
					<a name="08012280000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000544"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her helpful intervention.
She may well be right that the Mayor would have a major say, if not a
total say, in the matter. Setting aside the current incumbent, in
general terms the preference would still be for the Mayor, who has more
democratic credibility&#151;I remind her that I am talking in general
terms, as I see that she is choking on her fizzy water.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div>
					<a name="08012280000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">In general terms, the Mayor has
more democratic accountability than the commission will ever have.
Therefore, it will be appropriate for him to take on that role in
London. Indeed, I know that the hon. Lady&#146;s and my own preferred
candidate for Mayor have made it clear that they would seek to engage,
at a very low level, with local authorities to ensure that there was a
decent working relationship and that their views were taken fully into
account.</div>
					<a name="08012280000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish
to prolong matters further, but simply to say that there is a strong
case for the remit of trams and guided transport not to be taken up by
the commission. We are not talking about nationally significant
transport projects. We are talking about transport projects that are
significant at a local or possibly regional level, but certainly not at
a national level. I will listen with interest to the Minister&#146;s
explanation as to why he thinks that trams and guided transport should
be included within the Bill&#146;s
scope.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012280000545"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises concerns with
regard to the scope of clause 21. Specifically, he wishes to exclude
tramways and guided transport from the types of project that the IPC
will consider. We are sympathetic to his points. Those types of
development are often limited to a specific locality. That is why the
Department for Transport is exploring the potential to devolve them to
local authorities to determine. Guided transport, including trams, is
currently considered by the Secretary of State using the Transport and
Works Act 1992. We will be consulting on and devolving those powers to
local authorities as part of the sub-national review consultation that
I mentioned in our discussions on
highways.</div>
					<a name="08012280000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to clause 21, however, the Government are currently considering the
scope of the types of railway development that should be included in
the Bill. In doing so, I am happy to take on board the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concerns, and will come back to him and the
Committee on Report, possibly to include a suitable Government
amendment to address categories such as light rail, which would be
separate. I hope that, with that assurance on both
those areas being examined either on Report and/or through the
sub-national review that we have mentioned, he will feel able to
withdraw his amendment.</div>

provided some helpful clarification. On the basis that either on Report
or as a result of the sub-national review the matter will be addressed
and there will be clarity for local authorities, and possibly the
Mayor, on where responsibility for those sort of projects will lie, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
