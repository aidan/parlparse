					<a name="07011971001002"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;, if he

think that, when the sitting adjourned this morning, the Minister was

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000719"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Paul

						</b> I suspect, Sir Nicholas, that the only person
who can remember is the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporter, but we shall proceed
anyway.</div>
					<a name="07011971000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I
was finally about to persuade the hon. Gentleman that the word
&#147;necessary&#148; was preferable to the word
&#147;reasonable&#148;. Let me give an example of why
&#147;necessary&#148; is the right word to use here. For instance,
an officer could detain an individual, stop them to question them and
ask them for details of their home address. After the individual gives
some information, the officer may ask, &#147;Well, what colour is
your front door then?&#148; When the person answers that question,
the officer may then ask, &#147;What street is the next
street?&#148; When the person answers, the officer must send someone
to check whether that information is accurate. If it is accurate, the
person will be released; if there are further grounds for questioning,
the questioning will continue. In other words, that officer can detain
that individual for as long as it is &#147;necessary&#148; to carry
out those inquiries. &#147;Necessary&#148; is a more
black-and-white, a more certain word than &#147;reasonable&#148;,
which, as I suggested earlier, offers too much room for doubt and
uncertainty.</div>

						<a name="07011971000720"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I am not following this
argument, because what the Minister is really saying is that all
previous legislation containing the word &#147;reasonable&#148;,
which has long been accepted as the right word, is
wrong.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000721"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I do not suggest that for a minute. The hon.
Gentleman is playing a substantial role in the Committee&#146;s
deliberations, and I thank him for that.</div>
					<a name="07011971000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Reasonable&#148; is
the correct word in other circumstances, but we are discussing extreme
circumstances, in which an officer has considerable concerns about a
particular individual and perhaps needs to check certain information.
It is important in those pressured circumstances that the officer has
certainty, and the word &#147;necessary&#148; gives the degree of
certainty that we feel is essential. There is a judgment to be made
here. I began my remarks by saying that judging the difference between
the word &#147;reasonable&#148; and the word
&#147;necessary&#148; is a fine judgment, but we think that the
word &#147;necessary&#148; is the right one here.</div>
					<a name="07011971000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, I would like to
deal with the other amendment that the hon. Member for Tewkesbury has
tabled, which relates to limiting questioning to instances in which
there was a suspicion that someone had information regarding an
explosion or an incident that would endanger life. It would simply be
impossible to conduct any kind of random stop-and-search operation if
we were to accept that amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
understand that, if a threat is made against a particular meeting,
building or event, it may be necessary for the Army or the police to
mount some kind of surveillance operation, perhaps involving some
rolling surveillance cordon. If they were not able, to some degree, to
make a random selection of individuals, it would make that operation
extremely difficult. Obviously, all such operations need to be carried
out carefully, sensibly and sensitively, particularly in certain parts
of the community, but we believe that the constraint that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would give would make it very difficult
for the police and the Army to do their
job.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07011971000722"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): The wording of
amendment No. 19 is lifted from elsewhere in the Bill, so the
Government accept that such a situation is the only time that
individuals can be stopped for this particular kind of questioning.
Subsection (2)
says:</div>
					<a name="07011971000618"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A member
of Her Majesty&#146;s forces on duty may stop a person for so long as
is necessary to question him...about a recent explosion or another
recent incident endangering life...what he knows about a
person&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011971000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">That qualifies
why individuals can be stopped under subsection (2). Subsection (1)
does not actually state why the member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces
or the constable would want to stop that person; they could just stop
them for no reason at all for as long as they feel necessary. I suggest
that subsection (1) is at least badly worded, and probably worse than
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000723"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I simply ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect, as I
know he does, on the context in which we are moving the clause. We are
moving to normalisation, under which part VII of the Terrorism Act 2000
will be repealed, but we need specific powers in place to deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 113</div>with some of the extreme situations with which the law enforcement and
the security services have to deal.</div>
					<a name="07011971000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I again draw on the experience
of Whiterock. Officers have very little time to make judgments, decide
and act to preserve law and order or detain people who may be
responsible for lawlessness and worse. It is to deal with those extreme
and pressing circumstances that we seek such powers. We have judged
them necessary. I ask the hon. Gentleman, in assessing whether to
support the clause, to bear in mind the context in which we are
proposing
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000724"></a>Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> The Minister used an interesting phrase when he
said that the context was that wewere moving toward
normalisation, but the word &#147;necessary&#148; is not normal in
this context; the word &#147;reasonable&#148; is. I am afraid that
he has done the reverse of selling the case to me.</div>
					<a name="07011971000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the reasonable test of the
man on the Clapham omnibus, I came in by bus this morning, so I
consider myself that reasonable man. Members in Committee yesterday
probably did not think so, but that was a different matter. I have
watched a video of Whiterock with the police, and it was a terrible
situation. If a constable or member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces
needed to detain someone hurling rocks at the police&#151;as some
were&#151;in order to question them about their identity and
movements and if that person did not comply, I would think that the
person questioning them would be entitled to detain them for a
substantial amount of time. I would consider that reasonable. What I do
not consider as moving toward normalisation is the insertion of the
word &#147;necessary&#148;. It is open-ended and not generally
accepted as a legal term, whereas &#147;reasonable&#148; most
certainly is. Given that, I am sorry to tell the Minister that I am not
happy with his explanation and that I will press the amendment to a
Division.</div>

punishment for failing to stop to answer such questions&#151;which
the Minister has assured us are &#147;necessary&#148; bearing in
mind the circumstances of,for example, Whiterock&#151;for
refusing to answer the questions or for failing to answer the questions

the amendment at this early juncture and might need a little time to

the punishment fit the crime and to be proportionate to the serious
issues that he has drawn to the attention of the Committee when
responding to earlier amendments in the name of the hon. Member for
Tewkesbury. With those words, I look forward to the Minister&#146;s

Goggins:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, as ever, for
probing and for scrutinising every aspect of the Bill. It is important
that penalties are proportionate tothe offence. It is also
important that penalties are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 115</div>consistent throughout the legislation. As set out in schedule 3, an
offence of failing to stop is punishable by a fine up to level 5, the
same penalty that we are proposing in clause 20.</div>
					<a name="07011971000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady should consider
that the clause deals specifically with the offence of failing to stop.
It may be that a person refuses to stop because they have a grudge
against the police or Army but, of course, it is important that there
is a penalty for someone who fails to stop in whatever circumstances. A
person may not have committed any offence or have any further
information to offer but, even so, failing to stop would be an offence.
If a person had committed a more serious offence, if they were actively
engaged in violence or inciting violence and so on, they could be
arrested by the police, taken away and placed in custody. There is no
question that a person behaving unlawfully can be arrested under other
legislation. Clause 20 deals merely with the offence of failing to
stop.</div>
					<a name="07011971000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I made it clear
earlier in the debate that it may be necessary to use the powers to
stop and question randomly. It may be that surveillance is drawn up on
a particular event and that people are stopped and questioned randomly.
In those circumstances, we regard the fine of up to level 5 to be
proportionate for the simple offence of failing to stop. If a more
serious offence is being committed&#151;if people&#146;s lives are
endangered, or violence incited&#151;it would be up to the police to
arrest the individual involved and deal with them
appropriately.</div>

						</b> They are, and we believe that the penalties are
proportionate. However, if a person acted in a violent way to an
officer or to a member of the public in the course of failing to stop,
that would be a more serious, arrestable offence, which could carry a
sentence of imprisonment. We regard the penalty as proportionate for
the actual offence of failing tostop. Indeed, we have
consistently applied that proportionality in the Bill. Clearly, such
things are a matter of judgment, but we regard a fine of up to level 5
as appropriate for the simple offence of failing to stop, and that that
is proportionate and consistent with other measures in the
Bill.</div>

						</b> The hon. Lady helps the Committee to get nearer
to the point. If a police officer has evidence that an individual has
carried out or been connected with a violent act such as the setting of
explosives or some other heinous crime, the officer has the power to
arrest that individual. Any obstruction would carry its own penalties.
If the individual were found guilty of those more serious crimes, they
would go to prison and rightly so. The provision relates simply to
somebody who has failed to stop; they may be completely innocent of any
other crime. We think that the fine is a sufficient, proportionate
penalty. If there are grounds to believe that somebody has committed a
more serious offence, they should be arrested and dealt
with.</div>

his finger on. Clauses 20 and 22 both begin with the

clause 20 does not talk about a constable, however. My amendment
attaches to subsection (2), which is exclusively about a member of Her
Majesty&#146;s forces. Clause 22, however, contains the two
alternatives of a member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces or a member of
the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and then deals only with the
powers of one or the other. It is extremely confusing.</div>

the police constable can arrest the individual. Sorry, Minister: in

more peaceful, stable Northern Ireland, but the drafting of clause 20

part 7of the Terrorism Act 2000 is repealed, neither will have the

stray slightly, but only to make the point&#151;we will see that they
apply only to members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces, because the
police already have sufficient powers to carry out the actions that the
clauses cover, whereas Her Majesty&#146;s forces do not. An Army
officer is not in a position to make an arrest, for example, and clause
21 will give him that power. That reinforces the point that our
approach has been minimalist; we have identified the minimum powers
necessary after July 2007 to have the wherewithal to maintain public
order and deal with extreme circumstances.</div>

part 7 goes, neither the police nor the Army will have the powers that
we seek to provide in clause 20. If we did not replace some of those
powers for the Army, the police would still have the powers that
clauses 21 and 22 seek to give the Army. However, we wish the Army to
have the powers, too, so we look to do the minimum
necessary.</div>

						</b> Let me paraphrase what the Minister has just told
the Committee. Owing to the lapse of other terrorist legislation, the
police and the Army will not have powers. Therefore, under the
legislation before
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 118</div>us, we must give the Army powers, but the police will have powers under
other legislation. That is a fair summary of what he has just
said.</div>
					<a name="07011971000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
true, will the Minister look carefully at the wording of clause 20?
Subsection (1) refers
to:</div>
					<a name="07011971000634"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A member
of Her Majesty&#146;s forces on duty or a
constable&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011971000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
constable already has the powers, as the Minister has assured the
Committee, there is no need for the clause to refer to a constable at
all. He just said that the provisions give members of Her
Majesty&#146;s forces the powers to stop and to question.</div>
					<a name="07011971000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point and that of my
amendment is that there will be no joint patrols: a member of Her
Majesty&#146;s forces will be on duty on his or her own. They will
have the power to stop a person in serious circumstances pertaining to
a recent explosion, a recent incident endangering life, or to a person
killed or injured in a recent explosion or incident. My entire argument
is that in those serious circumstances, when a member of Her
Majesty&#146;s forces is on duty on their own and unable to call in
aid a member of the PSNI, any offence committed ought to be punishable
by a term of imprisonment equivalent to the &#163;5,000 fine. That is
my point.</div>

							<a name="07011971000756"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak again,
if for no other reason than to clarify one point on which I slightly
misled the Committee when responding to the hon. Lady. Clause 22
applies to constables as well as to members of the Army, so we seek to
confer powers specifically on members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces
only in clause 21. When part 7 lapses, they will not have any power of
arrest. The Army must have that limited power of arrest and of
detention for up to four hours so that they can participate effectively
in what may be a difficult public order situation or a situation
surrounding an explosion.</div>
					<a name="07011971000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 21 is only for the Army,
and clauses 20 and 22 apply power equally to the police and to the
Army. We want to introduce the minimum powers necessary. The specific
powers in clause 20 are concerned with the ability to stop and to
question. If the Committee focuses on that narrow offence, I hope that
it will agree that the penalty of a fine not exceeding level 5, which
is the issue under discussion, is
proportionate.</div>

					<a name="07011971000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am terribly sorry to disagree
with the Minister, but as all hon. Members who consider the Bill will
clearly see, the reference that he made to clause 21 and to the powers
of arrest refers only to the powers of arrest given to Her
Majesty&#146;s forces. There is no equivalence given to a member of
the PSNI. The word &#147;constable&#148; does not appear in clause
21. The powers in clause 22, relating to entry to a building, noting
what and who is in the building and so on, are given to a police
officer. There is no equivalence between the powers of entry in clause
22 and what we are discussing in clause 20, namely the power to stop
and to question. It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate the
legislative provisions that give PSNI constables the right to do what a
member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces can clearly do under clause 20,
because the Bill does
not.</div>

Goggins:
						</b> I am always happy to try to help the hon. Lady

the narrow point of her amendment, which concerns whether a fine of up
to level 5 is proportionate in relation to the offence of failing to
stop when a constable or a member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces
insists on it, I fail to see how I can say more to try to persuade her.
I acknowledge, however, that the clauses need to be read with great
care, as the hon. Lady has said. For example, clause 20(1) refers to
a</div>

20(2) refers just to &#147;Her Majesty&#146;s forces&#148;. We do
not seek to give the powers to the police under subsection (2), because
they already have them under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,
and we do not seek to duplicate powers that already exist. Instead, we
want to give the minimum powers necessary to ensure that both the
police and the Army can operate effectively in situations of extreme
public disorder or in a situation involving explosives. I have gone as
far as I can&#151;I do not know whether I have persuaded the hon.

first time this afternoon. Previously, the Minister said that clauses
21 and 22 provide equivalent police powers, but they most certainly do
not. He has clarified the point, which is helpful. As he has said,

I would like the Minister to clarify something. During his long debate

subsection (5). In what circumstances would he envisage the police or
the Army stopping an aircraft that is airborne? Is it anticipated that
Superman might be recruited by the PSNI to knock on the window of the

						</b> Let us consider a situation elsewhere in the UK.
If the police have reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has
been committed, they can stop someone and question them under PACE. We
are discussing situations in which the police need to detain someone to
ascertain their identity and movements. We believe that we need such
powers in Northern Ireland and that similar powers should be given to
the Army to deal with incidents that endanger life&#151;sadly, the
threats of explosives and of serious social disorder still exist in
Northern Ireland. It is specifically because those risks still exist in
Northern Ireland that we seek to give those limited but important
powers to the
police.</div>

						</b> The Minister has not quite answered my
question. The question is why now? Why were those powers not introduced
in 1972, at the height of the troubles, or more recently? The DUP is
almost sitting down with Sinn Fein, and the IMC report says that the
IRA is not involved in paramilitary activity, so why is it necessary to
extend Army and police powers?</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I have failed to explain the matter
sufficiently clearly. Those powers already exist in Northern Ireland
under part VII of the Terrorism Act 2000. Because of the commitment to
repeal part VII from the end of July this year, Ministers had to decide
whether leaving out all those powers was reasonable, given the threat
that still exists from terrorism and serious public disorder linked to
paramilitary activity. Our judgment was that we could not do so and
that we needed to put in place minimum powers to enable the police and
the Army to continue to deal with such serious situations. We are
including powers that already exist, but we are dropping the part VII
powers, which will not exist after July. We feel that the powers that
we are keeping are necessary in the present
circumstances.</div>

Robertson:
						</b> Briefly, and on the same lines as I questioned
the Minister on why it is necessary to extend the powers of the police
under clause 20&#151;I was desperately searching through the
Terrorism Act 2000, but we reached clause 21 before I could find the
relevant provision&#151;will he explain why it is necessary at this
stage to introduce powers that I think he said do not exist for Her
Majesty&#146;s forces, given that we are supposed to be moving
towards
normalisation?</div>
					<a name="07011971000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question concerns subsection (1), which
begins:</div>
					<a name="07011971000638"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If a

suspects&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000791"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> It is important to recognise a couple of things.
First, members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces do not have a power of
arrest, which we seek to provide them with under limited circumstances.
Secondly, I ask the Committee to consider a situation in which a member
of Her Majesty&#146;s forces is dealing with explosives that have
been found. The Army has the expertise to deal with a threat from
explosives by defusing them and so on. The Army could be called
urgently to a road closure or some other scenario. They might be the
only people in the area; they might get there before the police; or
they might be there because they are the only people who are safe to be
there. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 123</div>
						they came across somebody whom they suspected of
being involved in the commission of the offence of laying explosives,
they would need to have the power to arrest that individual. After the
Terrorism Act 2000 is repealed, they will not have that
power&#151;</div>

have the powers, and this clause provides
them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000794"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b> That has given me an opportunity to comment on two
curious aspects of the clause. First, I should like some clarification
and assurances from the Minister about the way in which it is drafted.
It states:</div>
					<a name="07011971000639"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces on duty reasonably suspects
that a person is committing, has committed or is about to commit any
offence he may...arrest the person without warrant,
and...detain him for a period not exceeding four
hours.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011971000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
position of an off-duty soldier? The Minister has given us assurances
that the PSNI has powers of arrest and detention under other
legislation, even when part VII of the 2000 Act is dropped. Will an
off-duty member of the PSNI have to stand by and not intervene? And
will they have to call in aid a member of the PSNI who is on duty? What
is the position of an off-duty soldier? It is rather vexing that
community support officers in Northern Ireland will have more powers
than members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces when a person about to
commit an offence.</div>
					<a name="07011971000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point is related to that in the sense that subsection (2) states
that a person&#151;meaning a member of Her Majesty&#146;s
forces&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011971000640"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;making an
arrest under this section complies with any rule of law requiring him
to state the ground of arrest if he states that he is making the arrest
as a member of Her Majesty&#146;s
forces.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011971000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">For ease of
interpretation, subsection (5) defines&#147;a rule of
law&#148;:</div>
					<a name="07011971000641"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reference to a rule of law in subsection (2) does not include a rule of
law which has effect only by virtue of the Human Rights Act
1998.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011971000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
extraordinary. Given the overall content ofthe Bill and, as we
have highlighted, the powers of the Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission, I am amazed and surprised to find an exclusion whereby a
soldier does not seem to have to comply with the Human Rights Act 1998.
Those are the two points on which I await clarification by the
Minister.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000795"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> On the hon. Lady&#146;s first question, the
powers are not conferred on an off-duty solder by this piece of
legislation. An off-duty soldier would, of course, have the power of
citizen&#146;s arrest, in as much as any other member of the public
would have that power if something were happening and they were the
closest person to the situation, but they would not have the powers
conferred under the Bill. Soldiers would have those powers only when
they were on duty. I hope that that clarifies the position. In reality,
there would, of course, be an ongoing Army operation to deal with a
major security threat or serious incident, which would obviously
include only soldiers who were on duty.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 124</div>
					<a name="07011971000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the hon. Lady and the hon.
Member for Tewkesbury have mentioned subsection (2). When the police
make an arrest, they have to give reasons for doing so. They have to
say that there is a suspicion that the person being arrested has been
involved in the commission of an offence. The police have to give that
information to the person whom they are arresting, which they are
trained to do with great
care.</div>
					<a name="07011971000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Army is not
trained to do that. We therefore propose that it is sufficient for
members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces who make arrests simply to state
that they are doing so as members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces, which
is a simple, straightforward line that they will all be in a position
to use. That provision will empower them to detain the person for up to
four hours. Of course, if the police arrest that person, that person
must be given reasons. If that person is then rearrested and detained
for other reasons, they must be given those reasons, too. However,
because members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces are not trained for
that, because there is no need to train them for that, all they have to
do is say that the arrest is being made by a member of Her
Majesty&#146;s forces, which is sufficient for the powers conferred
under the
clause.</div>

(2), the Minister has said that members of the armed forces do not need
to give a reason when making an arrest. Is he comfortable with that? I
accept his explanation that they are not trained to handle such
situations, but there must be a reason why the police have to give a
reason for an arrest. The person being arrested will presumably not
have listened to this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 125</div>debate and will not know why they have not been given the reasons for
being arrested. Is the Minister comfortable with
that?</div>

						</b> I am comfortable with that, given the kind of
scenario that I remind the Committee we are dealing with, which might
involve extreme risk to life. Obviously it is necessary for a member of
Her Majesty&#146;s forces to offer some explanation, but we have
confined that to saying simply that they are making the arrest as a
member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces. That is sufficient, in the face
of what might be great pressure, for an arrest and detention for up to
four hours. It is a sensible and proportionate measure and, to answer

been delayed.</div>
					<a name="07011971000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not want to labour my point, as we have hada long discussion
about similar amendments. The amendment deals with the provisions on
entry inclause 22, which
states:</div>
					<a name="07011971000643"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces on duty or a constable may enter
any premises if he considers it

the hon. Member for North Down has pointed out, the clause starts by
referring to a member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces or a constable,
but from subsection (2) onwards, it refers only to a constable. If the
rest of the clause referred to members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces
as well, I would not have tabled the amendment. I say that because the
constable has to obtain authorisation, where it is reasonably
practicable to do so,
from</div>

of Her Majesty&#146;s forces does not, as far as I can read, have to
obtain any authorisation, so I thought it wise to suggest that we might
want to strengthen the reasons for making such an
entry.</div>

but would it not be possible for those involved in organising, for
example, a street riot to dodge into a house to escape arrest, to meet
to arrange further disorder or simply to get away to come out again?
They might not be there as members of a paramilitary group, or even be
engaged in paramilitary activity, but they will be disturbing the peace
and putting people&#146;s lives in danger. In such circumstances,
would the amendment not eliminate rather than extend the ability to

understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but I am a little
surprised that there is a difference between a constable, who must

amendment, which is just a probing amendment to draw out the

Goggins:
						</b> The amendment would&#151;the hon. Member for
East Antrim hit the nail on the head&#151;make dealing with the
serious situations with which the powers are intended to deal
unworkable. If the police in effect had to prove a paramilitary link
before they were able to take any action, that might lead to
unnecessary delay, which could have a devastating
effect.</div>
					<a name="07011971000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
present a scenario as an example. Two routes lead to a location where
an explosive has been found or where some serious disorder is about to
break out. One is through a public right of way and the other is across
some private land. If we were to accept the amendment, the Army would
have no choice but to go through the public right of way, where they
might suspect that a booby trap was waiting, as unless they could prove
a paramilitary link they would not be able to go across the private
land. We do not want to constrain Army personnel who are dealing with
extremely difficult situations so that they would have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 127</div>go to such lengths to deal with what might be a life-threatening
situation. It would certainly have an impact on the operation if they
were not allowed to enter premises without proof of a paramilitary
link. It might even place not only members of the public but Army
personnel in danger. I ask the hon. Member for Tewkesbury to consider
that seriously.</div>

						<a name="07011971000808"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): The Minister is
making a reasonably convincing point on a narrow issue. Does he agree
that the wording could have been tighter? It is lax and so we have two
extremes, particularly in the example that he has just given the
Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000809"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I am not at this stage convinced that the wording
is too lax, but I made a commitment at the outset that throughout our
deliberations we would look for ways in which the wording could be
tightened and clarified. That is the purpose of the Committee. I will
happily look again at the wording to ensure that it does the job that
we want it to. The key idea is to give the Army the power to deal
quickly with a fast-changing and dangerous scenario.</div>
					<a name="07011971000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members have mentioned the
safeguards. As set out in the clause, it is clear that the police
should seek written authorisation from a superintendent or oral
authorisation from an inspector. That is the system that the police are
used to, and if time allows that is what they should and would do. The
Army is not used to operating in that way and it is important that in
pressing and difficult circumstances we keep the system as simple as
possible, so the authorisation will not be sought in the same way.
However, the Army and the police are required under the legislation to
make a record of what has happened. That applies equally to the Army as
to the police.</div>
					<a name="07011971000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to the police, we return to the issue of oversight. The police
ombudsman will be able to investigate any allegations if there are
concerns.</div>

authorisation?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000811"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I am sorry if I have inadvertently misled the
Committee. I am saying that members of the police must have
authorisation in writing from a superintendent if there is time, or
verbally from an inspector if there is not. A record must always be
made. We are not seeking the requirement of the same system of
authorisation in relation to the Army, because it does not operate
using similar systems. To make that requirement might induce confusion
and uncertainty, which we do not want to do. We will, however, require
a record to be made that can be examined with
hindsight.</div>

Majesty&#146;s forces on duty reasonably believes that a person is
unlawfully detained in such circumstances that his life is in
danger&#151;there cannot be a more serious situation&#151;he will
have to obtain authorisation under clause 24. Unless I am reading it
wrong, I cannot understand that difference between clauses 22 and
24.</div>

						</b> We are seeking to keep the matter as simple as
possible. The armed forces do not need to make a record because that is
not reasonably practicable in the situations that I have described. I
offer clarification of my earlier remarks: it will not be necessary for
the Army to make a written record. We want to keep the situation clear
and simple for the Army. We want the Army to have the powers in
question and not to have them confused or reduced by a requirement to
prove a connection with paramilitary activity before personnel can act.
The powers will facilitate rapid responses to what might be difficult
circumstances, and they are proportionate and represent the minimum
necessary.</div>

					<a name="07011971000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister
address the point that, like other clauses, clause 22 gives powers not
only to the Army, but to the police? A moment ago, he mentioned that
the police are subject to the police ombudsman. The Army will not be
subject to that process of scrutiny or to a complaints process. Do not
these clauses not only reverse the commitment made by the Governments
in the joint declaration of 2003 and what was enacted last year, but
breach Patten? The Patten report
stated:</div>

						</b> Patten recognised that there may still be a role
for the Army to play in a situation of extreme public disorder. We
recognise it too. Although the Army stationed in Northern Ireland
beyond July of this year will be a garrison force, we want to make
provision to ensure that, should the situation arise, the Army can act
decisively to protect public order and deal with explosives and other
difficulties.</div>

Friend the Member for Foyle, whom I am delighted to see here this

but he is here anyway and was not stopped and questioned along the way.
On the powers of the police ombudsman, the ombudsman is of course able
to investigate in relation to the
police.</div>
					<a name="07011971000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
will have noticed that the independent reviewer, whose prime purpose is
to review the powers that we are giving the Army and the police under
this part of the Bill, will also have a role to play in dealing with
any complaint that relates to military personnel. Such complaints are
very few and far between. From memory, I think that in the last year
there were perhaps just half a dozen&#151;a small number&#151;so we
do not anticipate that there will be many. There will be fewer still
when there are no Army personnel to be seen on a regular basis on the
streets of Northern Ireland, but we have a provision that will allow
complaints to be made and dealt
with.</div>

						</b> Will the Minister clarify the Government&#146;s

standards.</div>

that clause 24 includes the power of search while clause 22 provides
only for the power of entry. Those are different powers and we believe,
on balance, that one requires authorisation while the other does not.
The hon. Gentleman may or may not accept that explanation, but it is
the explanation that I
offer.</div>

that it was a probing amendment, and we can safely say that we have
probed, but I am not satisfied by the Minister&#146;s response as to
why the personnel we are discussing do not need permission to enter
premises. They are not going to just enter and stand there. Presumably
they are going to do something when they get in. Under clause 24,
however, they need permission to enter, even though that clause seems
to relate to a more urgent circumstance&#151;someone&#146;s life
being in danger.</div>

akin to, &#147;It would be ridiculous if the Army had more powers

it is indeed ridiculous for the Army to have more powers than the
police, the soldier on duty must have an obligation to take
details&#151;at least to have a record of the building. The

						</b> Clause 22 provides wide powers to enter premises.
It is considered necessary for the police to do so for the maintenance
of public order. The police do not need a warrant and there is no
requirement even for reasonable suspicion. That is worrying when it
applies to the police.</div>
					<a name="07011971000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have indicated
that the provision gives the police some flexibility, and they will
argue that police actions will be subject to accountability mechanisms
through the Policing Board and, importantly, through the police
ombudsman. The Government will indicate that there are new safeguards
for police officers getting authorisation. However, those powers are
also being given to the British Army, and the Army will not have to
seek authorisation.</div>
					<a name="07011971000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those powers are meant to be
used in support of the civil power. We are told that the Army will be
acting only in support of the civil power, but none of the civil power
standards will apply. As well as not seeking authorisation, the Army
will not have to keep records, as the police have to do. Those
aggrieved by such Army actions will find no means open to complain.
They may go to the police, who might want to be responsive and
understanding, but the police will not be able to help. That will
create a totally unsatisfactory situation, which breaches the Patten
vision.</div>
					<a name="07011971000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reply to
my earlier intervention, the Minister said that those powers will be
subject to annual review. Patten touched on the question of annual
review if there was unfortunately a need to continue any sort of
special provisions in Northern Ireland. What Patten said in that
respect was that such provisions</div>
					<a name="07011971000655"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should be subject to annual
independent review and to Parliament&#146;s approval of any or all of
them remaining in
force&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011971000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is,
annual renewal by Parliament, just as emergency provisions and special
laws always are. We should remember that, under the Bill, there will be
no more annual renewal. The powers will be there
permanently.</div>
					<a name="07011971000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">How can
the Government justify those wide powers for the Army? I think they go
too far, even in relation to the police, but at least we have some
comfort in accountability of the police service. If we get to
devolution of justice and policing, those powers are likely to be
reserved for legislation by this Parliament, not by the devolved
Assembly. The police service, supposedly under the devolved remit, will
be backed up by the Army&#151;obviously, not under the devolved
remit&#151;and both the police service and the Army will use
controversial special powers, which those in the devolved institutions
will have no right or role in reviewing or amending. That is contrary
to what people envisaged under the Good Friday agreement and the Patten
report.</div>
					<a name="07011971000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
ask the Minister to address the fact that, in relation to matters in
earlier clauses that refer to the courts and now these matters of
continuing the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 132</div>emergency powers permanently, the Government must think very carefully
about the exact situation that they are creating. They are creating a
situation of quicksand and confusion, and many people leading the new
beginning in the police service will be unhappy about that, whatever
their justification for retaining some powers. I understand that some
officers believe that some powers should be retained, not least in
relation to the possible difficulties that may arise&#151;we hope
that they will not&#151;with parades. The Government are going too
far with permanent sweeping provisions and such wide-ranging
clauses.</div>

							<a name="07011971000831"></a>Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman not overstating his case?
First, clause 22(1) clearly specifies a fairly high threshold in so far
as a member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces or a constable must consider
the action necessary. That is a fairly strong statement. It does not
say &#147;suspects&#148; or &#147;believes&#148;; it says
&#147;considers it necessary&#148;. There is a high threshold to be
met.</div>
					<a name="07011971000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
although the hon. Gentleman made an issue of the fact that the Army
will not be under the same constraints as the police, I cannot think of
any instance when the Army would not be accompanied by the police,
because they are there to help the police and to back them up. The only
situation in which they will be used is when the Chief Constable asks
them to help the police. There will be a police officer present who
must have the authorisation to which the hon. Gentleman
referred.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000832"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s points are flatly
contradicted by the Bill. If a police officer is always present and if
he needs authorisation, why are Army officers immunised from that need
for authorisation? If they are always accompanied by police officers,
why does the question of a soldier acting without authorisation arise?
Surely, the policeman who can obtain authorisation can act. Similarly,
if the Army will always be accompanied by the police, why is the power
of arrest, which we discussed on other clauses, necessary? The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument that the police will always be present is
an argument against the Army having such
powers.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000833"></a>Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> In practical terms, when the police and the Army
are involved in joint operations, the arrest may often involve a police
officer and an Army officer or a member of the Army, so they need to be
covered, so that they can jointly take part in such an arrest or
operation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000834"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> Why then has the hon. Gentleman not tabled an
amendment to give the Army the right to exercise those powers only in
circumstances when it is clearly acting in support of the civil power
withpolice officers present, having obtained the proper
authorisation and so on?</div>
					<a name="07011971000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman said earlier
that clause 22(1) provides a very high threshold and a very high
test&#151;it does not. It simply
says:</div>
					<a name="07011971000656"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A member
of Her Majesty&#146;s forces on duty or a constable may enter any
premises if he considers it necessary in the course of
operations&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 133</div>
					<a name="07011971000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It does not say that
he must have reasonable grounds; he has only to consider it necessary.
Many people may consider lots of things necessary in such
circumstances, but there is no serious test. In particular, when a
member of the forces is under no requirement to keep a record, we
cannot take the assurance that the hon. Gentleman suggests.</div>
					<a name="07011971000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made the point in
relation other clauses that the Government are reversing legislative
changes that Parliament made in the Terrorism Act 2006. I have still
heard no good explanation from the Minister about why the clear
statements and commitments from the Secretary of State that powers
would be renewed only until 31 July and would then be renewable for one
year only until July 2008 should be overtaken. What has changed in the
prevailing circumstances since the Secretary of State made those clear
unambiguous statements? After all, he was telling us in glowing terms
that things are getting better every day and that all sorts of bad
things are being put behind us. Why, then, are we having to make
emergency legislation permanent? Why, then, are we violating the Patten
vision of
policing?</div>

						</b> First, I assure the hon. Member for North Down
that I will be happy to consider the consistency between the clauses
and my remarks on clause 20. From memory, I think that I was talking
about the Army and the police in the same situation, saying that it
would be ridiculous for the Army to have more powers than the police if
they were both engaged in the same situation. However, I will happily
check and reflect on that point.</div>
					<a name="07011971000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for

renewal of powers. Again, that strays into territory that we are likely
to deal with later in our deliberations. We take the view that the
powers are limited when compared to the part VII powers and that they
will be necessary for some time to come. It seems quite unnecessary to
have to renew them every year, as we anticipate that they will continue
to be necessary. However, using reviewer&#146;s reports to the
Secretary of State and our other monitoring, we will see over time
which of these powers in the Bill are no longer necessary&#151;and
the Secretary of State has the power to repeal them. We prefer to take
that approach, rather than renewing the powers every
year.</div>

						</b> The Minister said that it is necessary for the
powers to remain in place. That may be the Government&#146;s clear
view now, but why has it changed from the clear view expressed by the
Secretary of State and Ministers when the House was debating the
Terrorism Act 2006, which would extend the powers to July this
year&#151;and only in extremis extend them for a further year and no
more? That was the Government&#146;s clear statement then. Are things

may endanger life. I make no apology for making such
proposals.</div>
					<a name="07011971000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
inject some realism into this debate. The Army no longer routinely
patrols the streets of Northern Ireland; as I have said, from the end
of July this year, we will have a garrison fort in Northern Ireland.
That brings me to the issue of proportionality in respect of the powers
that we are giving the Army. The Army would be operational in Northern
Ireland in support of the police only in extreme circumstances, such as
a Whiterock scenario or serious attacks involving explosives. Do my
hon. Friend and others expect the Government to rush back to get the
powers when the Army has to be deployed in Northern Ireland in an
emergency? No, it is much better to foresee any such eventuality now by
putting the powers in place. Every one of us hopes that they will never
need to be used, but if such extreme situations arise, the Army will
need them to protect life and protect
people.</div>

if now, in taking the bold step of repealing part VII of the Terrorism
Act 2000, we did not make sure that the police and the Army had
sufficient powers to deal with extreme situations. Pictures of the
serious disorder at Whiterock have been mentioned; I have seen them
too, and other members of the Committee may have seen the reality. No
responsible Minister would not empower the police and the Army to deal
with such situations as they
occur.</div>

					<a name="07011971000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Nicholas, it is generous of
you to allow time for Committee members to make points on each of the
clauses in stand part debates. My point is small and relates to the
drafting of clause 24(1), which
states:</div>
					<a name="07011971000660"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces on duty who reasonably believes
that a person is unlawfully detained in such circumstances that his
life is in danger may enter and search any premises for the purpose of
ascertaining whether the person is detained
there.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011971000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress that the
words &#147;a person&#148; are used twice in clause 24. It is
unfortunate that the opening words of subsection (2) are, &#147;A
person&#148;. That is confusing because it implies, wrongly, that
that person is somebody other than a member of Her Majesty&#146;s
forces. For the purposes of complete clarity and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 136</div>understanding of the clause, it would be helpful if the opening words of
subsection (2) were also &#147;A member of Her Majesty&#146;s
forces&#148;, rather than &#147;A person&#148;. It is a minor
point, but it would assist understanding of the

Durkan:
						</b> In response to earlier debates, the Minister
explained that the Army is intended to be down to garrison strength and
its personnel will very rarely be on duty, which means that they will
perform policing duties very rarely. On that basis, I do not know why
the Bill goes to such lengths to confer policing powers. The police
already get such powers under draft Police and Criminal Evidence Act
codes, and the matter is already governed by common law. Like the hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire, I have to ask what the justification is for
going any
further.</div>

							<a name="07011971000864"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I have said that what we seek to putin
place through the clauses that we are debatingthis afternoon
has been arrived at after careful consideration of the types of
scenario that may pertain and require the police to have certain
powers. The clause describes one of the scenarios with which we believe
the Army should be empowered to deal. I emphasise, however, that use of
the power must be authorised by a commissioned officer. We recognise
that it is a serious matter and that a commissioned officer should have
to give approval.</div>
					<a name="07011971000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Foyle is right to say that the police
already have sufficient powers under statute and common law to take
action to save life and limb. The power in the Bill applies only to the
armed forces. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, it is unlikely to be
used because it is increasingly unlikely that the Army will be deployed
in operational situations in Northern Ireland. However, should the
circumstances arise, the Army needs to be able to deal with them. If
someone has been kidnapped or imprisoned against their will, it is
important that the Army, as well as the police, should be able to deal
with it.</div>
					<a name="07011971000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to
the short speech and question of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire,
we need the powers because if someone has been kidnapped and if the

Minister has not addressed my concern, which is that we do not need
clause 24 because it is perfectly obvious that clause 22(1) covers the
same circumstances. More worrying is the fact that clause 24 does not
seem to impose the restrictions of authorisation outlined in detail in
clause 22. I do not see why the Minister thinks clause 24 is necessary.
It gives much more power to members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces than
clause 22 but without the authorisation limitations outlined in clause
22.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 137</div>powers of search and entry. We took considerable care when drafting
those powers to ensure that they are the minimum required in the

22 does not give powers of search and entry but merely of entry. That
is the only logical way to interpret what he said. That is worrying,
because it means that a constable can go into premises but do nothing
more. Will the Minister explain exactly what clause 22 does permit, as

sort of scenario that I painted when the hon. Member for Tewkesbury was
speaking was the example of a house being used by people who were
involved in rioting or whatever, and that the police or the Army had to
enter in the interest of maintaining the peace. Is the Minister saying
that the Army could not look into cupboards or under the stairs or
under beds to see if people were hiding there? Are they allowed only to
go through the

						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me
the opportunity to clarify my remarks. Clause 22 gives the power of
entry. Powers given elsewhere in the Bill enable Army personnel to take
further appropriate action. For example, schedule 3, which we have just
dealt with, gives the power to seize explosives. Having been given the
power to enter, the Army can take further action under the powers given
in schedule 3. Hon. Members will see that, throughout the Bill, the
Army is given other powers that maybe required in the scenario
that pertains. Initially, however, we need to give the Army the power
to enter, which is given in clause 22. Clause 24 gives additional

Durkan:
						</b> Clause 25 takes the powers inclause 23,
which we have already debated and agreed, and applies them to vehicles.
The powers to stop and search a person for explosives or to stop and
search someone in a car have been among the most controversial powers
in Northern Ireland. They were used systematically and were seen by
many as a tool for harassment because there was no requirement for
reasonable suspicion. Anyone in a public place or anyone making a
journey by car, whether every day for business, or for a Sunday run
over the border from Derry, could be searched at any time&#151;and
that happened. Whatever justification there may have been for that in
the past, when a significant number of explosions were happening in
Northern Ireland, we are now at a point when the power is not
necessary. Unfortunately, there are still some explosions, but the
number is far less than it was.</div>
					<a name="07011971000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not follow the logic
of everything that the Government tell us about the threat of terrorism
in Britain. The threat posed by al-Qaeda in Britain is far greater that
that posed by domestic terrorism in Northern Ireland, yet Britain has
no equivalent to the powers in clauses 23 and 25 or schedule 3. I
therefore oppose the clause standing part. If people cannot justify
those powers in Great Britain, given the threat of terrorism and
explosions there, how can they be justified in Northern
Ireland?</div>

					<a name="07011971000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 25 clarifies certain
powers, particularly the power to stop and search a vehicle. That is
important in respect of Northern Ireland and the type of threats 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 139</div>that we are discussing. Obviously, people can move vehicles round with
explosives in them so we must provide such powers. There is also a
power under the clause that requires someone to remain with a vehicle
or to go with it when it is searched for munitions and transmitters.
That is necessary as individuals could attempt to walk away from a
vehicle that is being searched. We have thought through the matter
carefully and believe that such powers are necessary in respect of both
premises and vehicles. I encourage the Committee to support the

can reassure the hon. Lady, who will acknowledge, of course, that a

more thorough examination by the authorities. The powers that we are
discussing will allow them to do that for 48 hours. Obviously, we have
spoken to the police and the Army about the time that it is likely to
take to decide whether those documents have evidential value. From
their experiences in Northern Ireland, they think that 48 hours is
sufficient. For example, they can draw on their experience at Whiterock
when documents seized by authorities turned out to contain detailed
plansfor the events conducted there by paramilitary
organisations. It took some time to analyse those
documents.</div>

Lady rightly pressed a key issue: if during those 48 hours it becomes
clear that documents contain evidence of an offence, they can be
retained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and used in a
prosecution. The powers before us simply allow the authorities to
remove documents for 48 hours in order to conduct their investigations.
I repeat: during that time, which the authorities tell us is
sufficient, if it becomes clear that the documents contain evidence,
they can be retained and used as such to prosecute those who might be
responsible for very serious offences. I hope that that reassures her.
The 48 hour cut-off time is simply for consideration of a

likely to be useful for terrorism&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011971000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">That examination might well confirm that
those documents and records are pertinent and useful to terrorists.
Please remember that clause 26 enables only a member of Her
Majesty&#146;s forces to carry out such an examination. Even if that
confirms the pertinence and usefulness to terrorism of the documents,
the Army can neither retain the documents nor, courtesy of clause 27,
to which we are about to come, make a copy or take a photograph of
them&#151;they must be returned. That does not make sense or seem
logical to me, since the offences are so
serious.</div>

no provision in the Bill for a member of Her Majesty&#146;s forces to
be duty-bound to pass on the documents. I asked him for assurances that
if Her Majesty&#146;s forces come to the conclusion that documents
that they have seized and examined within 48 hours would be useful for
the purposes of killing or terrorising people, the forces would be
duty-bound to transfer those documents to the police. That is certainly
not clear in the wording of the clause&#151;quite the opposite: they
will not be able to retain the
documents.</div>

completed. The hon. Lady rightly points out that the provision relates
only to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 143</div>Army powers, because police powers are set out in other legislation. If
documents reveal information pertaining to terrorism or the commission
of serious offences, the police will re-seize them under the provisions

Durkan:
						</b> Given that, in our earlier exchanges, we touched
on the possible role of the independent assessor, it is important that
we test a number of points on clause 39. The clause provides for the
Secretary of State to appoint a person to review the powers as an
independent assessor. That assessor will have limited powers to oversee
how the Army investigates complaints and will not have any powers to
investigate complaints. That is no substitute for the office of the
Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland being able to investigate the
Army when it plays a supporting role for policing. The reviewer will
come each year, and the British Army is obliged only to give such
information and documents as the independent assessor might reasonably
require. By contrast, the police ombudsman has the power in the conduct
of her duties to get any document that she needs.</div>
					<a name="07011971000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the Minister
explained earlier and that it is pretty clear in the Bill that the Army
does not have to keep any records of what it does or of its
justification for it in the exercise of a lot of its powers, it is hard
to know what the independent assessor will assess. We are told that the
annual review of how the powers work will be the subject of a robust or
significant report to the Secretary of State, and so the question
arises of how there is to be an independent review that does not
require renewal by Parliament if there are no records in relation to
the Army.</div>
					<a name="07011971000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee earlier dealt with clause 36, which requires the Chief
Constable to make records of the use of emergency powers. Of course,
that does not apply to the Army. It does not have to keep any records.
It is hard to see how the role of the independent assessor is in any
way significant in relation to the Army&#146;s use of the
powers.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 145</div>
					<a name="07011971000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us remember that the Bill
institutionalises emergency powers for the British
Army&#151;emergency powers that used to have to be renewed annually
in the heat of the troubles and in the face of all sorts of violence,
difficulty and turmoil. Now, in a morebenign situation, they
are being institutionalised as permanent. Will the Minister give us a
clear assurance that the references throughout the legislation to Her
Majesty&#146;s forces will apply only to the Regular Army and not to
MI5 or MI6, for instance?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000912"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> The Committee needs to bear in mind when
considering the clause the exceptional and limited role that the Army
will play in Northern Ireland beyond the summer of this year. My hon.
Friend asked about the role of the reviewer. The reviewer will be asked
to respond to three specific areas. First, he will be asked to review
the operation of sections 20 to 31, which are the measures that we
debated this afternoon. What the reviewer has to say about that will
play an important part in the Secretary of State&#146;s judgment on
whether to repeal any of the powers. The Secretary of State will
consider other matters, too, but the reviewer&#146;s report will be
essential in the consideration of whether to appeal any of the
powers.</div>
					<a name="07011971000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
role of the reviewer relates to military matters. The clause makes it
mandatory on the General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland to ensure
that he passes over to the reviewer all information relating to the
investigation of, and response to, complaints so that the reviewer can
be satisfied that the complaints have been properly and adequately
dealt with. I expect that those complaints would be few in number by
virtue of the fact that the military plays a rare role in Northern
Ireland at present. I confirm that the only personnel who would be
subject to that would be those who were under the command of the
General Officer Commanding Northern
Ireland.</div>
					<a name="07011971000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
third category of event or circumstance that the reviewer may consider,
and that is any specific matter that the Secretary of State asks the
reviewer to consider that is not already covered in the first two
remits that I have outlined. For example, if the Secretary of State
were concerned about the use of baton rounds in a public order
scenario, he could ask the reviewer to undertake a piece of analysis
and to report back to him. That is a limited role for the reviewer, but
it is important both in underpinning public confidence and the
confidence of the House in relation to the measures and in informing
the Secretary of State and helping him to reach a judgment about when
the right time might come to repeal some of the powers.</div>

							<a name="07011971000913"></a>Mr.
Reid:
						</b> I wish to speak to the new clause that stands in my
name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire. Its
effect would be that the powers that we have just debated in clauses 20
to 39 would have to be renewed annually. On Second Reading, we asked
the Minister how long he envisaged that the powers in those clauses
would be in place; we would like to see a situation in which such
powers were no longer necessary in Northern Ireland. Although clause 40
provides for the Secretary of State to repeal sections 20 to 39, there
is no provision for Parliament to take stock of whether the powers are
still necessary or to debate how they are being used. The clause allows
the Secretary of State rather than Parliament to decide when such a
debate might take place, and we believe that it is important that
Parliament should have an annual debate.</div>
					<a name="07011971000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 39 very helpfully
requires a reviewer to produce a report on the operation of the powers,
but makes no automatic provision for Parliament to consider the
reviewer&#146;s findings. It would be useful, given the nature of the
powers, for Parliament to discuss how they are being used and to take
account of the views expressed by the reviewer. New clause 5 is,
therefore, a simple repeal and renewal clause. It states that the
provisions of sections 20 to 39 should lapse at the end of a 12-month
period, but should be ableto be renewed by statutory
instrument for a further12 months. That is similar to
mechanisms thatare already in place&#151;for example, the
arms decommissioning schemes in Northern Ireland and control orders in
the United Kingdom as a whole.</div>

								Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman wants to
give the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny to these important and
significant powers. However, the level of parliamentary scrutiny that
is implied in his amendment is unnecessary and I shall explain
why.</div>
					<a name="07011971000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been
through an extensive process in considering the powers in part 17 of
the Terrorism Act 2000, many of which are being repealed and not being
replaced. However, we are replacing those that we regard as necessary
to deal with the ongoing situation and the risks that may arise as a
result of it. We have already reduced to a minimum the powers in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07011971000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all look
forward to the day when the situation in Northern Ireland is as secure
as it is in the rest of the United Kingdom and we work to that end, but
at the moment, and for the foreseeable future, we have to prepare on
the basis that an additional risk of serious public disorder exists in
Northern Ireland. None of us wants it, but what happened at Whiterock
shows that such events may still take place. It is a matter of record
that, since last summer, the activities of dissident republican groups
have caused about &#163;25 million-worth of criminal damage. There is
still a residual dissident threat and a threat of paramilitaries
feeding into and off organised
crime.</div>
					<a name="07011971000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remaining
threat must be taken seriously and it may remain for a considerable
time. All of us&#151;the police, politicians and
communities&#151;do what we can to counter that threat and to build
the conditions for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, but it is
likely that these powers will be needed for some time. I will come
later to the accountability
mechanisms.</div>
					<a name="07011971000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
repeat what I said in an earlier debate about the role of the
independent reviewer. He will report to the Secretary of State on the
working of the new powers and the Secretary of State must then place
his report before Parliament on an annual basis. There will be no
question of the Secretary of State making secret judgments that no one
knows about; the report will have to be placed before Parliament and on
the record. Members of the House will be able to scrutinise the report
and to ask questions about it. That is a sufficient and proportionate
level of accountability; it is not necessary to return to the House
every year to renew the powers in the
clause.</div>

						</b> You are, as ever, Sir Nicholas, very gracious in
allowing hon. Members to participate in stand part debates. Regarding
the interpretation section in clause 41, and picking up on the
Minister&#146;s point about records, I am unhappy that this is a
limited clause. Earlier on in our discussion on clauses 26 and 27, it
was brought to the Committee&#146;s attention that members of Her
Majesty&#146;s forces could seize 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 148</div>documents or records during a search. However, the definition and
interpretation in clause 41 are unclear as to whether a record includes
computer documents. That was alluded to by the Minister in response to
an intervention.</div>
					<a name="07011971000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if &#147;record&#148; were defined in the
interpretation, particularly in light of clause 27, which we did not
discuss. If Committee members turn to that clause, they will see that
multiple use of the word &#147;record&#148; creates confusion. Not
only does clause 27(1) state that there is a document or record, but

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):
						</b> I hope not to detain the Committee too
long. However, it might be helpful to its members, or at least to my
hon. Friend the Minister, if I briefly speak about the legal aid
provisions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 149</div>
					<a name="07011971000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of clause 43 is to
provide resident magistrates&#151;a reference I will use for the
benefit of discussing this clause only&#151;with maximum flexibility
in granting publicly funded legal representation. The current situation
is that a person charged with a scheduled offence before the
magistrates court must apply to the High Court for bail. The legal aid
available for that High Court application is entirely separate from the
legally aided representation assigned to the accused by the court for
the preparation of his
defence.</div>
					<a name="07011971000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
clause, all defendants in custody will be able to apply at the earliest
opportunity to the magistrates court for bail. Their bail application
with therefore be made under the legislation governing publicly funded
representation at magistrates court level. The will allow the resident
magistrates to target publicly funded legal aid towards the specific
legal need of those legally aided defendants. For example, if a
resident magistrate took the view that counsel would not be required
for the duration of the magistrates court proceedings, but that the
accused might benefit from advice for the purposes of, say, a bail
application, the clause would allow
that.</div>
					<a name="07011971000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be useful
to make it clear that the clause is not to do with restricting legal
aid for any financial reason. The intention is to make matters simpler
and clearer for both the defendant and the magistrate concerning the
application of legal aid. On that basis, I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

in Northern Ireland will be that each individual worker in the industry
will have to be the subject of proper checks in relation to criminal
records. It will also&#151;importantly&#151;be necessary for them
to have undergone adequate and proper training. The current system
simply involves licensing of companies, without reference to individual

common ground in the Committee. The measure is important in dealing
with organised criminal activity in Northern Ireland. The need to
tackle extortion and the type of private security that is criminal is
important to the future of Northern Ireland. I am delighted that the
Bill contains the measures and to be speaking in firm support of them.

Hermon:
						</b> I will not detain the Committee, but I need some
clarification on an issue that may be of some interest to you, Sir
Nicholas, as a proud representative of an English constituency. Why do
the provisions that enable the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
extend to England, Wales and even Scotland, which has its own judicial
system? The clause makes it clear that the powers of the commission,
which will be significantly increased under clauses 13 to 19, extend to
England, Wales and
Scotland.</div>
					<a name="07011971000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister give some justification for the far-reaching extension of the
powers of the commission? Were any hon. Members from constituencies
outside Northern Ireland sounded out about this? Did the commission
seek the extension? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 151</div>Will he give examples of situations in which the commission will need
the powers? Clause 13 gives the commission the power to institute
proceedings of its own volition, if a victim or potential victim is
involved.</div>
					<a name="07011971000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that
mean that residents of England, Scotland or Wales, who might not
necessarily be British nationals, can avail themselves of the right
given to them by the extension in clause 49 to oblige the Northern
Ireland Human Rights Commission to take judicial proceedings on their
behalf, even though they do not fall within the jurisdiction of
Northern Ireland? The commission has not justified to my satisfaction
such an enormous extension of its powers to the rest of the United
Kingdom.</div>

					<a name="07011971000462"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

						</b> You were not present, Sir Nicholas, for our
earlier discussions about the Human Rights Commission, but even so I
think that you would rule me out of order if I were to go into all the
arguments that we have had in previous debates. However, there is a
simple response to hon. Members&#146; questions. The Human Rights
Commission was established under UK-wide legislation, so the amendments
must apply on the same basis, which is why the provision has been

hope you will allow me to make the point, Sir Nicholas. The Bill is
entitled the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Bill, and it is
important to ensure that the Public Bill Committee accurately reflects
the possible relevance of the Bill to, in this case, Scottish
Members.</div>

justification extraordinary, since the Northern Ireland Act 1998
established the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in order to
implement the Belfast agreement, which was signed on Good Friday. I did
not think that the provisions extended to the entire UK, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 152</div>but there we are&#151;we learn something every day. I live in Northern
Ireland and I respect the commission&#146;s jurisdiction. Will the
Minister confirm, for the benefit of hon. Members who represent
constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, that anyone in the
jurisdiction of the United Kingdom can now ask the Northern Ireland
Human Rights Commission to take a case to court on their
behalf?</div>

fears. First, no one has pressed for the provisions. We have to make
them for legislative reasons, not because an external body has pushed
for them. The key point, which I hope will reassure her, is that
although the legislation in question is UK-wide&#151;we need to amend
it because of the changes that we are making in Committee&#151;the
provisions do not apply outside Northern Ireland. For example, the
power to enter institutions applies only in Northern Ireland. The
matter is simply legislative: because the legislation is UK-wide, we
have to amend the UK-wide legislation, but the powers relate only to
Northern Ireland.</div>

						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07011971000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should explain
to hon. Members that we modelled the new clause on section 55 of the
Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which gives the office of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 153</div>the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland relevant powers over Serious
Organised Crime Agency staff in Northern Ireland. At present, as per
Patten, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has primacy in matters
of national security, and the police ombudsman has the power to
investigate complaints regarding its handling of such matters. That
accountability has helped enormously to build confidence in the new
beginning for
policing.</div>
					<a name="07011971000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again and
again, the police ombudsman has investigated complaints that have gone
to the heart of national security, concerning issues such as the Omagh
investigation and Stormontgate, and the Government have yet to raise
any serious complaint. No one has even attempted publicly to argue that
it has been a bad thing. The sky has not fallen because the police
ombudsman&#146;s office has had that reach into activities and
information relating to national security; far from it, because the
office&#146;s function has been one of the pillars of confidence in
the new beginning for
policing.</div>
					<a name="07011971000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Monday,
the truth will emerge again with the police ombudsman&#146;s report
into the murder of Raymond McCord. It is widely expected that the
report will show, among other things, that an RUC informer murdered
again and again&#151;Catholics, Protestants, civilians,
paramilitaries and even a minister of religion&#151;and that it was
allowed to go on. That is the reality of what has happened in Northern
Ireland&#151;collusion and complicity. If the matter had involved MI5
work, we might not have found out about it, and if it were to happen in
future under the Government&#146;s proposed regime, we would not find
out about it. Under current plans, MI5 will deal with much of the work
related to domestic terrorism.</div>
					<a name="07011971000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lie is being sold, and some
foolish people have bought it, that MI5&#146;s role in the future of
Northern Ireland&#151;its expanded headquarters and its new
recruits&#151;is all about international terrorism. The reality is
that a large part of MI5&#146;s work in Northern Ireland will still
concern domestic terrorism. The Minister&#146;s comments in Committee
on Tuesday reflected that, because he recognised that the issues dealt
with in the Bill&#146;s earlier clauses touched on not only criminal
justice but national security. He was equally explicit then that
non-jury courts would relate only to domestic terrorism and Northern
Irish paramilitaries specifically, not international terrorism. It is
clear that MI5 will continue to play a significant role in that
area.</div>
					<a name="07011971000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is proposed
that primacy in national security will move in October from the Police
Service of Northern Ireland to MI5. If national security functions have
not been impaired or compromised in any way by the police
ombudsman&#146;s power to pursue information in investigations
relating to national security, including information in the hands of
MI5, what is the argument for saying that there is a risk in allowing
that to continue, if primacy
shifts?</div>
					<a name="07011971000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that the shift of primacy and the bogus separation sold to Sinn Fein in
the Prime Minister&#146;s statement is about separating the work of
MI5 from the scrutiny and challenge of the police ombudsman&#146;s
office. No one with possible cause for concern or complaint about the
work of MI5 in the future will be able to go to the police ombudsman,
whereas they can do that now. It is clear that under Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 154</div>proposals the police ombudsman will not be able to investigate what MI5
does in Northern Ireland, which clearly shows that there will be a loss
of accountability.</div>
					<a name="07011971000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Prime Minister&#146;s statement last week sought to tell us that
there will be no diminution in police accountability in Northern
Ireland, which will be true of PNSI accountability. It is true that the
PSNI will be no less accountable to the ombudsman, so the assertion in
the Prime Minister&#146;s statement is technically true. However,
what if someone were to say, &#147;Well, what about intelligence
policing in Northern Ireland? Will that be less accountable under the
new arrangements or not?&#148;? The fact is that it will be less
accountable. To that extent, the line in the Prime Minister&#146;s
statement is misleading and calculatedly misleading, as are some other
things in his statement, such as that the police officers who will
interact with MI5 will be &#147;PSNI headquarters staff&#148;. That
might sound the same as saying that they will be based at PSNI
headquarters, but it does not mean that. They might be PSNI
headquarters staff, but there is no guarantee that they will be based
in PSNI headquarters. Again, people who say that there will be no
co-location and that they have persuaded the Government of that are
either buying a lie or selling
one.</div>
					<a name="07011971000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">The structures
that are supposed to hold MI5 to account are, quite simply, useless.
Only people who believe that they were subject to MI5 surveillance and
attention can bring complaints against MI5 through the investigatory
powers tribunal. Do not just take my word for that, because it is
stated on the tribunal&#146;s own website. The investigatory powers
tribunal is pretty clear about who can and cannot bring a complaint,
and it is only those who have been the subject of attention from
MI5.</div>
					<a name="07011971000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">We therefore face
the ludicrous situation in which Osama bin Laden can complain about
MI5, but the Omagh families in Northern Ireland, who were let down by
MI5, cannot complain, even though MI5 did not bother to pass on a bomb
warning about Omagh for seven and a half years. It is bad enough that
people who may be victims of MI5&#146;s negligence or abuse of power
cannot bring complaints, but even if they were able to bring
complaints, do complaints to the tribunal go anywhere? The tribunal
investigated 380 complaints from its foundation in 2000 until 31
December 2004. How many of those complaints were upheld? Not one. How
many reasons were ever given? Not one. That is not accountability, and
it is certainly not accountability in terms of the Northern Ireland
standards that are now needed as per the Patten report and the Patten
vision. Hon. Members might be happy enough to have that level of
accountability for themselves, but MI5 will not play as concentrated
and sensitive a role in their constituencies as it will in
mine.</div>

Robertson:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is touching on a very
important subject. I looked, and continue to look, very closely at the
Omagh situation. Does he not feel that something as important as what
one might describe as the overseeing of the security services should be
done on a national basis&#151;a United Kingdom basis? He may well
have a point that it is necessary, because it is possible for people to
get away with anything on the basis of &#147;Oh, it&#146;s national
security.&#148; I am uncomfortable with that as well, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div>because almost anything can be excused, but does he not think that the
matter should be tackled more on a UK
basis?</div>

Durkan:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point. I
certainly have no case against it, but obviously I am trying to deal
with the Northern Ireland-specific situation. MI5 will be given a
distinctively different role in Northern Ireland from what it has had
before. It is being given big new headquarters and an enhanced and
enlarged role. Staff are being recruited, and it is deliberately
recruiting people with special branch experience. We are particularly
concerned about whether that is a means of creating some sort of
&#147;continuity&#148; special branch. Remember, people in the old
RUC special branch were involved in some of the worst aspects of
collusion or complicity, which involved allowing things to happen when
interventions by other officers might have prevented
them.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07011971000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying
to deal with Northern Ireland-specific issues. It is understood that
MI5 will have a role in Northern Ireland in respect of not only
international terrorism, but what is called domestic terrorism. The
Minister&#146;s arguments the other day were consistent with that. We
want to make sure that the police ombudsman has the same reach in
respect of those intelligence policing activities as it has on Northern
Ireland citizens to deal with Northern Ireland affairs, and that that
is not
diminished.</div>

							<a name="07011971000944"></a>Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> Once again, the hon. Gentleman is making a case
for extended powers for one of the SDLP&#146;s favourite
institutions&#151;the police ombudsman. The Chief Constable has
publicly insisted that his demand that all human intelligence sources
be handled by the PSNI in Northern Ireland has been met. Does the hon.
Gentleman not accept that his scenario could not exist, as the police
ombudsman will have the powers to review PSNI officers, and human
intelligence sources will be handled by
them?</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000945"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman needs to look at other sources;
the assurance on which he relies is not the only statement on the
issue. The picture is not as straightforward as he suggests. In respect
of sources that will be handled by the PSNI, remember that the key
issue is primacy.</div>
					<a name="07011971000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other people are being foolish
in trying to sell the false notion of separation between MI5 and the
PSNI. The hon. Gentleman suggests that all agents would be handled by
the PSNI, but the fact is that whoever handles those agents, a lot of
them will function according to the MI5 agenda and interest. That
further confuses the separation picture as well as the degree of
interaction in that handling. If primacy lies with MI5, that has to be
a worry.</div>
					<a name="07011971000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contrary to
what the hon. Gentleman also suggested, the SDLP is advocating not
extension of the police ombudsman&#146;s powers, but retention of the
scope of those powers as they currently apply to
national
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 156</div>security issues. At present, the police ombudsman can seek information
and inquire into the activities of MI5 in so far as they relate to
matters of intelligence policing conducted by the PSNI. Matters that
can be looked into now will not be able to be examined after primacy
switches.</div>
					<a name="07011971000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
system has worked well until now, with no crisis having been created
and no public interest having been compromised, why the shift? Some
Committee members may ask how the police ombudsman can be able to
pursue complaints against the PSNI and its officers and against a
UK-wide body. The fact is that the police ombudsman can already
investigate actions of staff of UK-wide bodies, such as the Serious
Organised Crime Agency. Legislation coming to Parliament will give the
Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland the power to do
likewise for Revenue and Customs staff and immigration staff when their
work touches on and reaches into policing
matters.</div>
					<a name="07011971000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
okay for those agencies and is compatible and consistent with Patten,
how can it be right to remove the police ombudsman&#146;s powers of
scrutiny and accountability in intelligence policing? That goes to the
heart of confidence in policing in Northern Ireland and is where the
worst abuses lie. Not only people with a political axe to grind but
victims have genuine grievances and misgivings about how things were
handled and how things that could have been prevented were
not.</div>
					<a name="07011971000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
is essentially about ensuring that the police ombudsman is still able
to perform the function that was envisaged before Patten. We must
remember that she was able to do so even then, before we had Patten and
before Secretary of State after Secretary of State assured the House
that the situation was benign. When there was a much greater threat and
more sensitive activity on national security and intelligence, the
police ombudsman&#146;s office was entrusted with the powers in
question, but now for some reason it will not be. The idea that we can
trust MI5 in a new role with diminished accountability does not square
with experience in Northern Ireland or with the reality that the
Government tell us we should
embrace.</div>

							<a name="07011971000946"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I credit my hon. Friend with one thing: he is
consistent and persistent in raising the issue. He has done so for a
considerable time now. We disagree and I am sure that we will continue
to do so this afternoon, but let us agree on one point: the police
ombudsman has done an extremely good job of ensuring that transparency
and accountability in Northern Ireland is second to none in the world.
There is more scrutiny, accountability and transparency in policing in
Northern Ireland than anywhere else. That has been needed to create
conditions in which, we hope, the whole community can have confidence
in and support the police and the rule of law. Any democratic society
requires that.</div>
					<a name="07011971000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
the answer that he gave to the hon. Member for East Antrim, I am
certain that my hon. Friend is seeking to extend the powers of the
police ombudsman to scrutiny of the Security Service. The Government do
not agree with that. My hon. Friend pointed out that other agencies
involved in law enforcement, such as the Serious Organised Crime
Agency, will come within the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 157</div>purview of the police ombudsman. He is right: that is because such
bodies are law enforcement agencies.The national security
intelligence service is not a law enforcement agency and it would
therefore be inappropriate for it to come directly under the
ombudsman&#146;s
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07011971000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
my hon. Friend does not accept this argument, but I shall put it
anyway: there is already scrutiny of and accountability for the
securityservice. There are the three groups of commissioners
who oversee various elements of covert work in Northern
Ireland:&#151;the intelligence commissioner, the interception of
communications commissioner andthe surveillance commissioner.
There is also the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee and
the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, on which my hon. Friend went into
some detail, which was established in the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000.</div>
					<a name="07011971000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend cited the case of Omagh, as he and his colleagues do
regularly, and I echo the comments made by the hon. Member for East
Antrim. The allegations that my hon. Friend made this afternoon on the
failure to pass on information relating to Omagh have been refuted
clearly by the Chief Constable. Our legal advice confirms that the view
of the president of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal is that it has
appreciable discretion to consider whether to hear and determine
complaints against the intelligence and security agencies. It has more
discretion than my hon. Friend gives it credit for, including the
discretion to consider complaints from people who are not the subject
of the surveillance&#151;in other words, third parties can make a
complaint. I keep hearing the argument that my hon. Friend has made
today and I say to him in absolute sincerity that if people believe
that there are grounds for a complaint, he should encourage them to
make one, rather than persist with the argument that it is impossible
for them to do so. Our legal advice is that it is possible for a third
party to make a complaint, and the tribunal is the proper place to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07011971000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the police
ombudsman has reason, consistent with her legal powers, to investigate
the activities of a PSNI officer, she will continue to have the same
powers as she has now. In that connection, the Security Service and the
ombudsman&#146;s office have been working together to agree
arrangements governing the ombudsman&#146;s access to sensitive
information held by the Security Service. Sometimes, when conducting
her own investigations in relation to her own remit, the ombudsman will
need access to such sensitive information. It is a matter of record
that the Security Service and the ombudsman are discussing arrangements
for the sharing of such information and the drawing-up of protocols,
which will also involve the Chief Constable. However, that applies only
in relation to the investigations that the ombudsman is permitted to
carry out, which does not and will not include investigations into
staff working for the Security Service.</div>
					<a name="07011971000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition to the scrutiny
bodies that I have outlined, and following the announcement by my right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister, Lord Carlile will also carry out annual
reviews of the operation of the
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 158</div>arrangements. I should remind the Committee that those arrangements are
normal and that it is abnormal for the national security intelligence
security to be accountable to the Chief Constable in the way that it is
at present. It is normal for such arrangements to be back on a UK-wide
basis, and that should be celebrated as part of the return to normality
that we all want to see in Northern Ireland. In conducting his
investigations, Lord Carlile will consult the Chief Constable, the
Policing Board and the police ombudsman, as well as talking to the
First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and taking account of
their views before reaching his own conclusions. Therefore, in addition
to all the oversight that is already in place, there is also the role
of Lord Carlile.</div>

						</b> The constituency of Montgomeryshire, for
those who are not familiar with Lord Carlile&#146;s Commons history.
Although we can all agree that he does exceptional work in his scrutiny
role, the Minister will remember, as the hon. Member for Foyle and I
said during our discussion of clause 7, that Lord Carlile&#146;s
advice has been ignored. Although the Minister highlights the role
played by Lord Carlile and others in the scrutiny of the security
services, one of our concerns is that the Government may ignore their
advice. To some extent, that compromises the case that the Minister is
making to try to reassure us.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000950"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I do not agree with that remark. Lord Carlile has
established a first-class reputation for his work and makes his
recommendations. Although Ministers do not always agree with his
conclusions, it is interesting that the Prime Minister was happy with
his work and had enough confidence in him to invite him to take on his
current role. Indeed, Lord Carlile was happy to accept that role, and I
am sure that he will carry it out in his customary style. That will
help to underpin the new and normal arrangements for national security
intelligence to which we are moving.</div>
					<a name="07011971000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude, in addition to the
measures that I have outlined, we have indicated that, as far as
possible, we will make available to the public a high number of the
memorandums of understanding drawn up between the Security Service, the
ombudsman and, indeed, the Chief Constable. We have also indicated that
we are happy for human rights advisers to the Policing Board to give
their views on those memorandums. We are trying to be as open and
transparent as possible, but we are not acceding to the request that
the ombudsman should have full scrutiny powers over national security
intelligence service personnel. In the end, it comes down to the fact
that in Northern Ireland we have a police service that is open to
greater scrutiny than any other in the world. As I have said, that
should give us confidence.</div>

					<a name="07011971000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">Issues of
national security cannot be subject to the same level of transparency
as matters of policing. There are reasons why that is so. I am not
saying that there should not be any accountability. I have just listed
a range of measures by which the Security Service is held to account.
As the hon. Member for North Down has reminded us, we face dire threats
from international terrorism as well as the remaining dissident threat
and other threats. It is important for the security and safety of
ordinary people of Northern Ireland that the Security Service can do
its job in an accountable way, but in a way that is not suited to the
remit of the police ombudsman.</div>
					<a name="07011971000503"></a><div class="hs_Para">I regret to say to my hon.
Friend the Member for Foyle that he and I will continue to disagree on
the issue. However, I know that he will carry on making his point. He
will do so as genuinely and constructively as he can, but we have to
part company on the
issue.</div>

							<a name="07011971000951"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> I thank the Minister, at least for his last point.
There is not much else for which I can thank him, but I genuinely thank
him for what he said. He has made that point privately both to me and
others. I hope that he accepts that, in advancing such arguments as we
have been doing for a long time, neither I nor any of my colleagues are
playing electoral politics. We are not. If the hon. Gentleman does
accept that, I hope that he will convey it to the Secretary of State
who has accused us of doing precisely that. The right hon. Gentleman
has pretended to the BBC that he does not understand our worries or
what we said about the Prime Minister&#146;s written statement last
week, and says that we are just playing electoral politics. We are
not.</div>
					<a name="07011971000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other people
might be approaching the matter with an eye to electoral politics, and
spinning things for the Sinn Fein leadership and so on. We are not
approaching anything to do with policing, justice and the Patten vision
with an eye to electoral politics. In terms of electoral politics it
has cost us to uphold Patten, implement Patten and take our stand for
Patten. We are not playing electoral politics and we have never
approached such issues from that standpoint. I hope that the Minister,
who genuinely accepts that point, can persuade his right hon. Friend to
accept it,
too.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000952"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> It has been fairly evident from our debates that
an election is due in Northern Ireland. Various points have been made
sharply with one eye on 7 March. I rejoice in that because it means
that we can be confident that there will be an election and restored
devolution, something that we all celebrate as and when it happens. I
have every confidence that it
will.</div>
					<a name="07011971000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">To underline my
comments to my hon. Friend, I repeat that he has been consistent and
persistent in raising such issues. He has not just raised them in
recent weeks. He has done so over a period of time. I want to put that
on the
record.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000953"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> I think that the Minister is referring to a
motivation for the Prime Minister&#146;s written statement last week
and the fact that it was signalled in advance to Sinn Fein. The first
time that many hon. Members knew that it would be issued was as a
result 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 160</div>of the Sinn Fein press release the day before, which purported to say
what was in it. That was obviously to do with electoral politics, but
not the old axis of Sinn Fein-IRA; it showed the new axis of Sinn
Fein-NIO. It was clearly about electoral advancement. When some of us
are pre-emptively attacked before a statement is issued courtesy of a
Sinn Fein statement, we believe that we have the right to defend
ourselves. We also think that we have the right to point out those
parts of the Prime Minister&#146;s statement that are pure figment,
and those parts that are mere fig leaf in respect of Sinn Fein&#146;s
pretences about the
issue.</div>
					<a name="07011971000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">I go back to
the substance of the debate. The Minister made a strong point about the
role of Lord Carlile. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire made a valid
comment. How can we rest on the subject of the Government&#146;s
reliance on the strong role for Lord Carlile when they feel free to
dismiss his advice and clear recommendations? He made it clear that if
there were to be any retention or renewal of emergency or special
powers in Northern Ireland they should be renewed annually, as before,
and not made permanent. The Government tell us, &#147;Lord
Carlile&#151;that&#146;s good enough,&#148; but those of us who
do not agree with his finding that the powers are appropriate are not
convinced that he is the right person. When we see that the Government
ignore his key caveat that the powers have to be annually renewable, we
are left to ask, &#147;If we are not content with his judgment on one
point and the Government are not on another, what&#146;s the big
deal?&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011971000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
remember that all that Lord Carlile will dois review. That is
no substitute for the police ombudsman&#146;s complaint and
investigation role. The Minister also raised the point of the
Investigatory Powers Tribunal, suggesting that I should
&#147;encourage&#148; people to complain to it. Given the record of
how it deals with complaints and the fact that no reason has even been
given, I am not sure that the word &#147;encourage&#148; describes
how one could convince people to go to the tribunal.</div>
					<a name="07011971000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">Significantly, the Omagh
families have made their case to a number of people about the
difficulties that they see. They tried to take their case to the head
of MI5, for instance, they wrote and sought meetings, they wrote to
Ministers and so on. Nobody has given them the formal advice,
&#147;Oh, there&#146;s no point coming to us with this. It&#146;s
really a matter for the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.&#148; It is
not some misunderstanding on my part that the Investigatory Powers
Tribunal deals only with people who have been investigated by MI5, but
that is clearly the understanding of the tribunal itself and what is
understand by anyone who consults its
website.</div>
					<a name="07011971000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
satisfied that the Minister has answered the points. We are not looking
to extend the reach of the police ombudsman in Northern Ireland into
what people might call matters of national security. We want to allow
the police ombudsman to continue to have a reach into those matters
that citizens of Northern Ireland would have cause for concern or
complaint about that related to matters relating to Northern Ireland.
We are talking about sealing and preserving the role of the police
ombudsman that has helped to underpin the new beginning to policing and
has not undermined national security.</div>

Durkan:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07011971000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
purports to address a change made by earlier legislation on the
devolution of justice and policing in Northern Ireland. The Northern
Ireland Act 1998 provided that the devolution of justice required
cross-community consent in the Assembly. On current party strengths,
the votes of the Ulster Unionist party, the SDLP and Sinn Fein together
would be sufficient to achieve that consent. That clear provision in
the Northern Ireland Act was amended by the Northern Ireland
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, which provided instead that the
devolution of justice could not occur unless the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister moved a motion approved by the higher threshold
of parallel consent. The key difference, therefore, is that on current
party strengths the consent of the Democratic Unionist party is needed.
Also on current party strengths, a DUP Member would hold the office of
First Minister, which would give it another
veto.</div>
					<a name="07011971000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
might recall that at the time when the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act was passed, we warned that the DUP might be inclined to
abuse those vetoes, and so it has proved with the stand-off between
Sinn Fein and the DUP. Sinn Fein will make a clear move on policing
only if the DUP agrees a date for the devolution of justice and
policing, but the latter is content to hold the triple-lock veto in its
pocket; so the DUP has essentially given Sinn Fein a veto on
restoration, and Sinn Fein has given the DUP a veto on policing. Which
will blink next? The Prime Minister cannot wink for both of
them.</div>
					<a name="07011971000538"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that
the Secretary of State recognises some of the difficulties that he
created&#151;to be fair to him, he did not start it&#151;when he
legislated for the triple lock in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 162</div>the 2006 Act. In a paper that he released over the Christmas recess he
indicated that he wants to put a time limit on the triple lock so that
it is not indefinite. At a later stage, we will make our own proposals
to address that issue. However, to revert to the position of allowing
devolution to be triggered by cross-community consent in the Assembly
and not allowing things to be dependent entirely on a DUP veto, which
they have been abusing, would be one step forward. That is the intended
effect of the new clause. It would restore the position provided for by
this House in the 1998
Act.</div>

							<a name="07011971000972"></a>Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> Some of us have listened to the rhetoric of the
SDLP for a very long time about the need for confidence,
cross-community support and inclusiveness&#151;arguments that it has
used time and time again to ensure that Sinn Fein is included in every
decision in Northern Ireland. The explanation given by the hon. Member
for Foyle for the new clause was staggering. He has shown clearly that
inclusiveness as defined by him and his party must include only the
people with whom he agrees or is associated, but certainly not those
opposed to his point of view. That, of course, is what the new clause
is all about.</div>
					<a name="07011971000540"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why parallel consent was required in the 2006 Act was simple:
the devolution of policing and justice is of such importance that it
can only take place when there is absolute confidence within the
community that the right conditions have been met. That means that the
views of whichever parties happen to represent the majority of
unionists and nationalists cannot be ignored. To talk of inclusiveness,
without recognising that the support of the majority grouping on either
side is required, is plain
daft.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07011971000684"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07011971000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Foyle has hit on the problem that is caused. Sufficient confidence
needs to be generated on both sides of the community. It might well be
that nationalists are happy: indeed the SDLP indicated in the Committee
on the Preparation for Government last summer that it wished to see the
devolution of policing and justice on the day of devolution. It is one
thing to say that nationalists are happy about the devolution of
policing and justice and that it should therefore happen, but that
ignores the confidence that is required on the Unionist side.</div>
					<a name="07011971000542"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parallel consent was an attempt
to ensure that the devolution of policing and justice would and could
only happen in circumstances in which it could work. That is important.
The devolution of policing and justice in the absence of parallel
consent&#151;a move away from parallel consent&#151;would create
difficulties in a newly formed Assembly, and difficulties for
confidence in devolved policing and justice.</div>
					<a name="07011971000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DUP wishes to see the
devolution of policing and justice in Northern Ireland, just as it
wishes to see the devolution of all other functions. That has been put
on the record of the House on a number of occasions and on the record
of the discussions at Stormont, at which some SDLP Members were
present. The hon. Member for Foyle may have been present at some of the
meetings in which I was involved. However, devolution can only be done
in circumstances where there is confidence. We hope that that will
happen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 163</div>sooner rather than later. Generating confidence is not solely within the
remit of Unionists generally or the DUP in particular. The lack of
confidence is a result of the attitude of Sinn Fein, which will be one
of the major parties to deal with policing in the Northern Ireland
Assembly. The job of working towards a position that generates
confidence is for Sinn Fein.</div>
					<a name="07011971000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">This form of words on
devolution was used in the comprehensive agreement, in discussions in
the summer at Stormont and by the leader of the DUP in the House. We
wish devolution to happen as soon as is possible, but it cannot happen
unless there is confidence on both sides of the community that it can
work and unless those who will be involved in policing and justice
matters are genuinely supportive of the police. For that reason,
parallel consent is important. It is the one way of ensuring that the
decision is inclusive and cross-community, and that it will work in the
long term.</div>

							<a name="07011971000973"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle has raised a
matter that clearly requires urgent consideration, as we move gradually
towards full support for policing, the rule of law and devolved
government. I warmly welcome the remarks of the hon. Member for East
Antrim, who said this afternoon&#151;not for the first
time&#151;that his party agrees with and wants the devolution of
justice and policing. Of course, as I set out in the St. Andrews
agreement, the Government believe that if we have full support for the
rule of law, policing and the courts, and if we get the election and
devolved government, we can devolve policing and justice by May 2008.
That is possible so long as all parties work in good faith towards that
end. </div>
					<a name="07011971000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
invites the Committee to overturn Parliament&#146;s decision on the
provisions for the devolution of policing and justice. Of course I
shall argue against that and will encourage the Committee not to accept
his arguments. It has always been the Government&#146;s position that
policing and justice can be devolved only on a sustainable basis with
broad, cross-community support. Consistent with that position, it is
our view that the support of a majority of both sectors of the
community in Northern Ireland is essential if the devolution of
policing and justice is to succeed. That is why section 16 of the
Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 makes it clear
that the Secretary of State cannot introduce an order to devolve
policing and justice unless both the following conditions are met: the
motion asking that he do so is tabled by the First Minister and the
Deputy First Minister acting jointly and that motion receives support
in the Assembly from a majority of designated nationalists and a
majority of designated unionists&#151;the so-called 50:50:50
method.</div>
					<a name="07011971000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for East Antrim was right. Because the issue is
controversial&#151;it goes to the heart of confidence in policing and
sustainable democratic, peaceful conditions in Northern
Ireland&#151;it is right that a higher threshold be set in relation
to it than is, perhaps, the case for the devolution of other matters.
We make no apology for that. It is clear; it is in the legislation; and
most importantly, it can be done if the parties act in good faith and
work together to ensure that it can happen.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div>
					<a name="07011971000548"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me make one final point,
which might help the Committee. The transitional Assembly&#146;s
programme for government committee sub-group on policing and justice,
which I had the pleasure of engaging with a few days ago, is
considering various departmental models to support policing and justice
once they have been devolved. As part of that, it is considering a
paper that was put to it in December by my right hon.
Friendthe Secretary of State, which sets out a further
departmental model that might be capable of commanding support across
the parties. The sub-group has not yet come forward with any
conclusions. It might do so in the near future, and if it does,
Ministers will need to give urgent and careful consideration to what
action the Government may need to take in light of those findings,
conclusions and recommendations. I draw that to the Committee&#146;s
attention as a matter of courtesy, because it might be necessary to
return to those issues on Report and to debate matters that have not
arisen in Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000974"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> The hon. Member for East Antrim suggested that the
SDLP is somehow parting from the principle of inclusiveness&#151;it
is not&#151;or from the principle of cross-community support. It is
not. We seek to return to the provisions of the 1998 Act, which
legislated for the Good Friday agreement and are based on
cross-community support. That is the basis on which we say that
devolution should happen. That is what the 1998 Act provided for and
the Patten report envisaged, and it is what we are trying to achieve.
Instead, however, he is trying to say that the only test of
cross-community support should be the parallel consent or the 50:50:50
method that the Minister mentioned.</div>
					<a name="07011971000550"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be clear: the hon.
Member for East Antrim and his party did not like parallel consent when
it came to electing the First and Deputy First Ministers. They did not
want a test of cross-community support then. No, there had to be no
vote at all&#151;just one party nominating, with exclusive rights of
nomination, and the other party doing the same. Under the 1998 Act, the
First and Deputy First Ministers had to be proposed and accepted by
parallel consent, and that is the only instance under the agreement in
which it has happened. One other narrow provision requires parallel
consent, but it has thankfully never had to be used.</div>
					<a name="07011971000551"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DUP did away with parallel
consent to elect the First and Deputy First Ministers, and Sinn Fein
went along with the DUP. In everything else that is subject and open to
cross-community support, a 60 per cent. Assembly majority would
suffice, provided that at least 40 per cent. of nationalists and
Unionists were part of that majority. The DUP and Sinn Fein have moved
away from the wider and more flexible yardstick of cross-community
support to parallel consent and 50:50:50, because that gives each party
a veto, which they can abuse tactically to hold the rest of us hostage
and to hold Government to ransom for all sorts of concessions, some of
which have nothing to do with the issue that they are vetoing. The DUP
might be comfortable using the parallel consent veto, but it should be
remembered that it is going into the hands of others as well. We are
not departing from cross-community support; we are trying to return to
it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 165</div>
					<a name="07011971000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the remarks of the
hon. Member for East Antrim on his willingness to see the devolution of
justice. He strikes a different tone from many of his colleagues who
said, particularly during the passage of the Northern Ireland
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, that they did not envisage that
the devolution of justice and policing would happen in their lifetime,
competing to say how many lifetimes it would take. I made the
observation elsewhere that we have known for many years that there is a
strong Free Presbyterian presence in the DUP, but it was news to us
that there were so many Buddhists. It was going to take so many
lifetimes that they would have to come back to stop the devolution of
justice and policing.</div>
					<a name="07011971000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the fact that the
hon. Gentleman takes a different tone. There is a bit more realism
about the devolution of justice and policing, and the Secretary of
State has helped by pointing out that considerable devolution has
already taken place. The establishment of the PSNI has devolved to the
Policing Board and the Chief Constable, separately or between them,
powers that used to lie with the NIO and the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="07011971000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are caught
in a debate now because Sinn Fein has exaggerated and distorted
devolution issues for its own purposes, and it has served the DUP to
counter-exaggerate them, which is why we heard about so many lifetimes.
I am glad to see a bit more realism and perspective. That being so, why
do we need to retain the vetoes in this way?</div>
					<a name="07011971000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has told us that
Parliament cannot be asked to reverse what it provided for in the
Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. In the same
remarks, he told us that a sub-committee ofthe programme for
government committee in the transitional Assembly is considering the
Secretary of State&#146;s paper of late December, but that paper says
that, if a vote does not take place under the 2006 Act to devolve and
appoint a Minister by May 2008, the Government will take all necessary
steps to make that happen, including appointing a Minister for justice
to work in a devolved capacity. That completely contradicts what he
said&#151;that it could never be done and that cross-community
support was absolutely necessary. Contradictions and limitations are
emerging in the Government&#146;s
position.</div>

Goggins:
						</b> To clarify my remarks, I was simply pointing out
that my hon. Friend was inviting the Committee to overturn the previous
settled view of Parliament. Obviously, that is possible, but I was
making it clear that he is encouraging us to subvert a decision
previously taken by Parliament. That is just a matter of
fact.</div>

Durkan:
						</b> When we look at the Minister&#146;s remarks we
will see that he said a little more than that in respect of his
emphasis when echoing the hon. Member for East Antrim on the
prerequisite of having cross-community support as measured by parallel
consent before anything could happen. The Secretary of State&#146;s
paper shows that he now recognises that a difficulty has been caused by
creating an open-ended veto in the form of the triple lock.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div>
					<a name="07011971000558"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is hard to see how anyone
will rely on the certainty of a date such as May 2008 if one party can
postpone it indefinitely just by using the existing legislative
provision; it needs to be qualified, checked or overridden in some
other way. It seems clear from the paper that that is what the
Secretary of State is minded to do. It would not surprise me if, later
on in consideration of either the Bill or subsequent legislation, we
found ourselves doing precisely that. It would not be the first time
that the Government had produced a legislative multi-point turn on the
same issue, taking first one direction and then another. That is what
will happen.</div>
					<a name="07011971000559"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
asking members of the Committee to subvert the Northern Ireland
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006; I am asking them to revert to the

policing. Those provisions were agreed on a multi-party basis, not

Goggins:
						</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. I am pleased
to rise to express my thanks to all those who have been involved in our
deliberations. Three things have been apparent to me throughout. First,
we have had ample time to carry out our discussions and to deal with
challenging questions, as is evident from the stage that we have
reached. I am sure that we all have welcomed having enough time and not
having to deal with other pressures that force decisions in an untimely
way.</div>
					<a name="07011971000582"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, all
members of the Committee have shown good humour and courtesy in our
discussion of difficult and important issues. It is always good when
the House and its Members operate in that
way.</div>
					<a name="07011971000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, I note
the sheer hard work that many hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee undertook to prepare for these sittings and for making their
arguments, and I include my hon. Friends and others who may not always
have participated in our debates, but who were always there when it
counted.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div>
					<a name="07011971000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I thank my
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs,
who led on several issues. I am grateful for that, and am also grateful
to the Whip and his colleagues, who helped us to stay in
tune.</div>
					<a name="07011971000585"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to you,
Sir Nicholas, and to Mrs. Anderson that we very much
appreciate the way that you have chaired our proceedings. Without
doubt, you helped to keep the matter in hand clear, and you sometimes
reminded us that we were making an intervention, not a
speech.</div>
					<a name="07011971000586"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank among
the hard workers all my officials,who worked diligently in
Committee, but also in preparation for it. Much work lies ahead on some
promises that I made to reconsider the wording of various parts of the
Bill. The Committee is a point of scrutiny. It is important that we
bear in mind all the arguments that have been made, and we will do
that.</div>
					<a name="07011971000587"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I thank
the Clerk and <i class="I">Hansard</i> for their untiring and unstinting efforts
to keep us well advised and to record our proceedings. Again, thanks to
you, Sir Nicholas, for presiding over the
Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000994"></a>Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> Further to that point of order,Sir
Nicholas. I join the Minister in thanking you and Mrs.
Anderson for giving up so much time to chair the Committee, and for the
competent and occasionally humorous way in which you did
it.</div>
					<a name="07011971000589"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my hon.
Friends, who have been with me most of the time. As the Minister said,
my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes, who,
unfortunately, is not with us today, and my hon. Friends the Members
for Peterborough and for Wellingborough made several telling
interventions.</div>
					<a name="07011971000590"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
the Minister for his approach to the Bill. He said at the outset that
he would listen and think about the issues. He has quite a bit of work
to do before the Bill becomes law, as he kindly said that he would
reconsider several
matters.</div>
					<a name="07011971000591"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a wider
basis, I thank the Northern Ireland Office for its approach to
legislation. It offers briefings to Opposition Members and facilities
when we travel to the Province. That is very much appreciated. Such
actions help to avoid unnecessary party political squabbles and enhance
the quality of the debates. I thank the Minister&#146;s officials,
the Clerk and <i class="I">Hansard</i> for their help as
well<i class="I">.</i>
					</div>
					<a name="07011971000592"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish
the Bill well. We highlighted several issues and concerns. They may
sometimes appear to be small, but they can have a disproportionately
bad effect, so we have been right to raise them. I have very much
enjoyed the Committee, and I look forward to the next stage of
consideration.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000593"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07011971000995"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> Further to that point of order,Sir
Nicholas. I congratulate the Minister, who has been annoyingly
misguided from time to time&#151;that is, when he did not take on my
point of view&#151;but nevertheless proved himself a lovely fellow.
He has a beguiling manner, which will no doubt put him in good stead as
we approach other
deadlines.</div>
					<a name="07011971000594"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
parenthesis, may I observe to Northern Ireland colleagues that it is
obviously possible to get all the work done well ahead of a deadline
and not force the Government to postpone things yet again? There has
been a remarkable degree of joint working between parties in the past
four sittings.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 168</div>
					<a name="07011971000595"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make a serious point to the
Minister: he can see that when the Government give space for proper
debate and the opportunity to amend legislation, things work quite
well. That is a further reason to learn from the positive example of
the Committee the lesson that if statutory instruments were also
amendable, he would probably receive a positive response. The
Government have nothing to fear by introducing the ability to amend in
that context.</div>
					<a name="07011971000596"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Tewkesbury said that there is unfinished business,
which we shall return to on Report, as right hon. and hon. Members
know. I therefore finish by thanking you, Sir Nicholas, for your
irrepressible charm as our Chairman. You make democracy a delight, and
it has been a real pleasure to serve under you these past four
sittings.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000597"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000996"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> Further to that point of order,Sir
Nicholas. I pick up where the hon. Gentleman left off, by thanking
you&#151;not only for your charm, but for your courtesy and special
consideration of my position. Unlike the other hon. Members who have
spoken, I find it hard to thank everybody for being here for the whole
time, when I was not. However, I hope that that is fully understood and
that, as we finish today, hon. Members appreciate that absence all the
more.</div>
					<a name="07011971000598"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all the
Committee staff who have supported us in our consideration. I thank the
Minister for the degree to which he listened and responded. He perhaps
did not heed or accept, but at least he listened and responded in a
clear and respectful
manner.</div>
					<a name="07011971000599"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Tewkesbury touched on the fact that there are some difficult
issues in the Bill, and the Minister said that he would consider some
matters further. Other matters will have to be considered further,
although that will be based not only on the issues that have been aired
in Committee. However, that is for a later stage, so I thank you
again,Sir Nicholas, and your co-Chair, Mrs.
Anderson, under whom I did not serve due to other
circumstances.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000997"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b> Further to that point of order,Sir
Nicholas. I regard you as being in a league of your own when it comes
to chairing Committees. I have had the great fortune of sitting on many
Committees that you have chaired, many of which were controversial and
sensitive, given the suffering that people have gone through in
Northern Ireland. You are always exceedingly gracious, good tempered
and patient, in allowing lengthy interventions, yet making all members
of the Committee, including the Minister, feel that they have had ample
time to air their views. I pay you the warmest
tribute.</div>
					<a name="07011971000601"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that Mrs. Anderson was looking forward to seeing all the
Committee members back next week, so she will be enormously
disappointed that we shall not be sitting then. She was entirely
charming in chairing the Committee this morning, so I extend thanks to
her, too.</div>
					<a name="07011971000602"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
thank&#151;this is not a hierarchy&#151;the Doorkeepers, who had to
open, close and lock the door, aided and abetted by the hon. Member for
Foyle, who made use of his time when he was here. I
also
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 169</div>thank the <i class="I">Hansard </i>staff, who kindly returned by post this morning
my only surviving copy of the Belfast agreement, which is a rare
collector&#146;s
item.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000603"></a><div class="hs_Para">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971000999"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b> It is never to be extinct. That brings me to the
point in play&#151;the teasing of the hon. Gentleman, who was very
tolerant of that teasing, which came not only from me, but from hon.
Members throughout the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07011971000605"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
thank the officials. I have been critical of the drafting, but in a
previous incarnation I taught in the law faculty at Queen&#146;s
university and did some proof-reading. It is the main aim of all
members of the Committee and all officials to get it right&#151;for
Her Majesty&#146;s forces, the judges, the judiciary, the ombudsmen
and Police Service of Northern Ireland officers, who have to apply the
law that we introduce in the House.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000686"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="07011971000606"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last but
certainly not least, I thank the Minister. As always, it has been a
delight to tease, cajole and persuade him, and to try to entice him
into changing his mind on various matters. It is exceedingly difficult
to fall out with him. He is an exceedingly good Minister and it has
been delightful to see him in Committee. In fact, this has been one of
the nicest Committees of which I have had the good fortune to be a
member.</div>
					<a name="07011971000607"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs responded at a very
opportune time this afternoon on the matter of bail conditions&#151;I
have to say that until then I had never understood them. The demise of
resident magistrates could not possibly have been handled any more
elegantly and fairly. So, goodbye to the resident magistrates and thank
you to the Ministers. The Committee has been wonderful, and I am rather
sorry that we are not continuing next week. I thank all Members and the
Chairman.</div>

							<a name="07011971001000"></a>Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> Further to that point of order,Sir
Nicholas. I am going to be dead brief, because I want to catch the
plane home this evening, and other Members want to get away too. My
absent colleague felt that he could leave things in my hands, though I
do not know whether his confidence was well placed. On his behalf and
my own, I thank all the staff and everyone who has served the Committee
over the past couple of days.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 170</div>
					<a name="07011971000609"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is easier to thank a Minister
when the Bill is one with which one mostly agrees and there is not as
much dispute as on previous occasions. Nevertheless, I thank the
Minister for how he has handled the queries and questions that have
been raised. I still look forward to finding out the answer to my
question about the police stopping an airborne aircraft&#151;I hope
he gets me a reply to that fairly
quickly.</div>
					<a name="07011971000610"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Member for North Down, I have now served on a number of Committees on
which you have been the Chairman, Sir Nicholas, and I have always
looked forward to your good humour and the way that you help those of
us who are still parliamentary apprentices. We still sometimes fall
foul of the rules, but I have always found you very tolerant, and I
thank you for
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07011971000611"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011971001001"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I thank Committee members for those generous
comments about me and my co-Chairman, Janet Anderson. I congratulate
the ministerial team on the constructive and sensitive way that they
dealt with important amendments to what is an important Bill for the
people of Northern Ireland. I thank those who have ensured that our
deliberations have been effectively and properly carried out&#151;the
police, the Doorkeepers, <i class="I">Hansard</i> and, in particular, the Clerk
of this Public Bill Committee. It was always useful to have him on my
left to give me advice and help when necessary. This has been a good
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07011971000612"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make a
plea to the Government Whip, the governing party&#146;s business
manager. Although we have completed our deliberations well within the
terms of the programme motion, business managers should not be led into
reducing the time available for debate on important public Bills. We
have finished within the available time because the Committee as a
whole tackled the Bill constructively and sensibly. Ministers have
listened and there has been no procrastination, delay or
repetition.</div>
					<a name="07011971000613"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
comment in particular on the performance of the hon. Member for Foyle,
to whom I always love to listen when he waxes lyrical&#151;as he
frequently does. I am also grateful for the humour shown by everyone.
The Committee, even if I say it from the Chair, has been an example
that I hope will be followed often. I congratulate all Committee
members on the role that they have
played.</div>
