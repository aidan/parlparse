							<b class="B">Angela
Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): It is my pleasure
to open the debate. This part of the debate will be long&#151;not
only new clause 14, but clauses 34 and 35 are particularly
lengthy&#151;but I shall crystallise it. We tabled new clause 14
because there is a basic principle that the Government need to address
and which relates to the prescription of treatment and the
authorisation of medication by the second opinion approved doctor in
advance of what might become a deteriorating situation some weeks or
months later. We are concerned about
that.</div>
					<a name="07051550000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
situation could be as simple as somebody refusing to take their
medication at a later stage or disliking the side effects. Equally,
however, there could be a very salient reason why the patient stops
taking medication down the track&#151;a physical occurrence such as a
heart attack or something of that nature. It seems wrong that the
criterion applied to the patient could be such that, although there
might have been a change in circumstances since the initial assessment
of why he or she needs a particular treatment or medication, the
SOAD&#151;the authorising doctor&#151;may have decreed several
months in advance that that treatment or medication must be given. No
matter what the relevant circumstances, there would be compulsion, and
the patient would be only too well aware of that. That seems wrong in
principle.</div>
					<a name="07051550000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the rather lengthy new clause 14 would simplify the situation so that,
when there was a significant change of circumstances, the patient would
be reassessed based on those circumstances, and the piece of paper that
the doctor had in his or her pocket stating what might happen down the
track would not simply be dutifully applied. There would be proper
consideration of the patient&#146;s change of circumstances. That is
the fundamental
principle.</div>
					<a name="07051550000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think
that that is helpful to the Government because it would not only
encourage the application of best medical practice, but be in the
patient&#146;s interests. If the SOAD had the power to predetermine
treatment two or three months before, but there had been a change in
circumstances that he or she was unaware of, surely it would be in
everybody&#146;s interests for the patient to be reassessed at that
point.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>
					<a name="07051550000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that the Minister may
tell me that the fact that the doctor had that piece of paper in his or
her pocket might encourage the patient to maintain treatment and
medication, but the balancing argument is surely that the
appropriateness of a treatment, whatever it may be, should be
reassessed when there is a significant change in the patient&#146;s
circumstances.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051550000328"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Welcome to the Chair,
Mr. Cook. I will briefly endorse the comments of my hon.
Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton with two of my own. First,
clearly there is difficulty throughout the process in that one wants
assessments to be as contemporary as possible, but, on the other hand,
they should not be vexatious either to the patient or to the examining
professionals. The Minister might argue that it is not possible to keep
assessing people for ever, and I think that there would be a point to
that. On the other hand, I find my hon. Friend&#146;s arguments very
cogent in relation to the need to do a proper reassessment, and not to
give the SOAD the opportunity to issue a blank cheque. It is good
medical practice to reassess such patients, particularly if there have
been changes in circumstances, and while that does not automatically
preclude a continuation of the treatment, it demands a reassessment of
it.</div>
					<a name="07051550000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make a
further point. Even among professionals, one imagines that there may be
some difficulty in dealing with legislation of this length and
complexity, although it eventually distils to good practice. The
Minister should not be frightened about the complexity of the new
clause, since she is happy to present to the Committee schedule 6, an
extremely complex and lengthy working out of difficulties about
Bournewood and the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Speaking as a non-lawyer,
I think that it is sometimes necessary to write at great length in
order to anticipate and codify the circumstances under which certain
things should happen by way of good
practice.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000329"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> My understanding&#151;I do not claim to be an
expert&#151;is that, should the patient subsequently lose capacity
during that period, there need be no delay. A section 62 treatment
would be given, so the Minister need not worry that there would be a
long delay for somebody who had moved from having capacity to losing it
in the
interim.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000330"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> That is a helpful intervention. There is an
obligation on those with care of the patient constantly to assess the
capacity available. That is a somewhat infinite process, but those with
care must have their minds open to any deterioration or change that
could affect the patient&#146;s situation. It is sensible to consider
the process clinically, and it is legally important to have it as a
safeguard for the parties involved. It need not be unduly onerous or
vexatious to include that requirement, and I hope that the Minister
will consider the matter with
care.</div>

							<a name="07051550000331"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr.
Cook. I would like to explain a little more about the background to
clauses 34 and 35, which I hope will give some reassurance to the hon.
Members for Tiverton and Honiton and for Daventry. As they have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>said, those clauses insert new provisions in legislation to allow for
the treatment of supervised community patients, both in the community
and on recall to hospital. They will also insert important new
safeguards, including the SOAD, which will allow all SCT patients to
have a review of their treatment in the community and in the event of a
recall to
hospital.</div>
					<a name="07051550000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SOAD
will provide that review through a new part 4A certificate,
irrespective of whether patients have the capacity to consent, or not,
to treatment and irrespective of where that treatment is given. That
measure allows treatment to continue in situations such as that
mentioned by the hon. Member for Daventry, in which capacity may
fluctuate, and treatment can also be provided should the patient be
recalled to
hospital.</div>
					<a name="07051550000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to be clear about the fact that treatment in the community
cannot be given without consent to any patient who has the capacity to
consent to or refuse treatment. A patient who is refusing treatment
cannot be given that treatment by force against their will. If a
patient refused at the outset to accept treatment as part of their
community treatment order, that CTO could not be made because it would
not be effective in practice. That goes back to the debate that we had
last week. Understanding the way in which CTOs would operate is
extremely important to the debate. Patients must accept that the CTO is
part of their treatment and that it does not work if somebody says,
&#147;But I don&#146;t accept that I need to take my
medication.&#148; It is an important principle in CTOs that there is
that understanding and acceptance of the
conditions.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>On CTOs, it is fair to recall that,
although it is necessary for the patient to consent in
practice&#151;the Minister suggested that that would limit the number
of cases in which they could be applied&#151;it is a kind of consent
under duress, because the alternative may well be to continue in
hospital.</div>
					<a name="07051550000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clauses
34 and 35, there could be circumstances in which a patient recovers
capacity fully. If that happens, and as a consequence the patient
withdraws their consent, how will the doctor know, or how will they
respond to that position, because it would then be unethical to
continue to treat the patient, as well as unlawful, unless a different
provision were
sought?</div>

							<a name="07051550000333"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As I said last week, if a patient said that
they no longer accepted that they needed to take their medication, it
would be up to the clinician to decide whether, at that point, recall
to hospital was appropriate. That does not mean that they have to
recall a patient to hospital, but they must consider whether it is
appropriate. For example, if the patient&#146;s point is that their
medication is having side effects that they find it difficult to cope
with, the clinician may wish to suggest a different dosage. It does not
mean that, if a patient says that they do not want to continue with the
treatment, recall is automatic, but the provision gives the clinician
the option at that point.</div>
					<a name="07051550000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">What worries me about the new
clause is that it would remove an important safeguard, introduced by
clauses 34 and 35, ensuring that all patients in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>community have their medication independently reviewed. It would also
prevent clinicians from treating patients without delay on recall to
hospital, and would therefore jeopardise the effectiveness of
supervised community treatment, as well as inevitably causing
unnecessary disruption to patients&#146; lives. There are also some
technical flaws, but I will not go into
those.</div>
					<a name="07051550000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of the
part 4A certificate requirement is to ensure that all SCT patients have
had a second doctor review of the appropriateness of their plan of
treatment, wherever that treatment is to be given, whether in hospital
or in the community. We want all patients to benefit from that
safeguard, whether or not they have the capacity to consent to that
treatment. That is crucial for community patients, who are not in a
hospital environment where treatment can be reviewed and monitored
intensively. Obviously, community patients&#146; contact with the
clinical team would be less frequent, so the SOAD review offers
protection to ensure that the treatment that they receive is, and
continues to be, right for them. I find it difficult to understand why
Opposition Members would want to take that protection away from
patients.</div>
					<a name="07051550000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that the SOAD is able to approve treatment of the patient in
the event of recall to hospital, as well as in the community. The SOAD
does not have to address the issue of treatment on recall to
hospital&#151;it is not a requirement&#151;but can do that if it is
appropriate. Of course, it is always possible to reassess a patient on
recall to hospital.</div>
					<a name="07051550000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am advised by psychiatrists, including those who perform the SOAD
function, that when discussing CTOs we might be talking about
well-known cases where a prediction of treatment in relapse can be
fairly accurate. It is perfectly appropriate to look forward and make
such
judgments.</div>

Browning:
						</b> I agree with the Minister that it is appropriate
to look forward and make such judgments if everything is equal to when
the initial assessment was made. However, a significant change of
circumstances could have taken place. It is not just a question of the
patient coming off medication because they do not want to cope with the
adverse side effects any more, although that is a common problem. I
raised with the Minister the possibility of a situation in which a
physical disability has intervened. How does she accommodate such a
change of
circumstances?</div>

						</b> As I said, the SOAD does not have to address
the issue of recall to hospital unless it is appropriate. That might be
a circumstance in which a patient&#146;s not taking their medication
is the cause of a relapse, and so it is important that they can receive
that treatment immediately on returning to hospital. The new clause,
tabled by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, would prevent the
patient from being treated quickly on returning to hospital. However,
as things stand, a reassessment of the patient&#146;s needs can be
made at that time&#151;there is absolutely no problem in doing so.
Indeed, if a treatment becomes inappropriate, the doctor will not be
expected to administer it simply because the SOAD has said that it
might be appropriate. Such clinical flexibility is
allowed.</div>

					<a name="07051550000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that puzzles me in a simple and lay way is why it should be thought
that the SOAD provides a single gateway for all circumstances. If there
is a material change of circumstances of a medical nature, the person
responsible for treating the patient should not be obliged to refer. As
I understand it, the Minister is saying that it will be possible to
refer to the SOAD as a matter of good practice&#151;we can hardly
argue with that. However, it is not quite clear to me why it will not
be required, or expected, that that should
happen.</div>

						</b> As I said, the SOAD will provide an independent
review of treatment in the community so that the patient has a
safeguard. That does not always tie the hands of the clinician. If
recall to hospital becomes appropriate, it is important that the
clinician has the flexibility to be able to administer treatment very
quickly. That does not mean that it will have to be administered if it
is not appropriate at that time. It is simply a matter of ensuring that
there is a protection for patients in the community&#151;in the form
of an independent review&#151;and an ability to treat them quickly on
their return to hospital to save going through the whole process of
assessment again, which would put the patient in a worse position. I
understand that this is quite a complicated issue, but I hope that with
those reassurances, Opposition Members will not press the new
clause.</div>

								Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I want to widen the debate a
little and test my understanding of what clauses 34 and 35 involve. I
think that we all accept that the history of compulsory medication in
this country has not been a happy one for anybody, let alone the
mentally ill. Some treatments have been futile, some have looked
downright punitive and some have been experimental. The first use of
LSD in this country was on mental health patients in Kent. There is
also an issue with unacknowledged side effects, which have often been
identified many years after patients have been taking particular drugs
persistently. There is an acceptance that prescription in mental health
services is a fine art; the dosage must be correct in order to have the
required effect. I welcome and accept the Government&#146;s concept
of an independent review of medication as and when it is applied under
CTO
conditions.</div>
					<a name="07051550000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
I understand it, the Mental Health Act 1983 laid limitations on
compulsory medication for detained patients. I am not saying that my
understanding is immune from any kind of challenge from the Minister;
in fact I would welcome a challenge when I go wrong. The general
presumption, even in that legislation, is that medication would be
applied with consent. In fact, most patients detained as in-patients
are happy to consent to their medication and to get some benefit from
it. There was always a possibility under the 1983 Act of medication
being administered without consent, if the patient did not understand
and it was therapeutically necessary. The Act also contains other
exceptions that allowed a fairly wide range of discretion: doctors
could intervene if it was a life-saving issue and it was necessary to
prevent a worsening in the patient&#146;s condition, and also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>in order to prevent direct harm by the patient to themselves, as long as
the medication process itself was not irreversible. In emergencies,
medication could be used as long as there was not an irreversible
effect.</div>
					<a name="07051550000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the provisions in the legislation that apply to CTOs, the Mental
Health Alliance
said:</div>
					<a name="07051550000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Bill
proposals will result in very complex law relating to consent for
treatment of community patients which will be challenging for many
practitioners to
understand.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051550000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to
say that it is challenging not only for practitioners, but for
legislators. Therefore, I want to test my understanding by putting to
the Minister what seems to be involved and the problems that I think
are contained within
it.</div>
					<a name="07051550000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The general
assumption is that if a person is on a CTO, they will consent to
treatment, subject to the overriding conditions laid down by the Mental
Capacity Act 2005. We are talking only about the possibility of
medicating patients without their consent on their recall. It seems
that intervention and/or medication administered with force&#151;one
might consider a scenario where someone has an injection in order to
sedate them or control them&#151;can occur under CTO conditions if an
adult lacks capacity, if a child under 16 lacks competence and,
mysteriously, if the patient does not object to the use of force. I
found the latter in the notes on the Bill, rather than the actual Bill.
One wonders how that scenario could evolve and one assumes that there
must be some distinction implicit in the legislation between the
patient&#146;s standing will and the will that they have on a
particular occasion, such as during a psychotic episode. That, I
assume, is the reason that provision is included, as it seems rather
perplexing that one would want to use force if a patient had
consented.</div>
					<a name="07051550000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
appear that medication can be forced on a patient in circumstances such
as those set out in the 1983 Act; under a CTO, when the treatment is
regarded as immediately necessary. If a medical officer judges,
regardless of the consent conditions, that something needs to be done
which is regarded as immediately necessary, under a CTO, would that
judgment simply override whatever conditions are already in
place?</div>
					<a name="07051550000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further to what
we have just debated, I accept that there is an argument to be had
about the effect on the system and the patient of an advanced medical
directive. We have had a similar, almost parallel argument with regard
to advanced patient directives. There are pluses and minuses that may
need further investigation, but at this stage I would like the Minister
merely to respond to my queries to test my understanding of the
legislation. If medication is to be forced on a patient while on a
CTO&#151;not on recall&#151;in what circumstances will that take
place?</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000339"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> Despite the Minister&#146;s explanation, I
still have some concerns. I assume that a rapid deterioration would
count as an emergency and, thus, a need for immediate intervention.
Section 62 would authorise emergency treatment, so patients will not be
put at risk when the nature of their emergency is concerned with their
mental health. The emergency could be of a non-mental health nature,
but that does not seem to be taken account of by the fact that the SOAD
is authorising treatment down the track without being aware of the
circumstances.</div>
				
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>
					<a name="07051550000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						I
should like the Minister to compare such issues with that of detained
patients. When patients are detained, they receive a SOAD when they no
longer consent or when they lose capacity. However, that treatment is
not available to CTO patients under the proposal. There is a disparity
between the treatment and the response that an in-patient can expect
and what a person in the community can expect. We must bear it in mind
that CTOs are something of an experiment that we have covered in
earlier parts of the Bill. We hope that, with CTOs, the Minister would
at least be giving recognition at the same level of intervention as
would be given to someone who was detained, bearing it in mind that
those patients would have been detained previously and are now in the
community. The comparison of safeguards is therefore important. The
SOAD is a safeguard. That is its
purpose.</div>

								Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is an important
safeguard for the doctor to have a second opinion? While a challenge
would not remove the possibility of litigation about professional
negligence, it would nevertheless reduce it. As with the Mental
Capacity Act 2005, a lot of what is being done is properly to
safeguard the position of those who do things for people as well as
those to whom they are
done.</div>

Browning:
						</b> That is obvious. My hon. Friend is right that
such a safeguard is important. We are talking primarily about
safeguarding the patient, but equally we must have regard to the
professionals who take responsibility for the patients. If things go
pear-shaped, all too often it is the person who last saw the patient
who takes the
responsibility.</div>

proposed the abolition of clause 34 and replacing it with our
amendment. Unfortunately, it was not selected, which is why I am
speaking to new clause 14. If the Minister reads it, she will see that
it might simplify matters somewhat, but it certainly would not remove
safeguards. In fact, the SOAD is a safeguard. If matters are just left
to the responsible clinician down the track, there would be no real
SOAD safeguard in the Minister&#146;s
proposal.</div>

unintentional, but that is what it would
do.</div>
					<a name="07051550000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						With
regard to forcible treatment in a patient&#146;s home, I reassure the
Committee that there will be no forced treatment of patients who have
capacity or competence to consent, but who do not do so while subject
to a CTO. If forcible treatment is necessary, the patient will be
recalled to hospital. Forcible treatment outside hospital for patients
who lack capacity or competence to consent cannot be given except when
the responsible clinician has no reason to believe that such a patient
objects to the treatment, and as long as that does not conflict with an
advance decision, one made by someone who has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>been given a lasting power of attorney, or a deputy appointed by the
Court of Protection.</div>

issues are about practicality. For example, if a person required an
injection but had to be held down to get it, the injection could be
administered as long as they were not
objecting&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> If, say, a muscle
spasm in the arm would react, force may be applied. We are talking
about limited circumstances. As under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, if
a person gave any indication of objection, the treatment would not be
given. Practicalities will determine the limited circumstances in which
a clinician would have to take such action, but they are very
unlikely.</div>

							<a name="07051550000345"></a>Mr.

						</b> If I may follow the Minister, I am increasingly
coming to the view that we should after all have left the safeguards in
common law because of the lack of flexibility and the extreme
circumstances that she described. While that is not my considered
view&#151;I like the Act, as she does&#151;will she consider that
there is no intention on the Opposition side to remove any of the
safeguards that she is seeking to introduce? I have said that again and
again. However, given that the complexity of the issue, will she at
least undertake to review the situation? Circumstances might change,
and a clinician who has made a judgment in good faith and has had that
supported by a second doctor, might be obliged or encouraged, not least
for their own protection, to go back and review their initial decision.
We are not seeking to preclude appropriate treatment, let alone
emergency treatment, but there is a potential difficulty if clinical
approval that has been given in one position is not transferable when
circumstances change.

once again, but the effect of the new clause would be to remove the

what he intends, but I will ask the Committee to reject new clause 14,
because it would remove the safeguards.</div>
					<a name="07051550000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I conclude by
saying again that force may be used to administer treatment in an
emergency&#151;&#151;for example, to save a patient&#146;s life.
In all such emergency cases, force will have to be a proportionate
response to the seriousness of the harm that might be caused to the
patient. It is a similar approach to that taken by the Mental Capacity
Act 2005&#151;force has to be proportionate and used in a way that
helps rather than harms the patient.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000347"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> The Minister may be able to help me. Clearly, when
life and death are at stake, it is overriding that somebody must do
something. She suggests that force may be used in those circumstances,
and that the clinician will not have to make legal moves in order to
use that force should he judge it necessary.</div>
					<a name="07051550000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Was the Minister sketching
another scenario in which a clinician who judges that medication is to
be administered against the will of a patient who is on a CTO that
stipulates that they should consent must make a new legal move to put
in place the requirements laid down for in-patients? In other words,
there are circumstances in which needs must: clinicians must do what
they have to do to save lives. That is an overriding 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>imperative in circumstances in which action is immediately necessary.
However, at the start, the Minister seemed to be saying that one could
move from a scenario in which a patient was consenting to treatment on
a CTO to a different one, which was nevertheless not quite the same as
sectioning, in which some legal move was required prior to a change in
the patient&#146;s clinical treatment.</div>

						</b> The Government want to ensure that a patient on
a CTO has their treatment independently reviewed and that they have
access to treatment very quickly on recall to hospital. The problem
with the Opposition&#146;s new clause is that it removes the ability
of the SOAD to authorise treatment independently, which means that, on
recall to hospital, the patient would have to go through the legal
process again, and that is what we are objecting to. It may be that
that is unintentional. Perhaps it is a probing new clause. I am afraid

Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 58, page 35, line 35, leave out

&#145;18&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07051550000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a rather simpler amendment than the last one, and enormously less
long. It is about the referral to mental health review tribunals.
Again, it reflects our concern about how children and young people are
treated in the Bill. We are trying to ensure that safeguards are put in
place for all children under 18. Its purpose is to ensure that children
under 18 are reviewed at least annually by a tribunal. At present, only
children under 16 are automatically entitled to an annual review. We
think that they should have at least an annual review given the
sensitivity of their position. After all we are talking about very
vulnerable children. Children under 18 but over 16 who have no one to
look after their interests, such as unaccompanied asylum seekers or
those whose parents do not understand the mental health system, might
not be reviewed for three years. Surely, that is far too long in the
life of a young person.</div>
					<a name="07051550000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of the amendment is
simple. It reinforces the fact that those under 18 are regarded in law
as children, and it would safeguard their rights. Although we are not
talking about an enormous number of children each year, surely it is a
worthwhile safeguard to ensure that children under 18 do not have to
wait for up to three years, as they could in some cases, for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div>review of their position&#151;&#151;of their continued sectioning or

						</b> Clause 36 provides a safeguard for patients who
do not use their right to apply to the tribunal. It ensures that even
when patients have not applied themselves, hospital managers will
automatically refer them to the tribunal after a certain period. All
patients under 16 who do not apply to the tribunal, other than under
section 2, get referred after the first six months of their detention.
If a year passes without a tribunal, then they will be referred again
by the hospital managers. The amendment seeks to extend the annual
referral to patients under the age of

with the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that it is
important to consider very carefully the best ways to ensure that
children&#146;s rights are properly safeguarded. I would like to
consider the amendment further, alongside the commitment made by my
noble Friend Baroness Ashton in the other place. That commitment was
that no child under 18 should appear before the tribunal without having
had some input from a child and adolescent mental health specialist. It
is appropriate to put both considerations together. I invite the hon.

further.</div>

children under 18 are to appear before the tribunal, they should be
adequately supported in what is bound to be a difficult process? They
should not feel it to be any more difficult than it has to be. The
Minister will be familiar with the many changes to young people giving

not feel threatened by the tribunal beyond the bare requirements in

the Minister for saying that she sympathises with the intention and

are not collected. Potentially, we are not talking about a big cost
implication at all, if any. If it can be achieved operationally, then I
am happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that she will come

						Section
47 of the Mental Health Act 1983 allows the Home Secretary to order the
transfer of a sentenced prisoner to hospital. Any such decision is made
by the Home Secretary, based on reports from two doctors. We are
concerned that prisoners with mental health problems are still not
getting the specialist medical treatment they need. We are all only too
well aware of the enormous problems with mental illness among the
growing&#151;&#151;and record&#151;&#151;prison population. The
hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) responded to a question about
the state of mental illness in our prisons just over a year ago, when
she was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office.
She referred to what she termed the most comprehensive national
assessment to estimate the incidence of metal illness in prison,
published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 1997. The
survey indicated that 90 per cent. of prisoners have at least one
mental health disorder, including personality disorder, psychosis,
neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence. The majority of that
number have common mental health problems, such as depression and
anxiety, much of which may be related to their imprisonment rather than
being a contributing factor to it.</div>
					<a name="07051550000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A smaller,
but again much larger than average, proportion of those people have
more severe problems, such as schizophrenia or some form of personality
disorder. We have discussed personality disorder problems and I
mentioned the dangerous severe personality disorder prison population.
I know some of the experiments that are going on in the pilot scheme in
Broadmoor, which I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>visited, where prisoners with severe personality disorder have been
transferred for a different sort of treatment and
confinement.</div>
					<a name="07051550000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
figures are slightly out of date but none of us would expect there to
have been a drastic improvement in the mental health state of the
prison population. The annual report of the chief inspector of prisons
in 2002-03 estimated that 41 per cent. of prisoners in health care
centres should have been in secure NHS accommodation. It was discovered
in 2004 that, at any one time, at least 40 prisoners assessed as
needing a transfer to hospital had been waiting over three months for
it to take place.</div>
					<a name="07051550000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a large divide between
the health care that individuals can receive in the community and what
can be achieved in the prisons, owing to the difference in priority and
limited resources. Surely, prisons are not the place for people with
serious mental health problems as they cannot provide appropriate
levels of care. I know other hon. Members have raised the subject on
the Floor of the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles
Hendry) introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill last year on the
mental health of the prison population. Many members of the Mental
Health Alliance are concerned that section 47 of the 1983 Act has not
proved to be an effective mechanism for transferring prisoners with
mental health problems to a hospital for specialist care.</div>
					<a name="07051550000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In line with the recommendation
of the joint parliamentary scrutiny committee, many people believe
that, where two responsible clinicians agree that the transfer to a
hospital is needed, the Home Secretary should be under a duty to order
his or her transfer. That may help with the burgeoning prison
population. Given that the prison population has gone over 80,000 and
the Government and Home Secretary are now having to look at emergency
provisions such as floating prisons and so forth, taking some of those
people for whom it would be more appropriate to be in some form of
mental health accommodation out of the prison population could come as
something of a bonus to the Home Secretary, whoever he or she may be in
a few weeks&#146; time.</div>

					<a name="07051550000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The proposal
was put forward by the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee. There is a
genuine problem. The problem, as we were told in the pre-legislative
scrutiny Committee, is that corrections and community corrections staff
lack the training and expertise adequately to identify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>mental health issues in prisons. In Committee, we were told by the
Department of Health that there are plans to implement a mental health
first aid training package to provide corrections staff with the skills
to recognise symptoms and provide initial assistance and referrals, and
that higher-level training is being considered for key staff, as there
are few specialist mental health staff in the prison system.</div>
					<a name="07051550000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In responding

generally&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">] </i>I am sorry if I
am boring the hon. Member for Stockport, but it is an important
subject. There are many people who are not receiving the treatment they
need, and whose condition is stagnating and worsening in prison
environments where appropriate care is not available. I note the
Government&#146;s earlier references to appropriate treatment.
Appropriate treatment is not available in too many prison

							<a name="07051550000363"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I agree absolutely that we need to ensure that
proper mental health facilities are available in prisons for prisoners
who require treatment, which is why we have created a number of new
prison in-reach teams. It is also important that we have an appropriate
mechanism for transferring prisoners.</div>
					<a name="07051550000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer Opposition Members back
to our discussions about treatability. One issue, particularly for
women in prison, is that the treatability test has got in the way. As
Jean Corston said in her report, there are far too many women with
personality disorders in prison who are not being treated, which is why
she welcomed the changes that the Government want to make to the Act to
ensure that treatment is available, particularly to the women whom she
highlighted.</div>
					<a name="07051550000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recently asked for a review of both high security and medium security
facilities. It has not yet been published, but I assure Opposition
Members that due to the number of beds in the NHS and those
commissioned in the independent sector, I am quite satisfied that
provision is adequate, particularly for medium security
prisoners.</div>
					<a name="07051550000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes
the issue is how to handle transfers from prison. The new clause would
address that, as it concerns the treatment of offenders who have been
sentenced to prison and then need to be transferred to hospital for
specialist treatment of a mental disorder. The new clause is
particularly concerned with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>Secretary of State&#146;s power to direct the transfer of prisoners to
hospital, which will occur when the Home Secretary receives reports
from two doctors that a prisoner suffers from a mental disorder that
makes it appropriate to detain the prisoner in hospital for medical
treatment. The Bill provides for appropriate medical treatment for that
prisoner.</div>
					<a name="07051550000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State&#146;s current power to direct transfer to
hospital is discretionary. Once a prison has notified the Secretary of
State that a prisoner requires treatment in a mental hospital in which
he may be detained, he is under an expedient duty to take steps to
obtain medical evidence. If medical advice says that a transfer should
be made, the Secretary of State must take reasonable steps to do so,
but, importantly, in taking those steps the discretion enables the Home
Secretary to take account of the situations of hospitals to which a
direction might be made. It does not oblige him to transfer a prisoner
to a hospital regardless of whether appropriate care or facilities are
available there, or whether the hospital has a bed available, or
whether it is able or willing to provide sufficient security for the
public and other patients or for its staff.
</div>
				
					<a name="07051550000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition&#146;s new clause would remove the Secretary of
State&#146;s discretion and oblige him to direct regardless of
particular circumstances. I completely understand that, when a prisoner
is suffering from a mental disorder making it appropriate for him to be
detained in hospital, there is a need to act as soon as is practicable.
However, I cannot see the value in directing prisoners&#146;
admission to a hospital that has no facilities to provide the treatment
that they might need or that cannot offer the security needed to enable
a prisoner to be treated in conditions of safety. The problem with the
new clause is that it holds out the possibility of both
happening.</div>

								Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I am always slightly suspicious when the Minister
gets into caricature territory; my hon. Friend the Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham may attend to that later. Can the Minister make
something clear for the record? She has now twice referred to the Home
Secretary while also referring, variously, to the Secretary of State.
Although I may be wrong, I had understood that under the new
arrangements for the division of the Home Office, the responsibility in
question will devolve to a Minister or Secretary of State for Justice
and not to the Home Secretary. It is important that we get that point
clear.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000365"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> That is a fair point.</div>
					<a name="07051550000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to emphasise some
important security questions here. Obviously, many prisoners would be
in an extremely vulnerable situation, but it is also true that others
may be extremely dangerous. We could be talking about people who have
committed quite serious crimes; any prisoners in such circumstances
would need to be transferred to hospitals with an appropriate level of
security.</div>
					<a name="07051550000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
completely understand that the spirit of the new clause in seeking to
ensure that people get treated quickly. That is why, as I said, we now
have 102 NHS mental health in-reach teams in prisons. This year, for
the first time, all prisoners should have access to those services.
Some 360 more whole-time equivalent staff 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>are employed on mental health in-reach provision, which actually
exceeded the NHS plan for 300 to be in post by the end of 2004. More
than &#163;60,000 has also been invested over three years on mental
health awareness. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham talked
about basic training in that area for prison staff, which has commenced
and should be reaching 20 per cent. almost as we
speak.</div>

Loughton:
						</b> Before the Minister rattles off all this stuff,
can I take her back to the safety angle? I am sure that she will be
able to give me the figures, but is it not the case that fewer people
have escaped from high security mental hospitals than from prisons? Her
contention that a mental hospital would in some way be less secure than
a prison for potentially dangerous people therefore does not hold. Is
that not
right?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000367"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> No, because I was talking not necessarily about
escapes, but about security levels for staff and other patients in
respect of someone who is potentially quite dangerous. Security is
needed not only for the individual, but for staff, visitors and other
patients.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000368"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> If we are not discussing escapes, would not the
Minister agree that the degree of specialism and skill that is
available in high security mental hospitals to deal with someone who
might be dangerous either to himself or to other patients is much
better and more appropriate than in prisons? The reasons are the ones
that have been stated, which are connected with shortage of skills and
facilities. Whether the issue is escape, safety of inmates, public
safety or the safety of the individual, there is better provision in
hospitals than in prisons, so the Minister&#146;s argument does not
stand
up.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000369"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I do not necessarily agree. The whole point of
the new clause is that it would remove any discretion to consider the
type of hospital that might be appropriate. That is exactly the problem
with it, and that is why I have said that retaining the discretion is
important.</div>
					<a name="07051550000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
might reassure the Committee to know that there has been a significant
decrease in the number of people who wait more than 12 weeks for a
transfer from prison. In the quarter ending December 2006, 38 prisoners
had been waiting for that period, compared with a figure of 62 for the
quarter ending June 2005. The figure for December 2006 is obviously
still too high, but I hope that it indicates that the changes that we
have made are working.</div>
					<a name="07051550000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause seeks in a sense
to use legislative powers to direct the allocation of NHS resources,
and could almost result in more favourable treatment of prisoners,
because hospitals would be obliged to accept them. That would put the
issue in a rather different perspective&#151;one that would not
necessarily be favoured by the public.</div>
					<a name="07051550000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that the
Opposition are trying to highlight the need for people to be
transferred quickly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>from prison to hospital, if transfer is appropriate, but there are some
very good reasons why removing discretion from the Secretary of State
would not be appropriate, among which are matters of public safety. I
hope that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will therefore
withdraw the amendment.</div>

Loughton:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Cook. I was a bit
confused by what the Minister said, and I think that she got a bit
confused too. Having said that the issue was not escapes, which
endanger public safety, but behaviour and risk in prisons, where the
public are not present, she ended up by saying that it was all about
public safety. It seems to be a rather circular argument.
</div>
					<a name="07051550000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having reeled off a
load of supposed improvements to facilities in prisons and mental
hospitals, the Minister then said that actually there might be a
problem if such facilities are not available in a hospital to which the
Secretary of State for Justice is obliged to make a transfer. Either
things are getting better, in which case the services are available, or
they are not, in which case we must do something about it, but at the
end of the day it is about the health and well-being of patients who
have serious mental health problems that are not properly catered for
in prisons. They are in the logjam that exists in the prison system at
the
moment.</div>
					<a name="07051550000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
do not take the Minister&#146;s point about removing all the
Secretary of State&#146;s discretion. The new clause would place a
duty on the Secretary of State. If given proper, investigated medical
advice that a person should not be in a prison but a hospital
environment, surely the Secretary of State for Justice should pay close
attention to that advice. He or she will not be expert enough to give
opinions on the person&#146;s medical state. Surely there are few if
any grounds on which the Secretary of State for Justice should
challenge a medical opinion given by a person legitimately entitled to
give it. Why, all of a sudden, is the Secretary of State for Justice as
competent to give medical opinions as a highly qualified Secretary of
State for Health would
be?</div>

								Tim
Loughton:
						</b> This is a probing new clause, because it clearly
recognises the problems that the Minister acknowledged when she claimed
that improvements were occurring in transfers from prison to hospital.
I do not see any incentive, other than to clear some prison space for
people whom it is more appropriate to be place there, for the Secretary
of State for Justice to do something about it. Does the Minister have
figures for the number of people for whom there was medical
recommendation for transferral to a hospital environment and about whom
the Home Secretary, as it would be at the time, said no for whatever
reason, because he had discretion to do so? What reasons would have
been given that those people should not be transferred? If the reason
was that the alternative was less appropriate, as the right hon. Lady
suggested, were the decisions reviewed after some weeks or months when
a more appropriate placing was available in a high security mental
hospital, for
example?</div>
					<a name="07051550000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it stands,
the Secretary of State for Justice can say no and does not have to do
anything about it. Should there not at the very least be some
conditions whereby if he says no, he must then reconsider the decision
after several months? If the medical determination is still the same,
there should be a greater incentive or compulsion for him to ensure
that an appropriate hospital space can be found by reference to the
Secretary of State for Health, whose system clearly is not providing
the services that are required for that different form of
patient.</div>

							<a name="07051550000380"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> If the medical advice is that the Secretary of
State recommends transfer, he does not question that advice. The
discretionary bit is where the transfer is and that he can wait until
an appropriate hospital is available. As I said, the numbers
waiting for more than three months have decreased by
about 33 per cent., so the discretion is about where and when,
not the medical opinion in the first place. I hope that I have been
helpful.</div>

							<a name="07051550000381"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I was not challenging that, but it is pointless
unless the Secretary of State for Justice has to do something about it,
such as decide whether to challenge the medical opinion or not to
challenge it and say that a suitable place was not available. The
consequences would be the same, as a person in prison, who should not
be in prison, should be in hospital. That is the key point. What is the
incentive for an appropriate space to be found as soon as possible?
There does not seem to be any
comeback.</div>
					<a name="07051550000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
gave us some indicative figures of how delay has been reduced when she
referred to 12 weeks. Does that cover everyone? Is everyone
automatically obliged to be transferred if the medical opinion is that
they should be transferred, even if it takes three, six, nine or 12
months? Will that recommendation still be live? I do not know how the
system works at the moment, but my reading of the mechanism suggests
that there is a potential problem with having no incentive to get on
with it.</div>
					<a name="07051550000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come back
to the Minister&#146;s point about public safety, and appropriate
security and skill levels in a hospital. Surely, if she has confidence
in the services that her Department is offering to mental health
patients and those in secure mental hospitals who happen to have come
through the criminal justice system as well, she should not be making
the case that, in some way, they might be better off in a prison than a
health environment. That is the clear implication of what she is
arguing, especially by praying in aid public safety, which does not
apply in prisons because there are no members of the public
there.</div>

Browning:
						</b> Let us suppose that it is recognised that there
is a need for someone with a custodial sentence to be referred to a
hospital placement. When that does not take place, there is the obvious
problem of managing the person in the prison. I represent a Devon
consistency and I have visited Dartmoor prison from time to time. It is
my limited experience that mental health patients, which is how I
describe them, are often confined to the medical wing on a
semi-permanent basis because that is the most containable place in
which to manage
them.</div>
					<a name="07051550000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that referral
is never made, however, the prison has to deal with the patient on an
ongoing basis. When that person is discharged from prison, they could
be sent back into the community with no proper contact with mental
health services. They may have contact with the probation service, but
not mental health
services.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>My hon. Friend is right. That is not in
anyone&#146;s interests. It is not in the interests of the prison,
which has its hospital wings jammed up with long-term mental health
sufferers, or of other prisoners who, in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>severe cases, may be at some risk from those people. In addition, the
medical qualifications or training of the prison staff may not be
sufficient to deal with such prisoners compared with those in a higher
security hospital, which clearly provides the appropriate
treatment.</div>
					<a name="07051550000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
raised some legitimate concerns about the mechanics of the transfer
from prison to hospital. I am a little muddled by the Minister&#146;s

Pugh:
						</b> Surely the weakness of the Government&#146;s
position as it stands is that it does not preclude the indefinite
absence or postponement of treatment if the case is sufficiently severe
for there to be a public interest. For example, nobody could find a
good hospital for Ronnie Cray, so he was left to fester in prison.
Also, in the case of terrorists, the Government would never find a
public interest case for hospitalising such people even if
hospitalisation is medically recommended. Therefore, the weakness of
the system is that it allows the indefinite absence and postponement of
treatment without any review of that
decision.</div>

					<a name="07051550000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is me again, Mr. Cook. The amendment to clause 43
is slightly longer and it deals with the subject of places of safety. I
know that a number of hon. Members have expressed concerns about the
matter in the past. The amendment is to section 136 of the Mental
Health Act 1983. We want to define places of safety with particular
reference to the use of police stations, which are apparently being
used under the definitions of the Bill far too often and
inappropriately.
</div>
					<a name="07051550000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						So
the purpose of the amendment is to change the definition of a
&#147;place of safety&#148;, to ensure that as far as possible it
should be not a police cell but a therapeutic environment. When a
police station is used as a place of safety, because nothing else is
available, the patient must be transferred to a therapeutic
environment, which is more appropriate, within 24
hours.</div>
					<a name="07051550000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
experience of such a situation. I had a surgery case last year
involving a constituent&#146;s son-in-law, who had had a severe
psychotic episode. He had no previous experience or record of any
serious mental illness. He got involved in a quite bizarre incident
requiring a number of armed police and was taken into custody. No one
was hurt, but he clearly had&#151;for want of a better
word&#151;flipped. He was taken to the custody suite of the police
station, where he stayed for several
days.</div>
					<a name="07051550000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">He was not
transferred to a hospital environment. He was not dealt with properly
at the police station. His condition worsened severely while he was in
custody. The reason why he was not transferred was that the reviewing
clinician&#151;from the Maudsley hospital in south London&#151;was
on holiday and there was no one covering. So, for completely
unacceptable reasons, the son-in-law of my constituent was forced to
stay in that police cell for a number of days&#151;I cannot remember
how many, but clearly too many&#151;while his condition worsened. It
was highly inappropriate and he plainly should have been removed to a
hospital as soon as possible, so that he could start receiving the
medical care denied him for some
while.</div>

are rounded up by the police, perhaps handcuffed, and taken to a police

dumped in a police cell as a minor, on their own, when they are

state:</div>

					<a name="07051550000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a postcode lottery in operation
so there is clearly something wrong. Is the lottery to do with
different forces operating under different procedures and protocols?
Are the different rates caused by vast differences in the facilities
available to police forces? That is one of the biggest causes for
concern.</div>
					<a name="07051550000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Previous
research has indicated that police cells are used on around 80 per
cent. of occasions when section 136 powers are invoked. Police cells
are the norm, not the exception. Most of us would agree, and clinicians
say, that police cells are not the most appropriate place, or so much
as an appropriate place, for people detained under section 136 to be
taken.</div>
					<a name="07051550000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The person
detained under section 136 need not have committed any offence, but
simply to have behaved in a way that has given the impression that they
are mentally ill and a danger to themselves or others, so there is a
degree of discretion for the police who take people into custody. A
police cell is not a therapeutic environment for someone experiencing
mental health problems. Being taken into custody may delay the
provision of effective treatment and exacerbate the illness, which is
exactly what happened in the case of my constituent. The use of police
cells as a place of safety also has significant resource implications
for police custody facilities. The police have little training or
expertise in looking after people with severe mental health problems.
Given all the other pressures on the police, this is another problem
that they do not need.</div>
					<a name="07051550000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Police station staff are, I
fear, rarely trained to deal with people who are mentally ill. Home
Office circular 66/90, which is in a memorandum to accompany the 1983
Act, and the joint Home Office and Department of Health review of
health and social services for mentally disordered offenders both
suggested that police stations should rarely if ever be used to detain
people under section 136. The NSF on mental health states that
hospitals should be used in preference to police stations, and the
current code of practice states that police cells should generally be
used.</div>
					<a name="07051550000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The issue is
of particular relevance to black and minority ethnic communities,
especially African and Caribbean communities. The rates of use of
section 136 orders are disproportionately high for those groups. Two
surveys have been undertaken, one each in Islington and Camden. The
Islington survey found that no fewer than 41 per cent. of section 136
detentions were of black people, when that group makes up only 12 per
cent. of the population. Similar figures were found in Camden. Section
136 powers are being used disproportionately to detain black and ethnic
minority patients, reflecting the disparities, problems and
discrimination that happens across the mental health
service.</div>

						In
particular, there is a fear that, with the new power to transfer, PCTs
will be less likely to prioritise a search for a hospital bed for
section 136 patients because they know that they will be able to

consequence of increasing the use of police cells for mentally
disordered patients. That is the case that they are making.</div>

Complaints Commission.</div>
					<a name="07051550000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there is a great deal of
weight behind the amendment. It addresses a problem that is happening
all too often and one that we are all aware of. The Minister and other
members of the Committee share the view that it should not be
happening, but we are discussing how we should prevent it from
happening. The amendment will send out a serious message about the
undesirability and inappropriateness of this form of detention. It will
also act as a serious spur to reconfigure services so that police cells
are used only as a fallback position and not as the position of
preference, as happens in about 80 per cent. of cases. As such, I hope
that the Minister will take the amendment
seriously.</div>

							<a name="07051550000391"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I want to add just a few comments, as the hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has put the case exhaustively and
has covered most of the angles.</div>
					<a name="07051550000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some difficulty in
equating police stations with places of safety full stop because of the
things that happen in police stations from time to time. It is
understandable that people who have mental health crises will
occasionally end up in police stations. It is also perfectly
comprehensible that most policemen are not trained therapists and
therefore find such problems difficult to deal with, and that the
police station is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>an ideal therapeutic environment in any sense. Police stations are
useful facilities for all sorts of purposes. The stark reality is that
they are now used as prisons and used far more than the Government wish
them to be. They could clearly be overused as places of safety for
people who should be elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="07051550000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The amendment
is unashamedly designed to drive up standards. One can almost
anticipate the Minister&#146;s response, which will be something
along the lines of, &#147;Yes, it&#146;s good to have higher
standards, but hey, we&#146;re going to lose flexibility and if there
is no place of safety we may end up releasing people straight out on to
the streets.&#148; That is all well and good, but it is
indistinguishable from an argument for lower standards; someone arguing
for lower standards would make exactly the same point.</div>
					<a name="07051550000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment&#146;s cutting
edge is the restriction to 24 hours. If the Minister has a
difficulty with that, and if 24 hours is thought to be too short a
period because places might not always be available in that time scale,
we could adopt a more sophisticated amendment whereby the 24-hour
provision would be the norm, with a requirement for exceptional
permission to be sought if a longer period were required. Such
amendments are an attempt to drive standards up and deal with an
unjustified ill. Surely the Minister can warm to
that.</div>

							<a name="07051550000392"></a>Mr.
Walker:
						</b> I made a brief intervention earlier, but I think
that the incident that I described deserves more than an intervention,
so I hope that the Minister will not mind if I expand on it. About this
time last year, I spent a morning with the police, during which there
was a call-out to a &#147;domestic&#148; in my constituency. When
we arrived the situation was unclear; there was a hell of a row, with
plates breaking and cutlery being thrown. It sounded as though some
enormous person was out of
control.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000394"></a>Mr.
Walker:
						</b> Well, occasionally the Walker children get out of
control. The police entered the home and their performance was
outstanding from beginning to end despite their not being trained to
deal with such situations. After about half an hour, they emerged with
a tiny girl of about 14 or 15 years who could not have been more than 5
foot nothing. She was crying softly between two enormous policemen.
Clearly, as I said earlier, she was mentally disturbed. Indeed, she was
well known to our mental health services, the Hertfordshire Partnership
NHS Trust, and has had a long history of engagement with doctors and
nurses in the trust. I spoke to her parents and they were clearly at
their wits&#146; end, but I did not feel that they really understood
mental illness&#151;the symptoms had not been explained to
them.</div>
					<a name="07051550000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked the
police what would happen to the young person, and they told me that she
would be taken to the local police station to be detained and charged.
At the risk of sounding repetitive, I point out that it seemed totally
wrong that someone who was clearly mentally ill and who was known to
the mental health services should spend a period&#151;maybe the
entire day or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>longer&#151;in a police station, to be charged for an episode that
within a day or two she would, I discovered, not even recall.</div>
					<a name="07051550000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have the answer, but I
am sure that the Minister has heard hundreds of such stories. If we
could improve such situations, I and many other people would be
extremely
pleased.</div>

								Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I should say first that the stories Opposition
Members have told are all tragic. I completely understand why people
feel that the situation needs addressing, and I agree. That is one
reason why the Government introduced the amendments in the other place,
so that transfer would be permitted. Transfer was one of the real
problems that was highlighted at my meeting with the Police Federation,
whose representatives said that they would certainly welcome the
inclusion in the Bill of scope for transfer from one place to another.
Everyone agrees that police stations are absolutely not the right place
in which to detain someone who appears to be suffering a mental
disorder, and that hospital facilities are likely to be more suitable.
However, the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham touched on the
truth, which is that we must recognise the current limited availability
of adequate place of safety facilities other than police stations. The
availability also varies from area to area, and we are trying to put
that
right.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051550000396"></a>
							<b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): Although I
agree that police stations are inappropriate as places of safety, may I
ask whether any moves are being made to create specialisms in
conurbations such as London, Manchester or Birmingham? Staff at
particular police stations could be trained in dealing with such mental
health patients, so that they could be temporarily detained there,
rather than in an area with no awareness of mental health issues or
specialisms.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000397"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> There is a host of steps that we can take. An
important one is not always touched on: we need to look more carefully
and at why for some people the first point of contact might be the
police, as opposed to the mental health services. How some people end
up in police stations, as opposed to being taken to somewhere provided
by the NHS, is quite an issue. Hence the importance of allowing the
transfer between police stations and other places of safety, because
too many people were going through the police system instead of always
going through the mental health
services.</div>
					<a name="07051550000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Southport anticipated me, but I hope to reassure him that
this approach is correct. Coming back to the point raised by the hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and his constituent&#146;s
five-day wait, the maximum period of detention in a police station is
72 hours, so he might wish to take that up. I should emphasise that
that 72 hours, which I am sure many people would say is too long, is an
upper limit. Recently published evidence, emerging from a study being
undertaken by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, suggests
that the average amount of time in police custody under section 136 of
the Act is 10 hours and that the vast majority of detainees leave
police custody within 18 hours. That is reassuring, but it also makes
it clear that a small 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>number of people have been detained in police cells for longer than 24
hours. The amendment would make that
impossible.</div>
					<a name="07051550000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we said
in the other place, the issue is about whether we feel that imposing
statutory restrictions is the way to address the understandable
concerns that the amendment seeks to tackle. We believe that the right
way forward is to limit the use of police stations by facilitating the
good practice that we know occurs in some places. The hon. Member for
East Worthing and Shoreham said that it was interesting how the figures
are very low in some parts of the country, but in others they seem to
be greater.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000398"></a>Mr.
Walker:
						</b> On a connected point, what sort of access to
psychiatric services does someone in a police cell or station have? Do
they have access to review by a trained clinician? What happens when
they leave? Do they go
home?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000399"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Basically, the individual will be waiting for
an assessment. Once the assessment is made, a decision is taken on what
to do with the patient. We therefore need the assessment to be made as
quickly as possible so that, if necessary, proper treatment can
commence. It is the issue of getting the assessment that the hon.
Gentleman is trying to
address.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000400"></a>Mr.
Walker:
						</b> On a point of interest, would that assessment
involve the person&#146;s clinician who had been supporting them
prior to their admission to the police
station?</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000401"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Yes, a clinician and social worker would be
involved in the decision to detain somebody under the Mental Health Act
or to provide other
care.</div>
					<a name="07051550000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
I have said, by allocating approximately &#163;42 million in capital
spending, we are trying to improve the NHS mental health
estate to ensure that proper places of safety are available. We are
putting in a further &#163;58 million this year. We have
specifically asked people to look at the issue of places of safety. As
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, the local
protocols that are in place are often what is important. The Police
Federation made the point that if we can ensure close co-operation
between the police and the health authorities, we could see real
changes in the use of police cells as places of safety. That is why we
introduced the amendments in the other place that, in effect, allow a
patient to be transferred elsewhere. Currently, if someone ends up in a
police cell, that is where they stay. The Government amendment made in
Lords allows a transfer to take place.</div>
					<a name="07051550000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to reinforce that
approach by strengthening the guidance in the code of practice The
current code states that police stations should not generally be used.
In the revised code, we want to stress that police stations should be
used only as a last resort: for example, only if nowhere more suitable
is immediately available, and even then, only if such use is compatible
with local agreements on the use of places of safety.
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>We want to ensure that local protocols are in place and to
stress the points that I have just made in the revised
code.</div>
					<a name="07051550000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will consult
very widely on the revised code. We will involve representatives of the
police, including the Police Federation, in the drafting of the
guidance. I understand that similar arrangements will be made in Wales.
The National Institute of Mental Health in England is working with the
Association of Chief Police Officers on the development of guidance on
joint working between police and health services in dealing with people
with a mental disorder. I know that that is general, but it is an
important matter. Getting the process right at local level and
understanding how each other&#146;s work can take place and be
improved is the best and most appropriate way forward.</div>
					<a name="07051550000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that reassurance,
combined with guidance on moving people from one place of safety to
another more appropriate one, will encourage the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

								Tim
Loughton:
						</b> This has been a useful debate. I am particularly
pleased with the Minister&#146;s assurances about consultation in
reference to the code of conduct. That will probably be the swiftest
way of bringing about improvement. In particular, it will address the
deserts of best practice that appear to exist and ensure that protocols
that work at the moment work everywhere. I see no reason why that
should not happen. Promoting a local agreement is the best way to
proceed, so that there is mutual benefit and trust and a good
relationship between clinicians, police, the Prison Service, social
workers and all the other agencies involved.</div>
					<a name="07051550000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment stipulates an
upper time limit of 24 hours. That should not be a problem,
because the Minister has said that the emerging IPPC research indicates
that the average stay is 10 hours. Having taken her assurances that a
lot is happening&#151;discussions with the police, improvements to
the code of conduct, and so on&#151;in relation to the provision of
services, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>
					<a name="07051550000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 47 will amend the Mental
Capacity Act 2005 to introduce safeguards to protect
the rights of a person who is deprived of their liberty. The new
deprivation of liberty safeguards are necessary for people who lack the
capacity to consent to arrangements made for their care. The measure is
being introduced in response to the European Court of Human Rights 2004
judgment in the case of HL <i class="I">v</i>. UK, which is commonly referred to
as the Bournewood judgment. The Court identified the need for
protection from arbitrary deprivation of liberty for people who have a
mental disorder and who lack capacity to consent to arrangements made
for their care, but who are not detained under the 1983 Act.</div>
					<a name="07051550000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">We considered the judgment and
decided that the Bill needs to include formalised procedures covering
who may propose admission, for what reasons and according to what
criteria, and how those should be assessed. Limits must be placed on
how long the deprivation of liberty may continue before a review, which
will include a clinical reassessment that says that a person still has
a mental disorder. There must be a right to have the lawfulness of the
deprivation of liberty decided speedily by a court and for a
representative who can offer a challenge on a person&#146;s behalf to
be appointed.</div>
					<a name="07051550000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed safeguards will address those matters. They will permit the
deprivation of liberty only in circumstances in which that is necessary
in a person&#146;s own best interests and to protect them from harm,
and when that cannot be achieved in a less restrictive
manner.</div>
					<a name="07051550000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals
will give vulnerable people the protections that they currently lack.
The safeguards will give additional protection to those in a hospital
or care home in circumstances that deprive them of liberty. The law
will clarify for hospitals, care homes, service users and their
families the circumstances in which a person may be lawfully deprived
of their liberty. That will enable hospitals and care homes to ensure
that they are acting lawfully.</div>
					<a name="07051550000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The cornerstone of the new
arrangements is that the deprivation of liberty will be lawful only if
it is specifically permitted by a formal authorisation concerning a
particular individual in a particular care home or hospital, or by
order of the Court of Protection. An authorisation may be given only if
six criteria&#151;called &#147;qualifying requirements&#148; in
the Bill&#151;are met, and it will last for up to 12 months. Except
for a short period in urgent cases, all authorisations must be given by
the relevant authority on the basis of the decisions of a properly
qualified assessor. The schedule calls such authorisations
&#147;standard authorisations&#148;. The job of granting standard
authorisations falls to &#147;supervisory bodies&#148;. For care
homes, the supervisory body granting the authorisation would be the
relevant local authority, for hospitals, it would be the PCT, and in
Wales, the National
Assembly.</div>
					<a name="07051550000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments to the Mental Capacity Act have been welcomed by all those
who were involved with that legislation, not least the hon. Member for
Tiverton and Honiton, who has taken great interest in this matter. Our
amendments introduce a power to make regulations to reduce the maximum
length of standard deprivation of liberty authorisations, as agreed in
the other place, in response to concerns that authorisations could be
granted for too long a period.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>
					<a name="07051550000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I come to the detail, I
would like to explain our policy on the duration of authorisations. Our
aim, which I am sure the whole Committee shares, is that if deprivation
of liberty needs to be authorised, it should be for the shortest time
possible. We will make that very clear in the Mental Capacity Act code
of practice and in training facilities. In the other place, Baroness
Ashton committed to strengthening that point in the code, and officials
are working on a revised version, which will be subject to
consultation. That is why we are setting the authorisation period on a
case-by-case basis according to the best interests assessor&#146;s
recommendation.</div>
					<a name="07051550000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The assessor
will look at the person&#146;s circumstances and the likelihood of
change and make a recommendation based on their best interests. There
are cases in which it will be perfectly reasonable to grant an
authorisation for 12 months, and others in which the period will be
much shorter because it may become possible, through rehabilitation and
support, for the person to be cared for at home.</div>
					<a name="07051550000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a change in circumstances
means that the deprivation of liberty should end, the hospital or care
home is required to request a review. The relevant person or the
representative who is appointed to support them can also trigger a
review or apply to the Court of Protection at any time. Those
safeguards mean that if a deprivation of liberty is no longer needed,
it can and will be ended. We will provide information and support to
families and carers to ensure that they can effectively help their
loved ones to make use of the safeguards.</div>
					<a name="07051550000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am confident that the
measures will deliver our aim of ensuring that the deprivation of
liberty does not continue for longer than is necessary for the
person&#146;s protection. Concern was expressed in the other place
that authorisations would have a default duration of 12
months, but I am confident that that will not happen. I reiterate that
we will make it very clear in the code of practice that authorisations
for 12 months should be recommended only if the assessor is confident
that the person&#146;s circumstances are unlikely to change in that
time. However, to allay those concerns, we committed in the other place
to take certain powers. Amendment No. 48 will give us the power in
England, and Welsh Ministers in Wales, to reduce the maximum
authorisation period if monitoring of the operation of safeguards
provides convincing evidence that it is necessary to do so.</div>
					<a name="07051550000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 47 and 53
provide that the regulations, if made, would be debated in both Houses
of Parliament and in the National Assembly for Wales. I hope that the
power will not be needed, but it is prudent to include it in the
legislation. I therefore invite the Committee to support the
amendments.</div>

Browning:
						</b> Seeking to comply with the judgment of the
European Court of Human Rights is probably one of the most important
ways for the Government to use the Mental Capacity Act. There was
considerable debate in the scrutiny Committee on both that legislation
and on the draft Bill, and although I welcome the Government&#146;s
decision finally to use the Act, I still have some concerns that I
would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>like to flag up to the Minister today. It is important that we get this
part of the Bill absolutely right, because it deals with depriving a
very complex and vulnerable group of people of their liberty outwith
the Mental Health Act 1983. The Bournewood case was, as we know, about
lack of protection under that
Act.</div>
					<a name="07051550000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister gave
some welcome clarification about the duration requirement for
authorising deprivation of liberty. She wrote to us all on 17 April
outlining some of the amendments that would be moved in Committee in
this area, most of which she addressed just now. However, I remain
concerned about the rather vague language used on time
scales&#151;language that will be enshrined in the code of practice.
It is of course right that the duration should be the absolute minimum
that is necessary, and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Actual practice, however, could well be based on available resources
rather than on the best interests of the patient.</div>
					<a name="07051550000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">How, therefore, does the
Minister calculate the additional resources that will be required for
the procedures associated with this part of the legislative reform,
which implements Bournewood judgment compliance? There are significant
resource implications that I believe have not been addressed and that,
of themselves, might skew the determinations. In due course I shall
mention some of the lawyers&#146; concerns on that, with particular
regard to the concerns on marrying up the Mental Capacity Act and the
Mental Health Act that have been expressed by the lawyer who handled
the Bournewood case.</div>
					<a name="07051550000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise that the Minister and
her officials have had a difficult task since the appearance of the
judgment, so I am not complaining. They had to decide which Act was the
appropriate one to consider, and I think that they have chosen the
right one. Now, however, we are reaching the detail of implementation,
and it is important not to be satisfied just with putting something on
the statue book in the belief that that is an end of the matter. Will
the Minister therefore consider the safeguards that might be needed on
time factors, notwithstanding her proposed amendments and the contents
of the code of
practice?</div>
					<a name="07051550000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes
there are advantages to lightly worded recommendations, because they
give flexibility in areas where it is needed, but we need to be
cognisant of certain matters that have arisen&#151;including some
that have arisen even since the Bournewood judgment. Not least among
them is the issue of defining liberty and deprivation of liberty, which
remains a matter of some obscurity, as we know from a recent court case
involving Surrey county council. That is because such cases now involve
people deprived of their liberty not only in hospitals, but in wider
care in the community and in residential and nursing homes. Has a
person been deprived of liberty when they are not free to go out of the
door, or when they are not free to go out of the door unless
accompanied by a suitable relative or friend? The case involving Surrey
county council concerned an elderly person with dementia in a
residential setting. If such people are trying constantly to get out of
the front door, is their being contained within the building to be
interpreted as an indication that they are being deprived of their
liberty?</div>
					<a name="07051550000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those who
looked at the Bournewood case when it reached the House of Lords were
clear that, had HL 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>tried to leave the Bournewood hospital, it would have clearly been wrong
to have let him go because, in his own interests, it was better that he
be contained within the building while he was undergoing treatment.
That was the determination of the Lords. However, the European Court
found in favour of HL after hearing his lawyers&#146;
arguments.</div>
					<a name="07051550000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister consider the definition of deprivation of liberty, because
several references have been during our proceedings to the
opportunities for lawyers when there is lack of clarity and a grey area
that allows different interpretations? Because the right hon. Lady has
not actually defined deprivation of liberty in the Bill or, for that
matter, in the code of practice, it may well lead to further legal
challenges that the legal profession might welcome. That should be
something that the Minister should reconsider during the final
considerations on formulating the code of practice or the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07051550000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly
welcome the Minister&#146;s keeping her word and the
Government&#146;s pledges in Committee in another place. The six
qualifying requirements to deprive someone of their liberty are
sensible and well drafted. There is an age requirement, the mental
health requirement, the mental capacity requirement, the best interests
requirement, the eligibility requirement and the no refusals
requirement. We are still at a stage when for some people the Mental
Health Act will be applied, and for others the Mental Capacity Act will
be applied. I want clarification from the right hon. Lady. If, under
the initial assessment, it is appropriate to apply the amendments to
the Mental Capacity Act, how will changes in circumstance be regulated
so that patients who might move between the scopes of the two different
Acts can be assured of the protections that they need? I am still not
100 per cent. sure that such provisions have been correctly drafted
because there is a rather vague definition of deprivation of liberty
and, under the Mental Capacity Act, we now seem to have embraced a
wider group of
people.</div>
					<a name="07051550000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer the
Minister to a bundle of documents that were provided to the Committee.
The Government supplied an excellent guide, &#147;The Bournewood
Safeguards&#148;. I am looking at the easy-read
version.</div>

							<a name="07051550000408"></a>
								Angela
Browning:
						</b> It is very good. I commend the Government on how
they issue such guides. The document explains who will usually use the
Bournewood safeguards&#151;in other words, who will come within the
scope of clause 47, to which the Minister has tabled the amendments.
They include</div>
					<a name="07051550000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;people who
have serious learning disabilities&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07051550000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">which goes without saying, but then we
come to a group that covers the Surrey county council case,
which is</div>
					<a name="07051550000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;older people
with mental illnesses like
dementia&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051550000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">That group is
not small and I suggest to the Minister that it is growing. We know
from demographics that we have an increasingly elderly population,
although such conditions do not exclusively affect the elderly. People
in that group might be detained against their liberty. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>is a pretty wide and large group, and it is going to expand. I return to
the question of resources. How will the Minister ensure that adequate
resources are available to implement the safeguards that she is
building into the clause? My suspicion is that the Government have
underestimated how many people will be dealt with under the clause. If
resources are not available, the safeguards will not prevent people
from falling through the
net.</div>
					<a name="07051550000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
mentioned earlier the concern about the definition of deprivation of
liberty and the question of the same individual moving between the
regimes of the Mental Health Act and the Mental Capacity Act, but I
should also like to draw attention to the difficulties identified by
the legal profession, which has taken a close interest in the Bill. We
benefited from MH55, a paper submitted by Robert Robinson, a solicitor
with Scott-Moncrieff, Harbour and Sinclair in London, who pursued the
Bournewood case. He quotes the conclusion of the Joint Committee on
Human Rights, which commented unfavourably on the guidance. It
stated:</div>
					<a name="07051550000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
consider that deprivation of liberty is a less flexible and elusive
concept than might be thought from the draft illustrative guidance.
Since we posed this question to the
Government&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07051550000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">clearly,
the Minister or her officials have had some discussion with lawyers on
the
subject&#151;</div>
					<a name="07051550000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Munby J.
has delivered judgment in J.E. and D.E. <i class="I">v</i>
						<i class="I">.</i> Surrey County
Council and E.W., holding that the crucial issue in determining whether
there is a deprivation of liberty is not so much whether the
person&#146;s freedom within the institutional setting is curtailed,
but rather whether or not the person is free to
leave.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051550000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
areas are complex and grey, but while they remain so, and as further
case law emerges that only compounds the problem of definition, it
seems that while seeking to fill the Bournewood gap, we are considering
a much wider group of people than was alluded to in the original
Bournewood case, shocking as it was. I met H.L., an adult in his 40s,
after he left the Bournewood hospital. It must be said that for many
years, he was an in-patient in that hospital, so his condition had
quite a long track record, but none the less there were complications.
I shall not digress too much into the Bournewood case, but it triggered
the need to change the law, as it eventually went before the European
Court of Human Rights and was found to involve a contravention of
article 5 of the
convention.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07051550000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07051550000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the
lawyers still feel that as more case law is made, an even wider group
of people will be encompassed by the measures, clarity in the
definition of deprivation of liberty is essential. The Minister must
also examine the resource implications. I have alluded to just one
group of people, purely because a court case involved somebody from it.
The Government seem to think, judging by the documentation that they
have put out, including the easy-read version of the Bournewood
judgment, that we are talking about a small, discrete group, whereas
the lawyers seem to be saying that many more people will be subject to
this legislation than the Government are
indicating.</div>
					<a name="07051550000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only
does that have implications for the deprivation of liberty&#151;a
wider group of people will be involved&#151;but there are important
resource implications. The Minister may not able to give specific 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>answers today on the issues that I have raised, but before the page is
closed on the Bill and it becomes an Act of Parliament, she should, yet
again, be prepared to discuss this, face to face, with the lawyers.
They have had a great involvement with the case and clearly know it
well, so if they have ongoing concerns, it is important that the
Minister is made aware of them.</div>
					<a name="07051550000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not a lawyer, so I am
giving the layman&#146;s version of what the lawyers have sent me and
the rest of the Committee. I hope that the Minister understands that
this is an important part of getting things right. There is no party
political divide, because we all want her to get this right, but I hope
that before coming back to the House on Report, she will consider that
this part of the Bill should be examined carefully and she will give an
audience to those lawyers who continue to have
concerns.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000409"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> It may be helpful if I give an example of how
the process might work. Let us consider a patient who is in his 70s and
is physically fit and strong, but who has advanced dementia. He has
been cared for at home by his wife, who has been struggling to cope
with his behaviour. He is admitted to a care home in an emergency after
his wife falls and breaks a hip. Understandably, the upheaval of the
move has meant that he is extremely disturbed. Restrictions are needed
to keep him calm and safe, and the family are asked not to take him out
of the care home because he becomes so disorientated and distressed.
The care home considers this to amount to a deprivation of liberty and
applies for an authorisation.</div>
					<a name="07051550000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those circumstances, the
local authority would arrange for an assessment to be carried out. Let
us suppose that the psychiatrist who has been seeing the gentleman as
an out-patient confirms the diagnosis of mental disorder and assesses
the likely impact of the care proposed and the capacity of
Peter&#151;that is what I shall call him&#151;to consent. A social
worker with extensive experience in the care of the elderly, who has no
connection with the gentleman&#146;s case, is appointed to make an
independent assessment of what is in Peter&#146;s best interests. The
outcome of the assessment is that deprivation of liberty is authorised
for three months and Peter&#146;s son is appointed to act as his
representative.</div>
					<a name="07051550000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us then suppose that after nine weeks, Peter&#146;s wife comes back
home, much recovered, and wants her husband to return to live with her.
The son requests a review of the authorisation, and the best interests
assessor, after speaking to Peter, his wife, their son and the care
home, recommends that he should return home. The authorisation would be
terminated, and the gentleman would return home, with the support of
carers provided morning and evening.</div>
					<a name="07051550000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the desire of the
hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton to define the deprivation of
liberty, but it is almost impossible to give a definition that could be
used in every case. In the code of practice we have tried to identify
factors that the courts have used to determine whether a person is
deprived of liberty. Some of the factors that we have given
are:</div>
					<a name="07051550000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Restraint
was used, including sedation, to admit a person who was
resisting;</div>
					<a name="07051550000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">Professionals
exercised complete and effective control over care and movement for a
significant period;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>
					<a name="07051550000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">Professionals exercised control
over assessments, treatment, contacts and
residence&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07051550000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">if a decision
has been taken that the person would
be</div>
					<a name="07051550000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prevented from
leaving if they made a meaningful attempt to do
so;</div>
					<a name="07051550000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">A request by
carers for the person to be discharged to their care was
refused&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07051550000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">that was
particularly relevant to the case with which the hon. Lady is
familiar&#151;</div>
					<a name="07051550000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
person was unable to maintain social contacts because of restrictions
placed on access to other
people;</div>
					<a name="07051550000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">The person
lost autonomy because they were under continuous supervision and
control.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07051550000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
that there is an ability to examine each individual to see whether it
is considered that what is happening is a deprivation of liberty. It is
difficult for us to consider every case in which someone is deprived,
because it often depends on the individual and what they consider to be
a deprivation of their liberty as well as the views of those around
them.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07051550000410"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): There is a situation that
might well arise in the circumstances that my right hon. Friend the
Minister described. Would it be a deprivation of liberty if it were
agreed that the gentleman could go home, and his family wanted him home
but could not have him without the provision of the care package of two
calls a day that she described, and the local authority was unable to
implement it? In the scenario that was described, that is the
hitch&#151;a local authority&#146;s ability to put in the care
package. I would welcome clarification of
that.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000411"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> But I believe that that is why the best
interests assessor would come into it. The assessor would have to
balance what was happening in the care home with what it would be
possible to achieve in the home. One may well be dependent upon the
other, so that the authorisation would be terminated if it were felt
that the appropriate packages were in place. My officials are nodding
encouragingly, so I assume that that is
right.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000412"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> I hope that the Minister&#146;s officials will
continue to nod encouragingly. I am genuinely trying to be helpful, but
I have reservations because the lawyers have raised them with us. I
wish to return to the case of an elderly person with dementia, perhaps
wandering around in a residential setting and trying to leave. In the
case that I mentioned, JE and DE <i class="I">v. </i>Surrey County Council and
EW, with which I am sure the Minister&#146;s officials will be
familiar, Munby J. referred in his judgment
to</div>
					<a name="07051550000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the necessary
objective element in a deprivation of
liberty&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051550000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was a
judge determining his own interpretation of a deprivation of liberty,
and he said in his summing
up:</div>
					<a name="07051550000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the
type of case with which I am here concerned, the key factor is whether
the person is, or is not, free to
leave&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07051550000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is how
the courts are determining it, I wonder why the Minister cannot be a
little more clear about her
definition.</div>
					
					<a name="07051550000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000413"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Because, as the hon. Lady has pointed out, the
courts in that case looked at the individual&#146;s circumstances. We
have tried in the code of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>practice to say, &#147;These are the types of things that the courts
have looked at.&#148; If we said in legislation, &#147;These are
the only things that can amount to a deprivation of liberty,&#148; we
could be open to some of the challenges that brought about the
provision in the first place. We do not want to try to stipulate that
and so exclude people who might feel, or whose carers or family might
feel, that there had been a deprivation of liberty because we had
specifically set that out in legislation. It would be almost impossible
for us not to lay ourselves open to even more legal challenges. Having
said that, I would be more than happy for the audience with the
lawyers, suggested by the hon. Lady, to take place&#151;not least
because it sounds very grand. However, I may defer to my officials on
that issue so that they can discuss with the relevant lawyers in the
Department whether such an audience would be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07051550000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn
briefly to the relevant figures. We have estimated that about 21,000
assessments will need to be made in the first year; after that, we
estimate that there will be about 5,000 per year. We are discussing
that with the relevant local authorities and will keep the issue under
review.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>
					<a name="07051550000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given those reassurances, I hope
that the Committee will accept the Government&#146;s amendments,
which, as I say, are meant to be safeguards on an important
issue.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07051550000414"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> I appreciate the Minister&#146;s offer to
consider the audience and shall do my best to pass that on. However,
will she comment on my point about the need for clarity between
patients who might move from one Act to the
next?</div>

as much information as possible about their rights and the safeguards
that are in one or other of the Acts. Obviously, different criteria
apply to each, and we shall try to make that as clear as
possible.</div>
