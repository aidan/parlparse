</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> A request was made this morning for a copy of amended clause 138. A draft of the clause has now been placed on the table in the Room for the benefit of members of the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 138</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appointment of persons to carry out investigations in particular cases</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 529, in page 65, line 14, leave out from `if' to `that', in line 15, and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`it appears to the Authority that there are circumstances suggesting'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 530 to 538.
<P>
No. 491, in page 65, line 41, at end insert
<P>

<P>
Government amendment No. 538.
<P>
No. 492, in page 65, line 46, at the end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`into the matter giving rise to the suspicion'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 539.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): At our previous sitting, I was coming to the end of a run-through of the impact of various Government amendments to clause 138. Government amendments Nos. 537 and 538 refer to sections 19 and 208, section 341 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and general market abuse regimes. The changed wording referring to ``circumstances suggesting'' under amendment No. 535 is not satisfactory and the existing wording of the Bill is more appropriate and reasonable. The amendments are part of the re-organisation of the different provisions of clause 138 and our biggest objection to them is the sneaking in of an unlimited right to intervene in circumstances where there is no additional requirement to give notice to the person being investigated.
<P>
Apart from anything else, that would be contrary to clause 2(3)(e) of the Bill. In fact, we have received notice from the City that it is regarded as damaging to the international competitiveness of the United Kingdom in relation to other centres. I suspect that some of the new amendments to clause 140 may have been prompted by one particular Investment Management Regulatory Organisation case that has been going on and which may have arisen from the Financial Services Authority nobbling either the Treasury or the Government draftsmen to tighten up and, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell) said, reduce the potential for judicial review in this and other territories where the FSA acts when it does not have adequate justification to do so in relation to any suspicions and is using the powers for its own ends.
<P>
Conservative amendments Nos. 491 and 492 would make it clear—and after the comments of the Minister this morning, they are still necessary—that an investigation needs to be conducted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``into the matter giving rise to the suspicion''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As drafted, subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority may appoint one or more competent persons to conduct an investigation on its behalf'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with no qualification whatever. Amendment No. 491 would correctly add to subsection (3) the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``into the matter giving rise to the suspicion''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 492 would add the same words to subsection (4), which deals with the specifically stated suspicions mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) to subsection (1). Those paragraph letters will, of course, be changed as a result of the redrafting of the Bill. The matter is quite simple, however; when conducting an investigation, the authority's territory should be confined to those matters that caused it to believe that an investigation was appropriate.
<P>
The amendments make it clear that investigations must be restricted to the relevant matters that have been their cause. As drafted, the circumstances in which investigators can be appointed are widely drawn, with no express limitation on what they must investigate. To argue that it is implicit in the clause as it stands, let alone the clause as redrafted, does not stand up.
<P>
We are extremely uncomfortable with those aspects of the redrafting of clause 138, because it considerably increases the FSA's power to call for investigations without grounds for suspicion. Our amendments go in one direction—to try to make it clear that the clause as it stands is right. The Government amendments go in the other direction; indeed, they have admitted that they want to ensure that the FSA would not encounter legal problems when ordering an investigation on the ground that it had exceeded its powers.
<P>
The redrafted clause is designed to give the authority a carte-blanche Star Chamber power to call for investigations. We believe that that is unacceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I should like to confine my remarks to the test of reasonableness, which has been removed from the Bill. The clause originally stated that an investigation can take place
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``if the Authority has reasonable grounds for suspecting that'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is followed by a list of possible offences. Subsection (2) uses the same phrase. It is being replaced by the words 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if it appears to the Authority that there are circumstances suggesting''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Anyone coming across that phrase will find a much weaker test that if the authority has ``reasonable grounds''.
<P>
I was talking to some lawyers last night, and I asked what was the difference between what the Government suggest in the new draft and a test of reasonableness. I also said that when the Opposition had tried to insert a test of reasonableness elsewhere in the Bill, Ministers had replied that the FSA was under a general duty to behave reasonably, and that nothing would be gained by adding a test of reasonableness. The original draftsmen, scribbling away in the Treasury Solicitor's department got it right; those who drafted the amendments—probably Treasury Ministers—have got it wrong. We should return to a general test of reasonableness.
<P>
In a moment, I shall explain briefly the grounds for assessing whether the FSA has acted reasonably that I understand will remain once the phrases in question have been removed. However, before I do so, I shall refer briefly, without going into detail, to some of the most salient provisions for which the Government have either voted down or rejected amendments to specify in the Bill the application of a general test of reasonableness.
<P>
Under clause 2, which covers general duties, we said that the FSA should have a general duty to act reasonably. That was voted down. A further crucial provision was schedule 1, to which we wanted to add a phrase along the lines of:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The authority must ensure that it acts in a reasonable, proportionate and fair way.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government rejected that, too. They did not accept that the authority should have a duty to ensure that it acts in a reasonable, proportionate and fair way. In discussing clause 46, we argued that, in demanding further information from companies, the FSA should have a duty to act reasonably, and that a reasonableness test should apply to such a demand. The Government did not accept that, either.
<P>
This clause is being affected by a general change of tone on the part of the Government, which also affected earlier clauses. Clauses are being amended to remove sensible phraseology.
<P>
The amended wording—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if it appears to the Authority that there are circumstances suggesting''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
leaves virtually no grounds for judicial review of the FSA. I understand that the general grounds for judicial review are, first, illegality—if the FSA does something that is clearly not in accordance with the Act of Parliament under which it operates. A second ground is procedural impropriety—if the FSA flagrantly flouts the procedures that it is expected to follow. I shall defer to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire, but I suspect that a duty of propriety includes a duty to act fairly, involving a right to a fair hearing and the principle that no one should be judged in his own cause. I believe that that was what brought down the Pinochet case, as it was held that Lord Hoffmann was acting in his own cause.
<P>
A third ground for judicial review is irrationality—an authority must be shown to have acted irrationally. To put it another way, if it can be shown that no reasonable authority would have behaved as the authority has behaved, that would constitute grounds for overturning a decision or for judicial review. That third ground for judicial review is what I understand to be the Wednesbury test. I understand that as a result of the Government's amendments only that test will remain. It will be the only protection afforded to firms in the face of unreasonable behaviour by the FSA.
<P>
Firms will have to show that the FSA has not only acted unreasonably but has more or less taken leave of its senses, thrown a wobbly, or done something extraordinary for it to be caught by judicial review under the Wednesbury test. A lawyer described it to me last night as often being defined as a test of egregious unreasonableness, so it is extremely strong.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not know how often judicial review has succeeded under the Wednesbury principle, but I remember the Bromley case. I shall not go into it in great detail, but it involved the hon. Member for—I cannot remember where—
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household):</B> Brent, North.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) halved fares on the underground and intended to precept London local authorities to foot the difference of the bill, but the House of Lords held him to have contravened the Wednesbury doctrine. In other words, he had acted unreasonably and thrown a wobbly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): As the sitting Member for Brent, North, I assure the Committee that it was the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone), who is a neighbour of mine, albeit a somewhat distant one.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I do not often take my lead from the Government Whip, and I shall remember not to do so in future.
<P>
That was a case of egregious unreasonableness, and the overwhelming majority of the British public thought so at the time, but it is a difficult test to prove.
<P>
There is no duty on the FSA or on an authority under the Wednesbury principle to consult anyone before working out whether it thinks that reasonable action has been taken; nor does the Wednesbury principle provide any practical oversight by the courts, except in the most egregious cases. That is why I have now concluded, although I listened carefully to the Ministers, that it is not right to say that firms will be in any practical way protected by the general duty to act reasonably—a phrase that has been thrown around the Committee Room on numerous occasions recently.
<P>
The Bill is right and the amendment is wrong. The test in the Bill is objective, because a huge body of law is available to decide what is reasonable behaviour. It is the reasonable behaviour of a man on the Clapham omnibus. That test would enable what we would all recognise as unreasonable behaviour by the FSA to be picked up by the courts in judicial review, but that will not be possible once the words ``reasonable grounds'' have been removed from the Bill.
<P>
I can assume only that the Government have decided to remove those words because they way to remove the possibility of judicial review. I can think of no other reason. They must have been advised that it is not wanted so it should be removed as much as possible, and replaced by the vague form of words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it appears to the Authority that there are circumstances suggesting''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Will the hon. Gentleman explain why a judicial review could not investigate ``circumstances suggesting'' as competently as ``reasonable grounds''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I can answer that only by telling the hon. Gentleman what I have been told by lawyers: that the wording proposed by the Government will leave only the Wednesbury precedent for any form of judicial review. Therefore, the test will be for egregious unreasonableness. It will have to have been extraordinary and almost certainly irrational behaviour for such a challenge to be sustained. I may be wrong, or the people who advise me may be wrong. If the hon. Gentleman has been advised differently, I am sure that he will let the Committee know in due course.
<P>
I do not want to go on at length, except to say that we should all pause and think about this important issue, which could destroy a business. Just the mere fact or knowledge of an investigation can destroy a business. Is asking the FSA to act reasonably so outrageous? That was exactly what the Government thought was the right approach, until they tabled the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): First, may I thank you, Mr. O'Brien, for having the clause printed out so swiftly in a usable form? It is extremely helpful and it is exactly how the Committee should be conducted. To add a word of slight dismay, which is not a matter for you Mr. O'Brien, I have heard that it may be intended to sit after 8.30 pm tonight. I suggest respectfully that that is not the way in which the Committee should conduct its business. The Government are busy and I understand that they are having difficulty in keeping pace with the Bill. That is shown by the fact that we are discussing amendments today that were starred only yesterday. It is no good the Minister shaking her head. They appeared on the amendment paper yesterday as starred amendments. As an Opposition trying to do our duty, we are attempting to keep pace with them, but it is not possible to do that if we do not sit regular and sensible hours. There has been no filibustering in the Committee. We are dealing with central and crucial issues, as I shall demonstrate the next 10 minutes.
<P>
I turn to the substance of the matter. We are talking about the power to appoint persons to carry out investigations in particular cases. The issue, which we have all mentioned, and to which my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) referred to most recently, are the circumstances in which the authority should be able to appoint investigators, with or without an opportunity for judicial review of that great and potentially draconian power. It is a serious power. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, who understands the City well said, the mere act of appointing an investigator, which can sometimes be done secretly, as we shall see in subsequent clauses, can do great damage to a business. I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is not an act that the authority should carry out without careful thought beforehand and without good reasons for doing it.
<P>
Unfortunately the Bill, which originally at least required that there should be reasonable grounds, now does not require anything more than the provision, which states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if it appears to the Authority that there are circumstances suggesting that''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
various things that ought not to have happened may have been done. In those circumstances, the authority may appoint investigators.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right, and I hope that the Minister will accept that this is probably the lightest form of control that can be expressed in United Kingdom legislation. These words are designed to make it extremely difficult for the courts to exercise any power of judicial control in circumstances that fall short of either bad faith or misfeasance in public Office. What constitutes misfeasance in public office is hard to say. Bad faith can be recognised if it occurs, but it constitutes a high test indeed, which, I hope, will never apply in the FSA. A decision to investigate could all too easily cause serious damage to businesses if it had not been thought through sufficiently, if precautions had not been taken and if what we hope, and the City trusts, will happen under Mr. Howard Davies—that is, a careful review before any such decision is taken—had failed to take place. That is the practical problem.
<P>
To emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, under the amendments, one can challenge a decision to appoint an investigator only if no reasonable authority would have thought it right to make that appointment. I hope that those who assist Ministers will listen carefully. If they think that I have got the law wrong, I shall listen carefully and think again; I am not trying to make debating points.
<P>
The Government are going down the wrong road. I am not teasing them—although I use the word carefully—when I say that this is not the modern way to proceed. It is not the way in which the jurisdictions of western Europe, of which we are a member as part of the European Union, are going. They do not have such untrammelled power in France or Germany, and we do not need it. Those who are regulated in France and Germany are more able than we are to have such decisions effectively judicially reviewed under their systems. The reason that they have that greater ability is, first, that the equivalent of the FSA in France is liable for serious faults and, secondly, that damages can be awarded in such circumstances. In fact, that is a requirement under United Kingdom law.
<P>
The Bill is contrary to the law of the European Union. Therefore, the Bill will contradict our law because the law of the European Union is incorporated into our law under the European Communities Act 1972. I say that because I was a Minister when we were found to be in breach of our own law because the law did not provide an adequate remedy or a remedy in damages. The European Court of Justice and subsequently the House of Lords held that we were liable to damages in principle. There is no more famous case in this area than that of Factortame. That case established an obligation in European law to provide a remedy for serious fault.
<P>
The French expression for serious fault is faute lourde, which is sometimes referred to as a sufficiently serious fault or a grave and manifest fault—the definitions vary because of language differences. However, European law requires that public bodies, which affect the lives of citizens, should, other than in exceptional circumstances, be liable to compensate people if they have been injured as a result of grave or serious fault on their behalf. That is exactly what will not happen under the Bill. The amendments take us further from the position that should exist. Before they appeared on the amendment paper yesterday, subsection (3) the power to appoint the investigator—applied if the authority had ``reasonable grounds for suspecting'' and the question of whether the question of whether the authority had reasonable grounds for suspecting could be reviewed by the courts.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The notes helpfully provided and circulated by the Minister state that the existing wording is thought to impose an unnecessarily high test for launching an investigation. I respectfully challenge that. I sincerely hope that in practice the FSA will not start launching investigations simply because it thinks that there are circumstances suggesting that a person may, for example, have contravened section 17 or 53(2) or any regulation under section 113 and that it will go further than seeing whether there are such circumstances. I hope that it will examine whether there are ``reasonable grounds to believe''—the wording that has just been removed from the clause.
<P>
It would be so much more satisfactory if the law were consistent with common sense; if it were, it would be much closer to our European obligations. So that there is no confusion, I point out that even with the powers of judicial review in the original wording of the clause, the Bill would be defective in relation to European law.
<P>
The amendment is a step in the wrong direction and unless we receive assurances that the Government will carefully and seriously re-examine the point, we should vote against the clause.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Could my right hon. and learned Friend clarify whether I had it right when I said that although the existing wording was perhaps defective in respect of European law, it would at least provide an objective test for the man on the Clapham omnibus? However—and this is the crucial difference—once that phrase is removed, all that we are left with is the Wednesbury principle, the egregious unreasonableness test.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend has much of it right. However, the reality is slightly different, as I shall try to explain. Until the amendment is accepted, the existing wording would allow the unfettered operation of Wednesbury principles—the principles of the Wednesbury case. Briefly stated, those principles have three ingredients. First, the courts may intervene and will strike down administrative action if what is done is unlawful and in breach of the statutory framework. Secondly, they may strike down such action if it is procedurally improper. A good example of that is where one is required to consult before something is done but it is then not done or not done properly. The third ingredient is what my hon. Friend refers to as egregious unreasonableness or irrationality. To take Lord Diplock's famous triple statement, irrational in this regard would mean that no reasonable authority could behave in such a way.
<P>
All that remains is that third ingredient. As the authority does not have to have reasonable grounds before it starts an investigation, which would be a sensible requirement, the court cannot strike down the decision to start the investigation on the basis that there were not reasonable grounds. All that is left is a purely subjective test. I am sure that the courts will try to get around that. Lawyers and, ultimately, the courts will seek to encroach on this if such wording continues to be used, which is another reason for constantly trying to force the courts away.
<P>
This is the lightest possible wording that can be laid on an authority. A member of my chambers who has studied the Bill said that much of it is specifically designed to make it judicial review proof. It is a mistake. We do not want the FSA to be fettered by the constant fear of huge damages. The Financial Secretary has just come in, so he will not have heard what I was saying. The structure that we are setting up is not in accordance with European law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> How many judicial reviews have arisen out of the establishment of an official investigation, as opposed to the conclusion of an authority such as the FSA? We are debating not the concluding penalties or decisions of the FSA but whether an investigation should be set up. Are there any precedents for a judicial review in those circumstances?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Off the cuff, I do not know. There are parallel precedents where people have set in power investigations and where judicial reviews have been sought. When I was responsible for the Serious Fraud Office, some of its investigations were the subject of litigation. I cannot remember the outcome, but one can look back to see. The important point is that if people are not answerable in law they are less careful than they would otherwise be. People should have to look over their shoulder: there should be practical, legal reasons for taking serious decisions such as starting investigations in a methodical, careful and reasonable way. They are not required to do that by the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) broke into the points that I was trying to make. The Bill is not in accordance with European law in many respects. European law requires that the Government should include a remedy for serious faults—faute lourde in the French parlance—and a remedy in damages. The Bill specifically does not provide that. It lifts away the only thing in the English tradition that provides supervision—judicial review. We are being far tighter than our competitors. Those who set up financial systems in other jurisdictions will have not only a lighter touch, but a better supervised touch than we will. We are not moving correctly in the way that modern financial services authorities should move. I ask the Government to go away and think seriously about these points and come back with a considered answer before Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The drift of the Opposition's case in trying to apply the test of reasonableness is to demand that the evidence is available before the investigation, which will take the evidence, has been held. That amounts to a catch-22. The aim of the amendments is to have a light test at the point where the evidence on whether an investigation can be set up is bound to be fragmentary and flimsy. If we go fully down the road of applying too rigorous a test and demanding evidence that is unlikely to be available, many wrongdoers will never be investigated.
<P>
The drift of the argument, as on so many occasions, is effectively to water down the Bill and make it more difficult for the FSA to achieve anything. The Opposition are more conscious of the FSA taking on draconian powers than of wrongdoers getting away with it, which is equally damaging to the City.
<P>
On 1 November, the Financial Times was right in saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as far as the FSA's disciplinary and enforcement powers are concerned, enough time has now been spent on improvements. The balance is now broadly right''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in this case, the balance between fairness and usefulness.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Attempts to tilt it further would merely favour insider traders, incompetent managers and cheats.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Opposition should take that into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I want to make the point that the Financial Times article was written before the amendments that we objected to were debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I would have preferred to make an intervention, but this will be the shortest speech for a while.
<P>
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that the Government want to give the authority the power to launch an investigation, even where he and I and everybody else in this Room might consider, on looking at the evidence, that there were no reasonable grounds for launching an investigation. The FSA will be able to launch an investigation in those circumstances, which we believe is wrong. The majority of members of the Committee does not appreciate that a mere threat of an investigation is a huge power and that a threat in itself can force significant changes in the behaviour of firms. That is why we speak of the FSA as a leviathan: it is being given such huge powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am coming to my point. The hon. Gentleman can make another speech if he wants to.
<P>
Of course we want the FSA to have the power to catch miscreants, but there should also be a duty to act reasonably—a duty that the Government originally believed should be built into the Bill but which is now being withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> In response to the hon. Gentleman's deterrent theory, I should point out that it is no deterrent if the Bill is so constructed that the FSA is hobbled at every end in trying to institute its investigations. That is the key issue: is the FSA over-hobbled or is the provision too draconian? The hon. Gentleman is too conscious of the hobbling and not conscious enough of the wrongdoing that will go unpunished if there is no investigation because the test for instigating it is too strict.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> Three of the amendments that we are now debating—Nos. 529, 535 and 538—align the test in the clause with those currently used in section 177 of the Financial Services Act 1986 and section 432 of the Companies Act 1985. That is a key point, which all the Opposition Members who contributed seemed to miss.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am grateful to hon. Members for their thanks for the consolidated text of clause 138, which we produced. They will see from it that we propose that the relevant investigating authority—the FSA or the Secretary of State—can launch an investigation where it appears to it that circumstances suggest that a contravention might have taken place. As it stands, the Bill would require the FSA to have a degree of certainty that an offence had been committed before am investigation could be launched. It would have to be close to the degree of certainty needed before a person could, for example, be arrested. That test is too stringent, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford said, to deal effectively with the issues that the FSA will have to tackle. The amendments before the Committee return the drafting to the form used in current legislation—that is the force of what we are doing.
<P>
There is a similar test in clause 137, about which we had an interesting discussion this morning on amendment No. 460. I hope that my remarks will help the Committee, and perhaps I could answer slightly more fully one or two of the points that were made this morning.
<P>
Opposition Members, and particularly the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire, focused on the fact that the test in clause 137 is subjective, which is quite right. It is the same subjective test that we find in section 105 of the Financial Services Act, just as the test that we propose for clause 138 is the same test that we find in the Financial Services Act and the Companies Act. I agree that it is not a heavy test, but I am unable to say whether it is the lightest test. We are talking about circumstances in which it simply might not be possible for the FSA to form a reasonable suspicion, but in which it is eminently desirable none the less that it should be able to investigate. There is an important question of balance. We want the FSA to be able to investigate where it must so that it can pursue possible breaches, which could damage investors and markets. We should not lose sight of the fact that that approach is central to the objectives of regulation and of the Bill. It is of paramount importance for the future and standing of our financial services industry and for maintaining its credibility.
<P>
We have gone back to the wording in the amendments. We want the regulator to have effective powers. We are not in the business of equipping the FSA with powers that are less effective than those that it already has. I make no apology for that. The wording that we suggest has been in use in company law since at least 1948, and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire will know that better than me. The cry is usually for the powers to be used more rather than less frequently in that context.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The hon. Lady said a moment ago that the Government were returning the law to the position in the 1986 Act. However, I have the Act in my hand and it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The powers of the Secretary of State under this section shall be exercisable in any case in which it appears to him that there is good reason to do so for the purpose of investigating the affairs''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The test of reasonableness exists in the 1986 Act. It was transferred to the original draft of the Bill, but it is being removed at this late stage.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I can only refer the hon. Gentleman to section 177 of the Financial Services Act, which contains the wording that we are using. It is also the wording of section 432 of the Companies Act.
<P>
We do not apologise for equipping the FSA with the powers that it needs to be effective. As a result, the question with which a court would deal on the judicial review of a decision to exercise the power under the clause is whether it could have appeared to any reasonable authority or any reasonable Secretary of State that there were circumstances suggesting that a contravention had or may have taken place. In clause 137, which is similar, the court would consider whether it could have appeared to any reasonable authority or any reasonable Secretary of State that there were good reasons for investigating the business of an authorised person or appointed representative.
<P>
I hope that that has helped hon. Members by clarifying the Government's position and their reasons for undertaking such action. I sometimes fear that there is a degree of paranoia among Opposition Members about why things are being done. However, we cannot have a regulator who does not have the powers that he or she needs. That is all that we are seeking to achieve by using the wording of previous legislation in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister has missed the point in regard to one matter and has failed to address other matters.
<P>
The Minister is wrong to say that powers will be restored. In relation to investigation powers, section 105 of the Financial Services Act 1986 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The powers of the Secretary of State under this section shall be exercisable in any case in which it appears to him that there is good reason to do so for the purpose of investigating the affairs . . . of any person''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unless it has been amended in a way in which I am not aware, that Act refers to ``good reason'', not ``circumstances suggesting''.
<P>
Therefore, the wording of the two measures is not identical. It is perfectly true that the words ``it appears'' are in the 1986 Act and, to that extent, the matter is subjective. However, the Minister is wrong to say that what was there before is being put back. She is exaggerating and ought to be better informed.
<P>
The Minister did not attempt to answer the points I made about the general structure of law in Europe in relation to such matters. Financial services disciplines in France, Germany and other EU countries require—as European law requires of us—that there should be a framework in which serious fault on the part of the regulator can give rise to a remedy, including damages. If that existed here—and I am asking for no more for the United Kingdom than that which exists for all other EU members—then a little warning lamp would cause FSA and similar authorities to be a bit more careful. In practical terms, that is what we are asking for, and the Minister has failed to give us a reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister has defended the Government amendment by suggesting that it is an attempt to return to the position under the 1986 Act. Therefore, is she prepared to reassure us that she will carefully re-examine the 1986 Act to determine whether an amendment might be tabled on Report enabling the law to remain as it is, as far as possible? The Minister was not correct to say that there is a return to the 1986 Act. That may have been the Government's intention, but it is not correct to say that they have done that.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I can only read from the second edition of Butterworth's financial services law handbook, which was published in 1996. On page 149, the heading ``Part VII Insider Dealing'' is followed by the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``173-176 (Repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 1993)''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and some details about that. The handbook continues
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``177 Investigations into insider dealing<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) If it appears to the Secretary of State that there are circumstances suggesting that''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): We shall consider that. But why is the Minister referring simply to insider dealing? The clause goes infinitely wider than that. Why did she read out that rather narrow focused provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I have listened carefully. I fished out my copy of the 1986 Act and looked at section 105, which was precisely the section to which the Minister referred to confirm that the provision was a translation of the 1986 terms, which patently it is not. There is no use reading another section from Butterworth to justify what is clearly not section 105, which refers specifically to investigation powers.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I read the relevant section of the 1986 Act which has been extensively amended. It relates to a point that the Committee touched on previously. It is not especially a point about insider dealing, it is a form of words that has been carried forward and is already to be found in two relevant Acts. We propose to carry forward only the existing form of words. Hon. Gentlemen deny that it exists, but it does, and we are carrying it forward. That is all that we are doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We seem to be in complete conflict over facts. The Minister now says that the 1986 Act, from which we quote, has been subsequently amended. We are quoting from the 1997 reprinted version. Is it not likely that a subsequent amendment would have been updated in that version? If not, surely the Government printers have fallen severely short of their duties. The Minister claims that there were subsequent amendments whereby the reasonableness clause in the 1986 Act somehow vanished, but that does not appear to be so according to the latest edition of the Act which we have here. Did something actually happen, or is the hon. Lady just plain wrong?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I cannot comment on the version that the hon. Gentleman has.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It is the only version. Clause 137 is the translation of the section to which we keep referring. Clause 138 is more appropriate as it deals with circumstances where an offence may have been committed, as under section 177, which relates to insider dealing. That is the comparison between clause 138 and section 177 of the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am sure that it is not the only version.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Why did the Minister just quote section 105 in defence of the clause? We seem to be using pick and mix to prove that the hon. Lady is patently wrong in her assertion that the wording was in the 1986 Act, which apparently it was not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> By chance, it is again chapter X of the 1986 Act that deals with this point. Section 105 relates to investigation powers. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The powers of the Secretary of state under this section shall be exercisable in any case in which it appears to him that there is good reason to do so for the purpose of investigating the affairs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Section 108 relates to auditors' power to require a second audit, which is not comparable to the section that deals with investigation powers
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I feel sympathy for the Minister because this is a difficult area. However, it is also an important area. The hon. Lady says that she cannot keep up with the 1986 Act as amended, but the 1997 version is currently the law of the land, which her Department is responsible for administering. There is no point in continuing a criss-cross argument; it is the Government's duty to go away and think again.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I emphasise that by saying that there have been all manner of disputes about facts. Frankly, I have my own clear view of where the facts actually lie. The Minister made one very crucial statement when she said that the Government intend in the Bill to try to bring the law into line with pre-existing law under the 1986 Act, as amended. All I ask is that the Minister be prepared to say that she will consider the subject and return on Report with a view to ensuring that that be accomplished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister has my sympathy. It seems that the Government draftsmen produced the amendments at rather short notice, and she probably had as little time as we did in which to focus on them. There is nothing personal in the issues that we raise. I echo the comments of my hon. Friends; we think that the matter needs considerably more cold towelling and we do not seek to make the FSA ineffective. However, for the reasons set out largely by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire, we think that the Government draftsmen have got the amendments wrong.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I would not want to stop Opposition Members from putting cold towels around themselves, but I do not wish to join them.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I did not intend to speak in the debate, but we seem to be in a tremendous muddle about a matter of fact. We shall have many arguments about opinions and values in Committee, but it is sad when we cannot agree on basic facts.
<P>
My ears pricked up when the Minister said that she could not comment on the 1986 Act as reprinted in 1997. On reflection, she might not want to repeat that, as it is an important Act of Parliament that to some extent will be rolled forward or replaced by the Bill. She seemed to say that the powers and wording in many important respects were simply rolled forward from that Act, but my hon. Friends have assiduously checked the actual wording and have found examples when that is not the case. Having listened to the debate, I am certain that she is not acting in bad faith.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Perhaps I have a glimmer of light as to what has happened. The Minister read out a speaking note prepared for her to justify the wording of the existing Bill, not the amendments. She read out a justification of the phrase ``reasonable grounds'', which is the phrase in the Bill as presented to us before the amendments. ``Good reason'' is the phrase in the 1986 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That may be an explanation. I shall try to save time and be constructive by asking the Minister to write to us with clarification. We are at least owed that. We have not simply treated this as a matter of party political disputation; it is an important issue of fact. Such matters are important, because courts might pass judgment on the precise wording in due course. Certainly, the FSA will pay close attention to the precise wording. It is essential for the clause and following clauses to be right. Will the Minister, in a constructive spirit, agree to write to us with clarification whereby her officials can make a comparison between the existing law—I do not believe that it has been amended since the reprinting of the Act in 1997—and what is proposed in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I believe that the version of the Act that Opposition Members are using is—despite the fact that it was reprinted in 1997—that from 1986. I simply refer them to section 177 of the amended Act, which contains the words that I quoted.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister is giving way.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> As I understood it, section 177 is about insider dealing. Is the Minister saying that section 105 has been altered? She plucked out another section as justifying wording, but we are dealing with a section of enormous width. I do not hold a view about whether these stronger powers are appropriate in seeking to investigate insider dealing, which is a specific offence and exceptionally difficult to investigate. However, they are certainly not appropriate for this broad tranche of offences, when the effect of an investigation can be so damaging. It is not good enough to have one section dealing with perhaps the most obscure and difficult of all the City offences and then apply it to a whole tranche of City regulation. That is not a good answer,
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Section 105 relates to clause 137 and section 177 relates to clause 138. There is some confusion. Clause 138 is designed to look at cases when it is more difficult to know exactly what is about to be investigated. It covers not just insider dealing, but a number of other areas that are relevant to that sort of investigation under the terms that I mentioned earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Does the Minister think that the 1986 law, which has since been amended, should apply to insider dealing, using the phraseology that she has asked us to accept in her amendments, but that it should not apply to the other heavy duty responsibilities of the FSA, such as market manipulation, contravention of financial promotional rules and carrying on a regulated activity without authorisation, which are the other three big issues that are dealt with in the Bill? Have I understood her correctly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am still confused. I am glad that I have brought my version of the 1986 Act. Section 177 refers to insider dealing—specifically the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985—but there is no mention of that Act in clause 138. It refers to all sorts of other contraventions, including the Criminal Justice Act 1993. The two are not at all parallel. The Minister seems to be comparing apples and pears in order to get out of the dilemma. She was the one who referred us to section 105 of the 1986 Act. Is she now saying that section 177 should apply to clause 137, rather than clause 138? There is no mention of the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 in clause 138, which we are discussing now. What exactly is happening?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I do not think that we should pursue the matter further, but I want a commitment from the Minister on two things. Of course, if she wants to pursue the matter, I should be delighted, but I am sure that she would like to see an end to it, and I do not want to be unfair to her by pursuing it in greater and greater detail. Will she send us a letter quickly? We have had pledges of letters on a range of issues but none of us has received any.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> There is one today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Oh, it is probably waiting for me on the Board. May we have a quick response to this issue and, more specifically, a commitment from the Economic Secretary to reconsider whether her amendments will take the Bill way out of line with existing legislation? Will she give a commitment to bring it back into line with existing legislation, to reconsider the issue and to return to it on Report? If so, we can move forward quickly from this matter and on to other issues.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> On the question of apples and pears, the Opposition spent a long time at the beginning of the debate arguing that the expression in the amended form of clause 138—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if it appears to the Authority that there are circumstances suggesting''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
had no precedent in terms of regulatory activity that formed the basis of any previous provision. They argued that it represented a marked departure and would disturb the Leviathan—
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I should merely like to respond. I have had enough of giving way on this point, because I do not think that Opposition Members are listening to my replies.
<P>
Much of the debate earlier this afternoon and, to some extent, this morning, related to that argument. When I refer to, and Opposition Members finally seem to recognise, the fact that the expression has been applied to similar circumstances in two existing measures, they move on to another debate about the circumstances in which one of those sections applies.
<P>
I am saying not that we are applying section 177 of the 1986 Act in this case but merely that the expression has been drawn from contexts such as that section and section 432 of the Companies Act 1985. As I answer their points, Opposition Members simply move the argument on, and we are not making productive progress.
<P>
Nothing has been said to give me any reason at this juncture to write to Opposition Members. It might be different if they could give me something that gave me further pause for thought, but I have heard nothing this afternoon with which I do not feel that we have dealt adequately and which would warrant a letter to Opposition Members, much as I know they like to receive them.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have had a good debate on this important clause. However, we have repeated a great deal of what has been said, and unless hon. Members want to raise a different matter, I intend to proceed with our business. We have been round this course half a dozen times today.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> This is not a different point, but it is an important one. A Minister has a duty to be accurate and, especially, to be careful. I was sympathetic to the Economic Secretary in dealing with this difficult area when I last rose about 10 minutes ago, but I am not now, because she is not being accurate. She is sticking like a terrier to her piece of meat—
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> To the wrong bone.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Or to the wrong bone; I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The Economic Secretary is trying to rely on section 177 of the 1986 Act, which deals specifically with insider dealing. She has not answered the careful points that I and my hon. Friends have made. It is a question not of going round and round but of trying to debate sensibly and solicit answers from the Economic Secretary. We have received factual inaccuracies, which is not good enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I support my right hon. and learned Friend on this point. The Economic Secretary introduced the concept that the Bill will simply roll forward the powers conferred by the previous Act. When we debated our amendments today, we assessed them on their merits. We did not introduce the concept that they were different or more draconian than previous provisions. It was the Economic Secretary who relied on the argument that the clause simply incorporated previous wording. It was then discovered that the Minister—I am sure inadvertently—was slightly muddled about what sections in the earlier Act were being carried forward into the Bill. In a spirit of helpfulness, I suggested that she write to us to clarify the point, after further discussion, so that we could then move on. The Minister repeated her earlier points, without illuminating the debate in any way and falsely accused us of relying on the previous legislation when it was she who introduced that concept.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I abide by my earlier remark that we do not believe that there is bad faith in what the Minister said, but she has strayed near it by making allegations that are at variance with the truth. As the clause has not been clarified, we have no option but to vote against the Government amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I put the group of amendments to the vote, I advise members of the Committee that if amendment No. 529 is accepted, the Opposition amendments will fall because it changes the wording of that part of the clause. Also, because of the length of debate that we have already had, I do not intend to allow any stand part debate.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 540, in page 66, line 18, leave out `of the single market directives' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Community obligation'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 541 and 542.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The clause provides for a third investigation power: the FSA will be able to investigate matters on behalf of overseas regulators. The clause will also allow the FSA to request information or documents on behalf of overseas regulators.
<P>
The Secretary of State has powers under section 82 of the Companies Act 1989 to assist overseas authorities with investigations He or she will continue to have those powers, but the clause will provide new powers for the FSA to conduct investigations on behalf of overseas regulatory authorities. Giving the FSA that role will boost its ability to play a full part in international regulatory co-operation. In today's global capital markets, with multinational financial services providers and cross-border financial services provision, it is vital that regulators can co-operate effectively with one another.
<P>
The clause will allow the FSA to play the full part that we want it to play—which it must play—in bearing down on international crime and in ensuring that the global financial marketplace is properly policed. However, we have no intention of changing the FSA's primary concern, which should be the consumers and investors who use the services offered in the United Kingdom.
<P>
Subsection (4) refers to several factors, including whether providing assistance is in the wider public interest, that the FSA will be directed to take into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to exercise such powers. However, the clause makes it clear that the FSA, as the United Kingdom competent authority, must exercise those powers if it is obliged to do so under the European single market directives. That reflects the general obligation placed on competent authorities to collaborate under, for example, article 7.1 of the first banking directive and article 23.3 of the investment services directive. Under article 24.2 of that directive, they are specifically required to assist in ``on the spot verifications''. It is likely that similar obligations arise as a result of people exercising their treaty rights to establish themselves in, or supply services to, the United Kingdom. The amendments reflect that; they will broaden the references to comply with the directives to cover compliance with any such Community obligation to investigate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I can understand that the single market directive may be too narrow, but I am unsure about the new phrase ``Community obligation''. All that matters is that we should comply with our legal requirements under treaties with the rest of the EU. Does not the use of the phrase ``Community obligation'' imply something wider than a legal requirement? Could it not imply general agreement that does not have the force of law? I ask the Economic Secretary to clarify whether the phrase ``Community obligation'' refers to that which has the force of law.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I believe that that is what is meant. The phrase appears in the European Communities Act 1972. Any obligation will be limited to our EU legal requirements. The hon. Gentleman's fears are unfounded.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 541, in page 66, line 20, leave out `directive' and insert `obligation'.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 493, in page 67, line 23, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following:
<P>
Government amendment No. 543.
<P>
Amendment No. 494, in page 67, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) specify the grounds upon which the investigating authority considers that the conditions contained in subsection 137(1) or 138(1) (as the case may be) have been fulfilled.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 140 lays down the procedures for the conduct of investigations. The investigating authority—the FSA or the Secretary of State—must give written notice of the appointment of an investigator to the person who is the subject of the investigation. Under clause 143, no such notice is to be given in the case of offences listed in clause 341—misleading statements or practices, insider dealing and market abuse.
<P>
Although we understand that an investigator may want to conduct his investigation of such matters without the person under investigation being notified of the appointment, there is in principle little difference between the three types of conduct in cases where an authorised person has breached the rules, has carried on a regulated activity without authorisation or has committed one of the other offences listed in clause 138(2). In other words, there is little reason why notice of appointment of an investigator should not be given in all cases. The same argument applies to the notice of discretion referred to in clause 140(7), which is required to be given under clause 140(9). Amendment No. 493 seeks to achieve that.
<P>
Amendment No. 494 would add a new paragraph (c), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``specify the grounds upon which the investigating authority considers that the conditions contained in subsection 137(1) or 138(1) (as the case may be) have been fulfilled.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is intended to ensure that the person under investigation is made aware of the grounds upon which the investigating authority is relying, so that he can understand what is involved. Both amendments are concerned essentially with the just and reasonable treatment of individuals subject to investigation.
<P>
Government amendment No. 543 seems to do precisely the opposite, as it would enable the FSA to refrain from notifying the target of an investigation launched under clause 138(1) if it believed that giving notice would lead to the investigation being obstructed. We therefore oppose the Government amendment and support amendments Nos. 493 and 494.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As I explained earlier, the powers of investigators differ, depending on the circumstances that trigger their use. The more specific the grounds for launching an investigation, the wider the investigator's powers. However, the basic procedural rules are the same for all investigations under clause 137 and 138. They are set out in clause 140.
<P>
In general, the investigating authority—the FSA or the Secretary of State—is required to give written notice that an investigator has been appointed to the person who is to be subject to an investigation. The notice must state the provisions under which the appointment is being made and the reason for the appointment. However, as I explained in relation to clause 138, the requirement is not imposed for the contraventions listed in clause 138(2). It is an issue of practicality. Investigation into possible market irregularities is likely to be into market circumstances rather than the affairs or behaviour of a particular person. Equally, it is not practical to require the FSA to have a particular suspect before it launches an investigation into possible infringement of the general prohibition and other contraventions that are, by definition, going to be committed by someone in relation to whom the FSA does not have other information-gathering powers. That is why we cannot accept the Opposition's proposal to delete subsection (3), which would have the effect of requiring notification in these cases, however impractical.
<P>
We cannot accept amendment No. 494, which would require the notice issued to a person being investigated under clause 140 (2) to state the grounds on which the powers are exercisable. That goes too far. The clause already requires the notice to state the provision under which the investigation is launched and the reason for the investigation. If the investigation results in disciplinary or other proceedings, evidence will be disclosed. However, requiring that at the outset would be a significant and unwelcome departure.
<P>
Government amendment No. 543 enables the FSA to refrain from notifying the target of an investigation if it believes, as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, that giving notice would lead to the investigation being frustrated. That is clearly necessary. We built transparency into these mechanisms, but transparency must not be at the expense of effective investigation. The amendment does not let the FSA off the requirement to notify in the majority of cases, but provides it with essential discretion in those few cases where it is likely that notification could frustrate the object of the investigation.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members would agree that such discretion is needed if we are to prevent the notification requirements, which are generally worthwhile and desirable, from becoming a cheats' charter in the minority of difficult cases. I hope that my explanation of the intention behind our amendment meets the concerns of Opposition Members whom I invite to withdraw their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I started looking at this only last night, and my impression of amendment No. 543 is that it extends discretion to all offences. As I described a moment ago with respect to another provision, it is for heavy duty offences. It applies when activity is being carried out by someone who is not authorised to do so, or when someone contravenes financial promotion rules. Market insulation and insider dealing are also relevant.
<P>
Last night I tried to follow it through to first principles, and decided that the grounds for not notifying someone are reasonable only when the FSA has good reason to suppose that the person being investigated might try to frustrate the investigation by reaching for the shredder. As soon as the letter is received, it could be a case of ``Come on, boys, let's go to the basement and get at it''—getting rid of the evidence in the papers. The vast majority of City firms are unlikely to behave like that: it is, of course, a criminal offence. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire will correct me if I am wrong, but I discovered last night that it was a criminal offence under clause 147 (3), which imposes a stringent requirement not to frustrate an investigation. It struck me that that was enough, so I am surprised that the Government felt it necessary to table the amendment rather than move in the direction that we had proposed—that notice should be given in all cases, except those in which there is a clear risk of frustration by the relevant individual.
<P>
When I worked in the Treasury some years ago, I occasionally turned up on a Saturday morning to do some work—it is good for the soul. When the Treasury was quiet, a tremendous whirring noise could be heard in the basement. One day, I decided to investigate. I went down to the basement and found two men bundling mountains of paper into a powerful shredder. I wondered how carefully all that shredding had been authorised. If something had been shredded inadvertently, it would not have been an offence—shredding something is normally an offence only where there is intent to frustrate a subsequent investigation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): To shred with intent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That brings me to the notion of shredding with intent, as my hon. Friend put it. Will the Minister please have another go at clarifying why she feels that frustration will be such that the Government's stringent amendment is required, given that the provisions in clause 147 will be on the statute book and impose a criminal offence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On amendment No. 493, if no particular individual is targeted, it is clearly not possible or sensible to give notice to an individual. The issue would arise only when an individual was targeted. The Minister's argument is not valid. The essence of the debate is whether, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester said, the openness argument or the risk of frustration is stronger.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Chichester made the same point back to me that I had already made—that there is a minority of cases. I said that the amendment does not free the FSA from the requirement to notify in the vast majority of cases. However, there are cases, as the hon. Gentleman conceded, in which the provision is necessary. That is all that we are concerned about in the amendment, and I reiterate my request that he support it. I am glad that he found clause 147, although I had never lost it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are still not entirely happy for the FSA to be granted yet further powers, although there are arguments for them. However, we understand the argument, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following: Amendment No. 495, in page 67, line 33, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and if any proceedings are commended against any person in reliance on the report, the investigating authority shall provide a copy of the report to such person prior to the commencement of proceedings'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 545 and 546.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Amendments Nos. 544 and 545 would remove the reference to the FSA or the Secretary of State directing an investigator not to report. We can envisage no circumstances in which the power to direct would be exercised in that way. Indeed, it would be odd to launch an investigation and not require the investigators to report back. We do not want the power to be used in that way or the Bill to suggest that it might be.
<P>
On amendment No. 546, subsections (7) to (9) of clause 140 ensure that investigators who are appointed under the clauses before us are not entirely independent of the investigating authority that appointed them.
<P>
The investigating authority, either the FSA or Secretary of State, is given clear powers to direct the conduct and scope of the investigation it has launched.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (9) imposes a further requirement to notify the person under investigation of such directions; unless, of course, it is an investigation under clause 138(2), in which case it is not assumed that there is a particular person under investigation.
<P>
Amendment No. 546 clarifies the intention behind these direction and notification provisions. They are there to make clear that the investigators remain under the control of the investigating authority in respect of how they conduct the investigation, when and how they report and so on. The FSA may formally direct the investigators, even in respect of quite routine or detailed matters, concerning the way in which their report should be prepared, the form and frequency of progress reports and so on.
<P>
These provisions are not there to include the person under investigation in the management process. It is not the Government's intention that relatively routine instructions to the investigator should be notified to the person under investigation. That is not how any of the existing investigation powers work either.
<P>
If we leave the provisions as they stand, the power under subsection (7) will simply not be used for its intended purpose. The investigating authority will only issue directions for major changes in the scope or conduct of the investigation, rather than using the power to control its day-to-day conduct, and we do not want that.
<P>
The investigators must be fully accountable to the investigating authority for their conduct of the investigation. Our amendment therefore amends subsection (9) to narrow the requirement to notify only those changes to the scope or conduct of the investigation which the investigating authority considers that the person under investigation could be prejudiced by not being made aware of.
<P>
For instance, it might be right to notify the person under investigation of a change to the scope because they would not otherwise be able to assess whether a particular line of questioning was relevant to the purpose of the investigation or not. But a direction as to the matters to be included in a final report, or to supply an interim report on progress, or a direction to look for corroborating evidence of a particular kind, might not need to be automatically notified.
<P>
So to summarise, the amendment clarifies the intention behind the power to direct, which is to ensure that the investigating authority is fully in control of, and responsible for the conduct of an investigation on its behalf. The aim is not to involve the person under investigation in the detailed decisions as to the conduct of that investigation, but to notify where necessary to avoid any prejudice or detriment. The result is a practicable and workable regime, achieved without prejudicing the rights of those under investigation.
<P>
Turning to amendment No. 495, I can see the Opposition's reasoning in requiring a report prepared by investigators under this clause to be copied to the person investigated before the commencement of any proceedings arising out of the report. It is not completely clear what would count as the commencement of proceedings for those purposes, the commencement of internal disciplinary proceedings or the commencement of proceedings before the tribunal or criminal courts.
<P>
However, I must resist this amendment in any case. I have no problem with the proposition that a person must know what he is accused of. That is basic, and is recognised in the Bill in a number of ways. In disciplinary and market abuse cases, clause 338 requires the FSA to disclose the reasons for proposing the action in the warning notice it must give to the person concerned. Clause 338(5) also requires the FSA to make available the evidence on which it proposes to rely in any proceedings before the tribunal.
<P>
I should mention again at this point that we have been in discussion with the Law Society about how we should extend this disclosure requirement under clause 338(5). We intend to bring forward amendments to align the requirement with the normal rules on disclosure that apply in criminal cases. That will involve an additional requirement for the FSA to give the person access to evidence on which it does not propose to rely, but which it considers could materially undermine its own case. It will also involve a tribunal rule requiring the FSA, once it has a statement of the other party's case, to disclose any further evidence which it has, but has not already disclosed, and which it considers could reasonably be said to assist that case.
<P>
Criminal cases will of course be subject to the usual rules in any case. In many cases those requirements, taken together, would in effect involve the disclosure of the contents of most, if not all, of any report prepared by an investigator. However, the Opposition amendment would require the disclosure of the full report, regardless of its contents and the use to which it might be put. That might include material not relevant to the case being brought, including information that was sensitive for other reasons. Such information, for example, might reveal the source of a tip-off in a company under investigation.
<P>
That would go too far. We are providing for a lot of transparency in the process, but there are limits to what is sensible or appropriate. Automatic disclosure of the full contents of an investigator's report would go too far in tipping the balance in favour of the investigated and against the investigating authorities.
<P>
On the basis of the disclosure rules that I have described and my concerns about the amendment, I trust that Opposition Members will not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Government amendments Nos. 544, 545 and 546 are somewhat convoluted, but, in the main, acceptable. However, we do not accept all the Government's arguments against amendment No. 495. It would be wrong for confidential matters relating to informers to be made available—we accept that. However, that is clearly not our intention, which relates to the nature of the report written prior to the commencement of proceeding against an individual. Our amendment would require the investigating authority making a report of its investigation to supply a copy to the person against whom proceedings have commenced.
<P>
To achieve that objective, our amendment may need to be altered to exclude anything that is confidential. We wish to enable the individual who is to be prosecuted to have access to the allegations and evidence against him. That is not an unreasonable request. Should the Minister persuade me—as she has not done so far—that that is already provided for, the amendment would become redundant. The process of allegation, prosecution and defence surely requires that the person defending himself should have full details of allegations and evidence against him, so that he may refute them if he has cause so to do.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall attempt to reassure the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Clause 140, together with clause 338, will involve the disclosure of most, if not all, the contents of any report prepared by the investigator. The only provision that we wish to make excludes those circumstances in which—as the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged—revealing the complete report would damage other interests which the regulator must be aware of and protect. We are anxious about that and would therefore be worried about accepting the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If I understand the Minister correctly, clauses 140 and 338 will cause to be made available, before the commencement of proceedings, information other than that which both sides agree should be made available. If that is so, I am happy not to press our amendment.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I wish to speak briefly about clause 140 and to raise a couple of points that have not been referred to, but which could, quite logically, have been raised by tabling certain amendments. We have been discussing circumstances in which an investigation takes place and when, except in certain special circumstances, those concerned were told about it. We have been debating what those special circumstances should be and the extent to which there should be waivers from the duty to disclose.
<P>
Let us consider circumstances in which an investigation is launched, probably quite a lot of work having been done by the FSA, but when no notification was made and when, at the end of the investigation, it was decided not to do anything. A large amount of material about a firm may have been collected and huge discussion about it may have taken place, yet the material may still be lying around within the FSA. Does the Minister agree that there is a case for a general duty to be placed on the FSA to explain to those concerned that an investigation had taken place, even when there was no move from the investigation to prosecution?
<P>
I am not a criminal lawyer, but I am sure that such action is not general criminal law practice. There are some good arguments for such a procedure in such circumstances, the main one being that it would act as a good discipline and check on the FSA not to have enormous quantities of semi-incriminating or rumour-based material lying around without action being taken on it and without any opportunity for the individual or firm concerned to respond to it and say, ``Hey, you have such information on your files, but you have the wrong end of the stick. I can explain such matters very simply and here are the documents to show that nothing needs to concern you.'' Such action would also reassure such firms that their names were not being blackened or that they were on the wrong side of particular FSA staff without their ever finding out that investigations had taken place.
<P>
When talking to the industry, I have on several occasions come across firms that feel victimised. Sometimes, they have never been investigated thoroughly; sometimes, they have, but have reached a settlement. In many cases, however, firms may think that someone in the FSA is out to get them. There is an atmosphere among some investigators in the FSA of ``We must get someone'', which is not all together healthy. I am not suggesting that it is pervasive throughout the FSA, but that such am atmosphere can develop in certain cases, particularly when an American-style, Chicago-style investigative manner is generated by some of its recent recruits.
<P>
The Minister seems surprised. She has a critical look on her face, but I can introduce her to very senior chief executives of major firms in the City who have had extraordinary encounters with one or two of the senior investigative officers of the FSA, who have behaved in such a manner and who—to use colloquial language—tried to put the frighteners on a firm. I want to move towards a situation where there is some countervailing force or duty on the FSA not to act unreasonably by providing reassurance to firms that enormous amounts of information about them—about which they will never have knowledge—are not being collected. I should be grateful for the Minister's response.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am somewhat surprised by the hon. Gentleman's suggestion because I thought that the force of an earlier argument used by Opposition Members was the potential damage that the mere knowledge of an investigation could do to a financial services company. We are aware that the FSA will have to consider that aspect carefully when carrying out investigations. Were investigations sometimes to lead nowhere in circumstances sketched out for us by the hon. Gentleman, I am not sure that it would help the financial services industry and relevant companies if that came known. I am somewhat sceptical about the value of the hon. Gentleman's idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I do not wish to labour the point by saying that a general notification should be made to the market; I was suggesting that some notification to the firm in question might be appropriate. I shall speak for a short while longer if it helps the hon. Lady to catch up on some reading material. I merely suggest that a firm or individual undergoing investigation without knowledge of it could perhaps be made aware of it afterwards and, where appropriate, be told what led to it, to provide an opportunity to respond even though a prosecution did not result.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> May I clarify the hon. Gentleman's point? I understood him to refer to circumstances in which someone might, for good reason, not be told at the outset that an investigation was under way­it could be a reason that we discussed earlier. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It is clear to me that with insider dealing, for example, it would be inadvisable in certain circumstances to supply information at the start of an investigation. The sort of circumstance I have in mind is where an investigation has proceeded but eventually the FSA decides after all that it does not have sufficient evidence, or is confident that there was no insider dealing. The fact that there had been an investigation, together with information about the authority's reasons for its activity behind the scenes without the knowledge of whoever was being investigated, should be made available to the individual in question, giving him both the knowledge of it and the opportunity to respond to any allegations. My reason for suggesting this procedure is that it would give firms confidence that there were no accumulating huge files on them, as well as acting as a check or discipline on the authority to prevent it from collecting such information.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says. I undertake to think further about it. However, I do think that there are dangers in the course that he advocates, even though I accept that such notification would go to the individual, or the company in certain circumstances, rather than be in the form of a public notice. Nevertheless, we all know that information going into one arena can sometimes become more widely public through no fault of the regulator, and I merely question whether this is the right course, although I accept the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister write to me?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 547, in page 68, line 17, leave out `for the purposes of the investigation'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:—
<P>
Government amendment No. 548, in page 68, line 20, leave out from `description' to end of line 21. 
<P>
Amendment No. 496, in page 68, line 25, at end insert `and has explained to the investigating authority why it is relevant'.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall be brief. Both amendments are drafting improvements which remove the current overlap between subsections (1)(b) and (2), and subsection (3). Subsection (1)(b) states that any information that the investigator may require should be required for the purposes of the investigation. Subsection (2) requires that documents requested must relate to any matter relevant to the investigation. Subsection (3), which applies to subsections (1) and (2), stipulates that the information and documents required under those subsections must be relevant to the purposes of the investigation. Only subsection (3) is necessary. The amendments would omit the duplication in the other two subsections.
<P>
Amendment No. 496 would require the investigator to explain to the investigating authority his reasons for considering each such requirement relevant to the investigation's purposes. It is right, as with the previous clause, that the investigating authority should retain control over the investigation, but that is taking control too far. It would be very unwieldy—and in some cases completely impractical—if, in a complicated investigation, the investigators had to refer every question or request for documents to the FSA or the Secretary of State beforehand.
<P>
Nevertheless, I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is right that the investigating authority is responsible for the conduct of the investigators. To the extent that the FSA or the Secretary of State consider it necessary, they will be able to issue directions as to how the investigators should conduct themselves. If necessary, that could include a direction along the lines of the amendment. For the reasons I have given, however, I do not think that it would be a desirable way of proceeding in most cases. We therefore cannot accept the amendment.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We agree with the Minister that Government amendments Nos. 547 and 548 are essentially drafting amendments that remove an existing overlap. Amendment No. 496 has been designed to give power to the intention of the clause—that the investigation authority should have control over the investigator.
<P>
We largely accept the points made by the Minister. Throughout the investigation process, the investigator should make the investigating authority aware of why the path down which it is going and the type of material it wants is relevant to the investigation. The investigating authority can thereby be kept on top of matters. We are happy to withdraw the amendment, on the basis of the Government's point that those powers may be used. We did not want a clause that provided for something but did not give the tools to achieve it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to. 
<P>
Amendment made: No. 548, in page 68, line 20, leave out from `description' to end of line 21. [Miss Melanie Johnson.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have only one query about the clause: subsection (3).
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> A big one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I do not know if it is a big one; we will find out.
<P>
Subsection (3) inserts our old friend, a test of reasonableness—while it has been rigorously and ruthlessly excised from everywhere else in the Bill. As I have said on several occasions, when we tried to add that test to the Bill early in the proceedings, it was savagely voted down. Where the draftsmen, who had a crumb of comfort for the poor chaps being regulated, decided that some judicial review might be reasonable, they left it in, in clause 138—the Government have now taken it out—but here we have it again, without any Government amendment to remove it. I realise that it is dangerous to alert the Government to that, because they will no doubt return to it on Report, whereas otherwise they might have missed it. However, it is a thoroughly reasonable clause, with which I can agree. It is right that demands for the provision of information or the production of a document when relevant to the purposes of the investigation should be subject to judicial review and that a test of reasonableness should be—and has been—added.
<P>
In the explanatory notes, which were republished and corrected as recently as 18 November, and which are very short, clause 141 is, I am pleased to say, considered sufficiently important to account for nine lines. The notes on clause 138 are significantly longer, accounting for 25 lines, as it is quite an important clause. However, the point appears in the notes to clause 141:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The investigators may only impose these requirements where they reasonably consider''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the authors of the explanatory notes consider it sufficiently important that the test of reasonableness should be referred to even in a very short summary paragraph.
<P>
I shall not allude at length—or indeed, scarcely at all—to the debate that we have already had, but in the explanatory notes to clause 138, the point appears again:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where there is `good reason' to do so . . . where they have reasonable grounds''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point is therefore referred to twice in a comparatively short summary of clause 138.
<P>
I shall not reopen the debate on clause 138, but I should like the Economic Secretary to explain why this curious little corner of the Bill should be subject to an objective reasonableness test—the test of the man on the Clapham omnibus of what is reasonable—whereas in every other provision in the Bill we are left only with the Wednesbury principle to protect people who might be investigated.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgement that people are protected under other provisions in the Bill, because I thought that he was claiming earlier that people were not protected, contrary to what the Government and I have been saying. I am glad to learn that, and I am glad that he has found the reference in the Bill. It is indeed there, I am not discomfited by its presence, and I have nothing to add. I am delighted that it and the revised explanatory notes have given him so much pleasure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I shall repeat my question. Why should the test of reasonableness be written into clause 141 but excluded from other clauses, and, indeed, removed from other clauses in which it was previously specified? That is my first question, but, as the Economic Secretary has given me an opportunity to ask two, why, if the Government intended to remove the test of reasonableness, were several explicit references to it retained in a redraft of the explanatory notes produced as recently as 18 November?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his questions. I said that I would answer one of them, and I shall undertake, as I have already undertaken to write to him on an earlier point, to answer at least the first of them. I may even answer both of them in writing to him, along with the earlier point that he raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Another letter.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No, it will be one letter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 497, in page 69, line 2, leave out `expedient' and insert `desirable'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 498, in page 69, line 3, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and provides the person in question with a written notice of the requirement together with the reason or reasons why he considers that the condition in this subsection is fulfilled'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We now move on to the additional powers of people appointed as a result of clause 138. I do not think that the reasonableness bug appears in the clause; it certainly does not appear in the amendment.
<P>
Clause 142 requires a person not subject to an investigation or not connected to someone under investigation to attend for questioning or to provide special documentation. The document must be necessary or expedient for the purposes of the investigation. We are worried that no guidance is given on what may be deemed necessary or expedient. It seems that the subjective opinion of the investigator will determine the matter.
<P>
There is also doubt about publications. The broad phrasing of the clause means that newspapers that publish the advertising of an authorised person or that publish articles about the business of an authorised person may be caught. No consideration seems to have been given to the distinctive nature of journalistic material or of material held in confidence. That has implications for a free and effective press, because it can be construed as being in the public interest that a journalist should be able to protect his or her sources.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 497. We believe that the word ``expedient'' would allow the investigator to fish for information and documents—again, we return to fishing. We believe that it is important in such cases to restrict or limit those powers to matters that are necessary or desirable for the purposes of the investigation and not merely expedient; hence our wish to replace the word ``expedient'' with ``desirable''.
<P>
Amendment No. 498 would add to subsection (3) the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provides the person in question with a written notice of requirement together with the reason or reasons why he considers that the conditions in this subsection is fulfilled.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We believe that that is consistent with some of the assurances that the Minister was at pains to give earlier. Surely, a person is entitled to know why he or she has been called upon to answer questions or provide information or documents. The amendment would also protect unconnected third parties by requiring the investigator to explain why he considers that the requirement—that it is necessary or desirable for the purposes of the investigation—has been satisfied.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Clauses 142 and 143 are about the powers of an investigator appointed under clause 138 to carry out an investigation into a suspected contravention additional to those of an investigator appointed to carry out a general investigation under clause 137. Clause 142 is about the powers of investigators carrying out specific investigations into the contraventions listed under clause 138(1). Clause 143 provides additional powers for investigators appointed under clause 138(2).
<P>
Clause 142 provides that an investigator appointed to conduct an investigation under clause 138(1) will have the same powers as a person appointed to carry out a general investigation, except that he will not be so limited in who can be asked to attend the investigation and to answer questions. For those investigations, any person can be questioned, not only those who are connected. However, to impose that requirement on an unconnected person, the investigator must be satisfied that the requirement is necessary or expedient for the purposes of the investigation. I shall speak about expediency in a moment.
<P>
The amendments would do two things. First, as the hon. Gentleman said, amendment No. 497 would replace the second leg of the ``necessary or expedient'' test with a desirability test. He made clear the point of the amendment, but it may be a lower test on which the investigator would have to be satisfied before he required an unconnected person to answer questions. It rather depends upon whose interests are to be considered. If it is desirable for the investigator's own interests, it would seem to be an easier test than the one included in the Bill. By including the words ``or expedient'', we were ensuring that that option could be used where it was not be absolutely necessary to obtain the information, but where the alternatives might be unduly cumbersome or problematic. That is entirely reasonable. We want the investigator to be able to operate efficiently and effectively. We do not expect investigators to require unconnected persons to attend interviews and answer questions in the normal course of investigations. However, we want that option to be available where it is the sensible, expedient way to proceed.
<P>
Amendment No. 498 would require the investigator to provide the person who was subject to the requirement with a written notice and with the reasons why he considered such action necessary or expedient or, if amendment No. 498 were accepted, desirable. That is unnecessary. In practice, such requirements will be imposed by an appropriate notice. The person concerned will be able to ask the investigator to justify the exercise of the power. However, we do not see the need to require the investigator to explain why the requirement is necessary or expedient.
<P>
The terms ``if necessary'' and ``expedient'' will have the meanings commonly used in the statute book—that is the point that the hon. Gentleman was questioning. For the purposes of the investigation, the term ``expedient'' does not allow for fishing. There must be a link between the requirement and the purposes of the investigation. The word ``expedient'' is there for the purposes that I explained.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for that, but I cannot agree that the amendment would lower the test; that was certainly not our intention. The Minister tried to justify keeping the word ``expedient'', but I am not convinced that we should do so because it might be slightly more cumbersome for other justification processes to come into being. That was a rather weak response.
<P>
On the protection of journalists' sources, there is a case for justifying requiring a journalist to give up information about his or her sources without a proper explanation from the investigator as to why he was after the information. We know the problems that that can pose with journalists who guard their sources jealously to maintain their professional integrity and produce stories. If the investigator does not even have to justify his reason for requiring information, journalists in particular will be left in a difficult position. Perhaps the Minister can take up that point specifically, because she did not deal with it in her explanation.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Journalists' sources are not protected in other circumstances, and the question is why they should be in this case—there is no difference. Their treatment should be no different in this situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I cannot say that I am happy, but in the circumstances—our numbers are dwindling slightly—I shall not force the matter to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 549, in page 69, line 8, after second `is' insert `or may be'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 499, page 69, line 18, after `all', insert `reasonable'.
<P>
No. 500, in page 69, line 22, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) The investigator shall, in exercising the powers conferred on him by this section, give notice to A which specifies why he considers that the information document or assistance in question is or may be relevant to his investigation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As drafted, subsection (1) appears to require the investigator to know in advance that the information that the person can give will definitely be relevant to the investigation. That is clearly impractical. One cannot determine exactly the relevance of information that one does not have. If an investigator knew exactly what information A had, he would hardly need to request it in the first place. The investigator must consider that the person is able, or may be able, to supply information that is, or may be, relevant. Therefore, the Government amendment will enable the investigator to request information that he considers may be relevant even though he cannot be 100 per cent. sure that it will be, for the reasons that I have given.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 499 and 500 are unnecessary. Subsection (3) clearly states that the investigator may otherwise require person A to give him all assistance in connection with the investigation that A is reasonably able to give. I am unsure what purpose would be served by inserting the word ``reasonable'' before the word ``assistance''.
<P>
Under amendment No. 500, the investigator would be required to give notice to person A of the requirement being imposed, stating why he considers that the ``information, document or assistance'' may be relevant. Again, it will clearly be possible for a person to challenge the basis on which a requirement is imposed. Person A could ask why the investigator considers that he may be able to supply information that may be relevant. However, it does not seem practical to require the investigator to explain why he considers the information or documents that he does not yet have may be relevant. The requirement for assistance is that it can reasonably be given, not that it is relevant, whatever that means.
<P>
If the intention behind the amendments is to obtain an assurance from the Government that investigators must act reasonably in fulfilling their statutory functions and responsibly in exercising those powers and that those subject to them should be made aware of their rights, let me give that assurance. We are committed to giving the FSA effective powers to combat financial crime, protect consumers and maintain market confidence, but those functions must be carried out reasonably and fairly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We shall not take issue with the Government amendment. However, the Economic Secretary referred to amendments Nos. 499 and 500, so I shall give our reasoning for them. Clause 143 relates to investigations under clause 138 into misleading statements and practices, such as insider dealing and market abuse. Amendment No. 499 would qualify the requirement that any person required by the investigator to answer questions or provide information must give all assistance. We decided to revisit our old friend reasonableness. Under amendment No. 499, we would add the word ``reasonable'', so that the requirement would be to provide all reasonable assistance. We believe that that qualification is necessary, even though subsection (4) refers to assistance
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which A is reasonably able to give.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under amendment No. 500, the investigator would be required to inform person A why he considers that the information, documents or assistance is relevant to the investigation. Although the Economic Secretary disagrees, we believe that that is a necessary safeguard, because people need to know why they are being asked to answer questions and provide information. She said that it was not practical to require the investigator to justify why those documents and statements should be produced, but that is not good enough. Why is it not practical? Can she give specific reasons why acting reasonably would prejudice the investigator's work, as he could still carry out his function properly? That is the rationale for amendments Nos. 499 and 500. Perhaps the Economic Secretary could give us more detail and tell us in her own words why she thinks they are not practical.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The answer to the hon. Gentleman's second question is that eventually the Socratic paradox of knowledge comes into play—one cannot ask for what one does not know. In this case, the investigator needs information and needs to see something in it that he is presently unaware of—otherwise he would not be asking for the information in the first place.
<P>
Let me return to the hon. Gentleman's other point. In subsection (4), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the investigation which A is reasonably able to give'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I fail to understand what is added by the term ``reasonable'' in that context. What sort of assistance could A reasonably give which would nevertheless not be reasonable? I simply do not understand the need for the additional word.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I still take issue with the Minister. She referred to the paradox of knowledge—that one cannot ask for something that the investigator does not know. However, there must be a basis for suspicion about what wrongdoing has been committed: it is not necessary to know the entire story. It is perfectly legitimate for the investigator to provide the basis for his suspicion, without detailing every last point that might or might not amount to an infringement of the regulations.
<P>
When the police want to raid or search a house or if they stop and search someone in the street, they have to provide the reason why a warrant was issued by a magistrate and explain why it is right for an individual to be searched. We are asking for no more and no less than that with our amendments. There should be a basis for an investigator's right to demand information, without having to lay out the entire stall as to the end-result of the investigation. In that light, the addition of the word ``reasonable'' is perfectly acceptable. It accentuates the protections in the clause in the interests of the investigator being able to carry out a proper investigation. The subject of the investigation and the people helping with it should find it reasonable and thus want to co-operate. Surely that works in the interest of a worthwhile and thorough investigation. I therefore want to press amendment No. 499—I shall not take issue with the Government amendment—to a vote and urge my hon. Friends to vote in favour of it.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 150, in page 69, line 28, at end insert `or under section 177'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 551.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The clause is intended to provide for the so-called Saunders-proofing of the Bill, in respect of both criminal proceedings and the imposition of civil penalties for market abuse. That is necessary to ensure that the Bill complies with the European convention on human rights.
<P>
As I am sure that all hon. Members know, Ernest Saunders was convicted of criminal offences arising from the takeover of United Distillers by Guinness, partly on the basis of answers that he had been compelled to provide to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors investigating the takeover. The European Court of Human Rights held that that amounted to a violation of his right to a fair trial under article 6 of the European convention.
<P>
Although there is no barrier to the creation of statutory powers such as those to compel people to answer questions in clause 141, such evidence cannot, as a result of that judgment, generally be used in subsequent criminal proceedings against the person concerned.
<P>
That general rule does not apply, however, when the person under investigation is responsible for introducing his compelled statements as evidence, or when he is prosecuted for giving false evidence in his original compelled statement—in other words, if he has lied to the investigators.
<P>
The clause therefore prohibits the use of compelled answers gathered by investigators appointed under this part of Bill in any subsequent criminal prosecution of the person from whom they were obtained, apart from in the exceptional circumstances that I have mentioned. However, the clause would not prevent the evidence from being used in the prosecution of another person, if it were relevant.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 550 and 551 do not change the substance of the clause, but are instead intended to make absolutely clear what it covers.
<P>
Government amendment No. 550 makes it clear that statements made to investigators can be used in legal proceedings only if the proper procedures applying to the admissibility of evidence in such situations have been followed.
<P>
Government amendment No. 551 is intended to make it clear that the clause covers not only statements made to investigators appointed by the FSA, but statements made directly to the FSA.
<P>
The Opposition amendment seeks to extend Saunders-proofing to situations in which the FSA imposes a disciplinary penalty on an authorised person. I cannot accept that as I consider it to be both unnecessary and undesirable.
<P>
It is unnecessary because I do not believe that the courts would be likely to consider that proceedings leading to the imposition of a financial penalty under clause 177 amounted to criminal proceedings for ECHR purposes. Therefore, we do not need to extend the protection to such proceedings to make sure that we fully comply with the Saunders judgment.
<P>
The reasons for that conclusion were set out in some detail by the Minister for Small Business and E-„Commerce, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) and the Government's legal advisers, Sir Sydney Kentridge QC and James Eadie, in evidence to the Joint Committee. I do not intend or see the need to go over that ground again today.
<P>
The amendment is also undesirable because it would place an unhelpful limitation on the FSA's ability to deal with misconduct by regulated persons. Criminal offences or market abuse may be committed by a wide range of people, but civil penalties under clause 177 apply only to authorised persons.
<P>
Authorisation is not solely a privilege that allows a person to carry out financial services business; it also involves obligations, one of the most important of which is the obligation to be frank with the FSA about how an authorised person's business has been conducted, including in cases involving misconduct.
<P>
It would be quite mistaken to allow authorised persons who have committed serious misconduct, which would justify a financial penalty, to escape the consequences simply because the evidence took the form of a statement that they had made to investigators.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We have no quarrel with the Government amendments. Indeed, their subject matter was covered extensively during the proceedings of the Burns Committee. Its members were pleased at the Government's response, which included the Saunders-proofing amendments and other safeguards, such as developments with legal aid and other matters that we have discussed.
<P>
Given that the Government are happy that the provision complies with the ECHR, on which we shall have to accept the advice of their lawyers, and given the contentious issue discussed many times by the Burns Committee, including the submissions by Sir Sydney Kentridge and Mr Eadie which, even so, were open to some conflict with those submissions by Hobhouse and Lester and other legal counsels, we are happy to accept the amendments on the basis that the Government have done their homework.
<P>
We shall not press our amendment to a Division. It was tabled to put down a marker. We want to bring the provisions under clause 177 within the protection of clause 144, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no evidence relating to the statement may be adduced, and . . . no question relating to it may be asked . . . unless evidence relating to it is adduced, or a question relating to it is asked, in the proceedings''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Confusion may ensue at this point, which I wish to allay. Clause 177 of the new Bill refers to financial penalties. It has nothing to do with section 177 of the 1986 Act—as reprinted in 1997 and over which we pored extensively before our short dinner break—which is concerned with investigation into insider dealings. Section 177 is one of the quirky coincidences that have come back to haunt us.
<P>
Clause 177 is concerned purely with financial penalties and its provisions should be covered under clause 144 to provide an extra safeguard. However, given the Minister's forceful comments that such a provision is not necessary, and given the late hour, we shall not press the amendment to a Division and I beg to ask leave to withdraw it.

Government amendments: Nos. 552 and 553.
<P>
Amendment: No. 504, in page 70, line 28, leave out `the investigating authority' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a senior officer or official of the investigating authority who is not directly involved in the investigation'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie: We have tabled six amendments to this clause, four of which are not very long. However, two are of some importance and the Minister should consider them carefully.</B><P>
<P>
Under clause 145(6), no one should be required under Part X to produce or disclose a privileged communication. A description of such a communication is outlined in clause 360. It is a communication between a legal adviser and his client, and will be protected from disclosure in High Court proceedings on grounds of legal professional privilege.
<P>
Amendment No. 502 deals with privileged communications that come into the possession of the FSA by some other means—voluntarily, for example.
<P>
The amendment provides that that privileged communication would not lose its privilege in those circumstances, unless the person entitled to the privilege waived it in writing. Amendment No. 430 covers much of the same ground, so I will not repeat the arguments for it. Both amendments deal with a similar point: the issue of documents obtained voluntarily that have the status of privilege.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The effect of accepting the amendments would be that privilege would not be retained by virtue of the FSA having called it. It could pertain to a document that was voluntarily supplied. We would be happy for either of the amendments to be accepted and we would also be prepared to accept an assurance from the Minister that she will add a similar provision on Report. I shall be interested to hear her response. The current situation of voluntarily supplied documents not being covered clearly cannot continue.
<P>
Amendment No. 429 is a tidying amendment, which simply adds ``or document'' after ``communication''. We have taken advice from lawyers and, as a result, have some real lawyers' amendments. Amendment No. 503 is a classic example. It deals with subsection (6), which contains a specific provision intended to protect a person carrying on banking taking into account the duty of confidentiality owed by a bank to its customer. The amendment would extend that protection to others including—guess who?—lawyers and other persons acting as agents who owe a duty of confidentiality as a result of acting in a fiduciary capacity. That is a fairly straightforward and uncontentious amendment.
<P>
Clause 145(6)(d) provides an exception to the general protection provided by clause 156(6). The exception applies when a requirement to supply information or documents has been specifically authorised by the investigating authority. Amendment No. 504 would require the demand to be given by a senior officer who is not directly involved in the investigation. That is another straightforward and sensible amendment. 
<P>
Likewise, amendment No. 505 is a tidying amendment. It inserts ``at any relevant time'' in line 33. It mirrors qualifications on relevant time similar to those that appear in other clauses such as clause 137(2) and clause 141(4).
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I will endeavour to shorten my comments. There are a number of amendments and it is sometimes difficult to disentangle the way in which they interplay.
<P>
The amendments on legal professional privilege and banking confidentiality cover two interesting topics that are brought together. The amendments on legal professional privilege bring us back to a topic that we discussed in July in the context of part I. The Minister of State, Home Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), reassured the Committee that there was no disagreement between the Government and Opposition on general policy and that we do not want to undermine privilege.
<P>
In that debate, my hon. Friend explained that we were aware of concerns expressed by the British Bankers Association and others about the voluntary disclosure of privileged documents. Amendment No. 430 seeks to address those concerns. My hon. Friend said that we would discuss the matter further with the interested parties. Hon. Members will be pleased to hear that I can tell the Committee about further consideration of those topics. However, I should first like to say a few words about amendment No. 429, which seeks to clarify the fact that documents are included in privileged documents.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary and could cast doubt on the meaning of communication elsewhere in the Bill. The term is not limited and includes written and oral communications. Of course, the phrase ``privileged communications'' is expressly defined in clause 360, the terms of which cover documents. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
However, I am grateful to Opposition Members for tabling the amendment, as it has brought to our attention a possible need to amend the definition of privileged communication in clause 360. We are concerned that that definition may be drawn more narrowly than the general meaning of legal professional privilege in the criminal and civil courts. The possible discrepancy arises from the fact that clause 360 refers to the privilege regime for the High Court, and adds subsections (1)(a) and (b), which may be deemed to place additional limitations on the scope of privilege when compared with the civil High Court regime or the criminal regime under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
<P>
We are especially concerned that the additional wording may be regarded as preventing privilege from being claimed for certain items enclosed with legally privileged material, when such items would be protected on grounds of legal professional privilege in the ordinary criminal or civil regimes. We—and, I think, the Opposition—do not want such a discrepancy. We shall consider the matter further and, if necessary, table amendments to clarify or improve the definition in clause 360.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 430. We have listened to concerns that a document to which legal professional privilege attaches might lose that status if it is disclosed voluntarily to the regulator. Similarly, there is concern that a confidential document could lose its confidentiality.
<P>
Our legal advice is clear. It is possible to waive privilege in respect of one party—in this case, the FSA or the investigator—without waiving it more generally. In other words, as long as the basis of disclosure is made clear, the usual protections for privilege under general law will still apply.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Does that mean that, as drafted, the Bill will give full protection to voluntarily supplied documents?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That is tremendous. It means that we need only have an exchange at a later date to clarify whether any changes may be required on Report to reduce the current lack of clarity in the regulated community.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hope that our proceedings will be followed with interest by people outside, and our exchanges may help to clarify matters.
<P>
It would not be possible to subpoena a document in civil proceedings, either from an authorised person to whom it belongs or the FSA. I do not expect Opposition Members to dissent from that. Indeed, in an earlier debate, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire referred to the fact that one can waive privilege in a limited form.
<P>
Our discussions with the British Bankers Association and others make it clear that they do not disagree on that point. Their outstanding concern is practical rather than legal. They are anxious that in day-to-day business it may be difficult to ensure that employees showing a document to the FSA always make the basis of disclosure sufficiently clear, so that if it does contain privileged information they are not waiving that privilege more widely.
<P>
We sympathise with that, and want to do everything that we can to encourage a free and open exchange between the regulator and the regulated. We are not inclined to rush to rush to solve a potential practical problem with a legislative solution, such as that suggested in amendment No. 430. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green explained, such an amendment could have an adverse impact elsewhere. Numerous other public authorities may be shown privileged documents in a variety of contexts, and the inclusion of an explicit protection could cast doubt on whether privilege is in fact protected in all those other cases. That would be most unfortunate. We have therefore put the ball in a number of other courts, including that of the BBA, in order to explore practical solutions. We shall return to the matter at a future date.
<P>
The amendment also seeks to protect confidentiality. Again, we do not see the need for this additional protection. Clause 305 already sets out detailed provisions restricting the disclosure of confidential information.
<P>
Generally speaking, the recipient of confidential information would not be able to pass that information on to a third party without the consent of the person who disclosed it and, if different, the person to whom the information relates.
<P>
There will of course be some gateways that are provided for under clause 306 and which will be in line with what is permitted under European directives.
<P>
Any confidential information given to the FSA, or the investigating authority, will be treated as confidential information for the purposes of clause 305. The amendment seeks to introduce a presumption that information handed over is always for the purposes of the performance of the duties of the recipient under this part.
<P>
We believe that this is not only unnecessary, but could be dangerous—we have also discussed this matter with the BBA and others.
<P>
Providing for a presumption, as this amendment seeks to do, would provide a legal mechanism, whereby an unscrupulous person could deliberately hand over any document, regardless of whether it was not in fact for the purposes of assisting the regulator in the discharge of its functions. By so doing, it would ensure that the document was protected by the confidentiality regime in part XXII.
<P>
I assume that this is not the effect that Opposition Members intended. It is certainly not one that we could countenance.
<P>
As I have said, any confidential document which is legitimately disclosed to assist the regulator to perform its duties will be covered by the confidentiality regime.
<P>
There is another unfortunate provision in this amendment to which I draw the Committee's attention.
<P>
If members of the Committee cast an eye over the proposed paragraph (g), which relates to disclosure to overseas regulators, they will see that Opposition Members are suggesting that the FSA should be able to hand over confidential or privileged documents only in response to an unsolicited request for them. That is totally at odds with the aim of encouraging and facilitating international regulatory co-operation to police increasingly global financial markets.
<P>
Of course, there is no problem with overseas regulators making unsolicited requests for a particular document or piece of information that they have identified in relation to an investigation that they are undertaking. However, they cannot make unsolicited requests for information or documents which they do not even know exist.
<P>
What would happen if the FSA came across a document during an investigation under part X which it thinks should be brought to the attention of, for example, the SEC?
<P>
Under the amendment proposed, the answer is nothing. The FSA would be prevented from passing it on and the SEC would never know anything about it.
<P>
I am sure that hon. Members opposite would agree that this is not the sort of situation that we would wish to legislate for.
<P>
I would urge hon. Members opposite to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I now turn to banking confidentiality. The issue raised by this group of amendments is the additional protection that clause 145(6) gives to documents covered by banking confidentiality. It follows the model under current legislation—specifically section 105, subsection (2A) of the Financial Services Act 1986, as inserted by the Companies Act 1989. The two Government amendments are drafting changes. The term ``a related company'' is not defined as it stands. The amendments would replace those references with the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a member of that person's group'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which draws on the definition of ``group'' in clause 355.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are not attracted to extending a special regime in the way suggested in amendment No. 503. For one thing, the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acting in a fiduciary capacity''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
covers a broad range of circumstances, for example professional advisers, such as accountants, stockbrokers and solicitors, who may owe duties to their clients, company directors in relation to their shareholders, agents in relation to their principals, and trustees generally, whether under an express, resulting or constructive trust. Those are all people from whom the ESA may require information, but one must draw a line somewhere; why not include other duties of confidence? We cannot draw up specific rules for all of them.
<P>
We are following the existing legislation in drawing it round the relatively well-understood legal concept of banking confidentiality—a concept that has grown up over many years and has a clear and accustomed meaning. That is less true of fiduciary duties, particularly given that they would include constructive trusts that can arise in a wide variety of situations. There is a danger that the amendment would give rise to many different interpretations and disputes over the exercise of the powers.
<P>
I am also unconvinced of the need for amendment No. 504. It is clear that the provision requires the investigating authority consciously to take the decision to over-rule the normal presumption. I see no value in a requirement based on undefined terms such as ``senior officer or official''. In practice, we would expect the FSA to take such decisions at the level of its heads of department. However, it quite naturally intends that the decisions will normally be taken by the head of the department responsible for directing the investigation. That seems only sensible, as that person will be best placed to judge what is and is not necessary for the purposes of the investigation. In any case, the FSA will cover its approach to this requirement in its enforcement manual which is due to be published for public consultation in the first quarter of next year and I am content that that point should be dealt with in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have just received a high-powered six-page brief, with which I shall not detain the Committee. I am sure that it will make interesting reading later this evening.
<P>
I know the Minister's response to what I might describe as somewhat secondary, although none the less important, amendments: No. 429, which she has agreed to take away and consider, No. 503, which she is not so keen on, and No.504, which she does not like at all. I am delighted that she is responsive to the point that we are making about voluntary disclosure of documents in amendments Nos. 502 and 430.
<P>
I would like to impress on the Minister—it did not come across in her remarks; rather the contrary—that a large proportion of those communications have nothing to do with investigations and are not even connected with any putative offence that might be under investigation or might be permitted. They may be supplied for quite other purposes. For example, a major clearing bank may provide information to assist with prudential supervision, but the document may contain information that could subsequently be of relevance to an investigation. It is those sorts of documents in particular, of which the clearing bank or major financial institution is determined to do its best at all stages to keep the FSA informed generally and which it is supplying on a voluntary basis, that we feel strongly should get the same privileged coverage as if they had been demanded by the FSA under the terms of the clause. As drafted, the clause does not afford that protection, although the Minister said that it was her intention that it should be interpreted in that way. The only issue remaining is whether the Government feel that there might be a need to insert a small amendment on report to clarify that issue. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 505, in page 70, line 33, at end insert `at any relevant time'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 554.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I inadvertently spoke to amendment No. 505 a moment ago. I shall not add to what I said then, but I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about Government amendment No. 554.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The term ``relevant person'' is defined in subsection (8) as a director, employee or auditor—past or present—who is required to produce a document. Government amendment No. 554 would add to that list an actuary, an accountant or legal adviser instructed by the person who is required to produce a relevant document.
<P>
I understand and sympathise with the thinking behind amendment No. 505. However, it is not entirely clear what ``at the relevant time'' means. Would it be when the document was found or when the document was created? Perhaps it might be when the events described in the document or to which the document refers took place. If the answer is that it could be any of those, depending on the document and other circumstances, little is added.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Did we not face this problem in clauses 137(2) and 141(4)? Is not a way forward to be found in the Government's thinking on those two clauses?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am grateful for the suggestion that the way forward is to be found in the Government's thinking. That is absolutely right, and I commend the hon. Gentleman for his admirable good sense. I sympathise with him, but I am not sure why we should ask someone to explain a document if he was not connected with it at the relevant time. We need to take a common-sense approach to the provision. In practice, neither the FSA nor an investigator will abuse that power by asking for explanations from people whom they know were not connected at the relevant time. It is a matter of common sense, and I trust that the hon. Gentleman will commend the Government for having lots of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I always do my best, but do I not want to detain the Committee. However, the Minister's answer flags up the need for an explanation of what is meant by ``at any relevant time'' in clause 137(2) at line 41 of page 64. The Minister will find the same phrase, which we are trying to add to the Bill, in clause 141(4), at line 27 of page 68. We thought that the meaning was fairly clear, but in trying to reject our amendment, the Minister has now generated an element of doubt—not only about what we mean, but about what the Government mean. We shall need an explanation at some point if there is a genuine lack of clarity.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> To further the co-operation that is breaking out between the Opposition and Government, I should like to say that we are quite happy to consider further the points raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On that basis, I bet to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 506, in page 71, line 3, after `it' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within such reasonable period as is specified in the information requirement'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the amendment is clear. I hoped that the phraseology of the previous amendment—``at any relevant time''—was clear, but found that it was not. This time, we are going for ``within such reasonable period''. The amendment would make it clear that the person on whom an information requirement has been imposed should have a reasonable period to comply with it. That is a reasonable and sensible way forward, which would add clarity to the clause. It is a minor and straightforward amendment, which I hope that the Government will accept.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I regret that I cannot help the hon. Gentleman on this occasion. If a reasonable period has not been allowed for compliance, I doubt whether the test—which any justice of the peace or sheriff would want satisfied before a warrant were issued for failure to comply with a requirement—would be judged as having been met. No warrant would therefore be issued. For that reason, amendment No. 506 is unnecessary. It would mean that all requirements would have to be accomplished within a specific time scale for compliance or else they could not subsequently be enforced through a warrant. That might be another danger of accepting the amendment. As I said, it is unnecessary and also has hazards, so if the hon. Gentleman does not withdraw it, I urge my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Would the Minister go a little further in what she said about requiring justices of the peace to take into account a reasonable period before issuing warrants? The Minister seems to be saying that a judgment should be made and that there should be a test of reasonableness, but that it should not be built into the Bill. Rather than making a requirement through primary legislation, it seems that common sense should prevail and it should be dealt with by the issuer of the warrants. In that case, further clarity from the Minister on her interpretation would be helpful.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The power to enter someone's premises to obtain information and documents is important and the safeguards must be right. This and the following two amendments are all concerned with three sets of conditions, one of which must be satisfied for a warrant to be issued.
<P>
The first set is concerned with obtaining information or documents where a person has failed to respond satisfactorily to a requirement imposed under this part of the Bill. It is clearly necessary to be able to exercise powers of entry where the person has failed to comply. That takes forward the position under section 43(1)(a) of the Banking Act 1987 and section 199(2) of the Financial Services Act 1986. Those who are to sign warrants must be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to do so in the terms that I have explained. A reasonable period of compliance must be allowed for; otherwise the warrant will not be issued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We shall not delve too closely into the 1986 legislation. If information has not been provided as quickly as the investigator would have liked on account of a mechanical problem—for example, the problem of attaining documents from archives in the case that we mentioned earlier—it is only reasonable that the person being investigated should have had a specified time which could have been contested in terms of reasonableness from the outset. It is important for the person to be able to dispute it, as I say, from the outset or to be able to go back to the investigator and say, ``There is a particular problem, which is preventing us from producing the documents within the time scale. It is not that we do not want to comply and be helpful, but it has been physically impossible to do that.'' Otherwise, after a matter of one or two days, bailiffs with a warrant might be knocking on his door, even though he was unaware that he had only one or two days. It seems sensible to specify a time scale so that the investigated person can know from the outset what is achievable.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> For the reasons that I gave before, there are difficulties involved in setting a time scale. If it is impossible to comply with the requirement, there can obviously be no failure to comply. If it is impossible to get the information in the necessary time, a justice of the peace is unlikely to say that there has been a failure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I appreciate that, and there is little difference between us. However, it can take a great deal of paperwork and investigative work to get archived evidence, particularly records of investments that go back five or 10 years and which might involve someone who has fraudulently taken money or failed to live up to investment requirements when he was entrusted with money. If a time scale were agreed at the outset, it would help both sides. It would be better to do that than to have the sheriff or JP say, ``We haven't got the information. We must have the warrant'' when the person who is being investigated is trying his hardest to provide the information. It would be sensible to include that additional piece of information at the outset to avoid all the problems later on.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I could reunite the hon. Gentleman with his old friend reasonable. We are happy to have a further look at various aspects of the issue, but, in general terms, justices of the peace and others who are involved—of whom I am still one—think carefully before issuing warrants to enter premises. Nothing different would happen in the circumstances that we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister said that she was prepared to take another look at the issue, and it would have been marvellous if she had stopped there instead of carrying on with a ``but'' and a couple of qualifying clauses. In spite of that, however, and on the basis of the first part of her remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 317, in page 71, line 40, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) A warrant under this section shall not authorise the taking of possession of any documents or information to which legal professional privilege applies'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Amendment No. 557 makes it clear that the safeguards under section 15(5) to (8) and the provisions regarding the execution of warrants under section 16 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 apply to warrants that are issued under the clause. Among other things, the provisions specify that a warrant permits entry on one occasion only; that that must be within a month of the date of issue; that the warrant may authorise other people to accompany the constable; and what must be specified in the warrant. The amendment also makes it clear that, in line with those provisions, reasonable force may be used where necessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 317 relates to the protection of privilege. The objective of the amendment is clearly to ensure that documents to which legal professional privilege attaches cannot be taken, even by a constable armed with a warrant. Again, we agree that legal professional privilege should be respected, so we sympathise with that objective. We have discussed clause 145(4), which provides that a person cannot be required to hand over a privileged document. Of course, the circumstances are different under clause 146; it is a case not of people being asked to hand over documents, but of constables being able to enter premises and take possession of documents. I assure hon. Members that legal privilege will be protected none the less. That protection is provided under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 19(6) of which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``No power of seizure conferred on a constable under any enactment (including an enactment contained in an Act passed after this Act) is to be taken to authorise the seizure of an item which the constable exercising the power has reasonable grounds for believing to be subject to legal privilege.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provides the protection that Opposition Members seek, so I hope that they will not press amendment No. 317 to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 317, and with permission, I shall refer to amendment No. 318, so that we may proceed more speedily. The purpose of amendment No. 317 is to ensure that warrants granted by justices of the peace or sheriffs under clause 146 will allow the authority or an investigator to gather information and that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall not authorise the taking of possession of any documents or information to which legal professional privilege applies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reason for the amendment is straightforward. Legal professional privilege is a mechanism whereby the information conveyed to a solicitor, barrister or advocate is subject to protection from unauthorised disclosure.
<P>
Clause 146 will allow a constable acting on a warrant granted by a JP or a sheriff to enter premises, search them, and remove documents or information. The constable can require any person on the premises to provide an explanation of any document. That power cuts across the obligation of confidentiality owed by a solicitor to his or her clients under the benefit of legal professional privilege, which the courts in England and Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom recognise. Therefore, it would be sensible and straightforward to agree to the amendment, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will do so. She has been relatively sympathetic to several points that I have made, so I hope that she will continue in the same vein.
<P>
I shall refer to amendment No. 318 even more briefly. It would ensure that warrants under clause 146 could be granted only by a sheriff in Scotland. The Law Society of Scotland thinks that warrants granted under clause 146 will allow such invasive powers that they should be approved by a sheriff rather than a JP. I should be grateful to the Economic Secretary if she would be flexible about that amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall reiterate my sympathy for amendment No. 317 and my belief that it is unnecessary because of the provisions of PACE to which I referred. Amendment No. 318 would end the possibility of JPs being involved in granting warrants to the FSA in Scotland, restricting that to sheriffs only. I share some of the sentiments behind that amendment. Issuing a warrant is a serious matter, and I understand that JPs do not have the seniority and experience of sheriffs. However, they rightly have an important role to play in the Scottish criminal justice system. JPs have the power to issue warrants—for example, enabling searches of premises relating to drugs offences and robberies as well as under financial services legislation. 
<P>
It is the policy of the Crown Office in Scotland that that power should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances such as in an emergency, when it would not be practical to contact the procurator fiscal or the duty sheriff, or in rural areas, where practical difficulties may be encountered in contacting either of those individuals and following the preferred procedure.
<P>
I do not envisage that it will be routine for a constable to apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant. However, I understand that the Crown Office wants to retain that option for use in the circumstances that I described. That will be consistent with other legislation and will retain the flexibility necessary for the FSA to do its job. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Chichester not to press the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Economic Secretary has asserted that PACE covers our anxieties and our reasons for tabling amendment No. 317. I have not been appraised to that effect, and we shall have to investigate the matter. However, on the basis that it does, we hope that we shall not have to return to the matter on Report, after we have considered it. We will not press the amendment now, on the basis that the Economic Secretary is correct on that point.
<P>
Amendment No. 318 would make a relatively small change. The Economic Secretary said that she wants to retain the flexibility to enable a JP to issue a warrant in this case. Again, we might have to reconsider that, and we shall try to urge the Government to do so in the light of the response that we receive from north of the border. In the spirit of co-operation in which we are engaged tonight, I am happy not to press either amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am eternally grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I know that his bedtime reading will not be complete without his tucking himself up with a copy of PACE. He should refer to section 19(6) in relation to what I mentioned earlier.
<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 558, in page 72, line 12, leave out subsections (1) and (2) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) If a person other than the investigator (``the defaulter'') fails to comply with a requirement imposed on him under this Part the person imposing the requirement may certify that fact in writing to the court.
<P>
(2) If the court is satisfied that the defaulter failed without reasonable excuse to comply with the requirement, it may deal with the defaulter (and in the case of a body corporate, any director or officer) as if he were in contempt.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Amendment No. 507, in page 72, line 12, after `comply', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within such reasonable time as may have been specified.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 559.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Clause 147(1) makes it a criminal offence to fail to comply with a requirement imposed under part X without a reasonable excuse. Amendment No. 558 will replace that criminal offence with a procedure whereby a requirement can be enforced as though a failure to comply with it were a contempt of court. That follows the certification procedure under section 436 of the Companies Act 1985.
<P>
Apart from decriminalising how requirements under this part are enforced, the change will enable disputes over what may legally be required to be resolved quickly before a court, rather than having to wait until a criminal case can be brought. Indeed, in a recent high-profile ruling, involving Kevin Maxwell, the court held in contempt proceedings that the requests of Companies Act inspectors were unreasonable. It is much better to allow the court to determine that at the time rather than having to wait for the criminal process. That will benefit all parties.
<P>
Amendment No. 559 defines ``court'' for these purposes as the High Court, or, in Scotland, the Court of Session. Amendment No. 507 relates to a subsection that we are replacing. I understand the reasoning behind the amendment, but both subsection (1) and new subsection (2) are qualified by the words ``without reasonable excuse''. That clearly includes the excuse that the period allowed for compliance was unreasonable. Amendment No. 507 is therefore unnecessary. We propose to amend the clause and replace the offence in subsection (1) with a certification procedure.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Fortunately, we have reached the last part of the debate on part X and what has turned out to be a long and tawdry section of the Bill. [Interruption.] The word ``tawdry seems appropriate at this time of night. We are glad to see the back of part X now, but I think that we shall be seeing more of it on Report after our deliberations today.
<P>
We welcome the extra clarification in amendment No. 558. As non-compliance with any of the provisions under part X amount to a criminal offence being committed, it is important that the FSA's powers of investigation are clearly and precisely defined. That was not the case before, which is why we tabled amendment No. 507, and sought the return to reasonableness and a reasonable time. I am happy to have the assurance that reasonable time will now be covered by the Minister's phrase ``without reasonable excuse'' That proves that merely including or uttering the word ``reasonable'' is not so much of an arduous task. We are happy to see our old friend, Captain Reasonable back in Government parlance. If the Minister can reassure us on the issue of timing, we shall be happy not to press amendment No. 507.
<P>
Without subsection (1) of amendment No. 558, the investigator is the only one who is allowed to be incompetent and to fail to come up with the terms of reference that are being imposed on the person being investigated. The investigator has complete immunity from incompetence and non-compliance with the terms. We visited that ground earlier, so I shall not open it up again. On the basis of the Minister's assurances that her new amendment will satisfy our reasonableness qualification, I shall not press my amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
