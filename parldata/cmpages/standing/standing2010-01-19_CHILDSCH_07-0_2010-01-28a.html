<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000254"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Amess.
Amendment 39 amends clause 1(5) on parent guarantees, paragraph (b) of
which introduces the guarantee of a home-school agreement. It would
change the provision so that such a home-school
agreement</div><a name="10012857000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
be a condition of admission to the school&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div><a name="10012857000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 43 would amend
clause 4 on home-school agreements and would enable a school or
admission authority to make them a condition of admission. The Bill
acknowledges that home-school agreements have not been an effective
means of ensuring compliance with school rules or of ensuring good
behaviour. They are good in that they set out the ethos of a school and
what is expected of pupils, but because schools are not permitted to
make the signing of such an agreement a condition of admission, they
lack
enforcement.</div><a name="10012857000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the explanatory notes, clauses 4 and 5 explicitly acknowledge that,
by tying
the</div><a name="10012857000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;discharge
by parents of their responsibilities under home-school agreements to
parenting contracts and
orders&#148;.</div><a name="10012857000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
say that the legislation will be amended so that, in every parenting
contract,</div><a name="10012857000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is a statement by the parent that they agree to discharge their
responsibilities set out in the home-school
agreement&#148;.</div><a name="10012857000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern about the effectiveness of home-school agreements was made even
clearer in the impact assessment, which states on page 8
that</div><a name="10012857000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;existing
HSA legislation is ineffective in underpinning parent/school
relationships.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Yeovil said on Tuesday, the assessment goes on to
say
that</div><a name="10012857000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HSAs
are largely ineffective at present: bureaucratic process with few real
benefits.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that the Government share our view about the lack of
enforcement provisions of home-school agreements, but their proposals
to tackle the problem seem extreme and unlikely to be
realised.</div><a name="10012857000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Invoking
the parenting contract and parenting order legislation when parents or
pupils fail to comply with the home-school agreement seems to be using
a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Paragraphs 2.8 and 2.9 of the White
Paper
state:</div><a name="10012857000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At
the moment, all schools have a Home School Agreement, but not all
parents sign on. So we will now strengthen Home School Agreements so
that all parents and pupils understand their responsibilities to follow
the school rules and support good behaviour from the
outset.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far, so good, but the White Paper goes on to say
that</div><a name="10012857000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will therefore ensure that when applying for schools for their child,
all parents will receive each school&#146;s behaviour policy as it
will appear in their Home School Agreement. In applying for a school
place every parent will now agree to adhere to these rules. If parents
have difficulty understanding the requirements, we will ensure that
they get the support they
need.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sounds like a requirement to sign a home-school agreement, as a
condition of admission, except that it then
states:</div><a name="10012857000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be wrong to make signing the Home School Agreement a condition of
admission, as this could unfairly deny a child a school place. However,
once their child is in school the parents will be expected to sign the
Home School Agreement each year, and parents will face real
consequences if they fail to live up to the responsibilities set out
within.&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10012857000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is all very tough,
but&#151;</div><a name="10012857000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will bring forward changes to the law so that parents&#146;
unwillingness to sign up and support their school&#146;s behaviour
policy can be used by schools to support applications to the courts for
Parenting Contracts and Parenting
Orders.&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div><a name="10012857000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the
Government do not want to make signing a home-school agreement a
condition of admission to a school, but if a parent refuses to sign the
agreement, the school should take those parents to court. That is an
extreme approach to
take.</div><a name="10012857000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000255"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> Let us envisage a hypothetical situation. If it
were made an absolute condition of admission to a school that a
home-school contract should be signed, what school would a pupil go to
if a parent
refused?</div><a name="10012857000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000256"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I shall come on to that, but I shall touch on it now
to the extent of saying that that is a sign, is it not, of a problem
with parenting. The Government&#146;s approach is rather bizarre.
Surely it is more sensible to make signing a home-school agreement a
condition of admission to a school. That would encourage the
vast majority of parents to sign and would make all the parents fully
cognisant of the fact that their child&#146;s continued place at the
school depended on their fulfilling the obligations in the agreement,
including on behaviour and homework.</div>
<a name="10012857000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
parents refused to sign, thereby, as the White Paper said, unfairly
denying their own child a place at the school, that would surely be the
point at which to question their parenting skills&#151;not when a
child swore in class or acted out in the
school.</div><a name="10012857000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000257"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I accept the point about parents, and the
necessity for parental responsibility. No one would disagree with that.
I am raising the sheer practicality of making it an absolute condition
for admission to a school that the parent should sign the home-school
contract. What would happen if the parent had not signed it by the time
the child was due to start school?</div>
<a name="10012857000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is all
very well to say that the parent should have done so, but that does not
overcome the point that a child would have been prevented from going to
school by his parents&#146; failure to sign a home-school agreement.
That would be the consequence of the amendment, even though we all
agree about the necessity for responsible
parenting.</div><a name="10012857000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000258"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> That is the advantage of the independent sector over
the state sector at the moment. If parents do not sign up to the ethos
of the school, the child cannot go to it. That means that the
leadership of those schools has real power in enforcing the school
rules.</div>
<a name="10012857000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
raises a good point in asking what would happen to the children of
parents who refused to sign. There is no reason why they should not
sign. Why should they refuse to sign the home-school agreement? If they
do not sign, it is an early warning sign of parenting problems in those
schools.</div>
<a name="10012857000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000259"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes, in a moment.</div>
<a name="10012857000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s approach is to say, &#147;You do not need to
sign, but when you get into the school you are expected to comply with
the agreement; and then we will go to court to seek parenting orders
and parenting contracts when a child or parent disobeys the rules in
the home-school agreement. However, that is a very large
task.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div><a name="10012857000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many children,
including children of parents who have signed the home-school
agreement, will breach the rules by messing up in class, not doing
their homework, or persistently behaving poorly; and the
Government&#146;s approach means that court action will be taken to
obtain parenting contracts in relation to thousands of children. That
seems extreme and onerous; and consequently it will not happen. Head
teachers will not do that in the numbers
envisaged.</div>
<a name="10012857000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is far
better to say, &#147;We expect parents to sign the home-school
agreement as a condition of their children coming to the
school&#148;; 99 per cent. of parents will do that. It would then be
possible to isolate a tiny minority of parents who refused to sign the
agreement. Why do they refuse to say that their child will behave in
class, or that their child will do their homework on time? It is an
early indication of
problems.</div><a name="10012857000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is better to focus the resources of the state on the tiny minority of
parents who clearly show early signs of poor parenting.</div>
<a name="10012857000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="10012857000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012857000260"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): Does the hon. Gentleman
recognise that there is a considerable difference between the attitude
of parents who are in a position, and willing, to spend thousands of
pounds on a private education, and the small proportion of parents who
are likely to be in the group we are talking about, whose children go
to state schools and, for all sorts of reasons, perhaps including
mental health reasons, may not be willing to sign the
agreements?</div><a name="10012857000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000261"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Of course there is a difference; but the key
similarity is that the ability to refuse admission to a child due to
problems with behaviour will be the same in both sectors. That will
level the playing field to some extent between the state and
independent sectors. The hon. Gentleman made a good point. If there is
a minority of parents&#151;and there will be&#151;who refuse to
sign these agreements, we have to find out their reasons and tackle
them. Whatever the problem with a child&#146;s learning&#151;be it
dyslexia or other learning difficulties&#151;it is better to identify
it early. In that respect, phonics is a good way of teaching children
to read, because it identifies children with problems early on, and the
same is true here. If we require parents to sign a home-school
agreement before their child is admitted to the school, and they refuse
for mental health reasons or simply as a result of poor parenting, we
will have a good way of picking up problems
early.</div>
<a name="10012857000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012857000262"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman may not
agree, but we had a short debate earlier in the week about home-school
agreements including an individual learning plan, so it would be
difficult in practical terms for parents to sign the more general
home-school agreement in advance if they have not had an opportunity in
school to discuss how the personalised plan will work alongside it. I
know that the hon. Gentleman is against including a personalised plan,
but it is part of the debate, and if it goes forward, it is difficult
to see how parents could sign in advance. However, I agree that they
should sign, and they should sign quickly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000263"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I do not agree with that approach to home-school
agreements, so the right hon. Lady answered her own question. That is
one reason why they should not be personalised. Personalising a
child&#146;s pastoral 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>care is an issue for the personal tutor to decide on a one-to-one basis
with the pupil; it is not an issue for the home-school agreement, which
is about the school&#146;s general ethos, rules and behaviour
policy.</div>
<a name="10012857000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000264"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Before the debate goes any further, I want to be
clear about what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting. He seems to be
suggesting that no child whose parent has not signed an agreement
should be admitted to a state-funded
school.</div>
<a name="10012857000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000265"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes, indeed. There is no reason why they should not
sign. What is the reason why they should not sign? The hon. Gentleman
cites mental health difficulties, but if the parent&#146;s mental
health problems prevent them from signing a contract, what else are
they preventing them from doing in parenting their child? A refusal to
sign the agreement will be a good early indication to the social
services that they need to keep an eye on the family and perhaps help
them and give them support.</div>
<a name="10012857000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
parents refuse to sign because they simply do not agree that their
child should turn up on time for school, complete their homework and
behave in the class, there are, again, problems with their parenting.
Those parenting problems should not be foisted on the school and left
for staff to sort out; they need to be sorted out by those in the
system who have specialist knowledge and expertise in helping parents
with parenting skills.</div>
<a name="10012857000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
covered the arguments in favour of the amendments. The key point is
that the Conservative approach to admissions will enable social
services to give the tiny minority of parents who refuse to sign an
agreement the help and support that they need. The Government&#146;s
approach would condemn tens of thousands of parents to parenting orders
and parenting contracts and to involvement in the courts, simply
because their children would not adhere to the school ethos. That is an
absurd way of conducting home-school agreements in our education
system.</div>
<a name="10012857000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000266"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Amess. I
am afraid that my colleagues and I cannot support these two linked
amendments, because we are concerned that they would have a very
adverse impact in a small number of cases. Unfortunately, the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who is a pleasant, charming
and responsible person, assumes that everybody else in society is the
same. There is a small minority of parents whose behaviour is not so
bad or damaging that their children are taken out of the family home
and into custody, but who are not always responsible and who may, for
reasons that he and I cannot predict, decide that they will not sign
the agreement. I have seen a small number of people at my advice centre
recently who have custody of their children, but who have mental health
and other problems that mean that their approach to parenting is a good
deal further from what the hon. Gentleman, and perhaps I, would like.
Nevertheless, they have custody of their children, and it is extremely
unlikely in those circumstances that social services would take the
children out of their custody.</div>
<a name="10012857000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000267"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman think that such problems
should become the school&#146;s problem, given that schools are
staffed by teachers, who are academics 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>and are not trained in improving parenting skills? I realise, as he
says, that such problems are not sufficiently serious to warrant taking
children out of their parents&#146; custody, but none the less, ought
they not more properly to be dealt with by people with the right
specialism, namely, social
services?</div><a name="10012857000225"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="10012857000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000268"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal would make it
less likely that the problems were dealt with, because the children
would then not be in a school environment and would not receive direct
support from the school and linked services. He will know that this
Government have tried&#151;so far, the aspirations have not been met
on the ground, but at least we are moving in that direction&#151;to
establish more services for children in order to deal with the absence
from their home environment of precisely the support that he wants.
However, I fear that if we exclude a small number of children from
education because their parents&#151;for whatever reason, however
irrational it might seem to him&#151;are not willing to sign the
contracts, it will condemn those youngsters to even greater
disadvantage.</div><a name="10012857000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman gave a couple of linked reasons for objecting to the
Bill as it stands. One, which does not stand up, is the suggestion that
if a young person is effectively excluded from school, at least
something will happen to trigger communication with their family in
order to get to the bottom of the problems. I agree that early warning
signs of parental irresponsibility are important, but paragraph 25 of
the Government policy statement that has been issued alongside the Bill
gives a clear indication that the Government intend that action will be
taken if a parent decides not to sign an agreement. Paragraph 25
specifically
says:</div><a name="10012857000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
agreement cannot be reached, and the HSA was not complied with by the
parents or the child, the school would trigger further discussion, for
instance through a Parent Support Adviser, and then possibly early
intervention by other professionals if there was cause for
concern.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is precisely the type of intervention that the hon. Gentleman is trying
to trigger through his suggestion that the child be excluded from
school, but it will not lead to the draconian effect of excluding a
child from education from which they could benefit. Such a thing might
leave children in a home environment in which I do not think that he
would want them to be left, particularly if the parent was not prepared
to sign the agreement for reasons that would appear irrational to him
and me.</div>
<a name="10012857000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the
critical issue raised by the amendment. As the hon. Gentleman rightly
says, there are concerns about whether home-school agreements are
effective. However, if they are to be effective, there must be a
mechanism for taking action against breaches, and that mechanism should
surely apply equally to parents who have and who have not signed. I
agree that it would be totally wrong if parents who were irresponsible
enough not to sign the agreements could not be held to account in the
same way as parents who had
signed.</div><a name="10012857000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
44 of the Department&#146;s policy statement says:</div>
<a name="10012857000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
cases where children misbehave, or their attendance is poor, there will
be an explicit link between non-compliance with the HSA, and parenting
contracts and orders. It will be a legal requirement for a parenting
contract to include a statement by the parent that they will comply
with the provisions of the relevant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>HSA and the school will provide support to the parent to help manage the
child&#146;s behaviour. Non-compliance with an HSA will be something
that a court can take into account when deciding to make a parenting
order.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify whether that means that the courts will be able to
act more effectively and decisively and with greater strength when an
HSA has been signed than when it has not? I suggest that if the powers
are equivalent, it should give us comfort, although it raises the
question of precisely what is the point of signing the agreements. If a
failure to sign made it more difficult for the courts to take action,
there would be a loophole. That would require an amendment to the Bill,
albeit not along the lines proposed in amendment 39, to ensure that the
irresponsible minority of parents were not able to make it more
difficult to enforce home-school agreements, and parenting contracts
and orders. We look for some reassurance from the Minister that
irresponsible parents who fail to sign will not be in an advantageous
position when it comes to taking
action.</div><a name="10012857000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the reasons that I have given, we would be unwilling to support the
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.
The amendment makes an assumption about the world out there, but we
cannot legislate on the basis that everyone is as nice, responsible,
reasonable and sensible as the hon. Gentleman without taking serious
risks.</div>
<a name="10012857000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000269"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Whenever I see such amendments, I am instinctively
attracted to them, because it would be nice to think that everything
could be so straightforward. At present, the vast majority of parents
sign home-school agreements without quibbling, but things sometimes go
wrong. Most of this morning&#146;s debate has been about the parents
who wilfully choose not to sign such agreements, but we need to address
the underlying issues, and that will have to be done somewhere along
the way because children leaving year 6 will sooner or later have to
attend another educational establishment.</div>
<a name="10012857000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
aspect of the debate is that mistakes can be made&#151;people lose
forms or do not send them in. I would be worried if parents who, to all
intents and purposes, were well-meaning and wanted to do the
best by their children had someone from the school
or the local authority chasing them for a form. That could
lead to them being wrapped up in a series of official consequences, but
it would be due to nothing more than a mistake or an oversight in the
hustle and bustle of real life. Can any member of the Committee
honestly say, as an MP or otherwise, that they have always filled in
forms correctly&#151;that subject has been quite topical over the
past year or so? We are all vulnerable and frail.</div>
<a name="10012857000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
thing, however, is what happens when the child enters school. Schools
can support parents who, for one reason or another, decide that they do
not want to sign the forms. Some people might not sign because they do
not care enough about the ethos of school or their role as parents,
while others might be anarchists who do not want to sign such
forms.</div>
<a name="10012857000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Supporting
schools is important. I would say to my hon. Friend the Minister that
throughout these debates, we must remember that we want schools to have
a greater idea of what action they can take on home-school agreements.
Some forms might not be signed, but the more worrying problem for
schools is that although most people sign them, not all abide by
them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div><a name="10012857000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said to
my hon. Friend before that there seems to be ignorance among head
teachers&#151;ignorance is a not sin&#151;about how to use the
current powers on parenting orders, and perhaps a cultural
unwillingness to use them. We set benchmarks and rules, but people
ultimately end up wringing their hands because they want someone else
to take a decision or more affirmative action to deal with the problem.
We should not forget that when such problems occur in schools, it is
not just about a single family, because the negativity often has an
impact on other children in the class and
elsewhere.</div>
<a name="10012857000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that my hon. Friend will deal with those matters. Although I am
attracted to the simple way forward suggested by the amendment, it is
fraught with problems. However, once a child enters a school, it is
important that the home-school agreement is discussed with parents,
whether they have signed it or not. We should also remember that people
can just sign things and then put them to the back of their mind, never
thinking about them again until a crisis emerges. I hope that that will
not
happen.</div><a name="10012857000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000270"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Good morning to you, Mr. Amess, and all
members of the
Committee.</div><a name="10012857000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had an important little debate, and my right hon. Friend the
Member for Don Valley hit the nail on the head. The idea of not signing
a home-school agreement probably does not seem reasonable to any of us.
In an ideal world, we would all come together, discuss the home-school
agreement and sign it, but in the real world, although we all want that
to happen and we have to take every action to try to ensure that it
happens, it simply does not happen, for some of the reasons given by
the hon. Member for Yeovil and my right hon. Friend. For those reasons,
Ian Craig, the chief schools adjudicator, has
said:</div><a name="10012857000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
welcome your intention to strengthen...such agreements, and also
your continued view that the statement in section 1.55 of the current
School Admissions Code that &#145;admission to school must not be
conditional on parents signing home-school agreements&#146; must
remain in force. I am certain that the &#145;outlawing&#146; of
conditionality is essential to ensure that the admissions system
remains as fair as possible, and readily accessible to all parents and
carers.</div><a name="10012857000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the nub of the debate, although we can go round and round on this.
No one disagrees with the intent behind what the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton is trying to do. He says that he wants parents
to take responsibility&#151;that this is about parenting skills. That
is absolutely right. I agree with him and share the frustration that
he, my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley and all of us have
about some parents&#146; unwillingness to support the school or work
with it in a way that we would think
acceptable.</div><a name="10012857000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is right to say that the
system should try to address problem and that there are other issues
that need to be considered, but we come back to two central points.
First, I do not know the figures, but let us say that we got to a point
where the parents of x number of children in this country simply
refused to sign a home-school agreement. If the amendment were
accepted, it would then mean that x number of children in this country
would not be able to go to
school.</div><a name="10012857000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000271"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does the Minister think that local authority social
services should keep an eye on parents who refuse to sign a home-school
agreement, and perhaps intervene 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>and pay a visit to that family, or does he think that they should leave
them alone and the consequences should be left to the
family?</div><a name="10012857000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000272"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I do not think that such parents should
necessarily just be left alone, but it is a good job that the hon.
Member for Beverley and Holderness is not here when his colleague is
talking about keeping registers of people who have not signed
home-school agreements and the question of whether they could be the
subject to home visits and checks. I shall keep schtum, however. I will
not share what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said
with the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, and nor will I
mention it when the home-education debate comes
up.</div><a name="10012857000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I take the serious point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton. It might be that the issue under discussion should be
taken into account. We are trying to say that we cannot predict all the
different reasons why people do not sign. There might be wilful
non-signing, and some people might have an objection in principle. All
I am saying to the hon. Gentleman is that his proposal would mean that
a number of children would not have a school place, and I would also be
concerned that some schools might use such a measure as a back-door
method of
selection.</div><a name="10012857000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000273"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Can the Minister imagine what social services
departments throughout the country would say to the proposal that they
should be tracking children whose parents are not abiding by and
signing home-school agreements? Social services departments can barely
do their existing job of child protection and already concentrate on
the very small proportion of children with welfare concerns. The idea
that they can extend their role into education when, in my view, they
are not even able to do their existing child protection job is simply
not
realistic.</div><a name="10012857000226"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div>
<a name="10012857000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000274"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> There are practical consequences to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s suggestion, but part of the thrust of the
Government&#146;s agenda is to try to ensure a greater joined-up
delivery of services between schools, social services,
children&#146;s services, health, police and so on. We ought to use
all the information that we get to try to ensure that the different
parts of the system work together to address the problems. Parental
responsibility is important for society, but simply requiring someone
to sign a home-school agreement is not the right way to generate such
responsibility. We all share a frustration when some people do not act
reasonably.</div><a name="10012857000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012857000275"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): As we are
discussing the role of social services in education, will the Minister
say what role home-school agreements will play when an education
supervision order is made?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000276"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b><b class="B"> </b>The education supervision order is one
aspect of the system; alongside it will run the home-school
agreement&#151;an agreement between the school and the parent. The
supervision order aims to enforce certain requirements. The home-school
agreement is valuable, but there will be no legal requirement for
parents to sign it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div><a name="10012857000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000277"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for being so generous
in accepting interventions. The hon. Member for Yeovil spoke of social
services being involved when parents do not abide by the home-school
agreement, but they would be involved in only a tiny minority of cases
when a parent refuses to sign a home-school agreement. The hon.
Gentleman implied that, because social services departments are
stretched and lacking resources, responsibility should pass to schools,
which do not have the expertise in parenting and dealing with families
who are in difficulty. That would be an absurd way for our system to
function. If there are problems in social services departments, and
they have capacity constraints, we need to deal with them and not pass
responsibility to head
teachers.</div>
<a name="10012857000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000278"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman answers the point
made by the hon. Member for Yeovil. Of course schools will not always
have the expertise necessary to deal with the problems that a parent or
family might have, which is why we need to ensure greater clarity about
the different roles in the system and that they are better joined-up.
That is the point of the schools
agenda.</div><a name="10012857000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Yeovil made a point about non-compliance. Parenting
contracts and parenting orders are available for any parent. As my
right hon. Friend for Don Valley said, someone can sign a home-school
agreement, but not really mean it&#151;they can just tick it and
comply for an easy life. Parenting contracts and parenting orders will
be available for anyone to deal with any parent, but the courts should
consider them when deciding whether to grant a parenting order. That is
not the case at the
moment.</div><a name="10012875000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000279"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is the Minister therefore saying that, in trying to
enforce the home-school agreements or taking action against parents who
are not abiding by them, it would not in practice make any difference
whether the home-school agreement had been signed or whether the parent
had refused to sign it? Would the enforcement powers and the attitudes
of the court be exactly the same under both
circumstances?</div><a name="10012857000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000280"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> We are saying that parenting contracts&#151;the
voluntary agreements&#151;are available to schools, local authorities
and others. Parenting orders are available to the courts, irrespective
of whether someone has signed a home-school agreement. The fact that
the parent has not signed the home-school agreement may be a
consideration for the court in determining whether to grant a parenting
order or what its terms should be. The home-school agreement aims to
put some teeth into the system by saying that there may be a
consequence for parents who do not sign the
agreement.</div>
<a name="10012857000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000281"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am still a bit confused, because I assume that the
point of the parent signing the home-school agreement is to give it
some greater enforceability and meaning, and to provide for
follow-through if it is breached. If, however, somebody refuses to sign
them, does that make it more difficult to achieve the enforcement that
the signature is designed to reinforce?</div>
<a name="10012857000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000282"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> No, the actions of the parent, including whether
they have signed the agreement, will determine whether a parenting
contract or parenting order will be pursued. If a contract is not
signed, the court might want to take that fact into account in
determining whether to impose an order.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div><a name="10012857000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012857000283"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Ann Cryer</b> (Keighley) (Lab): I am sure that my hon. Friend
has many grandparents coming to him, as I do, about problems with their
grandchildren, because the parents are on drugs. Parents on drugs will
not sign any form, because they will not understand it. Is there
provision in the Bill that I have missed whereby grandparents can sign
instead of parents and can effectively act as a parent? The Bill
certainly says that a child can sign an agreement if the school is
satisfied that the child understands what they are signing. I want to
ensure that we will not take parents to court just because they are
under the influence of drugs, when there is a perfectly adequate set of
grandparents who can sign the agreement for
them.</div><a name="10012857000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000284"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I can reassure my hon. Friend on that point. The
people who sign the home-school agreement have parental responsibility
for the child or young person, but a parenting order is the last step;
before that, there would be a parenting contract. The court does not
have to grant a parenting order because somebody has not signed a
home-school agreement.</div>
<a name="10012857000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">One would
expect the circumstances that my hon. Friend describes to be dealt with
in other ways. If parents are under the influence of drugs and
therefore are not caring for their child, one would expect that
grandparents to step in and all sorts of other things would
happen.</div>
<a name="10012857000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">This measure
is not about trying to penalise those people who are trying to deal
with difficult circumstances and who are trying to bring up their
children properly. It is about trying to deal with people who are
wilfully not seeking to work with a school to improve standards of
behaviour and support the ethos of the
school.</div><a name="10012857000088"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000286"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am listening very carefully to the
exchanges, but the debate is getting very wide of the
amendment.</div>
<a name="10012857000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000287"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I hope that my question is related to the amendment,
Mr. Amess. The amendment covers what happens if the
home-school agreement is not signed. My assumption is that these
measures are in the Bill to try to give home-school agreements greater
enforceability, through the requirement for a parent&#146;s
signature. However, the problem is that the Minister implies that, if
people do not bother to sign the agreement, it makes no difference to
the ability to enforce the agreement. Will the parent&#146;s
supposedly compulsory or semi-compulsory signature improve the
enforceability of home-school agreements, compared with the present
situation?</div>
<a name="10012857000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000288"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Of course it will and the expectation is that the
vast majority of parents will sign and that schools will work closely
with parents who will not sign. There might be different reasons why
some people do not sign, but the home-school agreement has been broadly
welcomed. Everywhere I go, head teachers, teachers and parents of
pupils who sign the agreement welcome the fact that an attempt is being
made to try to deal with parents who do not sign, not for the reasons
mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, regarding those who have mental health
problems or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley mentioned,
issues with alcohol or drug addiction, but because they
refuse to work with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>the school or seek to undermine the school&#146;s ethos. We are trying
to make available a measure to deal with that
problem.</div><a name="10012857000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012857000289"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): I am grateful
to the Minister for giving way. This is the first time I have
intervened in this Committee, and, rather than go another day without
appearing in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, I would like to ask how the important
question of parental responsibility will apply to children in care.
Will the placing authority be responsible for signing the contract for
the child? Will it be a foster carer if the child is in foster care? In
special guardianship orders, who will have the ultimate responsibility
to sign and maintain the
agreement?</div><a name="10012857000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000290"></a>Mr.

that has responsibility for the child.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000291"></a>Tim

guardianship?</div><a name="10012857000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000292"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Whoever has the parental, day-to-day
responsibility for the young person will be responsible for the
agreement. If that is not correct, I will correct myself in due
course.</div>
<a name="10012857000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that the amendments are well intentioned, but they would have
unintended consequences, so I ask the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton to withdraw
them.</div><a name="10012857000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000293"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> This has been an illuminating debate, but, the
Minister has not answered the key question that is in the White Paper.
It states that during the application
process,</div><a name="10012857000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all
parents will receive each school&#146;s behaviour policy as it will
appear in their home-school agreement. In applying for a school place
every parent will now agree to adhere to these
rules.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot see the distinction between what it says in the White Paper and
amendments 39 and 43, which simply say that unless a parent signs the
home-school agreement their child will not be admitted to the school. I
do not see the difference between that and a school uniform policy that
says that unless the child turns up in school uniform, according to the
school rules, they will not be admitted to the school. Schools have
those rules, and they need to be obeyed by parents and the pupils
attending the school. The amendments shift the balance back to the head
teacher and teachers. The power to instil good behaviour and the ethos
of the school should rest with the head teacher and
teachers.</div><a name="10012857000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the past 10 to 20 years, for all kinds of reasons, that power has
shifted from the head teacher and teachers, particularly in schools
serving the most deprived and challenging parts of our country. The
amendment, which reflects a wider Conservative approach to education
policy, will help schools in the most challenging areas the most, as
they, generally speaking, have the poorest behaviour policies, which
let down children in those schools to a greater extent&#151;although
I could give examples of schools in leafy suburbs that have equally or
more difficult behaviour

the past 10 to 15 years, the number of permanent exclusions has
gradually declined, but the number of repeat suspensions has increased
alarmingly. There are now almost 14,000 children a year who are
suspended from school five or more times in a single year. Those
children are not being helped&#151;they are not
receiving  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>specialist help. All that is happening to them is that they are spending
five or six days roaming the streets before going back to the school
and repeating poor
behaviour.</div><a name="10012857000101"></a>

guardian appointed by the court signs. Under all circumstances, the
person with parental responsibility signs the home-school agreement.

want to become involved in issuing parenting orders and parenting
contracts wholesale in the courts. The reality is that the provision
will not be used if it gets on to the statute book, so we will be in
the same position as we are now. Given the importance of the issue, I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000312"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Amendment 40 would make it clear in the Bill that
pupil and parent guarantees are not intended to create legal
obligations that can be enforced in the courts under tort or breach of
contract. The amendment&#146;s wording is lifted from section 111(6)
of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which was
Labour&#146;s first key education legislation after the 1997
election. Subsection (6) prevented home-school agreements from being
enforceable in the courts, and it makes sense to add such a provision
to the clause that introduces pupil and parent guarantees.</div>
<a name="10012857000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The biggest
fear of all the critics of pupil and parent guarantees is that people
will end up in the courts. One union, the Association of School and
College Leaders, said in its brief to the Committee:</div>
<a name="10012857000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#148;ASCL
believes that the creation of these guarantees will open the flood
gates for increased litigation against
schools.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Union of Teachers told us:</div>
<a name="10012857000216"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;NUT
head teachers are concerned that without adequate resources or
provision for staff training these proposals may leave schools
vulnerable to litigious parents or over-eager lawyers who have
misinterpreted the Government&#146;s intentions. The NUT is concerned
that any breaches of the guarantees should not be treated as akin to
breaches of statutory duty in the health and safety sphere granting
persons distinct rights to legal action and monetary
compensation.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

<a name="10012857000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
118 and 119 would direct complaints about the school under the pupil
and parent guarantees to the governing body. When I complain about a
service provided to me it is the board of directors of the company to
whom I ultimately complain, and the amendment parallels that approach
and would avoid the consumption of vast amounts of head
teachers&#146; and courts&#146;
time.</div><a name="10012857000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000313"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Having had to diverge from the views of the hon.
Gentleman on the previous group of amendments, I am pleased to say that
I am back on side with him on the present group, many of which were
tabled by Liberal Democrat Members. We are very concerned about the
complaints mechanisms that will be established as a consequence of
clause 3.</div>
<a name="10012857000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has quoted many of the observations of professional bodies
and teaching unions about clause 3 and the powers given under clause 1.
He will be pleased to know that I was going to use exactly the same
quotations. However, in his brief speech he missed out the contribution
of the Local Government Association, which gives me something to say,
because it is very concerned about the proposed complaints mechanism.
It said that the proposals</div>
<a name="10012857000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will create an
extensive system of rights of appeals for parents and pupils against
head teachers, governing bodies and local councils if they feel they
have not complied with the requirements of the
guarantees.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continued:</div><a name="10012857000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
LGA would like to be assured that these rights will actually help
schools improve and will not just create unnecessary additional burdens
for schools and
councils.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes so far as to say it would like the removal of subsection (2),
right to the end of the clause, and has explicitly supported amendments
118, 119, 156 and 177. I think that the last of those is not in the
group.</div><a name="10012857000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth stepping back for a second and thinking about the complaints
mechanisms for parents. A parent or pupil who is concerned about
whether the guarantees are being observed by a school will presumably
be able to complain to the class teacher, as the first point of
contact, and then to the head teacher about the same issue, if they
feel that their concerns have not been dealt with.</div>
<a name="10012857000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">If they are
not happy with the head teacher&#146;s response they will be able to
complain to the governing body. If they are not satisfied with its
response they can presumably 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>still exercise a right to go to the local authority, if the school in
question is under its strategic oversight. If they are not satisfied
with the response of the local authority they will, under the new
proposals, be able to go to the local government ombudsman. If the
ombudsman supports the parents and pupil but is not successful in
securing from the school the changes they desire, there will be a
further potential appeal to the Secretary of State, who may then
underpin the recommendation of the ombudsman. In addition to all that
there is the potential threat of legal
action.</div><a name="10012857000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are six or seven potential layers of complaint. We all want complaint
mechanisms for people who use and depend on public services and who
feel that they are getting a raw deal. It is right that there should be
complaint mechanisms; it would be wrong to assume that we should have a
take-it-or-leave-it system of public services where people cannot do
anything about poor quality of service. However, there must be some
balance and proportionality. To have six or seven layers of appeal is
hugely time-consuming and potentially expensive, and there is a worry
that the new complaint mechanisms might make vexatious complaints
difficult to palm
off.</div><a name="10012857000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister and I had this debate in the context of the last education
Act, so I will not rehearse it entirely, but I suggest that the
standards of evidence collection likely to be required by an ombudsman
service and the extent of ombudsmen&#146;s inquiries into complaints
are of a different order of magnitude and involve much less discretion
than the complaint mechanisms of schools, head teachers, governing
bodies and local authorities.</div>
<a name="10012857000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not say
that the idea has no value, because many people clearly feel that their
complaints are not taken seriously at &#147;lower&#148; levels, but
considerable bureaucracy and cost will be involved. Schools will be
extremely nervous at the prospect of having complaints investigated by
an ombudsman and will feel compelled to collect much more evidence to
show that they have attempted to deliver the guarantees, which are
often vaguely phrased, making it difficult to prove that they have been
met. The prospect of being taken to court will be an even greater
concern.</div><a name="10012857000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
that could make schools extremely cautious and could lead them to keep
vast amounts of records and documentation, try to anticipate potential
problems and complaints early on and spend a lot of their time fending
them off or preparing to do so. The proposed complaints mechanism could
run out of control and prove counter-productive for schools, parents
and pupils, the vast majority of whom will
probably not need to use it.</div>
<a name="10012857000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would prevent complaints about pupil and parent guarantees
from moving up to higher levels. We do not want them to go to the local
government ombudsman. We expressed concern during debate on the last
education Bill about involving the local government ombudsman in school
complaints, and we opposed measures to do so. We do not want these
complaints to go to the local government ombudsman either. We think
that in many cases, the ombudsman will struggle to understand what the
guarantees are and establish meaningfully whether they have been met.
We certainly do not want vexatious complaints to be pursued. I am sure
that the Minister will agree with that; I hope that he will agree to
put it on the face of the Bill, because it would reassure many
people.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div><a name="10012857000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000314"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will restate this in my remarks, but it is
already in legislation that the local government ombudsman has the
power not to hear complaints that he considers vexatious, so we do not
need to put it in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="10012857000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000315"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. He has reminded me
that the same issue arose when we debated the Apprenticeships, Skills,
Children and Learning Bill. I need to reflect whether it needs
underlining in this part of the Bill. I think that people would be
reassured by it, but they will also be grateful to hear from the
Minister that the previous Bill covers the issue.</div>
<a name="10012857000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also seek to deal with the potential for court challenges. I
am not sure whether that is what the Government want, but we need to be
clear about it. Amendment 40 would make that clear, as would amendment
154 by removing the potential for appeals going to higher levels.
Amendment 128 would have a similar effect. Amendment 118, which we and
the Local Government Association support, is a Conservative amendment
and would also achieve that result, as would amendments 119 and
129.</div>
<a name="10012857000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 156
is supported by the Local Government Association. It would give the
local government ombudsman greater flexibility when deciding which
complaints to pursue relating to the pupil and parent guarantees. It
would allow him not to pursue complaints that he regarded as
unreasonable or
vexatious.</div><a name="10012857000228"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10012857000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification, because I
cannot remember whether the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and
Learning Act 2009 covers unreasonable as well as vexatious behaviour.
There is clearly a difference between the two and, given our concerns
about the way in which complaints may multiply under the new system and
the cost, we want the widest possible flexibility for the ombudsman not
to have to pursue complaints that fall into those
categories.</div><a name="10012857000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 181 would ensure that any investigations into complaints
about the pupil and parent guarantees would be required to consider the
resources available to local schools and the local authorities in
question, and would prevent complaints from leading to monetary
compensation. Both matters are important, and it would be sensible if
the ombudsman, the courts and any other bodies involved could take into
account the practical ability of schools to deliver on some of the
guarantees that the Government have already planned to put in
place&#151;of course, the guarantees could change in the future. It
is possible that a Government might get carried away with the guarantee
concept, if it were successfully implemented under the Bill, and could
then put in place all sorts of proposals that it might not be possible
to fund, particularly if the school budgets are cut by a future
Government. Many people would therefore welcome such
reassurance.</div><a name="10012857000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000316"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I shall first comment on the debate and follow
that with an
explanation.</div><a name="10012857000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the sentiments of the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton and for Yeovil. None of us wants the sort of problems to
occur for head teachers, schools or local authorities that they have
outlined, whatever our view about the necessity for guarantees and
whether they are good or a bad thing. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>We do not want to create the problems to which both hon. Gentlemen have
alluded. I will reflect on the points made, but I ask the hon.
Gentlemen not to press the amendments. I have put on record that we
will look at the issue and see whether we need to deal with the points
more
directly.</div><a name="10012857000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000317"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The amendments raise a range of different issues
from vexatious complaints to the complexity of the ombudsman making
judgments. Will the Minister explain which parts of the amendments he
feels more and less sympathetic to? As he has said, the ASCL Act
already includes the ombudsman mechanisms, so I assume that he is not
planning to delete that in respect of the
guarantees.</div>
<a name="10012857000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000318"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Not necessarily. I want to answer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the ASCL Act, but I cannot do that
during this sitting because I need to go away and properly reflect on
it. He made a reasonable point when he asked whether the ASCL Act, as
currently drafted, includes the word &#147;unreasonable&#148;.
Luckily, I have the Act with me and it does not mention the word
&#147;unreasonable&#148;. It states:</div>
<a name="10012857000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
Local Commissioner may in particular decide not to investigate a
complaint...if satisfied that the complaint is
vexatious.&#148;</div><a name="10012857000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will need legal advice on any difference that adding the word
&#147;unreasonable&#148; would make. However, I have heard what he
has said and I have also taken on board the points made by the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I need to reflect on them,
take advice and then come back, if necessary, with the reassurances
that the hon. Gentlemen seek. The Government might need to clarify the
position to prevent the problems highlighted by Opposition Members,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000319"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Is it the Minister&#146;s view that the guarantees
in clause 1 will not create any obligation or liability in tort or
contract that could be challenged in
court?</div><a name="10012857000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000320"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Yes; the legal advice that I have been given is
that that is the case.</div>
<a name="10012857000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not
normally do this, but because this is a legal argument, I shall read my
script, as it is important to ensure that there is clarity. My
statement will answer one or two of the points made by the hon.
Gentleman in respect of contractual obligations, and by the hon. Member
for Yeovil in respect of compensation. I put it in context, not only
because it will answer the questions, but because it is extremely
important for those who read our deliberations. Before reading this
statement, I want to say that I have taken on board the comments made
by both hon. Gentlemen. I will reflect on them and, if necessary, we
will make changes to the Bill on Report. I wish to take proper account
of their points and ensure that the situation is clear.</div>
<a name="10012857000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guarantee
document does not create a contract between parents or pupils and the
school, because it is a public law document. Guarantee documents can
impose public law duties on local authorities, governing bodies and
head teachers. A redress mechanism for breach is contained in the Bill.
The Bill is not intended to create private law rights on which parents
or pupils could sue. The guarantees do not affect existing common law
duties.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div><a name="10012857000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guarantees
create public law benefits as part of the education system. We consider
it extremely unlikely that they would create the kind of rights that
parents or pupils could use to claim compensation through the courts.
The courts would regard these as public law entitlements. It must be
remembered that quite a number of them are already statutory
duties.</div><a name="10012857000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the entitlements contained in the document are pre-existing and
could, in theory, already be the subject of litigation. Some of them
are the subject of complaints to the Secretary of State, but the
Secretary of State is not judicially reviewed by these parents.
Judicial review might be available for breaches of mandatory duties
imposed by the document, or against the local government ombudsman, but
that would be expensive, and the vast majority of parents do not do
that now. The existence of a redress mechanism makes that less likely,
not more. Any public law duty could in theory give rise to litigation,
but rarely does so in practice. The guarantees are no different from
any other duties imposed by
legislation.</div><a name="10012857000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would challenge or amend the system of redress available
beyond the individual school level. Clause 3, to which the majority of
the amendments relate, provides for the system of redress that supports
pupil and parent guarantees by putting the guarantees within the scope
of the parental complaints service created under the Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. If pupils are not receiving
their clearly defined entitlements, and if that cannot be resolved with
the school or other provider, we believe that it is right to have a
straightforward route of redress. A guarantee without the possibility
of redress is no guarantee at all.</div>
<a name="10012857000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 40
would ensure that the guarantees would not form a contractual
relationship between schools and their pupils and parents that would
enable parents to take action in the courts, and would not otherwise
expose schools and local authorities to civil claims such as for breach
of statutory duty. As I said, I am pleased to agree with the sentiment
behind the amendment, and I make it clear that it is not the
Government&#146;s intention for the guarantees to create new
obligations that might lead to parents or pupils suing in the county
courts.</div><a name="10012857000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill, together with the ASCL Act, sets out a clear route for pupils and
parents to seek redress through the local government ombudsman for the
failure of a school to deliver the guarantee; or, for academies,
through the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency. Rather than seeking
to encourage litigation of any sort, the provisions intend the
opposite. They offer a mechanism for redress that keeps such matters
out of the
courts.</div><a name="10012857000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents
and pupils are unlikely to want, or be advised, to take public law
claims to judicial review when they have such a mechanism, even in the
limited circumstances where that might be available. I confirm that the
guarantees will not lead to contractual relations between schools and
parents that could found claims. In our judgment, it is exceedingly
unlikely that any other claim would arise in tort, in the absence of a
pre-existing duty of care. On that basis, we consider the amendment to
be
unnecessary.</div><a name="10012857000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
154 would remove the system of redress that supports the pupil and
parent guarantees. It would also prevent parents from complaining to
the Secretary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>of State, which they currently have the option of doing, or taking a
case to court if they believed that a duty outlined in the guarantees
document had not been fulfilled. Our expectation is that schools and
local authorities will take seriously their legal responsibilities to
deliver the guarantees. We expect that almost all complaints under the
guarantees will be resolved at school level, as at
present.</div><a name="10012857000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the role of the LGO and the YPLA in the case of academies provides a
final, transparent point of redress where the pupil or parent does not
receive that to which they are entitled. That form of redress places
the guarantees firmly within the scope of the parental complaints
service created by the ASCL Act. The ombudsman&#146;s powers work
effectively as he deals with local authorities at present, and he will
bring those powers and knowledge to the schools sector. He will have
the power to investigate complaints, to report and to make
recommendations in cases in which he believes that there has been
injustice resulting from a failure by the head teacher, governing body
or local authority to comply with the requirements of the guarantees.
Even if the amendment were passed, parents and pupils would still be
able to complain to the LGO about acts of governing bodies by virtue of
the existing ASCL
Act.</div><a name="10012857000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
consider it unlikely that parents will take a litigious route with
their complaints, even when that might be possible. Even when judicial
review might in principle be available, it would be unlikely that the
time or expense would be justifiable. As I have said, the guarantees
will not create contractual relations between schools and parents that
found
claims.</div><a name="10012857000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
156 relates to vexatious complaints. In considering any complaint, the
ombudsman will think carefully about whether an individual has
genuinely suffered an injustice before taking action and whether there
is merit in the complaint. In fact, the ombudsman already has the
ability, under section 207(5) of the ASCL Act, to decline to
investigate or to discontinue an investigation into a vexatious
complaint, or one on which the governing body has satisfied the LGO of
its proposed action. Therefore the amendment is unnecessary, but as I
have said, I will consider the issue again in the light of the comments
that the hon. Member for Yeovil has made. The ombudsman himself is
clear that he will investigate cases only if he believes that there has
been an injustice to an individual, and he has processes in place to
ensure that over-persistent complainants are identified and are not
allowed to tie up his or others&#146; resources
indefinitely.</div><a name="10012857000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
128 and 118 would prevent parents from escalating complaints about a
head teacher to the LGO under the ASCL Act, meaning that they could not
seek redress with anyone beyond the school&#146;s governing body. The
only exception would be where a head teacher&#146;s action was
already prescribed for the purposes of the parental complaints system.
Pupils and parents need to be able to make effective complaints that
relate to a head teacher, because a number of the guarantees relate to
parts of education where the duties fall on the head teacher rather
than on governors. Those include guarantee 3.5, which
entitles every secondary pupil to a personal tutor, and the guarantees
about the introduction of the new home-school
agreements.</div><a name="10012857000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way in which schools handle complaints is also relevant. Complaints in
most cases start with the child&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>teacher, personal tutor or subject head, and they will then be escalated
to the head teacher before reaching the governing body. The governing
body will make a judgment about whether the school, including the head
teacher, has complied with the guarantee. A school&#146;s head
teacher is the leader of that organisation and a vital decision maker
in the way in which complaints are handled. We must not discount the
contributions that heads make by excluding them from the
guarantees.</div><a name="10012857000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
118 would provide that complaints about the head teacher should be
handled by the governing body&#151;we endorse that view. School
governing bodies have a vital role in handling complaints, and we will
encourage the development of a link governor for handling complaints.
We have put on record a number of times that our expectation is that
most complaints under the guarantees will be resolved at school
level.</div><a name="10012857000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
119 and 129 would leave out clause 3(2), leaving a gap in
the ombudsman&#146;s power to investigate complaints from pupils and
parents about local authorities. Subsection (2) is essential for
ensuring that there are no gaps or anomalies in the way in which pupil
and parent guarantees operate. It amends the Local Government Act 1974
so that pupils and parents will be able to make complaints about local
authorities in connection with the guarantees. The subsection expands
the powers that the LGO has had since 1974 to investigate acts of the
local
authority.</div><a name="10012857000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
119 would further omit subsections (3) to (5). These subsections
restrict the operation of the Secretary of State&#146;s
direction-making powers so as to prevent the Secretary of State from
giving a direction to a local authority on the basis of a breach of a
guarantee, unless a complaint has first been made to and disposed of by
the ombudsman, or the circumstances are such that the Secretary of
State considers it appropriate to give a direction without the process
being followed.</div>
<a name="10012857000229"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="10012857000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the sake of simplicity, clarity and efficiency, there should be a
single route of redress for pupils and parents to follow when they have
a complaint, and that should be through the local government ombudsman.
Subsections (3) to (5) will avoid the possibility of the Secretary of
State being asked to determine complaints about the guarantees or,
worse still, being asked to do so at the same time as the LGO. By
omitting subsections (3) to (5), which would remove any qualification
on the Secretary of State&#146;s direction-making powers, amendment
119 would open the way to
confusion.</div><a name="10012857000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first provision in amendment 181 would reduce the strength of the pupil
and parent guarantees so that all decisions arising from complaints
relating to the guarantees would be subject to considerations about
resources. That would dilute the mandatory effect of the individual
guarantees. Where we have specified that governing bodies, head
teachers or local authorities &#147;must&#148; do something, it is
because we believe the actions ought to be an entitlement for every
pupil or parent, not just the ones in schools that choose to honour the
guarantees. Having said that, we believe that schools should have
flexibility in the way in which they allocate their resources and
organise themselves to provide for their pupils, and the pupil and
parent guarantees are framed with that in mind.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div><a name="10012857000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
provision in amendment 181 relates to an important point made by both
the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. It
sets out that pupils and parents would not have a right to monetary
compensation if there was a failure by a governing body, head teacher
or local authority to comply with any element of the pupil and parent
guarantee. The ASCL Act does not include a right for the ombudsman to
award financial compensation in relation to the acts of head teachers
and governing bodies, and that is therefore also true for the
guarantees. However, the ombudsman has a long-standing power to require
local authorities to provide financial compensation, and he would be
able to do so in relation to a breach of any of the guarantees when it
is the local authority&#146;s responsibility to deliver. We expect
the ombudsman to be sensitive in the way in which he uses that power,
but it would be inconsistent if the ombudsman did not have the power to
require local authorities to award financial redress for an issue
relating to a guarantee when he did in all other matters. For the local
authorities, there is an existing
power.</div><a name="10012857000186"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000321"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> This is very interesting, because the Minister is
effectively saying that he expects there to be awards of monetary
compensation for breaches of the guarantee from time to
time.</div><a name="10012857000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000322"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am saying that the local government ombudsman
has the power to require compensation as legislation currently stands.
That power simply continues. The LGO&#146;s existing power with
respect to local authorities does not apply to schools or governing
bodies, and we do not intend to give the LGO that power under the
Bill.</div><a name="10012857000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000323"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Ah. Will the Minister clarify his second point? I
thought that he said that the power already exists and will continue to
do so. Will he confirm that the power will continue in so far as the
guarantees are concerned? If monetary compensation can be awarded
against a school for breaching one of the guarantees, will he issue
revised guidance in relation to the financial management of schools
stating that schools would need to consider whether, if the measure
goes on to the statute book, they would need to make provision in their
accounts for the possibility of having to pay out compensation awarded
against
them?</div><a name="10012857000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000324"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The situation is that the LGO has a power to order
the payment of compensation by local authorities relating to their
remit, which he has had since 1974. The ASCL Act, however, does not
allow him to use that power for schools. We took the view that schools
should not be subject to financial
penalties.</div><a name="10012857000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000325"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister is being extremely helpful, and I
understand his point. Will he clarify, in relation to the guarantees,
which aspects of the existing proposed guarantees the Government think
are the responsibility of local authorities, and therefore on which
compensation might end up being paid?</div>
<a name="10012857000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000326"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> One-to-one tuition might be a particular
guarantee, but I will return to the hon. Gentleman after checking some
of the specifics. The principle is that where the local authority is
responsible for ensuring that something is provided under a guarantee,
the local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>government ombudsman has the power to go down the compensation route,
but he does not have that power with respect to schools, and we do not
intend to give him that power.</div>
<a name="10012857000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
conclude my speech now. I am sorry to have taken such a laborious
route, but I hope that the Committee will understand why, given that a
lot of what we have been discussing is legal, technical and extremely
important. I have just been informed that the provider of last resort
for one-to-one tuition is the local authority. In that sense, there is
an obligation, so I was correct, even if the hon. Member for Yeovil
does not agree. In the light of what I have said, I would ask hon.
Members not to press their amendments.</div>
<a name="10012857000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000327"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful reply
and conciliatory tone. My colleagues and I will certainly not press our
amendments, given that he has undertaken to look at some of these
matters. However, I am aware that he has signalled an intention to look
at certain issues and not others, and I fear that we might need to
bring back some of the substantive amendments.</div>
<a name="10012857000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the Minister does not want the guarantees to be
legally enforceable, that he does not want vexatious complaints to be
pursued, and that he is considering whether unreasonable complaints
might also not have to be pursued. His comments on those issues were
helpful. However, he is giving no ground on the proposals in amendments
118 and 119 to exempt guarantees from the local government ombudsman
process. We still have considerable concerns about that, because the
ombudsman is not qualified to enforce and oversee guarantees,
particularly when they are so vaguely defined. That is what we are most
concerned about, because we believe that the process could be expensive
and bureaucratic.</div>
<a name="10012857000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
disappointed that the Minister gave no indication that he has
considered the fact that we have to see the guarantees in the context
of available resources. If a future Government cut education funding
but were not willing explicitly to drop the guarantees, because that
would be politically embarrassing, schools and local authorities might
be obliged to deliver guarantees because of the potential penalties
against them, but without the money to do so. Surely that would not be
fair.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div><a name="10012857000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
regard&#151;this is my last point&#151;I was relieved for a while
that there would potentially be no monetary compensation awards against
schools, which would be even more serious if schools did not have the
resources to deliver the guarantees. However, I was worried when the
Minister said that what is in many ways the most important
guarantee&#151;the one-to-one tuition guarantee, which is surely most
closely linked to funding&#151;will be enforceable against local
authorities, even though a lot of the money will presumably be
disbursed directly to schools. I think that that will also worry local
authorities, given the spectre over the next few years of considerable
cutbacks that might mean that authorities do not have the resources to
implement some of the guarantees. I say that particularly in light of
the potential change of Government.</div>
<a name="10012857000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this
stage, however, my colleagues and I will not press our amendments. We
are grateful for some of the Minister&#146;s conciliatory
indications, but some of our biggest concerns are still in our minds,
and we will need to return to them on
Report.</div>
<a name="10012857000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012857000328"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I was pleased that the Minister started by saying
that he agreed with the sentiments behind the amendments that my
colleagues and I tabled, as well as those tabled by the hon. Member for
Yeovil. I was also pleased when he said that he would reflect on what
has been said.</div>
<a name="10012857000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that the guarantee document was a public law document and that its
redress mechanism was contained in the Bill. As such, he said that it
did not, in his opinion, give rise to private law rights. He then said
that he would confirm that guarantees would not lead to contractual
obligations. However, he also said that they were unlikely to lead to
liabilities in tort. We therefore need explicit reassurance,
confirmation and clarification in the Bill that the guarantees in
clause 1 will not lead to such liabilities. The same issues apply to
the home-school agreements introduced by the School Standards and
Framework Act 1998. Given that it was felt in 1998 that there was an
advantage&#151;</div><a name="10012857000230"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
