                           </span> Good afternoon, Mr
Caton. It is a pleasure to be back in business talking about the
non-business use of business assets. Clause 19 has a series of reforms
to tax law, which are complex and important in their impact.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It might be
relevant to note that as we stand here talking about the Lennartz
accounting procedure in respect of value added tax and other changes,
my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn, who would normally be here
considering these particular measures, is on his feet in the Chamber
talking about the Government’s proposal to remove vital money
from pregnant women as they try their best to stay healthy. It is a
shameful measure. Unfortunately, I am unable to attend the Chamber.
However, I know that my colleagues on the Labour Front Bench are aware
of my support as they valiantly try to rebut the worst excesses of the
Administration’s nasty policy
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause seeks to amend the Value Added Tax Act 1994 to
implement a set of changes that have become necessary as a result of
European Union legislation in the form of technical directives.
Government Members are always keen and punctilious when the European
Union speaks; they immediately legislate to correct British law as a
consequence. It is a hallmark of their politics and the clause is
understandable, given their attitude to the European
Union.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the clause, the current exemption, known as the Lennartz accounting
mechanism, removes taxpayers’ ability to reclaim VAT paid on
expenditure on land and property, such that it might be used for
non-business or private purposes. Under the arrangement set out in the
directive, the changes in the clause will remove the ability to use the
current Lennartz accounting arrangements for ships and
aircraft.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The use of
Lennartz accounting for those assets is replaced by the ability of the
taxpayer to adjust for subsequent changes in private use under the
capital goods scheme—a related minor change to other parts of
the 1994 Act—bringing the rules relating to the recovery of VAT
on directors’ accommodation into line with European Union law
and a set of other arrangements 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 110<a class="bkMark" name="Column110">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that followed the judgment of the European Court of Justice in 2007,
although I might be wrong on that. Perhaps the Minister can tell me
whether I have the year wrong in respect of those
judgments.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I understand it, the Lennartz arrangement enables a buyer to use assets
for both business and non-business purposes, and to claim the input tax
in full when the asset is purchased. It enables the buyer then to pay
an amount of output tax—VAT, in this case—to relate to
that non-business use at the point either of disposal or later, at a
given point in time.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
understanding of the European Court of Justice decision, which was
subsequently taken up in the EU Council directive, was that there was a
suggestion that the United Kingdom and Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs were not applying the arrangement correctly, that there was an
excessive use of the arrangement within the UK and that therefore a
change needed to be made to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members
of the Committee might not themselves have used a Lennartz arrangement
for their own business and non-business purposes. If that were the
case, I would have declared an interest. However, given that we are
talking about rather wealthy individuals—those who purchase
ships, aircraft or yachts—they might be more familiar with such
practices than certainly my constituents would be.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, it
is important that we take the opportunity to correct the lacuna that
might exist in the Bill. The clause probably attempts to do that, but
several other policy changes were highlighted in the discussion on the
directive that have given rise to an interesting set of questions. For
example, let us consider the extent to which many taxpayers were
wrongly allowed to use the Lennartz accounting arrangement and whether
the Bill ensures that, when those taxpayers choose not to unravel those
arrangements, there will be some obligation on them to continue to
account for VAT
thereafter.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
extent to which we should seek retrospectivity within our legislation
is something that I have raised before in Committee. I am interested to
know whether the Minister can explain the provisions in the clause that
seem to ensure that the obligation to make those payments has always
had effect, and that it should be treated as having always been in
place. What studies have been done about the effect of that particular
provision? Current legislation on the recovery of value added tax on a
director’s accommodation becomes redundant, for example, as the
directive and related European case law ensure that there is no
entitlement to VAT recovery on the private use of such accommodation. I
understand that the law in respect of those arrangements is due to be
amended under the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
assessment have the Minister’s officials made of the effect of
removing the Lennartz form of accounting for businesses that might be
affected by the change? There might be a difference in the case of
those individuals who seek to use that particular accounting device,
but then businesses might have a legitimate use for doing so. Has a
regulatory impact assessment been made of that particular change
because it could be both complex and burdensome for businesses making
such
changes?<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Has
the hon. Gentleman received many representations from external bodies
advocating this particular set of cases? Was it a product of a set of
tax working groups 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 111<a class="bkMark" name="Column111">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that he set up or was it the result of spontaneous representations from
particular interested parties? Is it the case that those taxpayers who
are not permitted to use that particular Lennartz accounting
arrangement will have the parallel freedoms to apportion their economic
or non-economic activities on the basis of use and intended use from
the date of this announcement, or are we restricting ourselves to the
Lennartz accounting arrangement? In other words, are there parallel
arrangements for a wider set of taxpayers who might not fall under that
particular definition of the Lennartz accounting
arrangements?<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
it is my understanding that the Treasury will consider claims from
taxpayers who have already entered into binding commitments for
projects on the understanding that the Lennartz accounting arrangement
will be available. Will the Minister say whether that is indeed the
case and tell us how HMRC might deal with the issue? I have made a
number of points, but in general we support the intentions behind
clause
19.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000036">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It
is a great pleasure, Mr Caton, to serve under your chairmanship once
again. Clause 19 implements part of the EU VAT technical directive. As
we have heard from the hon. Member for Nottingham East, for assets such
as land, property, ships and aircraft, it ensures that the taxpayer
reclaims VAT only to the extent that the asset is used for business
purposes. Schedule 8 protects revenue at risk following a European
Court of Justice decision.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By way of
background, I should say that currently a taxpayer can recover all the
VAT on the cost of an asset, even if the asset is used partly for
private purposes. Over subsequent years, the taxpayer pays VAT back to
the Exchequer in respect of its private use. That is known as Lennartz
accounting, from the ECJ case of the same name, which allowed VAT
recovery on private use of the asset.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Lennartz
accounting gives taxpayers a cash-flow benefit by allowing them to
claim all the VAT on the cost of the asset up front. Following
representations from a number of European member states, including the
UK, the technical directive was agreed. Lennartz accounting has been an
area in which there have been considerable changes over the past few
years, following high-profile ECJ decisions and a number of avoidance
issues. The UK therefore supported the case for change.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 19 and
schedule 8 will mean that, from 1 January next year,
up-front VAT recovery on the cost of land, property, ships and aircraft
will be limited to business use, with no recovery for private use. To
help ensure a fair recovery of VAT over the life of the asset, the
clause provides the basis for an adjustment mechanism to take account
of changes in use. That will also be implemented at the same time by
secondary legislation. HMRC has been working closely with external
stakeholders to design an adjustment mechanism that meets business
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
well as implementing the EU VAT technical directive, these changes also
protect revenue at risk following an ECJ decision—a Dutch case
known as VNLTO. I shall attempt to help the Committee by giving the
name in full: it is Vereniging Noordelijke Land—en Tuinbouw
Organisatie.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000041">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The answer is no. The hon. Gentleman will be aware
that that decision confirmed that many taxpayers in the UK have been
wrongly using Lennartz accounting. To ensure that taxpayers do not
attempt to use the decision unfairly, the changes ensure that those who
have already benefited from the up-front VAT recovery afforded by
Lennartz accounting continue to pay the VAT due back to the
Exchequer.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions, and I will try to deal with
them. First, he highlighted that part of this legislation is seen to be
retrospective. It is worth pointing out that the revenue protection
element of the legislation ensures that VAT due under existing Lennartz
accounting arrangements is protected and paid to the Exchequer. These
rules simply maintain the status quo and are deemed to have always been
in effect. That ensures that taxpayers who embarked on Lennartz
accounting arrangements before the change of policy in January 2010
continue to pay VAT that is due back to the Exchequer. Such taxpayers,
having benefited from generous VAT recovery, should not be able
unfairly to avoid paying VAT that would otherwise be due as a
consequence of the VNLTO case. To answer a point of information, I
should say that the decision in that case was delivered in 2009, while
the case was listed in 2007.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about how businesses will be affected, whether
there has been consultation on that matter and whether an impact
assessment has been prepared for the measure. HMRC has been consulting
on the detail of the changes, which will be contained in secondary
legislation. Until that detail has been finalised, it is not possible
to quantify costs and benefits and, therefore, to prepare an impact
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A full impact
assessment is expected to be published on the implementation of the
secondary legislation, which is likely to be made and laid in December.
HMRC has consulted us informally on the relevant part of the EU VAT
technical directive. There was general acceptance of the proposed
changes. HMRC continues to discuss the implementing regulations with
external stakeholders and the representative bodies. I understand that,
to date, there has been positive engagement and enthusiasm for
simplifying the rules for the new adjustment mechanism.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

pm<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000206">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
adjustment mechanism will cater for changes in business use over the
economic life of the asset, and, as I said, it will be introduced by
secondary legislation. It will operate as part of the existing capital
goods scheme, so taxpayers do not have to deal with two separate
adjustment mechanisms. That will ensure overall a fairer covering of
VAT on costs that take into account the use of the asset over the
economic
life.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
there is a minor related technical amendment, deleting current law on
VAT recovery for directors’ accommodation, which is now no
longer necessary as a result of the other changes in this measure.
Overall, clause 19 and schedule 8 ensure that VAT is recovered fairly
and only in respect of business use. I therefore urge the Committee to
allow the clause to stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000048">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>Clause 21 amends group 8 of schedule 8 to
the Value Added Tax Act 1994. The amendment changes the criteria for
zero-rating supplies of aircraft and associated supplies. We broadly
welcome the clause and have no problems with it, so we will not be
pushing the Committee to a Division.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">None the
less, I have some quick questions to ask the Minister to clarify a
couple of points. The current definition of a qualifying aircraft also
extends to supplies made to state institutions, and that is preserved.
What discussions has the Treasury had with suppliers of aircraft and of
parts and services for aircraft and aircraft operators as part of the
consultation on this piece of legislation? Has the Minister received
any representations from individuals on this issue? What assessment has
he made of the financial implications of this change for the aviation
sector in the United Kingdom as a whole?<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again, we
have no great difficulty with the clause. As has been indicated, we
are, through EU law, requiring zero-rating on supplies of aircraft used
by airlines operating for reward chiefly on international routes. The
relief extends to supplies of parts and equipment for such aircraft and
for certain services such as repair or maintenance. I wish to know
whether the Minister has had any representations and to hear from him
about the points I have made in discussing the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000060">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
21 makes changes to the conditions that must be met before supplies of
aircraft can be made at the zero rate of VAT. It also covers supplies

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
required to apply the zero rate of VAT to a number of supplies
connected with international transport, including supplies of aircraft
used by airlines operating for reward chiefly on international routes.
UK law applies the relief based on the aircraft’s weight and
design by way of a proxy for the EU criterion, rather than by direct
reference to the user of the aircraft. While that broadly achieves the
intention of EU law, as international carriers tend to operate large
aircraft, there is a mismatch at the edges. For example, purely
domestic airlines also benefit from the zero rate, provided that their
aircraft meet the weight
test.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Following
a challenge by the European Commission in 2008, the UK accepted that
its provisions were not in strict conformity with EU law and agreed to
amend the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
scope of the UK zero rate currently also includes supplies of aircraft
made to state institutions, such as the Ministry of Defence, as the
right hon. Gentleman has pointed out. The zero rate in respect of those
supplies remains unaffected by the proposed
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
there will in future be two categories of supply that might be
zero-rated: supplies of aircraft to airlines operating internationally,
regardless of the weight; and existing zero-rated supplies of aircraft
to state institutions. Although supplies to airlines operating chiefly
on domestic routes, to non-airline businesses for corporate use or to
individuals will now be standard rated, businesses normally entitled to
recover VAT will be able to recover the tax charge under the normal
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked about discussions with the industry and what
help it is being provided with to cope with the change. HMRC officials
met with industry representatives in August 2009 to discuss the
changes, followed by an informal consultation between 1 October and 30
November 2009, to establish the impact on the various parts of the
industry and to help determine workable solutions to any problems. In
May 2010, HMRC produced draft guidance that it shared with the
industry. Following feedback and a further meeting, revised guidance
was circulated to representative bodies in June
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
might also be worth highlighting that the measure is likely to affect a
limited number of supplies—to low hundreds of
businesses—as in most cases the status of the airline will be
self-evident, as most contracts are with regular
suppliers.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
industry would have preferred to maintain the status quo, but it
understands that the UK had no choice but to comply with the
Commission’s view. Consequently, we have progressed with the

same Act, restricting the scope of exemption to supplies of public
postal services and incidental goods made by a universal service
provider. The exemption will apply only to suppliers of services made
under a licence duty, including those pursuant to a licence duty if the
USP allows private postal operators access to its postal facilities. We
welcome legislation to amend the VAT exemption following the case of
TNT Post UK Ltd in the European Court of Justice. There is no
difference between us on this particular issue, but I want to ask the
Minister a number of
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Unlike
with the previous two clauses, which were passed without controversy
and on which I received no representations from the industry in my
capacity as an Opposition spokesman, I have received some comments from
bodies in connection with clause 22. It is important that we examine
those concerns, given that that is the purpose of such a Committee, and
that the Minister at least places on record his response to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The main
representation we have received is a note from the Chartered Institute
of Taxation, a copy of which I am sure the Minister will have seen. The
institute’s submission to HMRC at the time of the
consultation—the note is dated 3 September 2010—states
that it has concerns arising from the fact that the clause is too
widely drafted. It states that the clause
could<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“lead

the application of the
exemption.”<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
emphasises that it is only the terms that might impact on the ability
of firms other than the universal service provider to compete that are
taken into account. I would welcome the Minister’s response to
those
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the Chartered Institute of Taxation has raised the issue that disputes
could arise between taxpayers, who might take the view that a service
was freely negotiated, and the post office, which considers that it was
not and that it is therefore within the exemption. Again, it is
important that we consider that particular point, which is made in the
letter of 3 September from the Chartered Institute of Taxation. The
institute says that the emphasis should be on ensuring that the Bill is
as clear as possible. Although we have not tabled amendments to the
clause, this is an appropriate moment for the Minister to give clarity
on those particular points made by the Chartered Institute of
Taxation.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Aside
from the letter of 3 September sent to Ms Jane Hyde of HMRC, I would
welcome the Minister’s view about what impact assessment the
Treasury has carried out on the impact of the clause on Royal
Mail’s customers who are purchasing the relevant services and
will now have to pay VAT. That might be referred to in the
documentation, but given that I have been flitting between the Chamber
and Committee, I have not noticed whether that is the case. I would
welcome some consideration of whether a proper impact assessment has
been undertaken and what its outcome
was.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000077">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a speculative comment, because the House will shortly consider plans
on the full privatisation of Royal Mail, but I wish to clarify whether
the clause is fully provided for in the event of both Houses agreeing
to the further privatisation of Royal Mail in the future. Will the
clause have any impact on the current and future status of Royal
Mail?<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000078">&#160;</a>

sets out that a universal service provider is defined within the
meaning of the Postal Services Act 2000. I expect that that
Act will be changed as a result of the Postal Services Bill, which the
House will consider shortly. I want to clarify whether the clause and
any future changes to legislation will be compatible. Obviously, the
Opposition will take a very strong and robust view on the Postal
Services Bill. However, I wish to know what consideration the Minister
has given to the issue, because a number of matters relating to the
universal service provision, which is referred to in the clause,
require at least some consideration by him. I would welcome him
referring to the points raised in the letter I mentioned, as well as
his comments on the impact assessment and, indeed, on the Postal

                           </strong> As we have heard, clause 22 amends the existing VAT
legislation in relation to supplies of postal services by Royal Mail to
remove some of its services from exemption. It also amends the law
relating to zero-rated passenger transport services made by Royal Mail
by replacing an obsolete reference to the Post Office company. Royal
Mail, as the only public postal service provider in the UK, has
historically been eligible to exempt from VAT all its postal services,
including those provided by any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
However, postal services provided by other postal operators, both
before and after full deregulation of the postal sector in the UK on 1
January 2006, are liable to VAT at the standard
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Following
a challenge from one of Royal Mail’s competitors, the European
Court of Justice confirmed in April 2009 that Royal Mail, as the
operator providing the public postal service, is the only body in the
UK that is eligible to exempt postal services from VAT. In drawing that
conclusion, the Court recognised that many of Royal Mail’s
services are subject to regulatory conditions and requirements that
have been imposed only on Royal Mail under the terms of its licence,
and not on any other postal
operator.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000081">&#160;</a>

that TNT or Deutsche Post could take over the running of the Royal Mail

that have on the European Court of Justice’s judgment, and did
the Government take legal advice in advance of the Bill’s Second

                           </strong> The right hon. Member for Delyn also made several
points about the Postal Services Bill. I am sure that you will be
pleased to hear, Mr Caton, that I have no intention of opening a debate
on that Bill this evening. Many hon. Members will recall that Lord
Mandelson pushed forward such proposals not so long ago, albeit sadly
without achieving much. Provisions for the universal service provider
exist in other European member states, and there is an opportunity for
zero-rated arrangements in those areas. We anticipate that that will be
the case, even if there is a change in structure.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000084">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The matter is
not directly relevant to these changes, but there is no reason why the
clause could not be implemented in law. If there is a need to examine
the matter again, we will have to do that on a case-by-case basis,
depending on the circumstances and arrangements. However, for example,
there is no reason why the fact that VAT is not payable on stamps
should change where there is a universal service obligation on Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth pointing out that Royal Mail operates under a significantly
different legal regime from that of its competitors, but the European
Court of Justice ruled that the exemption does not apply to supplies
made by Royal Mail for which the terms have been individually
negotiated, or which can be dissociated from the service of the public
interest. The Court’s ruling means that the exemption for postal
services must be applied on a narrower basis, and the clause applies
that from 31 January 2011. That date reflects the need to regularise
the position as soon as possible while giving Royal Mail sufficient
time to make the necessary IT
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Most
of Royal Mail’s services will remain free of VAT, including
stamps and normal deliveries—so-called social mail—so
private individuals will be largely unaffected. Those services provided
by Royal Mail that are not subject to price and regulatory control in
the public interest, or which are individually negotiated, will become
liable to VAT at the standard rate. The principal services affected are
Parcelforce, door-to-door mail—that is unaddressed
mail—Mailroom and other contract services. The customers who
will be primarily affected will be those businesses and other bodies
that purchase the affected services from Royal Mail and are unable to
reclaim all the additional VAT incurred. The Government have consulted
Royal Mail, as the sole provider of the affected services, as well as
the Postal Services Commission and representatives of the private
postal
markets.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are mindful of the possible impact of proposed changes to
the regulatory framework for postal services and have noted the
comments made in response to the consultation, including by private
operators. We will therefore review the VAT legislation in mid-2011, in
line with any changes being made to the regulatory framework, and take
action as appropriate to ensure that it supports the development of a
fully competitive postal services
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Delyn mentioned disputes arising over the
application of the exemption. We will consider those case by case, but
do not expect minor changes to affect the exemption. He also asked
whether the exemption was too widely drafted and whether it would be a
barrier to competition. VAT not being a barrier to competition is the
key to the development of the postal services industry. We will
continue to keep the VAT position under review as the regulatory
framework develops, as I have
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Retaining
certain services within the exemption, pending their deregulation by
the market regulator, is consistent with the court’s decision
and ensures that the VAT treatment does not give rise to any unwelcome
distortive
effects.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000090">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was asked whether there was an impact assessment—there is not.
It is normal practice to publish an impact assessment on significant
policy changes, but this is a

                           </div>unique set of circumstances, with essentially only one taxpayer directly
affected and having to incur compliance costs. As such, much of the
information on costs and qualitative impacts, if published, could be
directly attributed to Royal Mail. Such information is subject to
considerations of commercial confidence and taxpayer confidentiality.
The information that we could have published in an impact assessment
has been published elsewhere. For those reasons, no impact assessment
has been
published.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should like to say a word about Postbus. The clause also amends the law
relating to the zero-rating of passenger transport by Royal Mail to
replace an obsolete reference to the Post Office company with the
designation “universal service provider”. In practice,
zero-rating applies to Postbus, which is a rural bus service that Royal
Mail provides in conjunction with its postal services. The scope of the
zero rate remains unchanged as a result of the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the clause removes the zero-rating of some of Royal Mail’s
services, everyday use by private individuals will remain largely
unaffected. I hope that the Committee will support the

introduced by the Labour Government as a technical change to tackle tax
avoidance. I have no problems with the clause. I just want to test the

issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000099">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">First,
the proposal sets the taxation changes for substitution, to ensure that
long cigarettes are 8 cm long, rather than 9 cm, as in the 1979 Act.
Further changes set out in paragraph (1)(b) deal with each 3 cm portion
of the remainder of a cigarette being taxed at a different rate. Would
the Minister give us some idea why he chose those figures? The average
length of a cigarette, excluding the filter, is about 6 cm, so why was
8 cm chosen, rather than, say, 7 cm? I accept that there would be a
rise in taxation, but why did he choose 8 cm per cigarette? Why have 3
cm on top of the 8 cm, which effectively equates to another cigarette?
What criteria did the Treasury use? Why not 2 cm, or 4 cm? Those
figures represent material changes and differences on

that the measure was introduced by the previous Labour Government, and
I am pleased that the Minister has taken it up, because we were
concerned that people could effectively pay less tax on cigarettes.
Once the larger cigarettes are in the country, they could be removed to
form other cigarettes, which could then be sold on without tax having
been paid. The average length of a cigarette, excluding the filter, is
currently around 6 cm. The figure that was used previously was
9 cm, and the Minister has chosen 8 cm. He could have chosen
7 cm, so why did he choose 8 cm? A larger cigarette is in fact larger
than the average length of 6 cm, at 7 cm. What was the
rationale behind that

sure will the Minister in due course. I am talking about a
tax-avoidance measure. People were bringing into the country cigarettes
that were longer than the average size of 6 cm. That is a way of
avoiding tax, because they could bring in 12 cm cigarettes, cut them in
half and effectively have two cigarettes for every one for which they
had paid tax. The previous legislation, the Tobacco Products Duty Act
1979, gave the figure of 9 cm, which would equate to two cigarettes, so
if someone came in with a cigarette that was 10 cm long, it would be
taxed as two cigarettes, rather than one. The Bill will reduce the 9 cm
figure to 8 cm. If we are trying to prevent people from bringing in
more tobacco and claiming that it is one cigarette when in fact it can
be chopped down to make two, what is the rationale for choosing 8 cm,
rather than 7 cm, which is an alternative
figure?<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000107">&#160;</a>

the biggest problems with cigarettes is the tax differential. In the UK
they are taxed very highly, but in many places on the continent they
are taxed at a

man the border valiantly at Dover. Does he agree with me that the
border guardians, employed by the UK Border Agency, who do such a great
job in trying to stamp out smuggling, should be encouraged in their
jobs and that perhaps there should be less of a tax differential,
because it incentivises all the dreadful smuggling that goes
on?<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000108">&#160;</a>

                        </strong> I accept that the hon. Gentleman is speaking up
for his hard-working constituents. He makes an interesting point about
differential tax rates across the European Union, but that is not the
subject of today’s debate. The key point is that EU directive
95/59 obliges EU member states to supply a specific quantity-based duty
on cigarettes, levied at an amount per 1,000 cigarettes. A
tax-avoidance measure has come to light, and the Minister is
introducing a provision today to change that in cases where over-long
cigarettes are manufactured in the expectation that consumers will cut
them into two or more cigarettes before smoking them, because that has
the effect of halving the amount of duty
paid.

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have no objection to the tax-avoidance measure, but I would have tested
the Minister. I tried to table an amendment, but it was ruled out of
order because it raised the duty, quite rightly, by reducing the length
to 7 cm. Perhaps the Minister will give me a justification
for the figure of 8 cm, rather than 7 cm. Similarly, as I have
mentioned, clause 23(1)(b) states that each 3 cm portion of the
remainder of the cigarette shall be deemed an additional cigarette.
Again, if we are trying to avoid taxation, there is an argument to look
at reducing that figure further. The whole purpose is to ensure that
people pay duty on their 1,000 cigarettes at the agreed rate of duty.
If, for example, we reduced the 3 cm on top of the proposed 8 cm, to 2
cm, it would presumably have an impact. I am testing the Minister about
the justification for the figure of 3 cm as opposed to 2 cm or 4 cm. It
is important that the record shows the thinking behind that
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This may seem
a trivial point, but it is not. We are talking about the length of
cigarettes, but I would welcome a view about what happens to the width
of cigarettes. It is possible for duty to be levied on a cigarette that
is part of the 8 cm and 3 cm, and is within the 1,000 cigarettes that
form part of the taxation cohort. It would be possible for somebody,
should they so wish, to manufacture a cigarette that is twice as thick
as a normal cigarette, to disembowel that tobacco and reconstitute it
into 2,000 cigarettes from a 1,000 cohort brought into the country. If
taxation avoidance is the shared motivation behind the clause, I would
be interested to know what steps are being taken on the width of
cigarettes. Has the Minister given any consideration to that, as well
as to measures on the length of
cigarettes?<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000110">&#160;</a>

the Minister, a loophole could be found, whatever the response. You
have moved from halving the length of a cigarette to doubling its
width. If the demand is out there to do such things, surely whatever
law is passed and whatever definition is used, the legislation

                           </strong> That is an argument to do nothing and never to
take any tax-avoidance measures at all. I am simply saying to the
Minister that the legislation passed in 1979 sets out the length of a
cigarette in relation to duty. A cigarette of more than 9 cm would
qualify as two cigarettes for duty purposes. That is a way in which we
can look at importation for those who wish to bring in a 10 cm or 11 cm
cigarette, cut it in half and sell it as two cigarettes to people in
the community, thereby avoiding duty. Whatever our political
differences, we do not want to avoid taxation by back-door means. I
simply say to the Minister that the length is being reduced from 9 cm
to 8 cm and there could be an argument to tighten the measure further,
from 9 cm to 7 cm for example. Why is it 8 cm?<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

already said this, but I shall say it again for the sake of further
clarity and to ensure that we have a full debate on the matter. When we
add each 3 cm portion of the remainder of the cigarette, it will be
considered as a further cigarette. Why 3 cm and not 2 cm? If we are
looking at tax avoidance, I would have thought that the tighter the
regulation, the more opportunity there was to send a strong signal and
ensure that the appropriate duty is paid. With those few comments, I am
happy to hear what the Minister says.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000113">&#160;</a>

what many people think, the real price of cigarettes in the 21st
century is little different from what it was in the 1970s, because
living standards have risen. It is true, as one of my colleagues said
earlier, that taxation is relatively high here compared with taxation
by some of our European neighbours, but the price that people pay for
cigarettes in the UK relative to their disposable income is rather low
compared with the figure 30 or 40 years ago.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000115">&#160;</a>

to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover. I believe that
the focus of his comments was slightly wrong. I gave up smoking on
1 August, and I can tell the Committee that it is one of the
hardest things that I have ever done. Although the price of cigarettes,
and the level of tax, caused me to complain, it never stopped me buying
them. We must therefore be careful when saying that raising taxation
would help, because people make cutbacks elsewhere to feed their drug
habit—and that is exactly what it is. I detect from what the

the avoidance of tobacco duty. I hope that it will be some comfort to
my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol West to know that in last

smuggling. It is something that the Government take

                        <p class="tabbed">Those seeking
to avoid the element of tobacco duty applied specifically to the number
of cigarettes produce what are known as long cigarettes, which are
designed to be broken or cut into shorter sections by the smoker. The
final number of cigarettes is thus greater than the quantity used for
duty calculation purposes. We are aware that some brands of long
cigarettes are 8 cm or more in length. Under the new rules, they will
be classed as being four or more cigarettes. We therefore hope that the
legislation will be useful in that respect. Clause 23 will amend
legislation so that for cigarettes longer than 8 cm, excluding the
filter, each additional 3 cm will be treated as an additional cigarette
for the purposes of specific duty calculations. For example, a
cigarette of 12 cm would be treated as three
cigarettes.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000121">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Delyn asked what the reason was for those particular
measurements. We are amending legislation that dates back to 1979 to
ensure that UK legislation remains aligned with EU directive 95/59,
which itself has been amended and updated. This is an example of our
complying with European measures, and it is clearly important to
co-ordinate at a European level, for reasons that I do not need to go
into. Tobacco duty is an important contributor to the public finances.
It contributed approximately £9 billion in 2009-10, with
cigarette duty alone contributing approximately £8
billion.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000122">&#160;</a>

decision to include the measure in the Budget will help to protect
tobacco duty revenues. Almost all UK brands are unaffected, although
one or two businesses that manufacture or are niche importers of long
cigarette brands might be somewhat upset. Smoking is the single biggest
cause of preventable illness and early death in the UK, so tackling tax
avoidance with the measure will

the size parameters, the EU consulted relevant parties to decide the
definitions. Width is not currently an avoidance issue, with companies
making extra-wide cigarettes, because it is relatively easy to break up
long cigarettes, but not wide ones. I am sure that if we start to see

                           </strong> This is an important issue, but I will try to be
relatively brief. Clause 24 sets out the criteria for a range of issues
in relation to landfill tax, and to determining material to be subject
to a lower rate of that tax. My only complaint about the clause is that
it gives the Treasury considerable leeway in determining those issues.
Proposed new subsection 4 sets out the Treasury responsibilities in
determining which material is to be listed under the

is nothing at all about formal consultation with any interested parties
about what could be a major change to the Treasury’s
responsibilities. Amendment 10 proposes to add to the
proposed new subsection two new paragraphs, (d) and (e). All that we
are trying to do is to ensure that those who are interested are
formally consulted and that, post that period of consultation, we know,
collectively, what they have said.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000132">&#160;</a>

is, from my perspective, a probing one, about how much notice the
Treasury should give of the changes that it could make in the listing
of criteria for determination at a lower rate. The amendment states
that six months’ notice be given, but my interest in doing that
is to find out how much notice the Treasury intends to give if it does
make changes to the listing. We need clarity, so that changes will not
be made overnight that cause difficulty to those people whose daily
business—or indeed any other matters—will be affected by
the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000133">&#160;</a>

to worry that the Treasury might have wide-ranging powers that it can
do what it wishes with and not refer back to the House of Commons,
because those are important matters of state. However, we need to look
at them in detail. Clause 24(6), which I will read for the benefit of
the Committee,

simply says to the Treasury that it can go away and make any changes
that it likes because it considers the factors to be relevant. It does
not clarify what factors the Treasury might consider relevant, why the
Treasury have considered those factors to be relevant, and how people
who are affected by any changes the Treasury bring forward know that
those factors were relevant. It gives the Treasury a free hand to make
changes without reference to any other individual.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000135">&#160;</a>

                        <p>It
simply says that if the Treasury makes changes under subsection (6)
(b), it must, at the time of listing, publish what those factors are.
That is in the interest of transparency, so that the Treasury is not
accused of doing things in its dark recesses without consultation or
public transparency on those issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000137">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 24 brings greater clarity to the process by
which the Treasury determines the materials that receive the lower rate
of landfill tax. The Opposition amendments suggest yet further
transparency and clarity is needed, and furthermore suggest that
additional primary legislation is required to achieve that. However, as
the right hon. Member for Delyn is aware, the proposals on better tax
policy making that the Government published at the Budget make clear
that we are already committed to ensuring that all tax changes are
subject to a full process of consultation and scrutiny that goes well
beyond what the amendments would
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000139">&#160;</a>

applied to the Finance Bill, wherever secondary legislation makes a
substantive change to the tax code, including publishing the
legislation in draft for scrutiny; and to institute a minimum of four
weeks’ consultation on tax changes by secondary legislation.

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
10 seeks that the Treasury should consult interested parties and
publish their responses. I must emphasise that the clause we are
introducing is the result of a lengthy consultation process and itself
brings greater transparency to the process by which the materials
listed in the lower rate order are decided. Indeed, the changes that we
will make next year to the list of lower-rated wastes set out in the
Treasury order as a result of this clause and the publication of the
criteria are the first changes to the order in 14 years. The
Treasury’s decisions on the materials to be listed in the lower
rate order will not be taken in isolation, but will take into account
the advice and guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs, the devolved Administrations and the environment
agencies, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman is reassured by
those comments. Amendment 10 is therefore not
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000141">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
11 would require the Treasury to give six months’ notice before
any changes are made. The revised order will be laid before Parliament
before the end of 2010. The right hon. Gentleman asked specifically
about that. It will come into force on 1 April 2011. The landfill
industry is already well informed of the changes and laying the order
well in advance will give that industry the certainty that it requires.
The Government also intend to provide certainty on tax changes, and
therefore this amendment is not
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 14, which seeks to make public any factor that the Treasury
considers relevant when determining the materials to be listed, two
important points must be considered. First, the amendment supposes that
the clause, as it stands, gives undue scope to the Treasury to change
materials that are listed in the lower rate order, but that does not
fully understand the nature of the clause. The Committee should note
that the clause states that the Treasury is compelled first to have
regard to the published criteria under subsection (5) and then to two
other relevant factors. I reassure the Committee that it is not a
matter of giving the Treasury any real discretion when listing the
materials, but the arrangement will ensure that the criteria that we
publish, while providing greater clarity on how the lower rate is
decided, will not be unduly restrictive and prevent wider issues from
being taken into account. It provides for the possibility that other
indirect environmental or even non-environmental factors may become
important to delivery of the landfill tax’s primary objectives
in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
to address the fundamental issue raised by amendment 14, it is simply
not possible to publish every factor that the Treasury considers when
introducing a taxation change. Such decisions are made as part of the
normal Budget process, when all taxes can be taken into 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 126<a class="bkMark" name="Column126">&#160;</a>
                           </div>consideration as past of an overall fiscal judgment. Therefore,
amendment 14 is not necessary and not
practical.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, these amendments, although clearly tabled with the best of
intentions and rightly probing our thinking in this matter, would add
to the complexity of the tax codes. In addition, one of them is
technically deficient, and another would be unfeasible to fulfil in
practice. Moreover, they are unnecessary in the light of the more
efficient, overarching changes that we have publicly committed to make
to the entire tax policy making process. I therefore urge the right
hon. Gentleman to withdraw those
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000145">&#160;</a>

Caton, but I want to test the Minister still further. On
amendment 11, I have heard what the Minister has said about
orders being laid before the House and all those issues, but clause
24(1) gives the following powers to the
Treasury:<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>I
want it to be clear. When clause 24 states “from time to
time”, what notice will be given, not this time, but in future
times, in relation to any changes that are made? Will the Minister give
an indication of what the likely time scale will be for any changes
that are made under this wide-ranging clause, which gives the Minister
and the Treasury powers to make such changes, and how much notice will
be given? The reason that I have simply put “six months’
notice” is to test how long the Treasury will give in the event
of further changes being made by the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000148">&#160;</a>

confirming that he will withdraw his amendments. As to whether the
criteria that we have set out in the clause will be reviewed and
revised, we will look at that each year as part of the normal Budget
process. I would also highlight, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks,
the commitment the Government have made to greater consultation to
ensure that those affected by possible changes, whether in regulations
or primary legislation, receive proper notice of them. For example
there will be a minimum of four weeks’ consultation on tax
changes by secondary legislation. By raising these matters he has
enabled me to put on record our desire to ensure that we do not have
surprises for those people who will be affected by changes when
determining which material is subject to the lower rate, that there is
proper engagement with the industry and that there is an opportunity

                        <p class="tabbed">This
amendment is similar to the previous amendment. I picked 12 weeks as a
random figure to test how much notice will be given to those whose
daily lives will be substantially affected by the changes mentioned in
the clause. There was no indication in the Bill as to when or how these
changes could be brought forward. Subsection (2)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That
is a very big power. The Treasury may by order appoint any day it so
wishes. It could appoint a day by order with two weeks’ notice,
four weeks’ notice, six months’ notice, 12 months’
notice or whatever it wished to do. I wanted to probe the type of
notice the Treasury envisaged giving in relation to the changes that
are proposed, if agreed by both Houses, under this
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000157">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 19 specifies that any order to make
schedule 9 effective must allow 12 weeks’ notice. I appreciate
the concern that the right hon. Gentleman has raised and the desire to
ensure that HMRC provides adequate notice to taxpayers before making
the changes proposed by schedule 9 is entirely understandable. My
argument, however, is that the amendment is not necessary. Under
previous commitments made by Jane Kennedy, when she was Financial
Secretary during the 2008 Finance Bill debate, HMRC established a
practice of producing a draft appointed day order in advance of the
effective day where it is possible to do so. This practice has extended
to an appointed day order applying the harmonised interest rules to the
bank payroll tax, for example, and to several appointed day orders in
relation to penalties. These include penalties for incorrect returns
and failures to notify, as well as associated orders in relation to
national insurance contributions.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the
Committee will be well aware, HMRC publishes much of its draft
legislation for comment on its website. No adverse comments have been
received on any of these regulations. Furthermore, HMRC demonstrated
its commitment to continuing this process by publishing the draft order
for the late payment penalty regime for pay as you earn three months
before it became effective in April this year. I propose that this
practice continues for orders that will be made under the power given
in these
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
contrast to this tried and tested practice, one well used by the

made.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000160">&#160;</a>

the right hon. Gentleman’s thinking in raising the matter.
Given, however, that in amendment 19 he seeks to ensure that
HMRC provides sufficient notice of changes being made under the clause,

accessible manner, I ask him to withdraw his amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000161">&#160;</a>

amendment. Undoubtedly it is technically deficient, because in
opposition we do not have the resources of the Treasury. It is intended
to obtain an indication from the Minister of what level of notice would
be given, and of how that notice and changes under clause 25 would be
considered. I wanted him to state on the record that the changes will
be subject to a proper process that is understood by those outside the
House as well as by the massed ranks of the Treasury. On that basis, I

previous amendments. Before clause 26 is implemented, it

what circumstances he will advance the measures in the

ascertain what notice individuals will receive, how that notice will be
delivered by the appropriate authorities in the Treasury, and how that

what he has said before, but that will be worth while in order to put
it on the record for future discussions.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000170">&#160;</a>

find confusing. Within 12 months of Royal Assent, we would like a
formal review of the operations of the clause under the proposals in
amendment 18. Again, it is a testing amendment; I have received
representations from, among others, the Chartered Institute of
Taxation, which has

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am happy
for the Minister to outline to the Committee the reasons why he
believes that the provisions will not bear down on smaller businesses,
and to answer the concerns raised by the Chartered Institute of
Taxation. Alternatively, he can accept amendment 18 and agree to review
the situation after 12 months so that if problems are perceived with
the penalties charged and the effect on companies that have to pay, the
system can be examined and formally reviewed by the Treasury.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, HMRC has a procedure in place to provide notice of changes of
the kind proposed in the clause. The publication in advance of draft
appointed day orders on the HMRC website provides taxpayers and
advisers with time to adjust and certainty about HMRC’s actions.
That practice, introduced by Jane Kennedy in 2008 when she was
Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has been welcomed by interest
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 18
seeks to make the provisions in clause 26 subject to a
formal review 12 months after Royal Assent. The clause completes the
alignment of late filing penalties across all taxes and duties
administered by HMRC by including the remaining indirect taxes and
excise duties in the new late filing penalty framework that legislated
for direct taxes last year. It is important to remind the Committee
that all new policy measures are subject to a formal evaluation process
within three years and that that requirement will apply to the changes
within the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">HMRC is
committed to reviewing the policies that it implements. An
implementation oversight forum with a majority of external members was
established by the previous Government to consider the changes brought
about after the review of powers, deterrents and safeguards. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 130<a class="bkMark" name="Column130">&#160;</a>
                           </div>The forum assessed whether the changes were in line with the
undertakings given to Parliament and found that the first year of
implementation of the new powers had been a success. It is worth
quoting Andrew Hubbard, president of the Chartered Institute of
Taxation and a member of the forum, who said that some
of<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the
early concerns about excessive and inappropriate use of the powers by

promises and assurances about how the powers would be
used”.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000204">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The new
provisions in clause 26 were designed after an extensive consultative
process, and the measure has been subject to three consultations since
August 2008. HMRC intends to continue that collaborative approach in
measuring the effectiveness of the new penalties. It would be somewhat
odd to provide for such a review but not to allow for a review of the
changes introduced by the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen
Timms) last
year.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Delyn alluded to CIOT comments about the concern
that the fixed penalties were too high for frequent filing obligations
and that that could lead to disproportionate penalties. We have
considered the rates for fixed penalties carefully and agree that we do
not wish disproportionate penalties to arise. That is why HMRC
responded to concerns raised during the consultation by reducing the
maximum fixed penalty for monthly filing from £400 to
£200.<a class="bkMark" name="10102643000180">&#160;</a>

monitoring closely implementation of  the new penalty
provisions. I am pleased to report to the Committee that since
introduction in April 2010,  the early results on the
improvement of employers’ payment of pay-as-you-earn have been
encouraging. HMRC will continue to work closely with private sector
representatives on the implementation of late filing and late payment
penalties. Given those comments and assurances, I hope that the right
