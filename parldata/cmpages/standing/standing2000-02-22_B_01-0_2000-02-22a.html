<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to move the sittings motion, it may be helpful if I advise members of the Committee of the arrangements that will apply to the tabling of amendments during the forthcoming short recess. On the assumption that the Committee agrees not to sit this Thursday, amendments received at the Public Bill Office before 4.30 pm on Friday 25 February, will appear on the blue paper on Monday 28 February, and will, accordingly, be unstarred and therefore selected for our next sitting on Tuesday 29 February. Amendments that are tabled on Monday 28 February will be starred for our sittings on Tuesday 29 February.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Postal Services Bill, the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 29 February, on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past One o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a great delight to have you chairing our first sitting of the Committee, Mr. Maxton. When I was a teenage postman, I read Willie Gallagher's autobiography and learnt about those three legends of Glasgow trade unionism: Gallagher, Mannie Shinwell and your father, John Maxton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> He was my uncle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> My first mistake, and we are only two minutes into the sitting. Little did I know that John Maxton's nephew would be chairing the Committee on which I have the privilege to serve or that the Committee would discuss a Bill on the industry in which I once worked. It is ironic that you chaired the Committee stage of the Electronic Communications Bill, of which the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) was a member and in which I made fleeting appearances. I think that the Clerk to that Committee used a laptop for the first time in a Committee, which was also ironic because, for a short period in the long history of the Post Office between 1915 and 1981, telecommunications developed and grew as part of the old general Post Office. The city of Hull was one exception, a matter that we shall not go into at the moment, however.
<P>
Some predicted that the Post Office would sink into subsidised decline after the split and that the future lay with telecommunications alone. It is a sign of the Government's commitment to a healthy and modern communications industry that the Bills on e-commerce and postal services have come before you, Mr. Maxton, in quick succession. The Post Office, of course, is the Methuselah of the public sector. I sometimes remind those who have a single-minded obsession with telecommunications that the Post Office was the information superhighway when Dick Turpin was a superhighwayman.
<P>
I also welcome the hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) to the Committee. I congratulate the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire on his promotion to the Conservative Front Bench. He is one of my predecessors at the Department of Trade and Industry and I look forward to hearing his contributions to the debates. He must be delighted to have the opportunity to discuss constructive proposals for the future of the Post Office, something that he was not allowed to do when he had ministerial responsibility for it.
<P>
You have before you, Mr. Maxton, the crème de la crème of the Government Benches. We look forward to many delightful, enjoyable hours under your astute chairmanship, discussing this important Bill. Our sitting began at 9 o'clock, the time at which post offices throughout the country opened for business to some of the 28 million people whom they will serve this week. Staff will have almost finished their first deliveries to all 26 million addresses in this country and will be gearing up to handle 77 million letters today, which is 5 million more than were handled in a year in Victorian Britain.
<P>
Although the Post Office operates on a huge scale, it manages to be appreciated as a community service and even as a personal service. It touches people's lives as no other industry does. It is rightly highly regarded and even cherished by our citizens, but faces unprecedented challenges from globalisation, liberalisation and new technology. It needs the commercial freedom that overseas postal administrations have enjoyed for many years, but it must preserve its public service ethos. The trick is for the Post Office to change while staying the same.
<P>
The Government believe that we have chosen the best way forward for the Post Office and its customers, and we seek to implement the reforms as quickly as we can. The greatest damage that we can do is to delay further. By implementing the reforms in the Bill, the Government are confident that we will provide a Post Office that effectively and efficiently meets the needs of business and private customers in the United Kingdom. The reforms will also provide that the Post Office competes head-on in international markets with major overseas postal providers, and modernises and grows to deliver an excellent service in which it is more responsive to market developments and customer demands. Most important, the Post Office will protect its social obligations on the principles of universality, accessibility and affordability so that it will provide a world-class service for communities throughout the UK.
<P>
The Bill is crucial for postal services. It will create a modern Post Office able to grow as a significant global player, establish a new regulator and a stronger users' council for postal services, provide a firm basis for competition in the market, put the Post Office on a more commercial footing, provide a better deal for consumers and enable the Government to issue social and environmental guidelines that may include setting criteria for access to counter services.
<P>
It has been my pleasure to move the sittings motion, Mr. Maxton, under your—
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): Brilliant chairmanship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Just the phrase that I was looking for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> As the Minister said, there is a slight air of déja vu to our proceedings; those of us who served on the Committee that considered the Electronic Communications Bill will find an overlap in the cast of characters serving on the Committee. I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton, to oversee our proceedings.
<P>
I take this early opportunity to declare that my interests are properly registered, and I invite members of the Committee to study them in detail should they have any questions or concerns. I believe that the latest Register of Members' Interests is due out today or soon. I am not aware of any direct or indirect conflict between my interests and anything that we will discuss in Committee.
<P>
I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire not only to the Committee but to the Front Bench of our trade and industry team. I am grateful that I shall have his experience and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) to help me oversee proceedings.
<P>
We do not object to the sittings motion. We cannot predict when the Committee stage will finish; I shall leave that subject to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire. Given our conduct on the Electronic Communications Bill, I hope that all Labour Members will appreciate that I want to approach constructively any Committee that considers Bills. I do not want any games or gimmicks. I want to try to improve legislation wherever we can in a sensible and constructive way. We should bear it in mind that the Bill is long and that there will be much to discuss. We shall not unreasonably delay or do anything silly, but we expect proper scrutiny and will proceed in the spirit of it. On that basis, I hope that we can get off to a good start by getting through the sittings motion with dispatch. On that basis, I hope that we can get off to a good start by getting through the sittings motion with despatch. I look forward to returning next week. I hope that the Committee will allow me leave of absence next Tuesday afternoon and evening, when I am invited to a splendid dinner to celebrate the 50 years in Parliament of that grand old man, the Father of the House, my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath).
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): May I also express my pleasure that you are chairing our proceedings, Mr. Maxton. I have always had tremendous admiration for Chairmen. I am engaging in this sycophancy not only because I hope to have tolerance and a little leeway extended to me during the proceedings, but because I admire the fact that Chairmen know the arcane rules of parliamentary procedure. I have been in the House for 24 years and it is still a mystery to me. I am delighted that we have an experienced Chairman who will guide us through the labyrinth that lies ahead. I may come to you for a slightly unusual ruling, Mr. Maxton, but it depends on the Minister's response.
<P>
The other thing for which I admire Chairmen is the fact that they know everyone's name and constituency. Having been in the House for 24 years, I know that names, faces and constituencies change. It is a bit like school. When one goes to school for the first time, after three weeks one knows everybody; as one gets more senior, one knows one's own form and perhaps the form below, but does not have a clue about the names of the little sprogs who have just come in. I welcome the Labour Members who recently joined the House. There used to be an hon. Member called Maxwell-Hyslop—a thin, angular, rather abrasive man. His moment of triumph came in the late 1970s, during the passage of the then Government's hybrid shipbuilding Bill; he completely ruined it and it all had to be redrafted. That was the highlight of his life and things from then on went downhill. I always admire people who understand how ``Erskine May'' operates and what impact it has on our lives.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said, we are not against the Bill. Our only worry is that it does not go far enough. I would like the Post Office to be given the chance of greater liberalisation so that it can better contend with the foreign competition. However, I pick up the Minister's comment that the greatest damage would be done by further delay. When we wanted to liberalise the Post Office in the 1990s, who objected? It was the Labour party. That is a delicious twist of fate. A union ran a clever campaign against the proposal; who was a senior figure in the union at that time, blocking liberalisation? His name will not pass my lips. I find it amazing that we have to discuss a sittings motion when the perpetrator of the delay is bemoaning that delay.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton says, we will be constructive and we will try and move the Bill on in a positive, helpful—

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Yes, and sensible fashion. However, we are faced with 105 clauses and eight schedules. I object to the amount through which we have to plough. In his—I must not be uncharitable—pedestrian Second Reading speech, when he was plodding through his brief, the Secretary of State made a mistake when he said that he knew how many Government amendments there would be to the Bill. Seeing immediately the black hole in front of him, he had the sense to back off and say that he would not tell us the number of amendments. That was wise because, as the debate continued and he was pressed on some aspects of the Bill, especially on the social guidance to be given by the Secretary of State to the regulator, he suddenly realised, ``Whoops, we will have to introduce another couple of amendments.'' Having dug that hole for himself, he had the sense not to jump into it.
<P>
I am expressing my doubts and worries about the sittings motion because I do not want the Minister to have to call on his Back Benchers to filibuster on the Bill while the amendments that have not been drafted are produced. I want to avoid our having to consider rafts of amendments on Report. How many times in the past two years have Ministers said in Committee, ``We will table amendments on Report''? The Report stage on the Floor of the House is expensive in money and time, and it is impossible to investigate amendments accurately there.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall make a suggestion, and the Minister can take it on from there. If he can give a guarantee to the Committee that there will be no more than 50 amendments, I will finish speaking straight away. We had better record, for Hansard, that the Minister smiled at my offer but did nothing else, and there was no nod of the head to indicate that there would be no more amendments. I am a charitable sort of person, as you know, Mr. Maxton. If the Minister can guarantee that there will be no more than 100 amendments, I shall finish speaking straight away and we can all go away for our short holiday with our buckets and spades. I have to say that the Minister has not responded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> How about 200 amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Hang on, I am doing the bidding.
<P>
I must tell the Minister that there is a puzzled look on the faces of some of his hon. Friends on the Back Benches. They are a little worried. A hundred is a lot of amendments. The Bill has been drafted, but the Minister will not guarantee that there will be fewer than 100 amendments. What about 125 amendments? I want to know whether there will be more than 150 amendments. One or two people are starting to look distinctly worried; they were interested before, but now they are getting worried. Here is my offer: if the Minister can give me a guarantee that there will be fewer than 200 amendments, I will stop speaking right now. Two hundred and fifty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Laxton </B>(Derby, North): May I say, speaking on behalf of myself and perhaps on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle), that many of us fought long and hard and struggled manfully to ensure that we were nominated to serve on the Committee. We are looking forward to the proceedings. If we had only a trivial 150, 250 or 300 amendments, many of us would be bitterly disappointed. We would feel, quite honestly, that we had not had the opportunity to make a fulsome contribution to the debate. I am extremely disappointed that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire has such limited ambitions for the debate and seeking to improve the Bill. I wish to prevail on my hon. Friend the Minister to table plenty of amendments to keep us gainfully occupied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The bidding process can now stop. It is way beyond the scope of the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Mr. Maxton, you are absolutely right. I have to confess amazement and curiosity that the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) wants to increase the number of amendments, because all that that proves is that the Bill has been incorrectly drafted. That means not a tick in the box for joined-up government but an admission of failure. Although I have tried, in my normal way, to introduce some levity into the proceedings, I am worried that each amendment will take at least a couple of minutes to present, and if someone responds, that will take another couple of minutes. If there is a vote, each amendment will take even longer. However, the Minister has not blinked an eyelid at the possibility of the number of amendments peaking at 300.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I will finish my maths and then I will give way. Three hundred amendments multiplied by four minutes equals 1,200 minutes, which, when divided by 60, is a considerable number of Committee hours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman assure us that his contributions will be only two minutes long?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Bearing in mind the number of amendments that are being tabled, and the number of clauses, my contributions will probably run out on average at about two minutes, because there will be so many amendments and we will be here for such a long time.
<P>
As an experienced and knowledgeable Chairman, Mr. Maxton, do you think that it would be possible for the Committee to adjourn for two or three weeks, for the Government to rewrite the Bill and bring it up to date, so that we do not need so many amendments? The Government have not got their act together and the Committee will be wasting time dealing with amendments. The drafting has not been properly done. Who is to blame? I do not know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I suppose that, ultimately, the blame must lie with the Minister for introducing the Bill in such an ill-prepared form, but that is life.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> What the hon. Gentleman suggests is not a matter for me. The House, not the Chairman decided when the Committee would sit. I have no power whatever to adjourn the Committee for any length of time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton. You have chaired most of the very few Standing Committees in which I have been involved, and, as a new Member, I welcome your guidance.
<P>
I also welcome the Minister. Seldom have we had the opportunity to question a Minister with such a thorough knowledge and experience of his brief. No doubt he will be able to give us a great deal of guidance.
<P>
It will probably not the large number of amendments but their quality that will ensure that the Bill ultimately provides the much loved and much respected institution of the Post Office with an opportunity of remaining so. There can be little doubt that there will be a spotlight on the proceedings of the Committee, bearing in mind, for example, the extraordinary response to what many regional newspapers say about the potential threat to sub-post offices. Many people will be following our deliberations closely, although they may not have taken much notice of many other things that have passed through Westminster.
<P>
The Post Office is vital to so many people's everyday lives; it provides a real public service. The continuation of that service according to new market demands and challenges is extremely important to those people. We must ensure not only that we maintain that public service and wide network of offices but that we provide the Post Office with the commerciality and investment that it needs, enabling it to move forward to meet those new challenges as well as deal with people's local and personal needs.
<P>
Unfortunately, there have been similar problems with many other financial institutions in recent years, with the loss of mutuality, and banks becoming ever bigger and more remote from their customer base. They certainly have customers, but the personal relationship between customer and bank is now becoming very distant. I hope that we shall preserve the genuine feeling that members of the public have a personal relationship with their local post office. I hope that as the Post Office grows and takes on other responsibilities it will not lose that vital sense of community and personal relationship with its customers.
<P>
I look forward to our deliberations, because we have a common aim, although we may approach the matter from different perspectives. I hope that the Minister will recognise that we shall table amendments with the Post Office's best interests at heart, and I hope that they will receive a sympathetic hearing, so that together we can fashion the Bill into a measure that will genuinely achieve our aims.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I welcome the spirit in which the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton intends to approach the Committee, and I assure him that the Government intend constructively to examine the Bill to ensure that we put in place the right foundation for the future of the Post Office. I was slightly surprised by the comments of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire; for a moment, I thought that I was at Sotheby's. However, leaving the auction to one side, the hon. Gentleman said that I was responsible for the damage to the Post Office. However, I ran what was then called the Union of Communication Workers between 1993 and 1997. I did not run the Government, and it was the Government who were responsible for deciding the future of the Post Office. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that the union campaign opposed giving the Post Office commercial or financial freedom or liberalising it. In fact, it suggested that alternatives were available to the dogma that the only way to give the Post Office commercial freedom was to privatise it. We decided not to privatise it, and not to go down that Railtrack, so to speak, and we argued for an alternative. I do not like to compliment people behind their backs, Mr. Maxton, but Mr. Butterfill, who will also chair our Committee, served on a Trade and Industry Select Committee that proposed that the Post Office could be given commercial freedom by being turned into a public limited company that was 100 per cent. publicly owned. The Bill is that proposal, and if only the Major Administration had picked up that proposal, the Post Office would by now have much more commercial freedom.
<P>
Hon. Members expressed a lot of excitement about amendments. The Bill is not ill prepared, and it closely follows the White Paper that we published last July. I ask the Opposition not to get excited about our amendments. Major surprises are unlikely. We are dealing with an organisation that has been a state corporation since Charles I decreed from Bagshot in 1631 that the Post Office should be state owned. An awful lot of history is involved. Uncontroversial but detailed issues relating to tax and pensions, among other issues, are involved, and most of the amendments will bore the Committee rigid. I do not expect them to cause a lot of excitement. [Interruption.]—I have disappointed my colleagues. I realise that it was not unusual for the previous Government—indeed, all Governments—to table a substantial number of amendments in Committee. We shall ensure that we give plenty of notice of Government amendments and that the Committee has time to consider them properly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): I believe that an offer was made earlier that the Opposition might accept a motion to adjourn for a couple of weeks and to allow all the clauses to stand part without debate. Perhaps if we take that on board, they will support the Bill without moving any amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> It is tempting, but we are about to have a half-term break, not a six-week holiday.
<P>
I appreciate the points made by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) about the Post Office. He knows full well how valuable it is in his constituency, particularly its network. I hope that we can demonstrate during our proceedings that the Bill poses no threat to the Post Office network. In fact, it presents opportunity. It will underpin the network with access criteria, for example, which are set out in law for the first time. We have a common aim. It is inconceivable that any politician of whatever political persuasion would want to damage the Post Office.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister mentioned access criteria. As he rightly said, they will be crucial to whether the Post Office network is well underpinned. However, we received no guarantee about that on Second Reading. Indeed, it was almost a certainty that the criteria would not be available until after the Bill had been discussed in Committee. They are crucial to understanding whether the Bill will deliver that guarantee. Will the Minister undertake to press No. 10 Downing street to accelerate the publication of the criteria through the performance and innovation unit and, if possible, ensure that they are published within the time scale of the Committee stage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Two issues are involve. First, that we have already published the consultation paper ``Draft Statutory Social and Environmental Guidance to the Postal Services Commission''. Secondly, the PIU study is an important cross-Government look at how the Post Office can best deliver our objectives and how we can underpin the network. The PlU study will influence the final details of the access criteria. I want a proper job to be done there and, while I shall try to ensure that it comes before the Committee as soon as possible, it is more important to get those details right.
<P>
We have a common aim to see the Post Office prosper. It is widely accepted that it has lost ground in the past eight years while it has been under constant review. Its competitors have leapt ahead from what was for some a sedentary position back in the early 1990s. It is in all our interests to ensure that we get the Bill through smoothly, tackling the controversial issues in a proper way, so that we leave the Post Office in a much better position to face the communications market of the 21st century.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Postal Services Bill, the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 29 February, on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past One o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there are two financial resolutions in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also remind members of the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely: Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 3 to 5, Clauses 31 to 39, Clause 2, Schedule 2, Clauses 40 to 50, Clauses 6 to 30, Clause 51, Schedule 3, Clauses 52 to 79, Schedule 4 and 5, Clauses 80 to 93, Schedule 6, new Clauses, new Schedules, Clauses 94 to 10l, Schedules 7 and 8, Clauses 102 to 105.—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]<P>

Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Betts.]

 Adjourned accordingly at twenty-seven minutes to Ten o 'clock till Tuesday 29 February at half-past Ten o'clock.
