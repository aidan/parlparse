<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Clause 85 deals with non-resident insurance companies and the requirement that they should appoint tax representatives in the United Kingdom. I and other members of the Committee have received a submission from Ernst and Young, which includes counsel's opinion that that conflicts with article 59 of the European Union treaty, which precludes discrimination on grounds of nationality. Is it in order, Mr. Butterfill, for the Committee to proceed with legislation that is known to conflict with European law, which ranks ahead of national law? Should the Committee collude in the introduction of an unlawful provision?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is an interesting point, but not a point of order for the Chair. It will be for the European Court of Justice to decide the matter.
<H4><center>Clause 32</center></H4>
<H4><center>Unrelieved surplus advance corporation tax</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move, amendment No. 31, in page 18, line 39, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`such provisions to consist of a simple regime limiting the amount of brought forward surplus ACT which can be offset against a company's mainstream corporation tax liability in any year to 15 per cent. of that company's corporation tax profits.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would introduce some simplicity into the Bill, which is riddled with enormous complexity. It is an attempt by outside bodies and Opposition Members to encourage the Government to consider how the measures will be implemented in practice and how business will cope with them. The regulations that were published last week -- they are complex and run to some 18 pages--set out the shadow advance corporation system that will replace the current system. Many outside commentators believe that the new system is too complex and even tougher than the current regime. As I said at our previous sitting, Robert Turnbull of KPMG has stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The regulations contain tougher rules than the present system and some companies might find them difficult to use.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would replace the plethora of 18 pages covering the new shadow ACT system and in its place would limit the amount of surplus ACT that can be offset in any one year to 15 per cent. of the company's mainstream corporation tax profits. To me and outside bodies, that seems a much simpler method. The Confederation of British Industry believes that that figure should be 10 per cent. and the Chartered Institute of Taxation believes that the new shadow ACT regime is both unfair and unnecessarily complex and that the figure should be 15 per cent. The system proposed in the amendment would be fair.
<P>
A number of companies in this country together have &#163;7 billion of surplus ACT which they seek to offset against their mainstream corporation tax liability. That is a significant sum which has not emerged from thin air. It is hard cash which, over the years, those companies have paid to the Inland Revenue at the end of the quarter in which they paid a dividend. It is grossly unfair that that money should be difficult to offset against their mainstream corporation tax liability. The previous Government introduced the foreign income dividend scheme to try to help companies with large overseas interests to offset that money against their tax liability. It is unfair to say that that is a cost that they must bear because those companies do an enormous service to this country. They invest overseas, sometimes in risky ventures, and bring enormous income to this country from those ventures. It is wrong to say that we do not want those companies to offset that &#163;7 billion against mainstream corporation tax liability. The Exchequer cannot afford to lose &#163;7 billion of revenue, but that money belongs to companies and we should be trying to ease its recovery over the forthcoming years.
<P>
My particular concern is that there is a hidden agenda; that the Exchequer and the Inland Revenue do not want that money to be recovered. It would be helpful if the Paymaster General could confirm that no time expiry limit will be placed on surplus ACT and that the Government do not intend now or in the future to say ``From now on, you have three, four or 10 years in which to reclaim this surplus ACT.'' Indeed, the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We would welcome confirmation that existing ACT surpluses will be preserved indefinitely.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have given companies an option: either they can adopt the burden for administering the complex shadow ACT system or they can write off their surplus ACT and not use the new system. That is an invidious option. Companies should not be faced with such a choice. It is their right to recover the money. It should not be a matter of adopting the burden or losing the money. The system should be simple. It should enable companies to recover surplus ACT by following easy administrative arrangements. Companies should not have to make the invidious choice between losing many millions of pounds of surplus ACT and incurring many tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds in administrative costs when they try to reclaim the money.
<P>
I urge the Committee to adopt the amendment, which has the backing of outside professional bodies, because it simplifies matters. It would enable companies to recover what is theirs in a fair and equitable system for dealing with the vast &#163;7 billion of surplus ACT. I look forward to hearing what the Paymaster General has to say about the expiry of surplus ACT.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): I must point out to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) that the amendment is almost certainly defective, but he knows that. He has tried to make a point that was raised by some companies involved in the FIDs argument which we had last year when we discussed the previous Finance Bill. I am sure that all of us still have vivid memories of that.
<P>
It is a little disingenuous for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that his proposal is done in the name of simplicity. The previous Government's partial solution to the problem of surplus ACT was the foreign income dividend which came into effect in 1994. No fewer than 24 additional sections from 246A to 246Y--we almost got to Z--were inserted into the Taxes Act. Many were extraordinarily complex. For example, section 246I dealt with foreign source profit and distributable foreign profit and section 246B rejoiced in the title of notional foreign source advance corporation tax.
<P>
We are getting rid of all that. The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know that we are going to simplify the system in a way that the previous Government's half-baked scheme did not. Their scheme created no end of problems. It was not taken up by many companies because of the tax credits to which they were committed and the bias towards distribution that that involved. Companies did not take up the option on FIDs to anything like the extent that was envisaged.
<P>
We have solved the problem of ACT. We are also committed to dealing fairly with surplus ACT held by companies when ACT is abolished next April. The amendment would not do that for two reasons, which I am sure the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will want to know. Apart from being technically defective, the amendment would prevent some companies from getting back temporary ACT surpluses as quickly as they had anticipated. That would be a double-edged sword, because it would reduce the limit for set off against corporation tax bills from 20 per cent. to 15 per cent. of tax profits. In contrast, our shadow ACT system will substantially preserve companies' existing expectations. Given that &#163;7 billion is theoretically outstanding, such companies cannot realistically expect to recover all their ACT surpluses.
<P>
The amendment would also enable other companies with long-standing ACT surpluses, much of which they may have already written off in their accounts, to recover more of it than would be possible under existing rules. That would therefore constitute a relaxation of the rules. Moreover, the cost to the Exchequer could run to several billion pounds over several years. That is simply not on the cards. If the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton were to talk to companies about the matter, he would find that they largely accept the Government's proposals.
<P>
Companies that have built up large amounts of surplus ACT are multinationals such as RTZ and Billiton, which we are pleased to say entered the London market in 1997, and which have little in the way of UK profits. Companies with long-standing ACT surpluses, which they have written off because there is no realistic chance of recovering them, are precisely those that will benefit from the abolition of ACT.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that companies such as RTZ have written off surplus ATC. They may have done so for prudent accounting and auditing purposes, but they hope and expect one day to recover money that they have written off in their minds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Well, I cannot read their minds. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, who is a distinguished accountant, is also a distinguished Freudian or Jungian who can penetrate the inner recesses of the minds of industry tycoons. However, the surplus ATC is written off in their books. It would be unfair to benefit such companies still further by spending huge amounts of the Exchequer's money to improve the prospect of recovery of surplus ACT that they have written off.
<P>
The amendment would prove arbitrary and unfair, it would be excessively costly to the Exchequer, and it would itself be unfair on other people who pay tax. I therefore urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General did not respond to my key question, about whether the Government plan to introduce an expiry date for surplus ACT. Given his comments about writing off ACT, such companies should be worried that the Inland Revenue might decide in the future that ACT is irrecoverable. It is an important question because ACT is hard cash that companies have paid to the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not mentioning the matter. I can reassure him that, at least for the duration of this Parliament, there will be no time limit. We have given similar commitments on personal and corporate tax matters. However, we beg to differ with his other point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In view of the confirmation given by the Paymaster General, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Clauses 32 to 35 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interest payable under the Tax Acts by or to companies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 164, line 35, after `section', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall provide that where any company has overpaid tax in an earlier period and underpaid tax in a subsequent period interest on the overpaid tax arising at the same time as interest on the underpaid tax shall be calculated at the same rate and otherwise.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment:
<P>
No. 30, in page 164, line 48, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(8) No interest on overdue tax shall be charged in respect of underpaid quarterly corporation tax payment in circumstances whereby the under-payment resulted from an increase in the corporation tax rate or other changes to the law determining a company's liability to tax.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Amendment No. 36 speaks for itself. I am grateful to have been given a copy--which was on general distribution--of the Labour party policy unit document on these clauses. The Government are generous in letting us know their thinking. I need only quote from that document--[Interruption.] It is on the Table, if any hon. Members do not have a copy. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The purpose behind the change is to enable large companies to cope better with instalment payments of corporation tax, by avoiding penalising them if they make honest mistakes over their instalment payments.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am delighted that the Committee is of one mind on the purpose of this schedule and related clauses. I assume that the Labour party policy unit is still the mind of the Government, of which there is plenty of evidence in other areas. There is no reason to suppose that that is not the case in this instance.
<P>
If an instalment system on a current-year basis is introduced, it is inevitable that companies making such instalments will have to make untested assumptions about what the profits for the period just ended have been. It is in the nature of such a process that, sometimes, they will make an overpayment and then wish to make an underpayment in the following period, so that the total amount of cash taken out of the company is no more than the bare minimum required to meet the new law.
<P>
Under self assessment, if an individual makes an overpayment of tax, there is a general mechanism by which, if he makes a subsequent under payment, the discrepancies in the two amounts may be offset. I understand that no such mechanism is available to companies. If a company has overpaid in an earlier period, and then wishes to underpay in a subsequent period and have that acknowledged by the Revenue, the company will have to go through a formal process of getting the Revenue's agreement to the fact that it overpaid in the earlier period before payments for the two periods can be settled up and netted out, one against the other, in the company's account with the Revenue.
<P>
That seems to be somewhat unfair on companies, as, in effect, they will be asked to undertake a new process of self assessment in future. Therefore, it is vital not only that the interest that they earn on an earlier overpayment corresponds to the interest that they are charged on a subsequent underpayment, but that the two rates of interest are absolutely equal, so that, as the document from the Labour party policy unit aspires, there is no penalty on the company. At present, as I understand it, the rate of interest that will be paid on an earlier overpayment will still be some 2.5 per cent less than that rate of tax charged on the subsequent underpayment. Given that we are talking about the largest 20,000 corporate tax payers in the country, who account for 85 per cent of all corporation tax revenue, 2.5 per cent will be levied on some very large sums of money. That is a substantial point. The amendment would simply hold the Government true to their declared intentions that there should be no interest penalty in the case where the overpayment happens in an earlier period.
<P>
I anticipate that the Paymaster General will rise to say that the Opposition are advocating use of the mechanism of regulations for which we have criticised the Government during the debate. Our response to that is, if there are to be regulations--and we do not favour regulations being used to the extent to which the Government use them--it is appropriate that they should be used to fine tune the mechanism by which interest is levied or paid on tax. That area is sufficiently obscure and minute to be dealt with appropriately by regulations.
<P>
When, in a previous debate, we asked the Paymaster General whether there was any area that he did not envisage being covered by regulations, he was stumped for an answer. The Government have a wildly different view on the use of regulations in Finance Acts, but I am sure that we would both agree that in dealing with a complex area such as this, technical regulations can give effect to our intentions, but the intention must be clear. The intention is apparently clear in the Government document from which I have quoted, and the intention is clear in amendment No. 36, which would amend schedule 4, so that those large companies that will have this penal system imposed on them should at least be sure that if they are cautious and slightly overpay in an earlier accounting period, they will not face a further interest penalty of 2.5 per cent for doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, were we to adopt the system that he seems to be suggesting, an effective incentive to companies would be to underestimate the forward profitability of the company? The proposed system gives every incentive for accurate projections. Moreover, differentials already exist within the system to penalise those who do not declare enough profit in advance.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman as he has given me an opportunity to put him right and to clarify this important matter. The proposal is that there will be no penalty not when a company has underpaid in an earlier period but when it has overpaid in an earlier period. That does not dictate what the rate of interest should be. I acknowlege that if companies persistently underpay, the rate of interest will be relatively high--it may be 2 per cent. or so above the London lending rate of the banks.
<P>
However, the proposal relates to the situation in which a company overpays in an earlier period and underpays in a subsequent period. To the extent that the later underpayment is matched by the earlier overpayment, there should be no penalty. That would encourage companies, at least in the first quarter of the year, to slightly overpay. They would know that if they adjusted their figures in the second and third quarters, they could underpay without an interest penalty, which would benefit the Revenue and accelerate the receipt of tax.
<P>
In the first quarter of the year, companies would say, ``At this stage of the year it is hard to estimate what our profits will be. It is safer for us to overestimate now, knowing that in the second and third quarters we can fine-tune the figure without the risk of penalties because we know that our overpayment will accrue interest at the same rate as subsequent underpayments.''
<P>
If the amendment is not accepted, the overpayment in the first quarter would accrue interest at a rate that is 2.5 per cent. below the rate at which the subsequent underpayments are penalised. That is why the amendment is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> My understanding is that companies will, on a quarterly basis, be able to revise their forward profit projections on a rolling yearly basis, so that cumulative profitability can be adjusted. However, I wait for my hon. Friend the Paymaster General to correct us all on this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> As I said, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for highlighting the Labour party's confusion about the clause. I need say no more to prove my point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I support the amendment. Under the new quarterly payments system there may be a tendency to overestimate one's quarterly tax payments, which will play into the Government's hands. They intend to use the new quarterly payments system as a way of raising extra revenue for the Exchequer--it will raise an additional &#163;1.6 billion in the first year, &#163;2 billion in the second year and over &#163;3 billion in the third year. The system will encourage companies to pay more money to the Exchequer early, which will have a detrimental effect on business. The problem is compounded by the fact that underpayments will incur a high marginal rate of interest.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is concerned about the matter. It said that the spread of 2.25 per cent., which was announced in the Budget, is too high. Most of the large companies can obtain much lower rates of interest--ranging from about 0.25 per cent. to 0.5 per cent.--on the differential between borrowing and lending. The amendment would remove the damaging and penal margins between underpaying and overpaying tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Did my hon. Friend notice that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) spoke approvingly of penalising companies that underpay tax? Does my hon. Friend agree that in a quarterly payments system that is based on current year projected profits, innocent mistakes are inevitable and that a regime that is penal is wholly inappropriate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. His intervention reveals the constant anti-business attitude that prevails in the Labour party--it treats business as the pariah of society rather than as the generator of wealth and of high standards of living for the people of this country.
<P>
It is possible to make innocent mistakes in estimating one's profit for the quarterly payments system because calculations are based on current-year profits and the first quarterly payment is due six months after the beginning of the accounting period. That quarterly payment must be based on the whole year's profit. It is easy to make mistakes, so we should not be considering penalising companies for innocent errors. There should be an interest charge on inaccurate estimates, but the rates should be in line with commercial ones, as the Chancellor said in his Budget statement.
<P>
The reality of the provisions is that commercial rates will not be charged; the margin between underpayment and overpayment is too high.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I simply want to make the point that Labour Members want to encourage successful business. Has the hon. Gentleman any experience at all of starting his own business or running a business, or was he simply a bean counter in an accountancy company? I have run my own businesses for more than 10 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> These provisions do not apply to small businesses but to large companies. I have had 13 years' experience in the accountancy profession of dealing with and advising large companies, and assisting them in devising and working out their tax liability for any given year. Even when a company bases its profits on the figures for the prior year, it is difficult to calculate corporation tax liability.Using estimated profits and figures will be an enormous task, and a number of companies will inevitably calculate the figure wrongly.
<P>
Whether or not the amendment is technically defective, it makes the point that the margin between the underpayment and overpayment of tax it too high. The Government should respond to the amendment by introducing a zero margin between underpaying and overpaying tax.
<P>
No company will rush into using these rates of interest to their benefit, either by underpaying deliberately or overpaying deliberately. Most companies want to pay their corporation tax liability accurately, and do not want to pay or receive interest--as a result of inaccurate estimates of their corporation tax liability--when they would not otherwise have done so.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 seeks to deal with situations where an inaccurate estimate has been made, not because of the difficulties of estimating the current-year profits or current-year tax liability of a company, but because of a change in the law such as a change in the corporation tax rates. The year end of a company may not coincide with the financial year of the country and, indeed, rates may apply that will affect the overall tax liability of the year, thereby leading to inaccurate quarterly payments being made.
<P>
Case law or judicial decisions could completely change a company's corporation tax liability. There is a grey area in the law regarding whether a disposal gives rise to a capital gain, which would affect a company's corporation tax liability. There could be a change in case law affecting whether corporation tax should be charged on a given profit. There could even be a change in the law because of the legislation having changed.
<P>
For all those reasons, it would be unreasonable to penalise a company for inaccurately estimating their corporation tax liability when that inaccuracy arose not from the company's bean counters getting the figure wrong, but from the decisions of judges and legislators--senior manager bean counters--whose changes in the law affected the company's profits. We are not considering retrospective law: even prospective changes in the law will affect the overall estimate, as companies will have to estimate their prospective corporation tax liability. Prospective changes in the corporation tax regime could therefore affect companies' overall yearly liability, which will feed back into affecting quarterly payments.
<P>
I urge the Government to seriously consider the amendments. I am sure that they are defectively drafted--they are bound to be--but they reflect genuine anxiety in the real business world about the difficulties of calculating corporation tax liability and the injustice that would occur if inaccuracy were to arise from a change in the law, particularly if that change had resulted from decisions made by Treasury Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The first point I should make to hon. Members who have spoken in favour of amendment No. 36 is that what they have said is irrelevant because the provision deals only with those companies that are not subject to the instalment payment system--the new modern system for corporation tax payment. I understand their point, but the amendment is superfluous because that is what happens anyway under the common period rule, which has the same netting off effect as that sought by the amendment. For example, the rule means that if a company overpays &#163;10,000 in one year and underpays &#163;10,000 in the following year, no interest is payable by either the Government or the company for the period in which both amounts are outstanding. The amendment would only add unnecessarily to the length of the tax code, and I urge the Committee to reject it, quite apart from the fact that the remarks made by Opposition Members are irrelevant to the companies that will be affected by the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Just so that we are absolutely clear on this, the Paymaster General quotes an example in which a company overpays in one year and underpays in a subsequent year, but what about the case of a company that overpays in an earlier period within the year and underpays in a subsequent period within the year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> On that point, I must emphasise that we have reduced the differential tax rates in relation to underpayment and overpayment from 3.5 per cent., with which the Conservative party lived, quite happily, for 18 years, to 2.25 per cent., precisely in line with what the Chancellor said in the Budget speech, in order to bring both down to more commercial rates. That is a big step forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I repeat the point that I made earlier; does the Paymaster General not accept that there is a difference between an appropriate rate of interest in a system under which companies should be able to calculate the correct payments to be made--a previous year system--and a current year system, under which companies will, almost inevitably, make mistakes, albeit perhaps minor ones, and thus a penal regime is no longer appropriate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> It is not a penal regime; we have reduced the rates substantially so that it will not be a penal regime. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hamond) seems to be taking up the position expressed by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) when we discussed related matters on the Floor of the House, who said that it was impossible for companies to project profits for a year and a half. Of course they can; the companies that are affected by the move to in-year instalments, the modern system of taxation, are all large companies, well versed in the habit of five-year plans, three-year plans, rolling forecasts and forecasts for each quarter. Such companies have monthly board meetings, contrary to what the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Grantham and Stamford seem to imply. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford even said that the companies of which he was a board member did not do that sort of thing. I challenge him to tell us which those companies are because I have yet to find a company affected by the move to the modern system that does not already do that.
<P>
In narrowing the band of interest rate payments on underpayment and overpayment, we want to create a sensible system with no built-in bias. I do not think that companies will want to use this mechanism, but some might be tempted to do so because one can see where the relative advantages of making an underpayment or overpayment might lie. By overpaying enormously, a company could build up money with the Exchequer that could attract a higher rate of interest than it would attract in banks, Alternatively, if a company does not have sufficient money to pay, it could run up a big debt at a rate of interest of 2 per cent. over base, which it could not obtain from the commercial market. I am not suggesting that that would be usual behaviour for the strong companies in the new system, but it is pointless to provide that sort of incentive to misbehave when it is unnecessary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): The Paymaster General does not seem to have grasped the central point of our argument. There is all the difference in the world between a previous year's assessable basis, in which companies have plenty of time to get their tax computations right, and a quarterly filing system, in which they do not. The Paymaster General talks about a reduction in the rate differential from 3.3 per cent. to 2.2 per cent., but as the Government are getting the cash flow more or less in advance, that is a much more penal regime than before. I ask the Paymaster General seriously to consider that, where a company has underpaid or overpaid in error, the differential in tax rate is the same for the following quarter so that the two can be equalised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that the common period rule to a large extent will meet the latter problem. We have already debated cash flow effects and we will, no doubt, debate them again when we consider whether to look to the previous or current year's profit arrangements. We will also debate amendments on seasonal problems, which we discussed on the Floor of the House.
<P>
There is a genuine difference of opinion on that. We cannot allow the transition to an on-going benefit which, from the reductions in corporation tax, will rise to &#163;2 billion to be entirely neutral. We cannot allow companies to have both the one-off effect--the cash flow transition effect--and the on-going benefit. They have to be traded against each other. I believe that the Government have found the right balance, which has largely been accepted by the companies with which we consulted. Seasonal problems and whether we should go on the previous year's profits are legitimate subjects which we will debate soon.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 relates to what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said. He is well aware that the Government have given a commitment on corporation tax for this Parliament. That deals with any immediate prospect of a change in rates. I think that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that and our commitment on personal taxation rates. I realise he is arguing a point of principle. If the Tories, in the dim and distant future, wanted to raise the level of corporation tax when in government, companies would be affected. That would be right because it would be part of Government policy. It is no good trying to obviate the effect of a necessary policy because that would be contradictory. The essential point is that we have given an undertaking to this Parliament. The danger highlighted by the hon. Gentleman does not arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General said that companies should be affected by a reduction or increase in the corporation tax rate set by Parliament. He is, of course, right. But should those companies which have paid an underestimate of their corporation tax liability in the first and second instalments as a result of that increase have to pay interest on that underestimate when it was not their fault?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That very narrow point is a minor consideration in the context of an increase in corporation tax. Given that we have given a firm undertaking not to raise corporation tax, the question does not arise. If the hon. Gentleman's party ever has the responsibility to govern, it can avoid the impact of a rate change by making it effective in the future. In July's Budget, we made the change effective for the previous year. Such options are open to government if they want to avoid the narrow problem on which the hon. Gentleman has focused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I accept the point, but the Paymaster General talks about a commitment for this Parliament. However, the corporation tax system is not just for this Parliament; it is for several decades or, at least, for more than one Parliament. To say that the Government have given a commitment not to raise the rate of corporation tax for this Parliament is irrelevant because the system will last beyond that. Case law is another reason for changing the corporation tax regime.
<P>
Finally, one wonders how much validity can be given to the Government's commitment not to raise taxes. During the general election campaign the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown), said that there would be no tax rises under a Labour Government, but there have been several tax rises in the Government's first two Budgets.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall not allow myself to be side-tracked to the wider areas into which the hon. Gentleman has tried to tempt us. We have made the point. The hon. Gentleman said that we would, in effect, be in office for several decades and I welcome his judgment on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a matter of detail, the Committee has not been shown the draft regulations that will be introduced under schedule 4. Will the Paymaster General give an undertaking on when we shall see those draft regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We shall discuss on a subsequent amendment the regulations relating to companies not affected by in-year instalments in the new system of modern corporation tax. We intend that the new arrangements on overpayment and underpayment and the interest rates relating to them will be the same for those companies that are unaffected by the move to in-year instalments and those that are affected by in-year instalments. We have powers to issue regulations on that. There is no need for us to be specific about the regulations because they will be the same for companies unaffected by the move to in-year instalments as for those companies that are affected by it. The regulations will be published in the autumn when the Finance Bill has been enacted. Subsequent clauses in the Bill may give rise to debate on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am afraid that the Paymaster General, in his usual bluff and jovial way, has yet again missed the point. The point is not whether interest should correspond one year versus another, but whether it should correspond one quarterly period versus another.
<P>
The Bill is of great length and complexity, yet there is no technical support for Opposition Members in addressing what are often highly technical issues. Members of the Government think that they can stand up and say that, for reasons they have surmised, our amendments are out of order or would not have the intended effect. I take issue with the Paymaster General because amendment No. 36 would be effective. It would do what it intends to do precisely because the regulations are so widely drawn.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to page 164, line 8 of the Bill which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Treasury may by regulations make provision applying section 826, with such modifications as may be prescribed, for the purpose of preferring on companies of such descriptions as may be prescribed a right to interest''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Bill continues in line 20:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Treasury may by regulations make provision modifying section 826(2) in relation to companies of such description as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are very wide-ranging regulations.
<P>
Under the powers given in schedule 4, it is entirely possible that the regulations could have the effect that we suggest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend not think it a disgrace that we are discussing a schedule that will bring about a major change in the corporation tax regime when we have not even seen the draft regulations? When I asked the Paymaster General about that, he could not give me a specific commitment that they would be available in good time for discussion in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> That is a telling point. The Paymaster General's only defence to what I said is to say, ``In the context of the regulations that we are going to publish but will not let you see, it is not possible for your amendment to be effective.'' That is a totally defective argument.
<P>
On my hon. Friend's point, I have only to refer--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman desists from that. We shall discuss the regulations when we come to the next amendment and we are becoming side-tracked.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I would not wish to do that, Mr. Butterfill, but I was told by the Paymaster General that the amendment would not be effective. I have said enough to show that it would be effective. It would, if the regulations are so framed, ensure that large companies that overpay tax in an earlier quarterly period and which underpay tax in a subsequent quarterly period in the same year are not penalised. That is what the Government say they want, and it is what they should do.
<P>
To suggest that a reduction in the rate differential between overpayments and underpayments from 3.5 per cent. to 2.25 per cent. somehow answers that point is to display ignorance of the world of commerce. Only the hon. Member for Croydon, Central can claim that distinction this morning. I urge the Paymaster General and his colleagues to consider the fact that adding only one sentence to the Bill could resolve the matter.
<P>
The Government should say that they sign up to the amendment's principles, and they should ensure in their regulations that the point is taken. The Paymaster General said that our proposal was already current practice, and he gave an example in which one year involved an overpayment and the following year involved an underpayment. If that principle is accepted, it should also apply to quarterly payments. The principles that lie behind the amendment deserve to be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I want briefly to clarify two points. The hon. Gentleman must understand the fact that the amendment would apply only to companies that are outside the instalments regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> That is a fact. Sub-paragraph (3) on page 164 of the Bill states that the regulations cannot apply to companies that are covered by the instalments regime. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is the case, but there is no need to make a big issue of it.
<P>
It may perhaps stretch your latitude unduly, Mr. Butterfill, to say that I answered the hon. Gentleman's other point. The common period rule deals with the issues that he raised. He is wrong on both counts, and we cannot accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 164, line 48, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(8) Any regulations made under this section shall be subject to the approval of the Commons House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is another amendment in which we seek to smoke out the Government's persistent use of secondary legislation to deal with matters that ought to be dealt with in the Bill, or which Ministers should at least describe to the Committee so that a judgment can be made. Given that we are discussing interest payable by companies, which is a form of taxation, will the Paymaster General tell us when the Treasury regulations will be made available?
<P>
As we have said before, Parliament should always be interested in the relieving of taxpayers of property or money by compulsion. If we are to do our duty as a Parliament and a Standing Committee, the circumstances that surround such matters should be the subject of debate.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General give us more information on the general use of secondary legislation? In an earlier debate, I asked him to provide a comprehensive picture of how and to what extent matters pertaining to the Bill had been delegated to secondary legislation. We know, and outside commentators have confirmed, that the Bill signals a qualitative change in the use of such legislation. He did not respond to my question. Now that he has had time to reflect on the matter, to which we shall return in future debates, perhaps he can tell us more about it.
<P>
Will the Treasury regulations provided for in Schedule 4 will be debated on the Floor of the House or in Committee? Will the matter be dealt with by affirmative resolution? Can the Paymaster General guarantee that Members of Parliament will have the opportunity to express their opinions on those matters, and that the regulations will be scrutinised rather than waved through the back door?
<P>
The issue ought to engage the interest of the whole Committee, but we have so far had complete silence from Labour Members. Hypnotised as they are by the party, they have completely forgotten--if they ever knew it--their duty to their constituents. Taxpaying individuals and firms in a given constituency want to know that their Member of Parliament is taking an interest in taxation.
<P>
We are not asking Labour Members to revolt, or to run up the flag of low taxation, in which we know that they do not believe. However, they should be interested in the principle of taxation, and whether it is to be levied by Executive fiat or by the House of Commons, which obtained the power to tax in highly controversial circumstances many years ago.
<P>
Worst of all, the power of tax is being relinquished not by calculated transfer to another body but through a fit of absent-mindedness or neglect. Opposition Members are not prepared to relinquish that power, and we shall be grateful if the Paymaster General will say how, whether and when hon. Members will have the opportunity to scrutinise, debate and, if necessary, vote on those important aspects of taxation. This is just one example--by no means the most prominent--in the Bill. There is an issue to be addressed. I should like the Paymaster General to respond to the general points and specifically to those on schedule 4. When will the regulations be available and how will they be presented to the House?
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): We believe that the regulations are important. They have not been published and they should not become law without proper scrutiny, debate and, if necessary, amendment. When will the regulations be available and when will we be able to debate them? Individual and corporate taxpayers have rights, and it is up to the House of Commons to uphold those rights. We therefore support the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The point on affirmative and negative resolutions as it relates to powers conferred by regulation has been raised on successive occasions on the Floor of the House and in Committee. That leitmotiv runs through the Opposition's concerns. I have asked parliamentary counsel to prepare a response to the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), which may save a great deal of time, not just in Committee but on the Floor of the House later. My answer may take a few minutes, but it is of interest and is largely reassuring. Although I suspect that Liberal Democrat Members do not really believe that the Government are making a further unnecessary and arbitrary encroachment on the proper powers and rights of Parliament, I should like to reassure them because we take their inquiry at face value.
<P>
The power in clause 32 is not fundamental. It provides a saving in connection with the repeal of ACT. There are hundreds if not thousands of examples on the statute book of provisions that, in connection with a repeal or other change in law, leave the preservation of the rules for the old cases to subordinate legislation. The Opposition have made much of that. No one in the 18 years of the previous Administration or indeed, in the Labour Government before that, thought it necessary to change the arrangement.
<P>
Even if we disregard the transitional nature of clause 32, which is needed only until all existing surplus ACT has been used up, there are many examples in tax law of cases in which entitlement to relief or repayment is entirely dependent on regulation for order-making powers. Some of the widest examples relate to Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue. I shall give a couple of examples which are relevant to schedule 4, starting with one that has been given by my hon. Friends the Members for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) and for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) and many other Government Members.
<P>
The structure of PAYE, including provision for repayments and liabilities for tax, and the times when those liabilities accrue for the vast majority of the population, is entirely contained in regulation. Hon. Members mentioned that in respect of personal taxation and personal rights. It would be disingenuous to describe the PAYE system as administrative and the provisions of the Bill as substantive when PAYE is the sole mechanism of taxation and the sole source of repayments for so many people. That cannot stand up to scrutiny. In fact, PAYE regulations do not deal only with the minutiae of PAYE administration. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made that point on Thursday 14 May at col. 207 of Hansard. They are also the source of the fundamental obligation that requires income tax to be paid by deduction during the year before the employee's total income for the year can be known.
<P>
Section 110 of the Finance Act 1996 introduced the provisions for PAYE settlement agreements and it inserted new section 206A(7) (b) to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. That section contained power by regulation to amend primary legislation that affects the tax position of employees solely in consequence of an agreement between the Inland Revenue and an employer.
<P>
I apologise for giving such detailed references; my central point is that PAYE, by simple agreement between the Inland Revenue and an employer, is subject to regulations and orders that are made under secondary legislation, not primary legislation.
<P>
I could give two further examples, but I prefer to give just the shorter of the two. The mechanism for the quarterly payment of tax on gilts--and for repayments in respect of such payments--is contained in regulations that were made under a section that was inserted into the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988; but I shall not go into the details. That system will be repealed by clause 37, which also contains several powers to modify the operation of primary legislation.
<P>
I could go on at greater length. It is all a question of the Henry VIII power--the power to amend primary legislation, which is raised by clause 32(8). I want to deal with this matter once and for all, Mr. Butterfill--otherwise, we shall keep coming back to it. This is an unnecessary debate. It may pose a problem for some of the newer, less experienced Opposition Members, but it should not pose a problem of the magnitude that our debate suggests it has, and it should not delay us.
<P>
The matter was raised by the Opposition on the Floor of the House and in Committee. The Liberal Democrats might also be concerned about it, and perhaps I should also address myself to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). It is not at all unusual for Finance Bills to contain provisions that allow primary legislation to be amended. The Finance Act 1996 contained at least as many such provisions as the current Bill. Most, if not all recent, pre-1997 Finance Bills--namely, those before the general election--contained such provisions. For example, the Finance Act 1996 contained such provisions in sections 12(6), 65(5), 110, 151, 168(3) and 202, in paragraph 17(4) of schedule 15 and in schedules 26, 29 and 32. I could give further examples if the Opposition want them, or I could make my brief available--perhaps subject to slight amendment--to those Committee Members who are genuinely interested in the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have been a tax practitioner for 25 years and a member of my profession's revenue law committee, which is the tax law committee of the Law Society, for about 12 years. I am well aware of the situation that the Paymaster General is describing. If Parliament does not have a proper opportunity to scrutinise such regulations, time and again things go wrong and mistakes are made. However, the fact that such powers have been made before does not mean that it is correct to do so again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> For all his years of experience, the hon. Gentleman is missing a very simple point. In reality, the detail and minutiae of Finance Bills do not get scrutinised in Parliament. Parliament decides on the principles of taxation--its basis and justification, and whether it is progressive or regressive. We are discussing a very detailed and complex matter, and I do not pretend, with 24 years' experience in the profession, to be familiar with all the complex issues that are involved in drafting such clauses.
<P>
The whole point about regulations is that time is made available for technical consultation with interested parties inside and outside Parliament. Those parties have just as much interest as Parliament in getting it right, and one cannot get it right in the tight framework of the Finance Bill. That is why regulations are necessary and useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon said that it was important that regulations about smaller companies, which are not within the modernised system for in-year instalment payments by the larger companies, should be published. We have made it clear in enabling powers that we shall issue regulations. They will be issued in the autumn when the Bill has been enacted, but that is not important because companies already know the principle that will be embodied in those regulations, namely, that in respect of underpayment or overpayment of tax and interest thereon they should be in the same position as companies that are caught up in the in-year instalments. The hon. Gentleman seems to think that the regulations covering comapnies that are moving to quarterly payments have not been published, but they were published a month or so ago. [Interruption.]
<P>
If the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) will listen for once, we are discussing regulations covering companies that are not involved in the move to in-year instalments. I must conclude that the hon. Gentleman cannot read or, if he can read, that he cannot understand--
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall give way first to the right hon. Member for Wells.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Paymaster General has described the regulations as laying down the details and minutiae of taxation. Does he really believe that that describes clause 158(4), in which the Treasury is given
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``power to impose charges to taxation''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Paymaster General give another instance of a power of such awesome breadth being given to the Treasury under the negative resolution procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall rise to that challenge in due course. Sufficient to the day thereof, I have nine examples that I can read to the Committee. The hon. Gentleman's jump to clause 158 is some way ahead of today's debate, whatever good progress we may make. I am told that that reference could be to the single currency, which has not happened before, so the regulations may include something new.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I hesitate to rise because the Paymaster General has dodged so many questions that I expect he will dodge this one, too. Is there not a difference of interpretation between us of paragraph 1(3) of the schedule and is it therefore not possible that the sub-paragraph is entirely defective because of the ambiguities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that I have dealt with that, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
In reply to the canon from the right hon. Member for Wells, I can tell him that section 202(5) of the Finance Act 1996 in reference to gilt strips was equivalent to--
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Cannot the officials do better than that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I have no doubt that, given time, they will do better. The hon. Gentleman is being unreasonable. The argument will recur, but we cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am astonished by the Paymaster General's complacent regaling of the history of regulations in our tax system. His complacency reveals his arrogance. It is the same old story with the Government--power has gone to their heads.
<P>
If the Paymaster General is right about the regulations, why did Ian Barlow, head of tax at KPMG, say that such material should be in primary legislation? Why did Richard Collier Keywood, a partner at Coopers and Lybrand, say of the Bill:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I think we are getting perilously close to some constitutional issues''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why did the Institute of Directors state in their representations:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Some very important matters are to be dealt with in regulations. This will unduly limit the opportunity of parliamentary debate''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why did the tax committee of the Law Society state in its representations:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We condemn an approach that permits substantive matters to be dealt with in that way. Regulations are not subject to the same parliamentary scrutiny as primary legislation''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why did the Chartered Institute of Taxation state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are particularly concerned that this Finance Bill contains more clauses which give enabling powers for regulations to be introduced. . . . As a result, many taxation changes are not subject to the same degree of scrutiny which would have applied had they been included in the Bill itself?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally, why did the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are worried about the large number of provisions where substantive tax changes are to be imposed by regulation and thus will not be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the views of the people who will have to implement the regulations. Those are the views of the representative bodies of the specialists in this country. Why is he so dismissive of their opinion? The Opposition are reflecting the view of people in this country that regulation is being over-used in the Finance Bill. I am astonished by his complacency, and I hope that he will seriously address those bodies' concerns by writing to them to explain why the Government are using so much regulation in an undemocratic and arrogant way.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): There is a specific point and a general point to be made on this amendment.
<P>
To deal with the specific point first, the Paymaster General has failed to tell us where the draft regulations are. It is of no use to circulate a brief stating that regulations can be made only after the Finance Bill receives Royal Assent; we understand that. We want to see the draft regulations. The Bill was published more than a month ago and the Budget was published more than two months ago. Where are the draft regulations, and at what point does he intend to publish them?
<P>
As for the general point--the whole Committee will be grateful for your tolerance, Mr. Butterfill, in allowing a reasonably wide debate--the Paymaster General has displayed the most extraordinary bluster. First, he simply said that there were lots of regulations. We know that, but the regulations in this Bill are enormously important for corporate Britain.
<P>
Secondly--this was in his brief--he said that there was no need to consult on the detail of the regulations as their intent was clear. That is not the view--as was made clear by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon--outside the House; there is a need to consult on the detail and to get it right.
<P>
Thirdly--I wrote down his words--the Paymaster General suggested that scrutiny of regulations was not effective and that Parliament did not really scrutinise regulations. At one point, he said, ``That is not important.'' That marks the beginning of a new trend in this Executive's neglect of Parliament. We will probably be told next year that regulations do not need to be presented to Parliament at all. If the Paymaster General is to introduce such proposals, he must acknowledged the importance of parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
There is widespread concern outside the House, which has not been expressed to the same extent about previous Finance Bills, about the amount and importance of provisions made by regulation. Parliament must be brought properly back into this process.
<P>
The Paymaster General could do at least four things to assist the Committee. First--he dismissed this idea on Thursday afternoon--he could publish the relevant draft regulations before the Committee reaches each successive clause. Will he comment on that principle? If it is not possible this year, perhaps in subsequent years the Government could agree to publish draft regulations before the Committee considering the Finance Bill reaches the major clauses, even if they cannot do so in every case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> To which regulations does the hon. Gentleman refer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am referring at the moment to those in schedule 4, on page 164, line 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Which ones? Describe them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The schedule 4 regulations. But I want to make the general point that all relevant draft regulations should be published before the Committee reaches each stage of the Finance Bill.
<P>
Secondly, the Paymaster General should explain more clearly to the Committee how each set of regulations will be handled. Specific clauses at the end of other Bills--I do not know why there is no such clause in this Bill--summarise the secondary legislation and make it clear which regulations will be subject to the negative resolution procedure and which will be dealt with by administrative order.
<P>
Thirdly, will the Paymaster General give us some reassurance that the ratio of which he spoke on Thursday, between affirmative and negative resolutions, will at least not worsen under this Government?

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> One of my constituents summed up the transfer of power into secondary legislation rather well. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There can be no other conclusion than that, if allowed to pass into law, the 1998 Finance Bill removes the powers of Parliament to debate many important aspects of fiscal legislation and passes the power to the Executive.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That must be right, having heard the number of organisations that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) quoted. In my lifetime, I have never known so many organisations to show disquiet about this aspect of this Finance Bill.
<P>
My constituent goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It has always been an assumption in law that we have the right to have clear law on how we are to be taxed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That, as I understand it, was a fundamental reason why Parliament was established in the way that it was, and why it was given the power to grant money resolutions. I believe that the power of Parliament is being abrogated.
<P>
My constituent goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The 1998 Finance Bill drives a coach and horses through this principle and leaves us all with the situation that we are to be taxed by decree which can be changed at any time.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the point. The Paymaster General, for all his bluster, tries to defend a situation in which more and more power is being handed over to officials. The example that he quoted in relation to PAYE was an especially bad example. We argue in principle against powers to pass matters of taxation to secondary legislation. It has always been clear that powers to deal with administrative matters should be passed to secondary legislation--we have relatively little objection to that--and, of course, PAYE regulations merely enact the taxes Acts on administrative matters. However, these regulations constitute a fundamental change to the corporate tax structure of this country, which has been in place, largely unchanged, for 25 years. That is why we are making such a fuss about the regulations.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) makes a telling point; in Bills of all descriptions, there is usually a schedule detailing which clauses pass powers into secondary legislation. Can we have a note from the Government, as they must have the information to hand, to say which clauses pass powers to secondary legislation, and whether the regulations will be approved according to the negative or affirmative resolution procedure, because that can make a huge difference?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton alluded in some of the examples that he quoted to the constitutional position. It has always been a fundamental principle of tax law that the law can be made by judgments given in court. If more and more powers pass to secondary legislation, we could have a situation in which a taxpayer takes a case through all the courts in the land and up to the House of Lords, where the Inland Revenue loses the case, only to find that, the next day, his case is overruled by secondary legislation. That would be a fundamental breach of the individual citizen's right. I hope that we never take that path because it would be the path of oppression by secondary legislation.
<P>
We shall return to this matter in the debates on subsequent clauses. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells emphasised the point that I made on Second Reading about the possibility that considerable amounts of money would be raised under a later clause in relation to European economic and monetary union. Again, that shows how the Government are arrogantly overriding the wishes of Parliament, so that we cannot properly debate the clauses. The Paymaster General said that Parliament did not normally debate detail. That is nonsense. If powers are passed by primary legislation, Parliament has the opportunity to debate the detail if it wishes. What is more, our constituents, practitioners and others can make representations to us so that we can debate them in Parliament and if necessary table amendments. However, secondary legislation provides no opportunity to do that. Moreover, officials increasingly get secondary legislation wrong, and are obliged to redraft it. In the meantime it is the taxpayer who suffers the financial consequences of administering that law.
<P>
No Minister has indicated the substantial administration costs associated with many of the more fundamental clauses. When the clauses of earlier Finance Bills were debated, the previous Government had some idea of the administration cost as a matter of principle. Can the Paymaster General estimate the cost of administering clause 32 and schedule 4? If he cannot do so now, perhaps he will notify us at a later date. The relationship between the amount of tax raised and the administration cost is fundamental. If the gap between the two figures narrows, that signifies a bad principle of taxation.
<P>
I have huge concerns about the matter, which I was the first to raise on Second Reading. The Government must be wary of going down the route of excessive secondary legislation. The Bill is effectively legislating for Parliament to have less scrutiny. As I suggested in an earlier speech, one might as well have a one-clause Bill that states that all taxation matters shall be subject to secondary legislation by Treasury officials. That would dispense with the need for Parliament, Standing Committees or any other scrutinising body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I am tempted to say that debate that involves Opposition Members is pointless. Either they do not know which clause is being debated, or they misunderstand the clause. So much for parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
I told several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Guildford, that clause 36 deals with companies that are outside the in-year instalment system of corporation tax payments. Opposition Members do not know to which regulations they are referring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On a point of order. I shall save the Paymaster General further embarrassment by pointing out that we are debating schedule 4 not clause 36. It is he, not us, who does not know which regulations we are debating.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Yes, we are debating schedule 4 and amendment No. 36, which I put in the wrong order. However, unlike Opposition Members, in particular the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, I know precisely where we are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Point of order. May I seek your guidance, Mr. Butterfill? Are we debating amendment No. 27? The Paymaster General appears to be under the illusion that we are somewhere else in the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that we are debating amendment No. 27. However, that is not a point of order for me. The Paymaster General may make his speech in any way that he likes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The issue is that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks did not know which regulations were being discussed. I shall tell him again that the regulations in respect of in-year instalments have been published and are open to debate. The only regulations in respect of which we shall make an order are those that affect companies that are not covered by in-year corporation tax instalments. The purpose of the regulations will be to bring such companies in line with those that are covered by in-year corporation tax instalments. The regulations will be published when the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> In a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will he give way on that very point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will deal with the hon. Member's points as well, if he will bear with me.
<P>
The regulations will be published where appropriate. Those that relate to companies covered by in-year instalments have already been published. Such regulations are debated to a much greater extent than under the previous Government. I can quote chapter and verse on the matter if the Opposition wish.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and the hon. Member for Sevenoaks referred to the ratio of affirmative to negative resolutions. The Bill does not deal with that because of the general provision in section 828 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The Opposition, who were in government in 1988, made it clear that the matter should be decided by negative resolution unless otherwise indicated. That decision stood the test of time from 1988 to their disastrous general election. They did nothing about it.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Now, for reasons that the Committee has yet to understand, the Opposition are trying to question established procedures governing affirmative and negative resolutions and the publication of regulations. We understand more than they did how desirable it is to make regulations available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I raised with the Paymaster General in our last sitting a positive idea to improve the working of secondary legislation. If the Government do not accept that they should be adopting primary legislation, will the Paymaster General consider publishing the regulations on the internet so that they are widely available? That would be a positive contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that suggestion, which I have taken on board. I cannot commit on it yet because I do not know what would be involved. Certainly, he makes a valid point, and it is being considered. I cannot promise anything, but we will see what can be done.
<P>
I should like to say one other thing on secondary and primary legislation, as the Opposition seem keen to make headway--or lose time--on it. It is wrong to assume that a power is wider and therefore more objectionable because it includes the power to amend primary legislation. Every power to make subordinate legislation involves changing the law. A power to supplement a provision of an Act by applying the law to new cases may be much wider than a narrowly confined power such as one that amends legislation for a narrow purpose or for a limited number of expiring cases, as with ACT.
<P>
The only example that does not contain an express power to amend primary legislation is probably the widest of all those listed before me. Section 2 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 makes the whole structure of drawback relief in relation to excise duty something that can be modified by regulations made by the commissioners of Customs and Excise, who are, like those of the Inland Revenue, officers of the Treasury. That power goes a long way beyond any conceived definition of administrative matters. The Opposition have no argument to persuade us to change what we are doing, especially as they regularly used the same practice in their 18 years in office. We see no need to accept amendment No. 27.
<P>
Finally, in response to the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, the point is not that Parliament should not scrutinise to the best of its ability--it should, although the Opposition have not helped the process. We tend to get bogged down on matters other than the real issues, in particular the technical difficulties of financial legislation. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon must accept that a constituency outside Parliament and this Committee also needs to be involved, which was the point obliquely made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We should consult the financial community, which has to deal with and implement the legislation with customers, companies and individuals. The process of regulation enables it to be consulted. That would not happen if the consultation procedure was limited to the passage of the Finance Bill. For all those reasons, we cannot accept the amendment, and if the Opposition wish to press it to a Division, we shall resist it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Paymaster General has shown no understanding or appreciation of the gravity of the issues that we have raised. We are discussing the rights and privileges of the House of Commons on taxation matters in defence of our constituents. We shall press the amendment to a Division so that we can see which hon. Members and which political parties take a stand. It is in the interests of the Government and tax departments to tip the advantage in favour of the Executive and against the taxpayer in cases of dispute or ambiguity. Such matters should be resolved openly, transparently and by debate in the House of Commons. That is our historic right and those who gave us that right expect us to discharge it.
<P>
The Paymaster General kindly offered to circulate a memorandum on the use of regulations and we look forward to receiving that. It will be a genuine contribution to the debate and we shall return to the matter when discussing future clauses and schedules, possibly on the Floor of the House. The issue is a recurring theme in the Bill and we shall welcome his defence of the present situation.
<P>
The bluster and confusion in the Paymaster General's speech did nothing to allay our concerns. Without further debate, and in the knowledge that we shall return to the matter, I shall press the amendment to a Division.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to schedule 4 stand part. I was tolerant in allowing the debate on amendments to the schedule to run rather wide, especially on amendment No. 27, which, in many ways, went to the heart of the schedule. Therefore, I shall not be tolerant if hon. Members repeat during the stand part debate speeches that have been made in relation to previous amendments. Indeed, I shall use my power to ask hon. Members to resume their seats if they try to do so. Subject to that caveat, let us proceed.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I wish to return to a particular point about scrutiny of the schedule. I know that the Paymaster General does not believe in scrutinising regulations and clauses in Standing Committee, but although I have been here for a much shorter time than he has, I thought that that was part of our job.
<P>
It seems to me--I hope that the Paymaster General will take this in the constructive spirit in which it is intended--that lines 23 to 28 on page 164 are ambiguous. I read those lines as saying that subsections (1) and (2), in which the regulations that we are debating are set out, shall not apply to companies in relation to which regulations under section 59E of the Taxes Management Act 1970 are modified, in relation to the accounting period to which the corporation tax in question relates. That means that where the Taxes Management Act is used to modify the payment date in respect of a specific accounting period for corporation tax, the regulations do not apply. That is a narrow qualification and limitation on the application of the regulations. 
<P>
I submit that where section 59E of the Taxes Management Act is used to modify payment periods and timings generally, not just in respect of one specific accounting period, subsection (3) does not apply. As, I believe, the Paymaster General is referring to the modification under the Taxes Management Act of payment timings for large companies, which have a general application and which are not intended to apply to one specific accounting period, I do not believe that lines 23 to 28 have the effect of limiting regulations under this section only in relation to small companies unaffected by the new timing system.
<P>
It is very hard for us to find the ideal clause under which to table amendments, but when we find a suitable clause, we shall be entitled to table amendments. In that context, it is entirely legitimate to interpret subsection (3) as I have done. If I am right that subsection (3) is defective because it is ambiguous, I urge the Committee to vote against it until the Government get their act together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to draw my hon. Friend's attention to subsection (4), which says that where section 59DA(2) of the Taxes Management Act is used in relation to those companies, the Treasury may make other regulations. I suspect that subsection (4), rather than subsection (3), gives the Government the wider powers. That is how schedules such as this become so dangerous; they incorporate wide powers. If I am incorrect, no doubt the Paymaster General or my hon. Friend will correct me.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I hope that the Paymaster General will enlighten us because he has the advantage of the technical advice, support and expertise that forms part of the power of the Executive, and which is being used to oppress debate in this instance.
<P>
I understand subsection (4) as saying that, as another part of the Management Act enables the Treasury to make regulations that will apply to small companies, if the Treasury exercises its powers under section 59DA(2) of the Taxes Management Act in relation to those companies, that will not exclude that group of companies from being subject to regulations under the schedule. So I think that subsection (3) excludes large companies from the schedule's ambit. That is where I take issue with my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I do not think that there is an issue between the hon. Gentleman and myself. If he reads the schedule carefully, he will see that my comments are correct. However, that is not the issue--it is wrong to say that I adopted a technical position in order to suppress debate. I did not; I invited debate, despite the fact that the matter is not ambiguous. When the hon Gentleman has studied the accounting periods and interpreted the text correctly I hope that he will agree that it is not ambiguous. But that is not the point. I drew the matter to his attention only in passing, and I accepted the need for a debate. We discussed the merits of the case, which have not changed, and I continue to reject the Opposition's arguments. All the advice that we have received is that there is no problem, and I invite Labour Members--and dissident Opposition Members--to support the Government's proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 21, line 30, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1B) The Board may enter into arrangements with a member of a consortium for the member to offset its share of an overpayment of corporation tax by the consortium company against its corporation tax liability, or that of members of its group of companies, for the accounting period to which the arrangements relate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee for long with this technical amendment, which introduces the concept of tertiary legislation. It is not a new concept, especially for the Government, but it is worth emphasising that we are keeping an eye open for such arrangements.
<P>
The profession is concerned about the increasing amount of tertiary legislation. For example, a board may enter into arrangements that are not subject to any scrutiny. Those arrangements come one stage lower than statutory instruments and regulations. My criticism applies to this Government and to many others, but that mechanism is increasingly used to implement administrative taxation arrangements. It would be better if such arrangements were incorporated into a statutory instrument or into primary legislation.
<P>
The notes on clauses refer not to consortium companies but to groups of companies that can enter into arrangements to pay one another's corporation tax liabilities, have offsetting arrangements and can obtain repayments of overpayments that relate to other companies. Fine--but there are occasions when a company in a group has a share in a consortium, and it may be convenient for the tax liability of that consortium company to be paid in part by the members of the consortium belonging to other groups.
<P>
The amendment is probably technically defective, and it refers not to underpayment but to overpayment. It also recognises a consortium company's need to obtain repayment of the overpayment of corporation tax. The point has been well made that there should be some arrangement by which consortium companies can enter into arrangements for convenience to have their corporation tax liabilities met by other members of a consortium, and by which overpaid corporation tax can be repaid to members of that consortium.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The amendment would extend the proposed group payment arrangements to consortiums. Given the looser association between consortium members and consortium companies, as opposed to companies in groups, extending the special group payment facilities in the proposed way could lead to extended complications. For example, it is possible for a company to be a member of more than one consortium, and a consortium company may end up simultaneously belonging to a number of different group payment facilities. Moreover, companies may move into or out of consortium relationships more frequently than they move into or out of group relationships. The hon. Gentleman will know of consortiums that formed for particular purposes and which subsequently disbanded.
<P>
It would be difficult for companies and the Inland Revenue to cope with such arrangements. If group payment arrangements were extended to consortiums, companies that took advantage might find that their administrative costs went up, not down.
<P>
We have not received a single representation on this issue as part of the consultation on the introduction of quarterly instalment payments of corporation tax by large companies. On the contrary, we have received many representations on the issue of group payments and we have responded to companies' legitimate concerns to greatly simplify the way in which they can claim group relief.
<P>
It is also interesting to note that, although the existing law allows companies in groups some scope to transfer their corporation tax payments between one another, it does not give the same freedom to consortiums. We have therefore not taken any rights away in that respect.
<P>
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has a specific category or case in mind. If he has, it would be helpful if he were to write to me separately or raise the issue now. There has not been a single representation on this matter. In response to a genuine point made to us during consultation, we have put in place much-simplified arrangements for group payment facilities--I may have said group relief before, and we shall discuss this matter when we reach a subsequent amendment and clause stand part debate--whereby groups will no longer have to account for their individual companies. For those reasons, and to avoid the inevitable complications, I do not agree that the arrangements for groups should be extended to consortiums. If the hon. Gentleman seeks to press the amendment to a vote, I would urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Perhaps people are now sending their representations to me rather than to the Government. I will suggest to those who have made representations to me that they send them to the Government.
<P>
The amendment seeks an option for companies to enter into these arrangements and, in view of the exchange that we have had in this Committee, I hope that the Inland Revenue will take into account the possibility of giving consortium members the option of including their consortium interests in those arrangements. Once the Government receive the representation from the company that has written to me, perhaps they will bear that in mind. In light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 21, line 39, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(da) may make provision for cases in which some or all of the members of a group of companies are subject to seasonal variations in taxable profits;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment:
<P>
No. 9, in page 21, line 39, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(da) may make provision for members of a group of companies to elect to base their corporation tax payments on the previous year's taxable profits;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments strike at the roots of the problems connected to the quarterly payment arrangements. Amendment No. 8 in particular deals with situations where a company does not generate its profits evenly throughout the year but, perhaps, during one season of the year. The profits of companies engaged in the retail trade, for example, are generated--generally speaking--in December or November of any particular year. Such companies generally have a January or February year end and their profits therefore tend to be skewed towards the latter part of the year. But the quarterly payment arrangements require such companies to determine the level of their profits after six months, after which time they have to make their first payment.
<P>
One might ask why such companies do not change their year end, so that the profits generated around Christmas occur at the beginning of the accounting period and a proper profit assessment can be made. The reality is that if such retail groups are, for example, quoted on the stock exchange, their investors will want to see an early indication of the results in the most important period of the year. That is why retail companies tend to have a January or February year end.
<P>
One or two large retail groups have told me that if they were to change their year end, which would mean that investors would learn of the Christmas results nine or 10 months after Christmas, the company's value would decline on the stock market because of the increased risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Would my hon. Friend care to reflect on the fact that changing the year end vis-a-vis Christmas trading would not avoid the problems that some companies have because of seasonal variations earlier in the year? Summer trading, cold snaps and summers that are not particularly hot all affect the profits of such companies at times other than Christmas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Changes of fashion, as well as sudden changes in the weather, can occur during a year. I have been round a number of supermarkets in my constituency and the effect of weather on the sale of, for example, lettuces and salad cream is phenomenal. Some large retail grocery stores are spending an enormous amount of money on weather forecasting because that has a direct impact on stock levels in their stores. The weather may also cause a complete change of fashion which can seriously damage the profitability calculations of fashion companies.
<P>
The purpose of my amendment is to encourage the Government, when developing their regulations, to include a method of taking account of seasonal variation which companies may opt for. In the notes on clauses the Government quote a number of other jurisdictions where quarterly payments have been introduced. In all those jurisdictions the calculation of estimates is based on prior year results or there is a system that can be used by companies that are subject to seasonal variations in their profits. The British Retail Consortium is particularly concerned about seasonal variation in profits and quoted an example. If a company in the United States generates more than 70 per cent. of its profits in the second six months of an accounting period, it can opt for a seasonal method of calculation which takes account of the first two quarterly payments and the proportion of those profits that would normally arise in the first half of the year. The previous three years' trading patterns are examined to determine what the proportion should be. That is a sensible method of providing some relief for companies with seasonal variation in profits.
<P>
Retail companies may find themselves paying corporation tax on profits which they have not earned and many retail groups must borrow to pay the tax. The 70 per cent. test in the United States underestimates the effect on some groups of retail companies which generate an enormous proportion of their profits in the last two months of the year. They may have genuine difficulty in finding the cash to pay corporation tax in the first half of the year. That will add to their costs and inconvenience.
<P>
In conclusion, I urge the Government to come up with some relief to enable companies to vary their estimate of quarterly payments based on their past trading record so that account can be taken of any seasonal variation in their profits, whether the sort of variations demonstrated by the British Retail Consortium, the tourist industry, which generates a high proportion of its profits in the summer, or the fashion industry which may suffer sudden changes in fashion that can effect their profits. Whatever the difficulties faced by those companies, I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, which would provide the power to introduce in regulations a more humane and sympathetic system of relief for companies facing those problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 9. The clause covers the tax-paying arrangements for groups of companies. The amendment covers many of the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. The background is that payments on account give the Treasury an enormous and continuing cash flow advantage. The Confederation of British Industry in a Budget submission stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Despite the associated cut in the corporation tax rate, the Government's cash flow will still benefit from the latest changes during the 4-year transition--with around &#163;2 billion a year arising from the replacement of ACT and only &#163;1 billion given back through the rate cut from 31 per cent. to 30 per cent.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>A huge additional burden of taxation is being placed on British business. That is an established fact and not simply an opinion.
<P>
The CBI and others have noted that, had the Government wished to make the change neutral, they could have postponed the date of interim payments by two months. That would have rendered the arrangement neutral in revenue terms. The Government could also have done what a number of my hon. Friends ingeniously suggested, which is temporarily to cut the rate of corporation tax further to offset the cash flow disadvantage.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government did not do any of those things because they needed the extra revenue. They thought that they had found a wonderful way of raising tax without appearing to do so. The effective rate of corporation tax increased even though the nominal rate went down. Not only will the cash flow disadvantage hit investment and employment, but the way in which it is being demanded will create a great deal of administrative difficulty.
<P>
Companies will find it difficult to know whether they are to be subjected to the payment system which they come into if their profits are above a certain rate. If their profits are on the margin, they will not know until the end of the year whether they come into the system. Some companies will enter an accounting period with no clear idea of whether they are to be subjected to the required payments. They will have to guess and may be wrong in retrospect, having already made the interim payments. Then there are the difficulties touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about predicting the level of profit even if a company is on one side or other of the dividing line.
<P>
Some disparaging remarks were made about us bean-counters on the Opposition Benches. At least we are familiar with the problems of assessing taxation due retrospectively. To calculate the profit and the taxable profit after a year end is difficult enough. I spent much of my professional life trying to discover what tax was due well after an accounting period had ended, which sometimes involved difficult calculations and discussions with the Inland Revenue. Companies are being asked to predict profit before they are halfway through an accounting period. In the case of seasonal companies, that is well nigh impossible and extremely unfair. Many companies in the tourist industry make much of their profit in just a few months of the year, and they will be required to pay tax on those profits before they are earned.
<P>
Then there is the difficulty, especially with large companies, of knowing what will happen towards the end of an accounting peirod when overseas dividends arise. Unexpected exchange rate changes would render those dividends higher or lower than expected. There is also the matter of group relief, which is a complex subject. It is often not known what group relief will be available until after the end of an accounting period. What tax is due is not known with any certainty until a long time after an accounting period, and certainly not halfway through it. Nevertheless, companies are being required to estimate their profits and to make interim payments.
<P>
The problem has been understood by other countries in other tax jurisdictions. In the United States, for instance, a menu of options is available to companies so that they can choose how to make advance payments. That is why we have tabled a simple proposal that companies should have the option of paying on a prior-year basis. Not only would that get over the problems of estimating but it would avoid many of the disputes with the Inland Revenue that will arise under the present system. There is a difficult enough relationship between companies and the Inland Revenue at present; with the best will in the world, there are frequent disputes between taxpayers and the Inland Revenue. They will be much worse when companies, in good faith, makes estimates that turn out to be erroneous, and the Inland Revenue alleges that their underestimates are deliberate.
<P>
A company may say that it made a large, unexpected capital gain at the end of the year, which increased its profits and that, in retrospect, the tax payable would now seem to be higher, but that it was an innocent mistake. The Inland Revenue will then say that the company should have foreseen the capital gain and will demand to see letters, documents and company minutes, in order to ascertain whether the board discussed the likelihood of a capital gain or overseas dividend. The dispute will go backwards and forwards between the Inland Revenue and the company, yet it will be all pointless and needless. If the company were to opt to be taxed on the basis of prior profits, it would overcome all the difficulties that have been described. That would also be fully in line with what is done in other countries.
<P>
So, in the spirit of consultation, I ask the Paymaster General to reconsider because, at the present time, as well as being an institutionalised hit on some of our most important companies, the provision sows the seeds of further disagreement between companies and the Inland Revenue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I do not know whether I am in order to raise a general point on clause 36, but there is a technical difficulty with the clause in that it seems to give the Inland Revenue the right to double recovery of tax after the arrangements envisaged in the clause have been entered into. There is no provision to the effect that a payment by one company on account of the tax liability of another would discharge that tax liability, which could give rise to problems, especially on insolvency or sale of shares. I believe that representations have been made to Ministers on this point, and I hope that the Paymaster General will undertake to review the clause to ensure the removal of that anomaly.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I rise merely to point out that the denial of the previous proposal--that there should be equality in the treatment of interest for overpayments in one period and underpayments in another--makes it all the more necessary that the Committee should accept amendment No. 9 because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton explained, it will be difficult for companies to calculate their profits.
<P>
We have heard about the situation of companies in the retail sector. We might also consider the problems of companies in the construction sector, which are often involved in contracts that extend over a long period of time. It is difficult for them to calculate, from one period to the next, what their profits on a contract are. Payment for such contracts may be difficult to calculate and may be subject to negotiation between the parties, so companies will be in the invidious position of having to pay tax on bills that they have raised when there is no certainty that they will be paid. Then, in the subsequent period--when they have negotiated a change to the terms of the contract or modifications to the amount that they will be paid--they will be required to reassess tax for that period, and get the Revenue to agree that the tax charge for the previous period should be reduced, before the amount of their overpayment in the earlier period is paid back to them. Without the interests provisions that we proposed in previous amendments, they will be exposed to a penalty. The Government tell us--at least they tell themselves--that they are trying not to penalise companies, but that is what they will do.
<P>
I support the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells because it would introduce an element of certainty into the way in which Governments proceed. It is important for companies to be able to choose the current year or the previous year. A company in the construction industry, for example, could have wide fluctuations of profit and it may face good years and bad years. If the company elected to pay tax on a previous-year basis, in a subsequent bad year it might suffer extreme difficulties. It would make a loss, but it would have to continue paying tax on the basis of its previous year's profits. Those companies should be able to choose the basis on which they will be taxed.
<P>
With that proviso, companies will know with certainty what they are doing. In the absence of a more flexible approach, which we urged the Government to adopt in relation to schedule 4, it behoves the Government to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The best way to make progress with amendments Nos. 8 and 9 is to discuss them in general terms and to reply to specific points that have been raised.
<P>
It is surprising that Opposition Members tabled amendment No. 8 because we have already dealt with the matter in our debate on clause 30 on the Floor of the House. However, the hon. Member for Guildford said that it had been difficult to table appropriate amendments and I do not mind dealing with the amendment now.
<P>
As I said in that debate, the regulation-making powers in clause 30 are wide enough to allow the instalment regulations--which govern the payment by large companies of their corporation tax by instalments from 1999--to make special rules for companies with seasonal trades. The clause is already wide enough to do that, and the amendment is not needed. There is nothing in the clause that would preclude the making of such special rules. That is not surprising. Group payment arrangements are concerned with the way in which corporation tax is paid by companies within a group rather than with the way in which their tax bills are worked out. The amendment is therefore superfluous. The Opposition are simply making another attempt to return to clause 30.
<P>
In our debate on the Floor of the House, I said of seasonal trades that we had received a representation from the BRC, to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has referred today. I said that it had proposed a special scheme for companies that consistently made less than 30 per cent. of their profits in the first half year. The 30 per cent. rule would greatly add to the complexity of instalment rules, and it would benefit only a few companies. If a company pays for only one quarter or one half year, it is by definition underpaying relative to the level of profits in the other half year, and that may cause a cash-flow problem. Most companies are profitable. Provided that they meet the ongoing solvency rules of the relevant Companies Acts, most of them have no problem borrowing--if they have to--to make payments. They will also receive interest during the periods when they are underpaying--relatively speaking--in relation to profits. There is a net difference on interest, which will not be compensated for, but in the context of the major change that we propose to make to the corporate tax regime, I cannot accept that that is a significant matter.
<P>
We agreed to consider the BRC's suggestions. As Opposition Members will know, the consultation period on the regulations will not end until 15 July. We shall re-examine the draft regulations in the context of the BRC's proposals and we shall inform the House of our view. I am not positive about the BRC's proposals, but we shall consider them.
<P>
Amendment No. 9 also raises an issue that relates more properly to clause 30 than to clause 38. The amendment is not relevant to clause 36 because group payment arrangements are concerned with the way in which corporation tax is paid by companies within a group, which does not relate to the way in which their tax bills are calculated. Again, the amendment is superfluous.
<P>
Only large companies are affected by the instalments system for corporation tax payments, so only large companies will have to make instalment payments that are based on current-year estimates.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells made a legitimate point about a small company that is at the &#163;1.5 million limit and thinks that it may or may not be coming into the instalment period. We have envisaged that situation and laid down in paragraph 3 of regulation 3 of the draft regulations how we would approach it and what the criteria would be. There is no question of a company unexpectedly moving from one category to the other. We would welcome Opposition Members joining the debate on how the transition should be arranged and what the criteria should be for the movement from one category to the other. Those discussions are taking place and I believe that our proposed arrangements are adequate for the purpose.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have to say that we have also consulted widely on the details of the instalment system. A number of companies told us that they can cope with making payments based on their estimated current year's corporation tax bill. We have made a number of changes to the tax code to make that easier for them. We are not forcing the change on them. I understand that there are different views on the matter, such as those held by the retailers and the seasonal traders, and I appreciate why some companies would prefer to go on a previous year's performance.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells referred to the American system. Despite what he said about the menu of options, the bulk of companies on the yearly instalment basis in the United States pay the whole of the tax in the current year. It is clear from our proposals that only six months will be paid in the year in which the tax arises. That is a considerable improvement on the American system.
<P>
Although we received many responses suggesting that some or all instalment payments of a large company should be based on the previous year's tax liability, they were nearly always accompanied by the request that it should be an option to switch to a current year basis in the event of a downturn in profitability. That is having one's cake and eating it. The Government have had to opt for one system and we have chosen the right one. It will be more advantageous than the French or American systems. It seems to me that we have the balance right.
<P>
A specific point was also made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon who has clearly been well beiefed. I hope to be able to allay his reservations. I think that he was asking whether the Inland Revenue has the right of double recovery of tax in a group accounting arrangement and whether there is a provision to the effect that a payment by one company on account of another discharges that tax.
<P>
We understand the concern. Subsection (1) makes it plain that group payment arrangements involve one company discharging another company's tax liability. That is sufficient to meet the concern raised. In any event, it is clear that no group of companies would enter into a group payment arrangement with the Inland Revenue if that were not so. That is self-evident. I assure the Committee that we have not authorised the Inland Revenue to incur the costs necessarily associated with putting group payment arrangements in place only to find that they are so unattractive that no groups want to enter into them. When the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon reflects on what I have said, he will see the logic of what we have done.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman address the Chair because it is difficult for me and Hansard to hear him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Butterfill. I was responding to a specific point raised by the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he has fully understood me.
<P>
Although the amendments do not relate to the clause, I do not wish to avoid debating them. As for seasonality, we will consider and report on the 30 per cent. proposal put forward by the BRC. With regard to the pattern of in-year instalments, I hope that I have allayed the Opposition's remaining fears on the movement of smaller companies into the in-year instalments system. Detailed arrangements for that are set out in the regulations.
<P>
We cannot accept superfluous amendments. If the Opposition still wish to put them to a vote, I advise the Committee to reject them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Paymaster General suggested that the amendments do not relate to the clause. If that were the case, Mr. Butterfill, you would not have selected them for debate. However, he then graciously said that he did not object to dealing with them now. It is his job to answer the amendments that are correctly tabled, as I am sure you will confirm, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
First, I shall deal with amendment No. 8. I welcome the Paymaster General's comments, which he originally made on the Floor of the House. Our point is not just that special rules can be made, but that they hopefully will be made. We hope that he will consider representations made by the retail trade. Perhaps he, like me, has received a letter from Signet Group, a jewellery retailer that employs approximately 6,000 people, some of whom are my constitutents. Signet said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We will need to borrow funds to pay 50 per cent. of our annual tax liability in advance, which will result in punitive interest costs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To his credit, the Paymaster General did not dodge that issue. He said that a net difference in interest might well arise for certain companies. I hope that he will reassure us that consultations with the retail industry are genuine, because cases such as Signet's may well arise where a company has to make two payments before it reaches the most profitable payment period. Without some flexibility, the retail trade in particular will be disadvantaged.
<P>
Amendment No. 9, although slightly separate from amendment No. 8, would help the Government to deal with it. Here the Paymaster General's response was less than satisfactory. He said that help with the transition would be given, which we welcome. He also said that only very large companies will be affected. However, such companies can have as much difficulty in making estimates as small ones.
<P>
The Paymaster General then suggested that several companies had told him that they could cope with the change. He elsewhere suggested that some companies would actually prefer the change. That is an issue on which we must focus. If some companies would prefer the change and some would not, why not offer the choice? The change may well suit those companies that can easily estimate profits, although it may not suit others. Would the running of two systems from which companies could elect cause technical difficulties?
<P>
The second point is that, even for very large companies, a huge amount of guess-work is involved. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, who is a well-known professional bean-counter, and who is experienced in such matters, illustrated well how difficult it is to estimate profits rather than liability. Contrary and quite unexpected changes in the exchange rate may occur. Very large capital gains, such as an overseas dividend, may occur towards the end of a particular financial year. The estimating of profits ahead, rather than of past liabilities, is therefore a hazardous and difficult job.
<P>
The third point, on which we have not touched, is the cost of compliance. The quarterly forecasts will entail a huge management exercise, even for the largest companies. They must cope not only with the Bill's changes to transfer pricing and to the control of foreign companies, but with the huge management cost that the forecasts will entail. If such companies make incorrect forecasts--either deliberatley or through negligence--they will be liable to a penalty. More management time will therefore have to be devoted to getting the forecasts right. I hope that the Paymaster General will further reassure us on those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I think that I can reassure the hon. Member for Sevenoaks on that point. I do not know what his experience is of the sort of company that will have to deal with in-year instalments, but my experience is of relatively small companies, which will not be affected by it. In addition to a three-year forecast, companies also have detailed budgets for one year ahead. That budget provides a balance sheet for the month, reconciled with the cash situation, and a profit forecast for every quarter, as well as for the whole year. That is done in detail, and the next two years are calculated on a quarterly basis, but there are still balance sheets reconciled with the cash position.
<P>
To deal with the year in question, every company with which I have been involved has always produced an annual forecast and monthly forecasts within the annual forecast. That is how companies that come within the provision will proceed. Of course, in the best laid plans things can go wrong, and management action is required to put things right. Every company has to do that. If things are put right and the forecast is changed during the year, the profits will be downgraded and so will the tax liability in respect of those profits. So there is not a big problem, nor a big burden, and no great cost is involved. All that is part of running a business subject to proper commercial disciplines. I also want to reassure the hon. Member for Sevenoaks on the issue of transition. I was not really speaking about the transition for big companies from the ACT system, with all its complications, to the in-year instalments basis, but the hon. Gentleman is right, and if he checks the regulations he will find that they contain adequate transitional arrangements, whereby a negative cash flow for companies over that period will be offset against the on-going benefit--a net present value added benefit of around &#163;8 billion from the changes in corporation tax. The general welcome for our proposals suggests that we have got that right.
<P>
I was referring not to the transition of big companies from one system to another but to the much more difficult situation in which a small company, approaching the &#163;1.5 million level, suddenly finds itself catapulted into a completely new set of arrangements for in-year instalments. If the hon. Gentleman checks--I think that it is in section 3 of the regulations--he will find that we set out a series of criteria that will apply over a period of time before a company can move from one system to another. Medum-sized companies were taken out of the in-year instalments system as a result of consultation with the CBI and the industry generally. We have made adequate transitional arrangements and, with the one exception of the provisions relating to cash flow, the new system has received widespread support.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford raised a fair question about the construction industry, but one should consider profit only where it arises. If one starts to consider profit on work in progress before the contract is completed or a clear accounting point in the contract is specified, one gets into terrible problems. That creates tremendous dangers of overstating profit, or understating it, but more probably the former. Therefore, a company should consider profit only when it crystallises--when the contract finishes or reaches a particular stage that is known in advance and which the company will have in its budget. The pattern of profits throughout the year, or for two to three years in the case of a long-term contract, will be set out by the company and it will pay tax in respect of those profits, and not in respect of any irrelevant considerations.
<P>
Of course, if the contract goes horribly badly, the company will adjust its profit forecast in relation to the difficulty that it is experiencing with the long-term contract, and pay less tax. If the contract goes especially well and the company uprates its profits on the contract, as and when those profits emerge--or, more naturally, at the end of the contract--the company will pay tax, according to its forecast, when the profit crystallises.
<P>
In all those ways, it is clear that the system is workable. In the second year, once the transitional period has been completed, it will yield up to &#163;2 billion to companies with a large net present value. In the interim, there is an element of negative cash flow because, as I have said before, that is a one-off effect. The benefit of the reduction in corporation tax is an on-going benefit, and as the Government have committed themselves to those levels of corporation tax for the whole of this Parliament, it is a pro-business Budget and a pro-business reform of corporation tax.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It maybe for the convenience of right hon. and hon. Members to know that the Committee Room will be locked during the afternoon, so they may leave their papers until we come back at 4.30 pm.
