<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I wish the Under-Secretary a happy birthday. I welcome her to her next decade. We hope that she has a happy day and that she is not too bored with us.
<P>
Might I have an update from the Minister of State on the situation after the Government's little local difficulty last Tuesday?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B>
<P>
Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. We also offer greetings to the Under-Secretary: 39 seems a wonderful age.
<P>
I thank the Opposition, and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) in particular, for their co-operation on Tuesday. What happened was necessary for the good order of our discussion, and we are grateful to them. I promise to give the Committee an update of our position at about ten minutes to 5, before we finish our second sitting of the day. I should probably be able to say by then that things might happen tomorrow or on Monday. We expect to be able to act much quicker than had seemed possible on Tuesday. I shall be able to give a more up to date and accurate report on the situation this afternoon than I can now—I do not know what will happen today.
<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Member-nominated trustees</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 269, in page 31, line 12, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In subsection (8) (persons ceasing to be member-nominated trustees on ceasing to be qualifying members of the scheme)—
<P>
(a) for ``The arrangements must'' there shall be substituted ``The arrangements—
<P>
 (a) must''; and
<P>
(b) at the end there shall be inserted ``; and
<P>
 (b) may provide for a member-nominated trustee who—
<P>
 (i) is a qualifying member of one of the following descriptions, that is to say, an active, deferred or pensioner member, and
<P>
 (ii) ceases (without ceasing to be a qualifying member) to be a qualifying member of that description,
<P>
 to cease, by virtue of that fact, to be a trustee.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 271.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Clauses 33 to 36 make changes to the Pensions Act 1995 which govern the appointment of member-nominated trustees and directors to the boards of occupational pension schemes. Amendments Nos. 269 and 270 amend clauses 33 and 34. The amendments make the same change; one of the clauses operates in respect of member-nominated trustees, the other in respect of corporate trustees. The amendments correct an accidental omission For convenience, I shall refer only to member-nominated trustees, for everything will apply equally to member-nominated directors, who are the subject of clause 34.
<P>
The amendment will allow nomination and selection arrangements to include a provision for member-nominated trustees to stand down automatically if they change the category of membership. If an active member leaves to take up employment elsewhere and becomes a deferred member, the individual will be able to cease to be a trustee.
<P>
The power is permissive. Such a rule will not be adopted without a conscious decision by the trustee or the employer. If such a rule is adopted, a trustee required to stand down will, of course, have the opportunity to stand for reselection, and the members may decide whether they want the person to serve as a member-nominated trustee. Such people will still be members of a scheme, although their category has changed. It is reasonable to give the membership the opportunity to decide whether they want a deferred member who was originally nominated when an active member to continue, or whether they want to nominate someone else.
<P>
Without the amendments, we will not give full effect to the proposals in the consultation paper issued on 1 October. They were developed in consultation with key organisations in the pensions industry, which fully support them. As I said, they correct an accidental omission.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 270, in page 31, line 18, after `which' insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and the time within which,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 272.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The amendments make the same changes as the previous two amendments considered and also apply to clauses 33 and 34. One deals with member-nominated trustees, the other with member-nominated directors. For convenience I shall refer only to member-nominated trustees.
<P>
The amendments correct an oversight in the drafting of the clauses. An equivalent regulation-making power is contained in section 21(4)(b) of the Pensions Act 1995, under which regulations are in force. We always intended to carry that power forward to the new provisions. As it stands, the Bill removes section 21(4)(b) from the 1995 Act without making similar provision elsewhere. The amendments restore that provision.
<P>
The amendments enable us to continue to provide a time limit within which member-nominated trustees must be nominated and selected in accordance with the arrangements. The regulations will prescribe a time limit of six months for the nomination and selection of member-nominated trustees. That is the current limit, so there is nothing new in the amendments. Not only will members have to make the arrangements, but they will have to put them into operation. Without the amendments, there would be a small loophole in the Bill. We do not want to allow such loopholes to remain.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 237, in page 31, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`9(A)(a) The Secretary of State shall make regulations providing that all trustees will be provided with adequate training to enable them to carry out their responsibilities.
<P>
(b) These regulations shall also prescribe the content of such training.
<P>
(c) This training shall be provided at the expense of the pension fund.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not planning to hold up progress today—[Interruption] I thought that it would be nice to reassure the Committee on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady has not been holding up progress today.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am delighted to hear the right hon. Gentleman express that view. [Interruption.] And at least the Whip is present to hear it.
<P>
The amendment deals with the provision of training for trustees who require it. I remember listening to long discussions about the training of trustees during consideration of the Bill that became the Pensions Act 1995. Anybody who has had experience of occupational pension funds will know how heavy, difficult and often bewildering the rules, regulations and legal responsibilities are for the trustee of a pension fund. Although many trustees are well equipped, those who come from the members will often need more help. The issue has been circulating for a long time, and some responsible employers and many trade unions have provided training. I am happy to learn from the experts on the Labour Benches, but I understand that there has been a noticeable diminution in the amount of training that trade unions can provide, largely because of their declining membership. Not only will that deter willing volunteers who are unaware of the relevant issues from becoming trustees; it will discourage people from volunteering at all. A large number of trusts will have to be created under the stakeholder pension scheme envisaged by the Government, so there will be a huge demand for people who are willing to serve as volunteers.
<P>
The question of who should pay for training has always been problematic. As I have said, companies will sometimes pay for it, especially well funded, responsible companies. Trade unions will sometimes pay for it and some members may take the matter sufficiently seriously to fund it themselves. It occurred to us that the best way to fund training would be to pay for it out of the expenses of the pension fund.
<P>
I am well aware that the primary duty of trustees, and indeed anyone involved with the management of pensioners' and potential pensioners' money, is to produce the best possible return on the money invested and to ensure that money is put into a wide range of investments, including gilts, equities and property portfolios, in a sensible, well run fund. The costs of fund managers obviously fall on the pension fund, and it occurred to me that, in ensuring that pension funds are as well run as possible, where necessary, the training of trustees should be paid for out of the pension fund, but without diluting the return on the investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): For the assistance of those of us who are unfamiliar with the responsibilities of a trustee, my hon. Friend say what order of costs she anticipates will be incurred? Presumably, that will depend on the sort of training that is involved, so will she also say what sort of training would be required?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I envisage that training would relate to how stock markets, property markets and the gilts system work, as well as to the legal responsibilities of trustees. As my hon. Friend is undoubtedly aware, if something goes wrong, trustees can find themselves exposed both financially and legally. I confess that I have not worked it out, but I would have thought that the cost would be modest compared with the cost of paying fund managers to manage the money. There are not that many trustees on the board of any pension fund, although that depends on its size. We want trustees to have the highest quality training, and I would not suggest that a pension fund should spend money on anything other than professional training, but in the scale of things, the cost of professional trainers would be at the margins rather than a huge percentage.
<P>
It is crucial that trustees are properly trained and aware of their responsibilities. The result of not properly training trustees could be disastrous for a pension fund. That could lead to trustees agreeing to do something illegal without realising it, or failing to produce the best return for pensioners. We are looking for a breed of person to volunteer for trusteeship who can acquire a huge range of new skills. We must ensure that the people who become trustees are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge so that they do not feel that they have been dragooned into, for example, an investment programme or change in the rules without being aware of the consequences. The ability to provide for the necessary training out of the pension fund is key to the amendment. There is no disagreement on the need to train trustees. The solution, as I said to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), is not highly expensive. It would not penalise pensioners or potential pensioners, but it would ensure that they are secure in the knowledge that the people who are looking after their money have an idea of what they are doing and are equipped to carry out their role as trustees.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Minister of State looks kindly on the suggestion, it will bring relief and comfort to trustees who are not as well equipped as they would like to be. They often find it difficult to get the information and help that they need. It will also reassure members of occupational pension schemes that their money is being looked after by people who are aware of what is required, which should help them to benefit from good pensions.

<P>

<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I rise to support my hon. Friend. The Government should require trustees to be properly trained in their function.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Is that actually what we are requiring? The amendment stipulates that the Government should make training available, but it does not require people to endure training if they do not need it—I may be wrong.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. I accept that my interpretation is slightly wrong.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> The hon. lady should have more confidence in her opinion. She is right and the hon. Member for New Forest, West is wrong.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> In the circumstances, I bow to the Under-Secretary, whose birthday it is today. I accept her interpretation of the amendment.
<P>
The amendment deals with an important issue. We expect a great deal from active citizens. Trustees of pension funds, school governors and magistrates are just some of the many roles that we hope people will perform. The functions are complex and there is little training, especially of councillors. Onerous legal requirements mean that individuals can face financial penalties if they do not perform properly.
<P>
If we expect more people to take on demanding roles and want to get the best out of them, training should be available. General practitioners and governors receive training. It is a modest aim to ensure that people whose job it is to protect pension funds are fully acquainted with their role. That will help them to make funds perform well and create a sustainable financial future for beneficiaries.
<P>
The role of a pension scheme trustee is diverse. It involves the management of funds and judging the returns, and the security of returns, on investments. The investments chosen will have different returns. They could include property, stocks and shares or, as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, gilts. Not only will that affect the size of the pension, but some returns will be more certain than others. Although those funds will be invested by professionals, whose job it will be to worry about such things, it is important that the trustees should be fully aware of the likely impact of those decisions on the people who will be relying on those funds to provide them with an adequate pension.
<P>
One other aspect was not mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham. I risk exciting the Minister by saying this, but some pension funds have gone astray because the trustees were not wholly aware of who had ownership of them. I think particularly of the late Robert Maxwell, who so unacceptably lifted pension funds. I have not excited the Minister yet, so I shall not point out that he was a former Labour Member of Parliament—[Interruption.] The Minister is often keen to accuse us of wickednesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Original sin is alive and well.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Pension funds have occasionally been stolen. It is important that trustees should be fully aware of that and know how to spot such criminal activity. That will be difficult if they are financially unsophisticated, given the huge sums of money invested in pension funds, especially as they grow and accumulate. Robert Maxwell is not the only one to have abused the trust of others by stealing pension funds. Other unscrupulous people may have an interest in ensuring that people are not sophisticated enough to know how things work. The trustees themselves may be complicit in such criminal activity. However, I suspect that naivety is more of a problem, and that a lack of understanding may allow unscrupulous people to steal the future security of pensioners.
<P>
If trustees receive training and are made aware of their responsibilities, it is less likely that unscrupulous people will get away with stealing funds. The trustees would be more capable of spotting that things had gone wrong. That is important not only for pensioners. I hasten to add that they are the most important people; it is they who, in good faith, are putting money aside for their old age. It is a terrifying prospect that that money might disappear. People should be assured that their money is safe and that all possible safeguards have been put in place to ensure that their investments are secure.
<P>
That is important especially because we want to encourage people to make such provisions. If the system is flawed because of a lack of security, it will be more difficult to persuade people to do the right thing and to look after themselves. They will want to know that their money is safe, and that the people looking after it are capable of making the right decisions and spotting when things go wrong.
<P>
I am not an expert in pensions or the rights and responsibilities of trustees, but my broad understanding is that trustees are subject to legal requirements affecting their behaviour and responsibilities—and their liabilities if they do something wrong. I do not mean something criminal, which would obviously involve a different sphere of the law, but actions that are negligent or taken without proper understanding. Trustees risk being prosecuted or made liable for poor decisions. They want the reassurance of knowing that they understand the relevant obligations and expectations, that they are fit to take difficult decisions with some knowledge about how the system works, and that they understand their liabilities having taken those decisions. Any reassurance that we can provide in this context will be progress in the right direction. I hope that the Government will favour, if not the amendment as tabled, its intention of reaching the best outcome for all concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): We fully support the amendment. The precise wording is a matter for debate and the Minister may argue that it is prescriptive, but the issue is important, given the expanded opportunities for members to be represented and directly nominated as trustees or directors of trusts and the potential for changeover.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) said, local education authorities and others now provide a substantial programme of training for school governors, who have acquired considerable responsibilities over the years. The Department for Education and Employment deluges governors with material. People need to build annexes to their homes for the vast quantities that they receive. Only yesterday, I saw what is provided for induction on to a governing body in my constituency. A similar amount of material is necessary to enable trustees to discharge their onerous responsibilities properly.
<P>
Is there any legal impediment to trustees purchasing appropriate training? What materials to make matters clear and easy to understand are produced by the Department for those taking on the relevant responsibilities—or considering doing so?
<P>
If I were a trustee and were presented with the Bill, I would not think twice: I would decide against going on with the job. This subject is hard to penetrate. There is a need for documents that will make it easier for people to decide whether they want to represent the interests of others in such important matters.
<P>
I support the spirit of the amendment and hope that there are ways of improving and extending training. It would be interesting to know whether at present it is possible for a trust fund to contribute to the purchase of materials and training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): Of course it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it is, but the debate implies some impediment, and it seemed to me appropriate to ask the question and get the answer on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I am not absolutely persuaded that I was incorrect in my original interpretation of the amendment. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall make regulations providing that all trustees will be provided with adequate training''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does being provided with such training require one actually to take it? I was always of the opinion that one could lead a horse to water but not force it to drink. This is a modest provision, but not as modest as some members of the Committee might anticipate. The key phrase is ``adequate training''. What does that mean, insofar as it affects the duties of a trustee? The matter could well detain the Committee for half a day, but I am instructed that we are to make progress. In that spirit, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I apologise to the Committee for having had to nip out to make an urgent call.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): What was it about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> It was not from anyone called William.
<P>
The clause is extremely important, which is why I regretted having to nip out. Not long ago, people could drift into the pensions industry without any training and sell financial services products. Sometimes that helped people—if they were sold the right product—and sometimes it did not. I am aware that the situation has changed, and rightly so. With the exception of the medical profession, the pensions industry is perhaps the most important in the country, because it provides for people's future. It affects whether people will be inadequately provided for, and poor, in their old age, or better off or even prosperous. It is thus a matter of great magnitude.
<P>
When the industry was unregulated, people could drift in and out of it, which was acknowledged as being wrong. People who are in charge of huge amounts of money should know their responsibilities and be given training to enable them better to carry out those responsibilities.
<P>
We know that, in many cases, amateurs—for want of a better word—almost run the country. I do not mean to be derogatory to Ministers, but Members of Parliament do not receive any training for the job. People can drift into Parliament—

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> And drift out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> And drift out, as my hon. Friend says. Local councillors can drift in and out of office, yet they have huge responsibilities. Juries do not receive any training; people do many jobs without any training or knowledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Long may it remain so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> My hon. Friend says, ``Long may it remain so,'' but I do not always follow the line that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. When people are dealing with large sums of money and heavy responsibilities, it seems odd that they are not required at least to achieve a certain standard.
<P>
Being the trustee of a pension fund is not just about making up the numbers at a committee meeting; it is far more important than that. The Maxwell scandal must have persuaded us that things need tightening up, and I do not object to the Government's doing so. However, at the end of the day, what is important is people's knowledge, and the fact that they are prepared to stand up for what is right and to object to what is wrong. Our modest proposals might have a significant effect, and they are thus most important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is difficult for members of the Committee to make head or tail of clause 33, and thus the amendment to subsection (7).
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Because we have no training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is partly because we have no training in these matters, as my hon. Friend says, but also because clause 33 amends section 16 of the Pensions Act 1995. It is difficult to have a meaningful debate on the measure without the original Act. If I had the original Act before me—
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We sent the appropriate paperwork to Committee members, who should have received copies of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 and of the Pensions Act 1995. You, too, Mr. O'Brien, have been sent the documents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. I am sure that you, Mr. O'Brien, read the Pensions Act 1995 from cover to cover as soon as you received it, as I did. In fact, I must confess that I did not read it, for which I apologise. I fear that I would find it difficult to understand the provisions even if I had done so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> In addition to the other documents, the hon. Gentleman has received the explanatory notes to the Bill. I shall express the purpose of the three clauses in a sentence: they together require that the trustees and directors of all schemes will be at least one-third member nominated. That is the change that has occurred as a part of the package. Others have been made, but that is what the clauses are about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful for that explanation. In some ways, it is a pity that Opposition Members must make speeches before the Minister, who will, no doubt, explain the clauses.
<P>
I have a simple purpose for speaking. Last night, I listened to a speech made by Lord Wakeham, who compared debates on the Companies Acts held in the other place with those that occurred in the House. He said that the level of knowledge and debate was much higher in the other place. Although Members of Parliament are equipped to debate many matters well, we sometimes struggle on more technical provisions such as those before the Committee.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not brush aside my hon. Friends' arguments and merely say that the amendment is unnecessary. Will he use the opportunity provided by the amendment to explain the broad thinking underlying the proposals? How do the Government want the trustees to carry out their duties? What obligations will be imposed on them and what penalties will apply if they fail to fulfil those obligations? Will the Minister also explain the other interesting matters that are at stake?
<P>
With the introduction of stakeholder pensions and other such Government initiatives, we are moving into a period in which more pension work will be available and more people will have to undertake it. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned school governors. I should have thought that being a school governor was almost a doddle in terms of intellectual difficulty when compared with the sort of work that the trustees will be obliged to undertake. I do not mean that being a school governor is a doddle in terms of political or local pressure, as there is much local interest in what school governors do. I accept that there may not be much political interest in the actions of trustees of particular schemes, but that does not mean that their work is not incredibly important. We may simply find that people do not have sufficient training to understand what is going on.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) said that trade unions have hitherto taken a leading role in training. What does their training comprise? Do they try to put any of their particular spin on trustees' duties? As I understand it, trustees must put their members' financial interests first and they cannot take any political position on investments. For example, they cannot take a line on investments that is based on an ethical consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is a fair point, but it is erroneous in the current debate. From July, all trustees will at least be required to publish information to make it known whether they have a policy on socially responsible investment. That approach was promulgated a year ago and has been accepted throughout the industry. It is not interference; it simply enables people to have a view on the policies that are being operated by the trustees. I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman is wrong, but he seems to dismiss some of the valuable work that is done by trustees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No; I would not dismiss any of the work that trustees do. They undertake crucial work for which they are unpaid. Anyone who takes on such work deserves a gold medal, but will not, I suspect, receive one. I am not decrying trustees or people who believe in an ethical dimension, or decrying what the Government have done to try to codify such matters. The debate is a useful opportunity—what the Minister says will be in Hansard, and the House may have a broader understanding of the way in which the Government feel that trustees' duties will pan out and what broad obligations will be placed on them.
<P>
The Minister will probably answer that the amendment is unnecessary; we await his comments with interest. However, I hope that he will make it clear to the Committee that it is essential for people undertaking such an onerous responsibility to have adequate training. In recent years, great responsibility has been placed on people who become non-executive directors of companies. It is no longer possible for them to turn up to the monthly board meeting, get a nice little retainer for the work and be a silent witness to what happens. Most non-executive directors entering companies now are expected to take a close interest in the regulatory side of the firm.
<P>
The role of trustees is similar. They are supposed to be upstanding members of the community, joining a board to ensure fair play and proper regulation. It would be difficult for laymen entering such work to have a real grasp of the wide range of obligations placed on them. That is why training is essential.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will adequately reassure the Committee that there will be such training and that sufficient numbers of trustees will come forward. If he does not, people will be worried about undertaking the work, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham noted.
<P>
People are increasingly worried about taking on the work—they know what has happened. The constant refrain from the Government Benches is about pension mis-selling and other pension scandals of the past. Trustees are not paid for what is a public duty. They were prepared to do it in the past, probably feeling that little pressure would be placed on them. However, in the modern world, pressure always increases.
<P>
I am worried about where people with adequate knowledge and expertise will be found. I pay tribute to people prepared to undertake such unpaid work, but how many are there? We might be moving into a new world, in which there will be an increasingly professional cadre of people prepared to undertake work on behalf of the community—as trustees and school governors, for example.
<P>
If that is the case, we should perhaps move away from the amateurish way in which the work used to be done. A mature person wanting to pay back to society some of what he or she had taken would do it as a duty, turning up once a month to an oak-panelled room in which everyone would be obsequious, and lunch or expenses for coming to London from the country might be given. It was pleasant, but such amateurish days are perhaps a thing of the past.
<P>
We are moving into a professional society in which Governments are loading onerous duties on people undertaking such public work. It is surely incumbent on the Government to convince us that the people taking on the work are given adequate training. They will say that it is not right for the cost of training to fall on public funds. We accept that, which is why the amendment speaks of the pension fund undertaking the burden of paying for training. That is entirely sensible, and the Opposition would not want to promote any measure that would increase public spending. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reassure the Committee on those points when she replies to the debate.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The first thing to say is that many trustees are already doing the job to a high standard. We are not creating an entirely new system, involving people who have no experience of the work, who will flood into trustee posts, where they will be vulnerable and need support. Listening to Opposition Members, one would imagine that trustees did not receive any training at present, but they receive a great deal of training. I reassure Opposition Members that there is already a great deal of good work going on in that area. I do not believe that there is much between the Government and the Opposition on the issues of aim and output, but the amendment is too prescriptive in the way that it attempts to achieve that aim. It is almost Stalinist.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove was right in her interpretation of the amendment, which would make trustee training compulsory and require regulations to be made to prescribe its content and place the cost on the pension fund. At the moment, many pension funds pay the cost of training, but some employers also pay. The amendment would provide that pension funds must pay for training in all circumstances. We do not want to disrupt the current arrangements, which are working extremely well. I urge Opposition Members not to become too hung up with the training methods and arrangements.
<P>
A comparison was made with school governors, but whereas all schools do similar things and implement the national curriculum, there are as many variations of pension fund as one could imagine. The hon. Member for Beckenham seemed to recognise that, because she mentioned all the different sorts of pension funds that exist and the complex decisions that those who run them must take. That is another reason why the Government should not be too prescriptive about training.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I follow the argument, but some schools also require varying amounts of commitment and knowledge. Although at one time it was possible to sit on a governing body and not do very much, the job has changed beyond recognition because of the demands made on schools and governing bodies, probably as a result of various actions by successive Governments. It seems to me that the demands on trustees will become greater because occupational and private pensions will become increasingly important in future. Therefore, I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendment would take us backwards because it is too prescriptive, but I accept that the Opposition want to ensure that trustees know what they are doing and are confident about their role. There is no difference between us in that respect, although there is some difference between us on how prescriptive we want to be in achieving that. Much has been said about Robert Maxwell. Clearly, the Pensions Act 1995 created a different framework within which all occupational pensions must operate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove went on about private pension funds, but there were some spectacular grabs of state pensions when the previous Government were in power. For example, when the National Bus Company was privatised, the Government removed large chunks of the pension fund from its members. The hon. Lady was on dodgy ground.
<P>
There is no evidence of a diminution of trade union training, which worried the hon. Member for Beckenham. She cited the decline in trade union membership as a cause of the decline in training. We do not think that there has been a decline but, should she want to campaign with me to persuade more people to join trade unions, I shall be happy to join her on a lorry, speechifying in public squares to achieve that aim.
<P>
Opposition Members hinted that the role of trustee was too complicated to be left to ordinary people and that it had to be performed by experts who had passed exams. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) seemed to advocate a cult of the expert. The role of trustees is to represent scheme members. The 1995 Act requires them to employ professional advisers—lawyers, actuaries and accountants—to do the detailed expert work, but the way in which the United Kingdom's occupational pensions industry has developed is important. Trustees are not necessarily accountants or lawyers; their role is to represent scheme members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way again. I did not say that schemes should be run by experts or professionals; I said that they should be run by trained people. Does she agree that in many complicated fraud cases, the juries are not adequately qualified to fulfil their role and are unable to cope with the level of detail? As a result, some people who were probably guilty of fraud got off. Surely that is a good analogy.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am not going to get into a discussion about trial by jury and the relative merits of juries with respect to judges, but the 1995 Act places duties and requirements on trustees to consult experts, at the appropriate time, to take care of technical matters. There is a good balance between buying in expert advice for technical matters and maintaining trustees who represent the interests of scheme members. That is better than having all lawyers or accountants together because they may deviate from the trustees' basic interests and duties.
<P>
All trustees, whether nominated by members or the employer, play a key role in occupational pension schemes. Part of their role is vital to the security and well-being of the schemes. It is their duty to ensure that the scheme is well run. They do not have to be the greatest experts on accountancy, but they need that expertise at their fingertips to call on when necessary. That is the difference.
<P>
Trustees have to ensure that the scheme complies with the law. Opra will turn to them if it is suggested that the scheme is not being properly run. They appoint professional advisers—consultants, fund managers, auditors, actuaries, accountants and lawyers—who are the experts. It is good that the two are separate. It keeps the running of the fund down to earth, and the technical and professional considerations separate but to a high standard.
<P>
Trustees must know what is required and expected of them, which is why they should be trained. As I said earlier, we agree with the goals suggested by the amendment, but not the methodology. Various questions were asked about the status of the training and how it will be funded. I can tell the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that, at the moment, the funding of training is a matter for each scheme. In some cases, the scheme pays for it; in others, the employer pays. The Government do not want to be prescriptive about who should pay. However, I am sure that we would all expect those costs to be defrayed, and it has not been suggested that that does not happen already. We do not perceive it to be a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister is making a fair point—that one should let a thousand flowers bloom and not insist on a particular form of training. Will she tell the Committee what sort of training goes on now—how long it lasts, what is to be learned and so on?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman must have been reading my mind. A wealth of trustee training material is available. Some is published by pension consultants and some by trade unions; but the Department does not publish it. The experts are already dealing with people's everyday pension expectations; their expertise is being brought to bear on the dangers, the expectations and the legislation. There are no legal impediments to producing training schemes. There is no evidence to show that any practitioners or trustees in the industry have a problem with training.
<P>
Plenty of training is available, and it is of a high standard. Opra produces a good publication that outlines the roles and responsibilities of pension scheme trustees. Advice is plentiful, and some trustee qualifications are available. The Pensions Management Institute operates a certificate of basic trustee training, and many schemes put their trustees through a short course of training.
<P>
Opposition Members should be reassured that we do not need to worry about training. We differ with them only on the question whether we should make it compulsory and be prescriptive and centralist about who should pay for it. We share the same aims as the Opposition, but we believe that the amendment is too prescriptive. I hope that the hon. Member for Beckenham will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I apologise to the Under-Secretary for not being able to give her the birthday present of helping to recruit members to trade unions, largely because they are capable of managing for themselves.
<P>
I am glad to have received the hon. Lady's reassurance that many trustees are trained. Like her, I recognise that a wide variety of training is available. However, she was being slightly disingenuous when she implied that training trustees meant training professional people such as accountants, lawyers and actuaries. We want to ensure that member trustees are adequately trained. We do not suggest that the professions need that sort of training: indeed, they are often advisers as well as trustee members. However, I accept that the amendment would need to be redrafted.
<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to the trustees who are presently being trained and to the training programmes. That is fine, but we are aware that some trustees receive no training. However responsible they are, they have to train themselves. If the hon. Lady will assure us that all trustees will not only have access to training but will not have to worry about paying for it—if the Government will give advice and guidance to reinforce the importance of training—I would be more than happy to withdraw the amendment. However, I am concerned about the huge expansion in member trustees that is likely to result from the introduction of stakeholder pensions. Therefore, I believe that there is a real need for the Government to issue advice and guidance to ensure that all member trustees are adequately trained for their roles. As the Committee has not received that reassurance, I shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I want to say a few words on clause 33. One of the problems of considering a Bill, line by line, is that there is no provision for a Minister to make introductory remarks on a group of clauses before the Committee discusses amendments. What I am about to say in this clause stand part debate applies to a group of four clauses. Government amendments Nos. 273, 274, 275 and 288 are minor amendments. I am concerned that we should not agree to clauses 34, 35 and 36 without saying something about their contents, other than my two sentence response to the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh).
<P>
Clauses 33, 34, 35 and 36 form a group of clauses that ensure that every occupational pension scheme has at least one third member-nominated trustees, or member-nominated directors if the trustee is a company. The Government believe that member-nominated trustees add value to any trustee board. Member trustees contribute their different perspectives and experiences, and help to give members confidence in their scheme and a sense of ownership. The value of member trustees is also recognised by most pension industry organisations, and many well run schemes have had ordinary members on their trustee boards for donkey's years.
<P>
The existing provisions in sections 16 to 21 of the Pensions Act 1995 have worked well, but not as well as we would like. The current provisions enable the employer to propose his own trustee arrangements, although they cannot be implemented without the approval of the members. We have been told of cases in which an employer has used that freedom to avoid including member trustees on the board. People argue that the current legislation is too complex and difficult to operate. Another regular complaint is that it is too easy to exclude pensioner members from the process. Members of the pension fund will fall into three broad categories: active members who are paying in, deferred members who have left the company and pensioner members who are receiving their pensions.
<P>
We have listened and responded to those concerns, and have conducted two rounds of consultation. Under the new provisions, every scheme will have member-nominated trustees or directors. Some schemes, including statutory ones, are exempt, but that is another matter for another debate; we are talking about private-sector occupational schemes. Employers will still have the right to propose bespoke nominations and selection arrangements for their schemes, but their proposals must provide for a minimum of one third member-nominated trustees and be approved by the members. There will be no opportunity to opt out.
<P>
The clause deals with cases in which the employer does not make a proposal or fails to gain the approval of members. For convenience, I shall refer to that as the trustee route.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I hope that the Minister will forgive my lack of knowledge on the subject, but I must say that I am still concerned about member-nominated trustees. Will he briefly explain how such trustees will be nominated and elected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, I shall come to that. Under current provisions, when the employer has not made alternative arrangements, trustees can either propose their own nomination and selection arrangements or use rules set out in regulations. If the trustees choose to make their own rules, they must put them to the scheme members—who will fall into the three categories to which I have just referred—for approval. Under the amended section 16 of the Pensions Act 1995, trustees will implement nomination and selection procedures using the framework set out in regulations. There will be no need for member approval, so the process will be cheaper and simpler.
<P>
Regulations made under amended section 16(9) of the 1995 Act will provide a framework within which trustees will have flexibility over certain aspects of the nomination and selection. For example, they will be given discretion to divide the membership into constituencies if they so choose. There will also be limitations. For example, all the active and pensioner members must be given the opportunity to make nominations. The members who stand could be divided into constituencies according to their category: whether active, deferred or pensioner. Members of all those categories must be free to stand for election.
<P>
If a selection panel is used, it should have a majority of scheme members. The Government's proposals further strengthen the legislative framework. This may be the appropriate moment to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough. One of the other clauses that we have amended would allow bodies such as trade unions or pension organisations to nominate trustees. That widens the process, although the trustees would obviously be members of the scheme.
<P>
There was a campaign for designated separate seats on the board for pensioner trustees. We have not adopted that proposal, although it is seductive and recalls to mind the case of the Lucas pensioners in my constituency, who fought their case over a surplus. We do not want such problems. Trustees are not representatives, and it does not matter how they arrive as trustees. Once people are trustees they are bound by the duties of trustees, which is crucial. All categories of pensioner will none the less be able to stand for election. We have worked with the pension industry to produce changes to give members confidence in their schemes. By and large, those changes have received widespread support. They will make it easier to make a reality of the stakeholder schemes when the legislation flows.
<P>
My remarks on clause 33 apply equally to clause 34, although that deals with member-nominated directors rather than with trustees. The member directors will be elected by the same process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will there be a postal ballot for the different groups?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> There will have to be ballot arrangements. I do not know the detail, but I am aware of postal ballots in constituencies, although I have not been involved in any. Postal ballots can be expensive—one must keep track of deferred members, especially—although it will usually be known that active members are paying and where pensioner members are. Deferred members might have moved companies three times; their pensions will be frozen or deferred, but they will be spread to the four corners of the country—or the planet—and arrangements for them will be more difficult.
<P>
There must be proper ballot arrangements. All members must know that they have the opportunity to vote and to be nominated. There must be genuine communication from the trustees when nominations and elections occur. Extra work for the Post Office will be a natural consequence. Everything that I have said will apply during clause 34 stand part—members will be involved in the same way in choosing directors, albeit of a different category. That is why I do not propose to say anything during that debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 273, in page 34, line 2, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Regulations may provide that, for the purposes of this section and any arrangements under this section, arrangements are to be taken as complying with the requirements of sections 16 or 18, and as being consistent with those requirements, notwithstanding that nominations made for the purposes of the arrangements by a person or organisation which—
<P>
(a) represents for any particular purposes the interests of persons who are comprised in the membership of the scheme in question, and 
<P>
(b) is of such a description as is specified in the regulations,
<P>
are to be treated under the arrangements as nominations, or as the only nominations, made by qualifying members of the scheme.<P>
</UL></FONT>'.
<P>
The amendment makes it clear that employers can provide, through their nomination and selection arrangements, that organisations representing the interests of pensioners can make nominations for member-nominated trustee positions. I alluded to that during the previous stand part debate.
<P>
In short, we will have a regulation-making power to define which organisations—obvious candidates will include trade unions and pensioner bodies. A group of pensioners, rather than individuals, from a company could nominate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have a quick question. Will the Minister make it clear that the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or as the only nominations''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not make nominations exclusive to one organisation—for example, a trade union or a pensioner group?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is one of the few questions on which I have felt that I needed a lawyer. The answer is no—[Interruption.] I am right—[Interruption.] No, the hon. Lady is correct in her interpretation. There need not be nominations from individuals—nominations from organisations will be allowed. I might not have fully explained the details of the proposal; I touched on the matter earlier and I am trying not to be repetitious. Individual nominations could come from organisations, although they would not have to.

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am now even more confused, but I do not want to hold up the Committee. I therefore give notice that we may return to the subject on Report, or the right hon. Gentleman may care to clarify the matter in writing.

<P>
Amendment No. 288 is consequential to the amendment; it adds to the list of appeals in schedule 7 to the Bill. Amendment No. 275 removes stray references to Sections 17, 19 and 20, which are all repealed. I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 239, in page 37, leave out line 22.
<P>
No. 240, in page 37, leave out line 23.
<P>
No. 248, in clause 40, page 44, leave out lines 40 to 42.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to try to clarify some of the proposed exceptions to the general power to act as a whistleblower. The clause will give people, in law, the responsibility to report their anxieties; they must refer them to the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority, which we know as Opra.
<P>
One problem is that new section 26A(1) states that it will have to be reported if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) the trustees of the scheme do not include at least one person who the practitioner or official receiver has informed them is a person about whose independent status he is satisfied;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the trustees have no other reasonable grounds for believing that their number includes at least one person about whose independent status the practitioner or official receiver is satisfied''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are wide responsibilities; a responsible and well-trained person, if I may return to our previous amendment, should be reporting on that basis anyway. They should know their legal responsibilities.
<P>
Under the new section 26C the Government seem to be exempting from the requirement
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the employer . . . a trustee of the scheme''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the auditor of the scheme or its actuary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps we have completely failed to understand the purpose. However, those three categories include some of the key people whose duty it should be to report concerns or worries to the authority. They should be able to produce the information. Perhaps those categories of people are covered by the Bill in a different way for technical reasons, in which case I apologise for holding up the Committee, but some idea of the Government's aims would be useful.
<P>
The employer might not have an administrative role in the scheme, but might well, through employment records, for instance, be in a position to know or suspect some of the information that must be reported. Amendment No. 238, therefore, would reinstate the employer in the arrangements. Amendment No. 239 would reinstate the trustee—because if a trustee, particularly one who has been trained, does not know what is going on, who in a pension scheme does? The trustees should continue with that duty. Why should not the auditor or actuary be involved in reporting to the authority? Those people are employed to run, audit and be the actuarial adviser on the pension fund. The actuaries and auditors that I know will question everything down to—I nearly said the last farthing, but I do not suppose many Committee members remember them. [HON. MEMBERS: ``I do.''] That shows our ages. I do not remember the farthing as legal currency, though.

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It had a wren on it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It did have a wren on it. I shall say that actuaries and auditors query things down to the last penny. If they do not know what is going on, who does? I am worried that they have been excluded.
<P>
Amendment No. 248 has the same function as the others in the group, but with reference to clause 40. We want to find out why the Government want to exclude three groups of people who could usefully give information to Opra when a pension scheme is wound up. If the Minister would reassure us, I should be more than happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I reserve my substantive comments for our afternoon sitting, but I ask the hon. Lady to imagine in what circumstances a scheme would be wound up. That is the key issue. It would be as a result of insolvency or because the employer no longer wanted to sponsor the scheme or failed to pay the contributions in a specified period.
<P>
It is amazing to discover that there are at present no requirements for Opra to be notified that an employer is insolvent or that there is, for example, no trustee. Schemes can be left in limbo until the insolvency practitioner or Opra become aware of the situation and take action. That can take years. In one example it took 20 years.
