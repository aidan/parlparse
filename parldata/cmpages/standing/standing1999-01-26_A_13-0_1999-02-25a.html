<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome hon. Members to this sitting of the Committee.
<P>
Before we begin consideration of the Bill today, I have to inform the Committee that there are some mistakes on the amendment paper. It is important that the Committee be given details of them. New clause 55 and Government schedules 4 and 5 have been printed on the section of the amendment paper relating to chapters I to VI of part IV, although they relate to chapters VII to X. I shall put the questions necessary to dispose of the new clause and the Government new schedules at that later point in the Bill. Government new schedules 2 and 3 have been printed in the correct place on the selection list but, I am sad to say, in the wrong order on the amendment paper. I shall put the question on new schedule 3 before the question on new schedule 2. I hope that that information helps the Committee.
<P>
I am confident that we shall make steady and good progress this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Before we begin this afternoon's business, I ask you to consider whether you can instruct or request the Government not to make it necessary for other members of the Committee to respond at almost the last moment to new chunks of proposed legislation. We are in that position as a result of the regular replacement of what was in the Bill by the last-minute tabling of pages and pages of Government amendments.
<P>
I am aware, as you are, Mr. Winterton, that the normal procedure is that if any of us wants to table an amendment for consideration, we have to allow one clear day, and that you are not obliged to consider it for selection if there is no day in between. I am not saying that the Government have not complied with that. However, Opposition parties and Government Back Benchers may wish not only to table amendments to Government new clauses, new schedules and amendments, but to take advice from people outside who have briefed us and who have an interest in the original clauses.
<P>
There are already three extant examples of that, and I gather that more are in the offing. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would hon. Members please take their seats and allow me to listen to this point of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> There were belated amendments on the public-private partnership. On Friday 12 February, the Government tabled 16 new clauses and two new schedules to rewrite certain provisions in the Bill. They were published on Monday 15 February and first debated on the next Tuesday. Hon. Members who wanted to table any amendments to them had three working days to do so. We shall probably have a debate on concessionary fares later today, and we shall discuss some controversial Government new clauses and new Schedules--tabled last Friday and unseen by anyone until Monday--that rewrite the chapters covering concessionary and penalty fares. If we wanted to table anything in response, we would have had to do so on the following day; there was no other opportunity, and certainly no time to consult people outside the House.
<P>
The complicated and controversial Government amendments on taxis, rewriting the relevant clauses of the Bill, were tabled on 23 February and printed yesterday, and if they were to be reached today--I am not saying that they will be, but it is conceivable--there would be no opportunity for amendments to them to be tabled.
<P>
It is not unusual for the Government to rewrite legislation on the hoof. We are concerned, however, because if they continue to do so, the timetable to which we are working would be inadequate. Furthermore, the Government said on Second Reading that they would have to table new clauses and schedules. If they knew that in December, it would have been courteous to the Committee, the Chairman, the Clerks and others with an interest, to give us more than the minimum notice.
<P>
I ask you, Mr. Winterton, to use your power or influence to request that, for the rest of the Committee's proceedings, sufficient time be allowed after the tabling of Government new clauses and amendments for Opposition parties and others to take advice and to consider whether they want to table amendments in response. That would avoid last-minute scrambles, which do not make for good legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I support the points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), which reiterate the points that I made on Tuesday. I understand the Ministers' saying that the Bill is complicated. I do not disagree with that; it is very complex. We also want it to be a good Bill. I accept that it takes time to draft complex legislation, so I suggest that the Government take time out, work out what they want to do, and then present it in an orderly way.
<P>
On Tuesday, the Minister even told me that she intended to amend the new clauses that the Government had tabled. That is an extraordinary state of affairs. We believe that yet more new clauses will be tabled on road-user charging and road pricing. That is a most controversial issue. You will know, Mr. Winterton, having chaired the Business Sub-Committee, that, subject to the approval of the whole Committee, we shall probably have to reach a milepost by the Tuesday after next. We shall be expected to have completed the debate on this major new proposal in British transport legislation by then, and we have not yet seen it.
I suggest that the Government take time out to determine what they want to do. I am sure that Liberal Democrat members of the Committee would agree to a two-week postponement of the proceedings. We can then come back and conduct the matter in an orderly way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I shall not rehearse the whole of the speech that I made during the debate on the sittings motion. However, in that debate I compared the amount of time allocated by the Government to this 277-clause, 26-schedule Bill with the time allowed in 1980 for debating the Local Government, Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill, on the Committee of which I served. We took 125 hours, unguillotined, to tackle a Bill of 146 clauses and 20 schedules. Everything I said on that occasion has, a fortiori, been made the more emphatic this time by the fact that instead of having 277 clauses, this Bill will probably now contain more than 300.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has said, when the Government drew up the original timetable, they presumably knew that they would have problems. The timetable was therefore, effectively, a false prospectus.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. You are the guardian and custodian in the Committee of the traditions of the House of Commons and of the rights of all members of the Committee, but particularly of Back-Bench and Opposition Members. You also have the heavy responsibility of ensuring that the Committee does its job of scrutinising legislation properly.
<P>
Against that background, does it not seem to be against all our best traditions that the approach being taken towards this large and complex Bill is getting worse as we proceed, not better? I support the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey when he says that we are faced with a large amount of new material, which hon. Members cannot in all conscience be said to have had an opportunity to digest. That is exacerbated by Ministers' saying that the Government will make further changes to the Bill as the Committee continues its work--we have not had their final word on the matter. New material is produced for almost every sitting. However, we are not given proper time either to consider it or to take consultation on it, and there is the promise of more to come.
<P>
I endorse the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway). He argued that it would be in the best interests of the Committee, the House and of the Bill if Ministers were given greater opportunity to think ahead about what they wanted to do and if other members of the Committee had more time to do their job properly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the Minister wish to reply to that point of order before I comment?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms. Glenda Jackson):</B> If it is in order, I shall be most grateful to respond to the points made by the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Croydon, South, and by the right hon. Members for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth).
<P>
I will begin by countering the impression that members of Opposition parties clearly hoped to give. They seemed to suggest that there was something unique or remarkable about a Government tabling amendments to a major item of legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South said that we are discussing a significant part of the Bill--that which deals with transport. I ask him to cast his memory back to the previous Administration and to the passage of what was then the Railways Bill. Very important elements--those dealing with access, closures and pensions--of that very important transport Bill were completely rewritten as it went through Parliament. In some instances, they were rewritten on more than one occasion, and I clearly remember the discussion of pensions. I say to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that there were more than 800 Government amendments to that one Bill. It is neither unusual nor unique that a major Bill should need significant amendment as it goes through Parliament.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has expressed much concern about the clauses that deal specifically with the public--private partnership--PPP. Again, I say to members of the Committee that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said on Second Reading--on 14 December of last year, if memory serves me right--that we would be tabling substantive amendments to replace the regulation-making Powers in those clauses.
<P>
We have now removed that regulation-making power from the Bill and tabled most of our substantive PPP amendments. By doing that, we have honoured the Government's promise and, we believe, given the Committee and Parliament a proper opportunity to scrutinise our proposals. Our amendments relating to PPP were tabled on 4 February, and we provided members of the Committee with explanatory notes on 16 February. They have had ample time to study those amendments. We have also announced our intention to table further amendments. The subject is important and we wish to explain our plans at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
Most people, certainly Labour Members, believe that the Government have been helpful. We appreciate that the Bill is important and that our duty as parliamentarians is to provide the proper opportunity for scrutiny of proposed legislation. That is what we have done, intend to do and shall continue to do.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I detected a note of guilt in the Minister's response. She came prepared, almost in anticipation of the remarks made by Opposition Members. We complain not about the introduction of the changes, but about the timing of their introduction. We could not consider some clauses during Tuesday's sitting--clauses 142 to 145, I think--because the Government told us that they would subsequently be tabling amendments to them. It seemed pointless to debate clauses that we knew would be amended.
<P>
We suggest a time out so that Ministers can prepare and table their amendments. We could then debate these matters at the same pace with which we have conducted our debate so far.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I an grateful to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for the reasoned and constructive way in which he put his point of order and, likewise, how other Opposition expressed their views about what has occurred.
<P>
As long as the Government abide by the rules and table amendments or new clauses at the appropriate time and with adequate notice, there is nothing that I can do or, for that matter, would want to do.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey indirectly mentioned the fact that there was--as the Minister, the Government Whip and other members of the Committee know--a Meeting of the Business Sub-Committee just before this sitting. I said from the Chair that concern had been made known to me outside the Committee Room about the many important amendments and new clauses that had been tabled. I know that the Minister for London and Construction and his colleagues took what was said in the Business Sub-Committee very much to heart and that they will give as much notice of amendments and new clauses as they can. I am sure that the considered concerns that have been expressed on the point of order before us will weigh heavily with all those on the Government Benches who have responsibility for the Bill.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made an important point. I hope that the Ministers and those responsible for the Bill's progress will heed the concerns that have been expressed. It is clearly important for Opposition parties to have the opportunity to consult on some of the new clauses. It is important that we take that approach if we are to get the Bill right and if warts and other things are to be removed before it becomes an Act of Parliament. That said, I can do no more than give the advice that I have given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Winterton. I trust that it will be heeded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. You told us that the Business Sub-Committee has met. When will someone share the decisions that it has made with the rest of us?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The resolutions will be published in the morning and this Committee's agreement to them will be sought next Tuesday. Obviously, the right hon. Gentleman can speak to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, who leads for the Opposition. I am sure that the information, which will be made public tomorrow and which the Committee will agree next Tuesday, can be made known to the hon. Member for Croydon, South. Without further ado, I call Mrs Glenda Jackson.
<P>
<B>Ms. Glenda Jackson:</B> It is actually Ms. Jackson; none the less, it is a great pleasure to see you back in the Committee, Mr. Winterton. I trust that it is in order for me to take the opportunity, before I speak to the new clauses, to correct something that I said during our previous debate. At one point, I said that the Government would award the public-private partnership contracts. In fact, as I have had occasion to say, the Government will conduct the public-private partnership from beginning to end. London Underground Ltd. will formally award the contracts, although Ministers' consent will, of course, be required before they are awarded.
<P>
I should also tell the hon. Member for Croydon, South that the preparedness of my response to Opposition Members' concerns about ample time being given for proper scrutiny of the Bill stemmed not one whit from a feeling of guilt, but from my prevailing desire to be as helpful and as detailed in my responses as humanly possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I should like to press the Minister on her point about the contracts being with London Underground. I pushed on the issue in our previous sitting because it affects the debate on transition clauses 142 to 145, which we have been unable to debate because they will subsequently be amended. Now that the Minister has sorted out whom the contract is with--that is a helpful piece of information--will she tell us how the transition will work? Once London Underground has the contract, how and when will it transfer it to Transport for London?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South has put specific and detailed questions to me. He is quite right: they have to do with what we have called the split, which will come into place once the mayor and assembly take over the governance of London, and once the body that we know as Transport for London is established. We are clear that there will he a gap before the conclusion of the public-private partnership--we will not be driven by an artificially imposed end date for something that is of such importance for London. Our prevailing and overriding concern is to argue for what is in the best possible interest of and will deliver the best possible value for the public.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman knows, we will come to the detail of how the split will be achieved later in our deliberations. Once the PPP has been concluded, the contract will in effect be awarded by London Underground Ltd., and after that date TfL under the auspices of the mayor, will be complete.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Minister set out how she will split London Underground? How will she transfer part of it to TfL, and not the other part?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> I am happy to repeat what I told the hon. Gentleman in a previous sitting. We propose the creation of three infrastructure--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> No, that is not what I am asking.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> I have clearly misunderstood the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister said on Tuesday that the contract was with the Secretary of State, so it appeared quite straightforward that only the part that was not affected by PPP was to be transferred. Now she talks about London Underground Ltd. being the contracting party. Yet there are other parts of London Transport that are nothing to do with the PPP. Is she saying that those subsidiaries of London Regional Transport that are nothing to do with the PPP will be transferred, but that London Underground Ltd. will not, until the PPP is completed?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> In a word, yes. The hon. Gentleman has clearly already understood in great detail what I said to the Committee on the matter. I am glad that I was so clear.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> This is a large group of amendments, so it will take me some time to speak to all of them. New clause 39 defines the conditions that must be met for a contract to be defined as a PPP agreement. That is important, because many subsequent provisions will apply only to a PPP agreement as defined in the new clause. It may be convenient if I also speak to new clauses 40 and 41, and to the amendments tabled by the official Opposition and Liberal Democrat members of the Committee.
<P>
I will not talk the Committee through all of the subsections of new clause 39, as most of them are self-explanatory, but it may help the Committee if I briefly mention subsections (5) and (6), and new clause 40.
<P>
Subsection (5) of new clause 39 stipulates that the contractor undertaking or securing the carrying out of works under a PPP agreement must not be a public sector operator. The PPP is a partnership between the public and private sectors. If the drafting appears odd, I gather that that is because it is simpler to define a public sector operator, and say that it cannot be the other party to a PPP agreement, than to define a private sector operator, and say that it must be the other party to such an agreement. New clause 40 defines what is meant by a public sector operator.
<P>
Subsection (6) of new clause 39 will enable London Underground, for example, to give assistance to a PPP contractor where that does not constitute a substantial proportion of the work. We would not want London Underground, for example, to be prohibited from providing various services to a PPP contractor where that clearly made practical and commercial sense for both parties. London Underground may need to provide payroll and other support services for a limited period after the implementation of the PPP.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the public sector operator be paid for that service? will the contractor pay, or will TfL--and, indirectly, the Government--do so by making a grant to the PPP contractor?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> That would clearly need to be a matter of negotiation between the two parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Am I right in saying that the Minister does not rule it out?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> I do not rule it out.
<P>
New clause 41 sets out the process for designating a contract as a PPP agreement. The designation must take the form of a direction made either by the Secretary of State before London Underground Ltd. transfers to TfL or by the mayor after the transfer. The direction must describe the subject matter of the contract it is designating and name the parties to it.
<P>
The direction can be given before or after a contract is awarded. if it is given before contract signature, the contract must be signed within three months of the designation date. if it is given after signature, parties to the contract must give their consent.
<P>
It should be apparent from my earlier remarks that the Government cannot accept the proposed amendments to new clauses 39 and 40. The hon. Member for Croydon, South would like a PPP agreement to be defined to include the operation of a railway as well as responsibility for its infrastructure. We cannot accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman wish to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Why cannot the Minister accept that proposal?
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> It would he privatisation.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> As my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction said from a sedentary position, the proposal would mean privatisation. We have rehearsed our arguments and demonstrated our solid case a sufficient number of times for it to be unnecessary to do so again.
<P>
Tube users want the assurance that the public face of the system will remain unchanged while the real problem of years of underfunding and underinvestment is addressed. Most Londoners do not share the prejudice of the hon. Member for Croydon, South against the public sector, for the private sector.
<P>
Last week, the Committee debated TfL's right to borrow. The amendments to the Government new clauses, and the new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raise the same issue, by suggesting that TfL should be able to borrow to invest in transport. As I told the hon. Gentleman on Tuesday, TfL will be a local authority for finance purposes. It will therefore have the usual local authority powers to borrow money. We do not, however, envisage funding TfL through the borrowing and credit approval regime, but by an annual grant, in much the same way in which London Transport is funded now.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendments would also mean that a public-private partnership could be a public-public partnership. I have mentioned that subsection (6) of new clause 39 would enable the public sector to assist a PPP contractor when that assistance does not constitute a substantial proportion of the work. The amendments would undermine the Government's policy, which is that there should be a partnership between public and private sectors for modernising the underground. I must therefore oppose them.
<P>
With regard to new clause 61, the Government agree that the assembly should review London Underground's activities and the operation of the public-private partnership for the tube. We do not believe, however, that it is necessary for the Bill to contain such a requirement. The Bill contains numerous powers to ensure that the assembly can carry out its scrutiny role.
 Clause 51 enables the assembly to call to attend proceedings or to produce documents in their possession or control people who work for one of the GLA's functional bodies, such as TfL, or who have done so in the three years prior to being called. In the same way, it can call to attend or produce documents anyone who has had a contractual relationship with the GLA, such as a PPP contractor.
<P>
The assembly will therefore be able to review in full the PPP agreement and London Underground services at any time. Rather than being required to review such issues, the assembly will be able to do so at appropriate times.
<P>
In the light of those remarks, I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will accept that a requirement for the assembly to review such issues is unnecessary. I commend the Government new clauses to the Committee, and I ask the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey not to press their amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I ask the Clerk to read the title of the new clause, I apologise to the Minister for attributing to her the wrong gender title. As a traditionalist, I normally seek to play it safe by attributing no gender title at all; on this occasion I slipped up, and I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I welcome the Government to the real world and to the principle of privatisation. It is a policy that has swept all before it over the past 18 years, and has now been endorsed by every member of the Committee. The interesting thing is that, since the general election, we expect to hear Ministers say, "We would like to nationalise some industry or other if time permitted or if funds were available, but we have other priorities." However, have we heard a single call from anybody in the Labour party, or the Liberal party, to reverse any of the privatisations of the past 18 years? Silence. Perhaps the Minister will tell me which privatisations she would like to reverse.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman wants to know if any member of the Labour party has called for the reversal of any privatisations in the past few years. I am sure that he is aware that there were such amendments and calls for such privatisation of the railways at, I think, the party conference before last. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made it abundantly clear that it would be financially impossible to do so--it would mean giving a blank cheque to those who had benefited from the previous Administration's scandalous mismanagement of a national, inestimable, infrastructure, which they sold off for a fraction of its real worth.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Back to the new clause, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is a second reading debate, and we are talking about a partial privatisation. I should like to press that theme, and I hope that I shall be considered in order in doing so.
<P>
The Minister has just referred to a motion at the Labour party conference. Is she suggesting that, if funds and time were available, she would have liked to privatise the railways? What happened to the motion? If the Deputy Prime Minister said that it was a Question only of time and money, that implies that, if it were not for time and money, he would like to take that route. The new clause represents a partial privatisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): No, it does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Well, we have heard the phrase "private sector" used a number of times. The new clause involves the private sector, and it can involve nothing other than a partial privatisation. The reason why the Government are introducing the private sector in this way--we can play with semantics, but it is the private sector--is that they believe that the private sector can do the job better than the public sector. That is the truth of the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> In setting out his stall, the hon. Gentleman claimed that privatisation is sweeping all before it. How can he justify that, given that it took the Tories from 1984 to 1997 to put forward proposals for the privatisation of LRT, which they had nationalised in 1984, and that--as far as I am aware--there have been no privatisations of citywide transport, underground or rail, in the other capital cities of Europe during this decade or the previous one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> On the latter point, the hon. Gentleman may be right or wrong. He asked why it took the previous Government 17 years. As the Government know, they have been unable to introduce a strategic rail authority this year because there is a limit to how much legislation can be introduced. May I recommend to the hon. Gentleman a book that I wrote?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It cost £5.50 from Conservative central office; I suspect that it is now discounted, as it is about three years old. It lists 50 major privatisations, from 1979 to 1994. I shall shortly be reading quotes from Members of both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, who give their vision of privatisation.
<P>
We have here a half-hearted commitment to privatisation. The Government acknowledge that the private sector is the better sector--[Hon. Members: "No."] They say no, in which case why are they giving the private sector the infrastructure contracts, and not the public sector? The Government have a choice: they can leave the work in the public sector, or in the private sector. They have chosen the private sector.
<P>
We have all now had the opportunity of studying and digesting the remarks made by the Minister on Tuesday night. When she responds to the debate, I should be grateful if she could address two questions in particular. First, in talking about the funding for the PPP, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the modelling suggests that TFL will be able to fund PPP."--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 23 February 1999; c. 754-755.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that model include or exclude proceeds from road pricing and/or the non-residential car parking levy?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like an answer now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the Minister wants to give me an answer now, yes.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene. The modelling was done before the legislation to introduce road user charging and a levy from private non-residential parking was considered. Therefore I can categorically say yes--that modelling was done before any revenue from road user charging or private non-residential levy was considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was not trying to pull a fast one about the legislation, because we do not have it yet.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> I did not think that the hon. Gentleman could.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> There is no need to be gratuitously offensive.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> Oh, I think there is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have nothing but contempt for that sort of thing.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Please continue the debate in an orderly way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Is the Minister saying that the proceeds from those two revenue streams will be excluded in the model?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Well, from that, we seem to have an acknowledgement that the Government believe that TfL or London Underground will be able to be self-financing under the public-private partnership. I have to confess that that comes as quite a surprise to me; I cannot see how they could do that, even with the revenue stream from road pricing. Transport economists will be very interested in the fact that it will be self-financing for more than 30 years, for the £7 billion investment over 15 years, of which the Government are so proud.
<P>
My second point is that the model on which the PPP is being evaluated assumes a real increase in fares after 2001 and a 1 per cent. real increase in fares next year and in 2001. Does the Minister envisage a real increase in fares in perpetuity after 2001, or for a limited period of time? Would it be for the length of the PPP's existence? Would it be for 10 years, five years or a couple of years? Could she indicate what factor she is feeding into her model so that we can have some idea about future fare increases on London Underground?
<P>
The amendment that I tabled, as the Minister rightly said, would allow the PPP to be extended to operations. The new clause will cover the maintenance and infrastructure but not the operation of London underground. Ministers say that this is not privatisation, which is fair enough, but it is a 30-year contract, which will bring about its own problems. Anyone investing in any project for a limited period, instead of owning it, will obviously want his money back at the end of the 30 years. We will follow the financial details with interest as they become apparent.
<P>
If the public sector is to run the underground, Ministers must justify their belief that the public sector can do so better than the private sector. They talk about their vision for London Underground and its relationship with the private sector, and they believe that they know the best way to bring that about. They do not want to go down the road of privatisation because they understand London Underground better.
<P>
When hon. Members considered the privatisation of the power stations--Committee members will know that we now have a grid of power stations across the country--the Labour party spokesman said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the idea that we will have an influx of power stations, all competing on the grid, is nonsense"--[Official Report, 12 December 1988; Vol. 143, c. 683.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That spokesman was, of course, the Prime Minister. I do not want to leave out the Liberals. Their current Treasury spokesman, the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), said that electricity privatisation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will result in higher prices for the whole population, and especially for those on low incomes"--[Official Report, 10 April 1989; Vol. 150, c. 585.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Cabinet enforcer, the right hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham), said in relation to water charges,<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if this squalid Bill proceeds, domestic water charges will, effectively, at least have doubled as a result of Government policies"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 they have not--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and almost certainly rise much higher than that"--[Official Report,  7 December 1988; Vol. 143, c. 347.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Again, they have not.<P>

<P>
On the privatisation of British Airways, the late John Smith said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe that privatising British Airways is a bad deal for the airline and a bad deal for the British taxpayer"--[Official Report, 19 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 53.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 As you know, Mr. Winterton, BA is now one of the most successful airline companies in the world, providing a vast revenue stream for the Treasury. The current Secretary of State for Scotland--[Interruption.] I think that the Minister for London made an aside about shareholders. One cannot help sensing the resentment that someone who has invested in British Airways is going to see a dividend on his money. They may be new Labour, but old instincts die hard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman, who is working himself up into a lather about this, should have totally misconstrued what I was saying. He claimed that British Airways' profits--which have been substantial, although the company is currently undergoing a difficult period--were accruing to the Treasury. I merely pointed out that the first responsibility of British Airways, as with any other private company, was to its shareholders. It is they who derive the bulk of the benefits from British Airways' profitability. That is a matter of fact. There was no inference whatever in my remarks. I merely wanted to correct an error which the hon. Member for Croydon, South had made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> But a true supporter of capitalism would not have made the remark in the first place. Ministers have to learn their lines.
<P>
The current Secretary of State for Scotland made the most famous remark of all. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 British Airways--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will be the pantomime horse of capitalism if it is anything at all"--[Official Report, 19 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 125.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the vision of the Labour party and how it approaches privatisation. Ministers say that this is not a privatisation. We know that, because all those quotes betray Labour's real instincts. But they must explain to the London public why they think that the current management of the operations of London Underground can do a better job than the private sector.
<P>
We want a management that is prepared to take on the unions. The Minister for Transport in London refused to condemn them when they went on strike. It was left to a Minister who came down from Scotland to tell us how London Underground should be run. We need a Government who are prepared to take on the unions in London Underground's operations and get rid of all the Spanish practices that are bedevilling the travelling public in London.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): Will the hon. Gentleman confirm my recollection that the Conservative Government nationalised Rolls-Royce in 1972? Will he also confirm my recollection that some Members who represented English constituencies under the previous Conservative Government were put into Wales to act as Secretary of State? Will he also confirm that a Conservative Scottish Member of Parliament lost his seat and ended up in Southend?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong about the nationalisation, which was in 1971--[Interruption.] We, too, can be pedantic. As the hon. Gentleman is well aware, Rolls-Royce went back into the private sector under a Conservative Government. As for the other points, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to raise just two points. First, the hon. Gentleman is a great advocate of privatising London Transport, and London Underground in particular. What information does he have, therefore, about the view that the professional LRT board expressed when it considered its options a couple of years ago? How high did privatisation come up the list? Secondly, did PricewaterhouseCoopers recommend privatisation when it did its study?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I cannot give an accurate answer because I was not party to the discussions and have not seen the list. On Tuesday, one of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues mentioned Peter Ford who put PPP at No. 15 in the list of the 16 options for the future funding of London Underground. Privatisation was not No. 16.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman is certainly right. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) referred to that point, and he has more ammunition where that came from. I should, however, tell the hon. Gentleman that privatisation certainly was not No. 1 on the list.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be right. I want the best system for London, and PPP is not the best system. I am happy to concede that if someone comes up with a better proposal than full-blooded privatisation I will listen to it. Splitting responsibilities in the way that has been suggested, however, is the worst of all worlds. Each side will blame the other--the infrastructure people will blame the public operators, and the public operators will blame the infrastructure people. That will not be in the best interests of London, which is why I tabled an amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We certainly share the view that London should have the best system. That is why we share the hon. Gentlman's view that public-private partnership is not the best option, although we come to a different conclusion otherwise. Does the hon. Gentleman accept, however, that one reason why people will be so cynical about the privatisation option for the underground is their experience of the privatisation of the railways infrastructure. It was not good value for the taxpayer or, in the short term, for the rail user. If the hon. Gentleman is committed to looking for best value alternatives, has he seriously considered the option that we suggested of a public interest company? There are successful transport models for such a company in other parts of the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have read the hon. Gentleman's amendments. When he has spoken to them, I will have a chance to respond. I want, however, to deal with his suggestion that the privatisation of the railways caused a certain cynicism among the travelling public.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has been in the House longer than I have and will know that all the privatisations struggled at first. I could mention the privatisation that led to British Telecom. Journalists used to go round doing surveys of the number of telephone kiosks that were not working. There is no doubt that the service was bad. Eventually, British Telecom began sustained investment, and the number of complaints decreased. British Telecom developed into the company that it is today. The hon. Gentleman will know that the first Bill intended to carry out the privatisation of British Telecom failed when the 1983 election was called. It returned to the House early in the 1983-84 Parliament. It was probably not until the early 1990s that British Telecom was providing the service that people expected.
<P>
A number of franchises have been granted for the running of the railways over some time. Some are probably coming up to having run for about four years, while some have run for only two or three years. In my judgment, the franchises will take a similar time to that taken by British Telecom to bite and to provide the services that people expect.
<P>
Hon. Members may have heard the Deputy Prime Minister's fairly restless interview on this morning's "Today" programme, on which he sounded like a man who is not at ease with himself. He acknowledged that £17 billion of investment is going into the railways, having denied it in the Chamber the other day. I have said before that as London Underground carries virtually the same number of passengers as the railway network, it would die for such an investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton) rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I shall give way to the senior hon. Gentleman first, and to the junior one afterwards.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are all equal in this place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We as a party have never taken an absolutist view of privatisation. We have perhaps sometimes been more sceptical than we should have been in Opposition, but we were in favour of British Telecom's privatisation, which has been successful. However, railway privatisation is different from some of the other privatisations that have occurred. First, the amounts raised showed that Governments can make terrible mistakes at taxpayers' expense. Secondly, privatising the railway companies, which are interrelated operations, is much more complicated than privatising a direct competitor. It is not possible to compete on the same track in the same way as British Telecom directly competes for telephone communications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I gave way to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey first, but I was not trying to support his leadership campaign. I was so excited by his intervention that I have written down the word "tax".
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Asset stripping.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Yes, indeed.
<P>
Every privatisation is undertaken at a market price. As the Opposition of the time, Labour Members had a lot of fun pointing out what companies were worth as they improved with private-sector management. As the Government negotiate contracts, they will find out that things are worth what people are prepared to pay for them. It is impossible to obtain a higher price than the market will pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made a point that I, too, want to make. He spoke about competition, and he was right to point out that British Telecom improved dramatically because of the pressure of competition. Will the hon. Gentleman admit that the telecommunications industry is completely different from the railway industry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Last weekend, I travelled to Birmingham. For my return journey, I had a choice of three different railway companies. I chose the service that suited me best.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Which was the slowest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I took the quickest train to London. If I wished to take a slow train that stopped at places along the way--
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNMulty </B>(Harrow, East): Why would the hon. Gentleman want to do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It would have been cheaper, and I might have wished to get off along the way.
<P>
The point is that people are being offered choice. That is the benefit. I return to my central point. Huge investment is going into the railways, which will improve them dramatically. The Government will take the credit for that, even though that was the Conservative party's policy.
<P>
I think that I have made my point on the new clauses. The Government have to justify why they believe that the public sector can operate London Underground better than the private sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I want to reinforce my hon. Friend's comments about rail journeys, not least from the midlands. The borough of Solihull contains both the rail options of which he has spoken. It is possible to go from Solihull to Birmingham on the Chiltern line, ending up at Marylebone, or from Birmingham international to Euston on the west coast main line. One is very much faster, and the other is very much cheaper. It is a real through choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the hon. Member for Croydon, South and ask him please to stay in London--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> As they say at Euston. My hon. Friend makes his point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that we are on a Second Reading debate, so it is appropriate to deal with the other amendments and new clauses listed in the amendment paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South spent an awful long time taking us through the history of privatisation, and trying to make out that it was an unalloyed success. As my hon. Friend the member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey pointed out, there have been some successes --that is undeniable. But one has to look at the reasons for those successes.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman, in answer to my intervention and that of my hon. Friend, said that because of competition the railways will eventually become as efficient, productive and profitable as British Telecom. That is extremely unlikely. The degree and extent of competition on the railways is inherently limited. There are one or two routes, primarily InterCity, on which competition can flourish. Those routes were pretty profitable and effective before privatisation. But only one railway company serves the commuter routes in and out of Surbiton in my constituency. There will probably only ever be one, for safety reasons. It would be disastrous for two railway companies to serve the 10 railway stations in my constituency, so competition will be limited. The railway industry will not be as efficient as British Telecom because different competitive forces apply.
<P>
There are three major reasons for successful privatisations. They relate in different ways to different industries. One reason is the degree of competition. The second is access to capital. Even monopolistic industries, when they were privatised, saw improvements because they were no longer under the shackles of the Treasury, having to abide by the public sector borrowing requirement rules. If the previous Government had had a little more imagination, challenged Treasury rules and allowed the water companies, for example, to go to the private capital markets, the investment in the privatised water utilities could no doubt have been made while they were in the public sector. We have seen that happen in other countries. The notion that privatisation brought about that investment is flawed. In reality, it was the previous Government's ideological commitment to Treasury rules.
<P>
The third reason why privatisation was sometimes successful was because private sector companies were braver in taking on trade unions and trying to get rid of the Spanish practices to which the hon. Gentleman referred. However, that does the previous Government no credit; they could have taken on the trade unions and got rid of restrictive practices if they had chosen so to do. Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman does not make a strong case. That is not to say that Liberal Democrat Members do not agree that privatisation and the dynamics of the market economy are often very good for industry. But they have to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
The reason why the hon. Gentleman's Government took so long to privatise the railways, and never got around to privatising London Underground, is because the dynamics that would set off the privatisation of those industries do not exist. The monopolistic tendencies and the network economy within those industries prevent privatisation from producing great benefits. The only benefit is that of access to the capital markets. Our amendments seek, in the case of London Underground, to give access to those markets so that it can get the investment that it so clearly needs within the public sector.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Privatisation remains an ideological totem pole for the Conservative party, and I am glad that the Government are trying to climb off it. However, the public-private partnership method will not get them off the hook--at least, it will not be the most effective way of doing so. I spent some time on Tuesday evening explaining why we disagreed with the Government's PPP proposals, so I do not intend to go over much of that ground again. However, one or two relevant points should be raised again during this second reading debate.
<P>
Our main reason for opposing the PPP proposals is that we believe that they represent poor value for money for the taxpayer and for the wider economy. The costs of bringing the PPPs to fruition are likely to be huge. I explained some of the reasons for that on Tuesday night. Risks will have be accounted for in the private sector. Those risks are inherently more costly for the private sector than for the public sector. They involve construction, funding and lack of certainty about the contracts, and they will all have to be factored into the tender bids that are put in by private contractors. That will, inevitably, lead to higher costs. On Tuesday, I quoted Peter Ford, the former chairman of London Transport, who told the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee that that was the case. It was also the conclusion of the Price Waterhouse investigation--although we are not able to see the calculations in full because the Government's new freedom of information way of running the country does not allow us to do so.
<P>
In her response to my speech on Tuesday night, the Minister tried to correct me. She said that London Transport
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"found that PPP would offer significantly better value for money."--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 23 February 1999; c. 764.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I concede that that was the evidence that was given to the Select Committee by London Transport officials. However, the former chairman of London Transport, who was free of any obligations to toe Ministers' lines, told the Select Committee the truth. He said that the PPP was number 15 out of 16 in terms of the preferred options. He said that it represented poor value for money. The Minister did not respond to that point.
<P>
On 10 February, the Financial Times reported that the current board of London Transport is extremely concerned about the PPP because it does not believe that it is going to get off the ground. The two journalists who wrote the article, Charles Batchelor and David Wighton, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Concern over the sell-off's slow progress led to heated debate at a recent board meeting of London Transport, the Tube's parent company, with several non-executives calling for a review of the project. The non-executives pressed for a meeting with John Prescott, deputy prime Minister and Secretary of state for transport, but were persuaded to wait until Sir Malcolm Bates, whose appointment as London Transport chairman was announced last month, takes over."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That implies that those non-executive directors will want that meeting when Sir Malcolm Bates comes on board. They are still worried about the progress of PPP. The same concerns are expressed not only by the former chairman of London Transport, whose evidence to the Select Committee showed that PPP would be bad value for the taxpayer, but by the current board. The Government's proposals are not really supported by London Transport, as Ministers would admit if they were able to take off the shackles of ministerial duties and tell the truth.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members are very much against the Government's approach, and believe that there is an alternative to PPP. Our amendments would provide that alternative. We give three options. The first solution is the full-blown alternative--my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred to it as the public interest company--whereby one could set up a public corporation that could take on debt by working with private funders, but outside the PSBR constraints. That could be the vehicle, using cheap sources of funding and within the public sector, to bring in the investment that London Underground needs.
<P>
The second solution, which amendments (a) and (b) to new clause 39 would achieve, might be called a relaxed PPP, because public-sector operators would be allowed to be part of it. The Minister said that that would mean that it was not a PPP, but perhaps PPP could be given a new definition: a public-public partnership. That is not a real problem. Moreover, I am told--the Secretary of State's statement to the House confirmed it--that the PPP will allow for several contractors, so why cannot one of them be a public sector operator? Another could be a private sector operator. That would allow competition between the public and private sectors on those contracts.
<P>
The third option, as prescribed in new clause 62, is what one might call the fallback or reserve option. If there are problems with the PPP we should acknowledge them, while hoping that the PPP works, that the case can be proven and that private sector contractors can be signed up in a sensible time scale. However, if they do not and the whole thing cannot be made to work, we should ensure that the people of London are protected and that the London transport system will continue by means of a public sector fallback solution.
<P>
I want to deal with those three options in a little more detail. The solution of a public interest company, allowing the state sector to borrow, was examined in a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. When the Government made their announcement on 20 March last year, they published some papers along with the Minister's statement to try to explain why they were not taking these various options, including that of a public interest company. They did not publish the full report, but issued their own edited highlights, entitled "London Underground Public-Private Partnership Facts and Analysis". I turned to that, because I always want to study the Government's arguments.
<P>
In relation to the option that we recommend, the Government put the following facts before Parliament. They said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "an alternative approach would be to allow London Underground to orrow on the markets, but the measure of public sector borrowing which the Government uses, the PSBR, would increase in the same way as if it were Government borrowing to fund grant to London Underground".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They added that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it would be possible for the Government to adopt a different target for public sector borrowing, as other European countries do, but such a step could be seen as a relaxation of the Government's monetary and fiscal policies".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is interesting. They are sweeping aside that option not because it is not a sensible course of action, but because it might be seen as a relaxation--so all the extra costs that the PPP will entail are just because of appearances.
<P>
What is even more ridiculous is that the Government have already made those redefinitions of the PSBR and other public sector financial aggregates, so they are not following through in their micro-policy the macro-policy that they are adopting--which in many ways we support. Perhaps I could explain that in a little more detail.
<P>
Under this Government, the public sector borrowing requirement has become the public sector net cash requirement. The old general Government financial deficit has become general Government net borrowing. One of the reasons that they changed that is because they have brought in the golden rule: the idea that borrowing for investment has--and should have--a different economic status in the public accounts. We support that; it is a very sensible approach. The definitions that the public sector uses to make its accounts--and the importance given to them--should reflect that rule. The Government have acknowledged that, so why should not their micro-policy here in London reflect the way that they treat the public sector? They have changed the macro-definitions, but will not follow the logic through. If they used the new general Government net borrowing statistic, that would allow public corporations to borrow for investment, because that definition of public borrowing excludes borrowing by public corporations.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must ask the Committee to come to order. It is difficult for me to hear the hon. Gentleman when there is chatting on the Back Benches, and I want to ensure that he is in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
The general government net borrowing measure is relevant, because if that were considered more significant than the old public sector borrowing requirement, it would enable a public interest company to borrow and not to be limited by the false borrowing constraints of the past. There is an analogy with the debate, prior to the election, about housing. Many people argued for a housing corporation in the public sector, using the old measure of general Government financial deficit to enable money to go to the housing sector without contributing to the PSBR, only to the GGFD.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound (Ealing, North):</B> Like every person in the Room, I am sure, I have read the hon. Gentleman's seminal study of the privatisation of the Chilean post office with great interest, and the points that he is making tonight are on a par with that important work.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has made some extremely telling and persuasive points. Before I am convinced to vote with him this evening, will he tell us what impact a recasting of the constituent elements of the PSBR on the lines that he proposes would have on international confidence in the United Kingdom, and what impression that would give to our trading partners and people who use the pound as a reserve currency?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will take care in responding to that, and will be extremely brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The reference to the Chilean post office is relevant.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> At which tube station?
<P>
<B> Mr. Davey:</B> I came to the House from a much maligned career--I was a management consultant. I was involved with the post office industry, and visited many post offices internationally, including Correos de Chile, which is not a privatised post office--it remains in the Chilean public sector.
<P>
Before you call me to order, Mr. Winterton, the reason why that is relevant is that some post offices have remained in the public sector, but because the state has not guaranteed their borrowing, they have been able to borrow for investment without it being scored against the public sector borrowing requirement--or the equivalent. The New Zealand post office, for example--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you very much.
<P>
<B> Mr Davey:</B> I take your point, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
The Government have recast and redefined the PSBR. If the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) reads the Maastricht treaty, he will find that the borrowing criteria are set out not in terms of the public sector borrowing requirement or the public sector net cash requirement but the general Government financial deficit, which excludes borrowing by public corporations. That strengthens the argument for the Government to adopt our approach. They could allow a new public interest company to borrow for investment--while keeping to their golden rule, and keeping the country on track to meet the Maastricht criteria for borrowing.
<P>
The Government, in the form of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, are ignoring what the Government, in the form of the Chancellor, are trying to do with respect to public finances. It is extraordinary that the Government have opted for a PPP--the most costly option--when they could have gone for a public sector option.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government offered another argument for not choosing our option, and it is to do with risk. The note on facts and analysis states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is arguable that . . . a relaxation in policy would not have"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the effect of adding borrowing by London Underground to the public sector borrowing requirement if it were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"entirely commercial and without any form of Government guarantee".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That relates back to the New Zealand Post Office, about which I have spoken before. The note goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"however, it is questionable whether such an arrangement could be established because, whilst London Underground remained a nationalised industry, it would be very difficult for the Government not to stand behind it."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would not be impossible, just very difficult.
<P>
Why cannot the Government--who have huge difficulties getting their PPP to work-- make another option work? I refer to the option that London Transport wanted, PricewaterhouseCoopers recommended and which has been adopted by countries such as the United States--which is the home of capitalism and to which I am sure that the hon. Member for Croydon, South would refer--and New Zealand. Other countries and Administrations have taken the approach that I outlined. It is possible to imagine a company in the state sector borrowing without the state guaranteeing those borrowings. They could be linked, as London First argued, to the taxation, charging and fare revenues from which the company could expect to benefit and could be shown potentially to benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Did my hon. Friend notice the specific and accurate answer that the Minister for Transport in London gave the hon. Member for Croydon, South? He asked when the Government had concluded their thinking and whether they had added the money from the two new charging regimes that they will now permit? Is not the case for something other than PPP even greater now that we know that other revenue could back up a public interest company or another alternative to PPP?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> My hon. Friend is exactly right. With the benefit of knowing that other revenues could be forecast and factored in, a public corporation could borrow, and the state could say, "We do not guarantee those borrowings." That would leave the public corporation outside the definition of general Government net borrowing--it would be completely off the public sector balance sheet. Again, that has been tried elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I entirely take the hon. Gentleman's point about non-secured bond issues. If one uses the usual comparator of New York City Transit however, one has to accept that there are differences in scale. In the case of New York, we are talking about a minuscule bond issue compared with the amount of money that might be envisaged for London Transport. The amount for London Transport is vast, so the impact on the PSBR will be even more significant. The figure for New York City Transit is a tiny percentage of what we are talking about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I find the hon. Gentleman's remarks quite odd. I do not know whether he has read Professor Stephen Glaister's report on the operation of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Over the past few years, the authority has funded more than $20 billion of capital investment through bond issues. At most exchange rates--my arithmetic is bound to be faulty--that would translate into £10 billion or more of investment in London Underground. The Government are talking about £7 billion of investment. The analogy with the New York MTA is helpful, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman made it because it makes my point. There are alternatives along the lines that I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Glaister's figures are projections; they do not represent year-on-year expenditure. The hon. Gentleman should study the figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman has had his second go. I advise him to stop digging. The $20 billion of revenue--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> It was not in one financial year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the figure was not for one financial year--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. To ensure that the Official Report can take down everything that is said, hon. Members who want to intervene should stand up and seek my permission before doing so. They should not speak from a sedentary position, which makes it very difficult to record precisely what is said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I remind the Committee that the $20 billion to which I referred was invested in New York's transport system over a relatively short time, and funded major capital improvements. The money has not come in one year, but no one suggests that the Government's £7 billion will come in one year. I believe that 15 years is the current estimate, although officials have told journalists that the figure of £7 billion was plucked from the air. The $20 billion is real cash that was raised on the private market and spent on improving New York's transport system.
<P>
I was trying to make a generic point of principle. The Government appeared to argue in their facts and analysis that it would be impossible to transfer risk from the Treasury while preventing borrowings falling on the public sector accounts and being scored against them. That was not the case in New York. I know that Treasury officials get worked up about the matter and say that it is impossible to operate such a policy. They say that a public sector company cannot go bust and that it is therefore impossible for its borrowings not to be scored against public sector accounts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) spoke about how the Government stepped in when Rolls-Royce--a private company--was going bust in 1971. We have seen the state step in when other large private sector industrial or financial companies appear to be in jeopardy. Such companies do not have a written guarantee, but if they are large and important enough the Government cannot stand by and allow them to fold. They have to take responsibility for them because they are too important to society and to the economy to allow that to happen. Such companies may not have a written guarantee, but there is an expected or potential guarantee. It appears that the Treasury wants to apply different rules and principles to the public sector. That is unfortunate, because it will mean a bad deal for the taxpayer.
<P>
The problems with the PPP relate to such risks. If the project were in the public sector, the whole of society could take on and reduce the risk. The public interest company would be charged less for its capital and be more cost effective.
<P>
That is the Committee's first option. It is a major option, and it would mean that a public interest company would raise money on private sector markets to fund London Underground. If the Government do not like that, their PPP proposal could allow a public sector operator to play a part. I mentioned that point earlier, but I want to press the Government. Why are they trying to exclude the public sector operator from being one of the contractors? The Minister said that such involvement would prevent the project from being a PPP. As I said, there would be more than one private sector contractor, so it could still be a PPP. Even if all the contractors were public sector operators, they would presumably still work with private sector funding, so the private sector would still be involved.
<P>
There are good reasons for at least allowing the possibility of a public sector operator playing a part in PPP. For a start, such participation would assist the search for good-value and competitive bids from the private sector. Currently, the private sector companies, whether they are backed by merchant banks, Railtrack or any other company, can get together and indicate a minimum level of bids necessary for decent profits. If they were to have a public sector competitor--a comparator that could challenge them--they would be unlikely to set such a minimum and would push down their bid price further and further.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am no great expert, but my understanding is that the Government have supported that principle in local government and have not changed their view. When local government services are put out to tender, one of the tenderers is often helpful in keeping the other prices down. Although theirs is a contractual, arm's length relationship, it effectively replaces the local authority's previous in-house service. That would be a perfectly proper model to take from local government to central Government, endorsed as it is by this Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> My hon. Friend anticipates my remarks. Having a public sector operator involved imposes discipline on the private sector bids. It strengthens the Government's negotiating hand. Our criticism is that a PPP will be a costly solution. A public sector operator could keep costs down.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right that the Government support this method of operating in local government. When they were in Opposition and the Railways Act 1993, which privatised the railways, was going through Parliament, they supported such a method in the railway industry. On 12 January 1993, the right hon. Member for Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), now the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, said in an Opposition Day debate on rail privatisation:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the Secretary of State wants to experiment on the Chiltern or Southend lines, I hope that he will give the public sector management a chance to compete and to show how good they are. He should at least give the public sector management a level playing field and the same finance rights and access to the market so they can show that they can perform as well as private sector management. If, as seems to be the case, the Secretary of State wants to experiment, he should at least be fair and not condemn the public sector. We would resent that unfair ideological view."--[Official Report, 12 January 1993; Vol. 216, c. 782-783.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman put the case very well and it is the case that we are putting to the Committee this afternoon. The Government are being ideological.
<P>
<B>Ms. Glenda Jackson:</B> That is exactly what the Government are proposing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> No, it is not. New clause 39 rules out--
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is arguing precisely what the Government are arguing regarding the public-private partnership. It will indeed be the public sector that will run the trains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister has not quite got the point yet. New clause 39(5) provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The party undertaking to carry out or secure the carrying out of the work described in subsection (3) above (the 'PPP company') must not be a public sector operator".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The infrastructure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister for London, from a sedentary position, says the infrastructure. But why cannot one of the contractors for the infrastructure work be a public sector company? To allow that to happen would be to take a non-ideological position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I want to make sure that the Government do not misinterpret my hon. Friend's remarks. They keep on making the case that there is no parallel because what my hon. Friend is arguing for is a public sector bidder and potentially public sector partnership for a set of three infrastructure contracts. In 1993 the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions talked about a public sector operator for the trains. The Government are not arguing for a PPP option for the trains. We are saying that a public sector bidder bidding against a private sector bidder would achieve the same best value for the infrastructure contracts--if the Government choose to let them have the three infrastructure contracts--as the Deputy Prime Minister argued in 1993 would be achieved for the train operator--argument which the Tory Government refused to accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend to explaining that point to Ministers. I hope that they were listening.
<P>
If Railtrack were a contractee to the British Rail Board, it would be possible for its contract to be contestable. If other public sector companies were able to come in, they might get more efficiencies.
<P>
Amendments (a) and (b) seek to introduce the possibility that a public sector operator could bid. We are not trying to force the Government into that--we are merely attempting to allow them that option. The amendments are intended to be helpful, as is new clause 62.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 62 would give the Government a fall-back position if the PPPs are not signed before July 2000. London Underground could be at a huge disadvantage if that happens and the process would go on and on. The Government have said that they do not wish to negotiate against a deadline, and we understand that. Equally, however, the Government surely do not want to drag the negotiations out and allow the investment backlog to build up even further.
<P>
The Government could use the forthcoming Budget to help the process. To ensure that there is no stop in London Transport's investment funds, the Chancellor of the Exchequer could announce that in the years 2000-01 and 2001-02 money will be set aside in the contingency reserves to enable capital spending on London Underground to go ahead if the PPP agreements are not signed. So far, no money has been set aside--investment in the London Underground will stop during those years. That is of great concern, and why we want new clause 62 to be added to the Bill. If the Chancellor does not make the announcement that contingency reserves will be in place to ensure that investment continues, the new clause represents the only other alternative--it would be a fall-back position to protect Londoners and ensure that London Transport gets the investment that it needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> My hon. Friend raises a hugely important point. Unless the Government use the Budget to do what we suggest, we could be up against a deadline of about three months before the handover to the Greater London authority before any Government announcement is made about support funding from the Treasury--we already know that the Government anticipate that the new system may not be up and running until well after the handover. It may be literally a matter of months before the handover before any security is in place to tide London Transport and London Underground over with public subsidy. It would represent more sensible stewardship of public finance and better management of the public's expectations of public services if the announcement were to be made this year, when everybody at least knows that there will be a back-up provision in the event of the Government scheme eventually going off the rails.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. The Government are trying to sell their PPP scheme on the basis that it will bring long-termism to the planning of investment for London Underground. If that were so, it would be a very good idea. For far too long under the previous Government, London Underground operated on a 12-month financial horizon, so could not plan ahead. Investment in London Underground should have a 25-year or 50-year horizon. In terms of the next two years, the Government are falling into the same trap as the previous Government. The investment that will take place in the years 2000-01 and 2001-02 is not clear to the managers of London Underground. Over the next 12 or 18 months, their lack of certainty and ability to plan for investment will become acute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman share my view that to be the manager of London Underground with responsibility for the capital investment programme over the next few years would be an extraordinarily invidious task?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I could not agree with the right hon. Gentleman more. I think that the Committee should send its sympathies to that individual.
<P>
During the privatisation of the railways we saw the problem that can occur when there is doubt and delay about whether contracts are going to be signed or how interests will be organised. There is a hiatus during which investment is not made. The same thing happened with the Post Office under the previous Government. For two or three years it had no idea whether it would be privatised and its management could not take long-term investment decisions. It seems that it is almost a Whitehall rule that if one is going to make a change to an industry, that industry must go through two or three years of uncertainty, instability and under-investment.
<P>
I know that the Minister is likely to point to the allocations that the Chancellor made to London Transport in his comprehensive spending review for the first two years. She will say that the Government tried to put it on an even keel, but their efforts have proved insufficient. Unless the Minister can say today that she can guarantee that the contracts will be signed and that PPP will be resolved by July 2000, those doubts will remain and the manager who was doing the job to which the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster referred will have those problems. That will inevitably mean that the misery that Londoners face daily will continue.
<P>
We have proposed those three options in a constructive and helpful spirit. We really believe that if, as they say and as they put in their manifesto, the Government want to sort out London Transport and ensure that it gets the billions of pounds of capital that it needs, they must think again on PPP and, at the very least, include some reserve provisions in the Bill so that London Underground does not suffer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I ask the Minister to reply, I request the co-operation of the Committee. There have been some sedentary interventions from Government, Conservative and Liberal spokesmen which have made it extremely difficult for the Official Report properly to record our proceedings. I have been notified of that. I ask Committee members, particularly Government and Opposition spokesmen, not to intervene from a sedentary position.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms. Glenda Jackson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
I should first like to set the record straight with regard to some of the comments of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Yet again, he said in Committee that Mr. Ford, the former chairman of London Underground, did not believe that a PPP would represent the best value for money. He also implied that that statement was based on PricewaterhouseCoopers modelling. It was not. Indeed, London Transport agrees with the Government that a PPP should offer best value for money. The hon. Gentleman also implied that PricewaterhouseCoopers recommended a public-sector borrowing option. It did not.
<P>
Why not have a public-sector bidder? As we have pointed out, the public sector--namely London Underground, which will remain fully in the public sector, as it is now--will be the benchmark against which all private bids will be measured. Unlike rail franchising, we will not be awarding contracts irrespective of the value of the bid. Best value will be the watchword.
<P>
In response to the allegation that officials had plucked the figure of £7 billion from the air, I would say--as I have said before--that it is based on London Underground's figures. Year on year, it needs to spend £500 million and still be able to maintain a service.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred to a report in the Financial Times of a meeting. I was not at that meeting and I doubt whether he was. I am even doubtful the journalists were present. The argument--presented yet again--that there is no interest and that the PPP is not progressing is erroneous.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South made a substantive point regarding the PricewaterhouseCoopers modelling and his concern over fares. He wanted to know whether the 1 per cent. increase had been modelled for perpetuity. The figure is based on the current pattern of underground fares increases, which is inflation plus 1 per cent. That is in marked contrast to the previous Administration's stewardship of fares. We were promised that fares would be frozen, yet they never were and we saw vast increases above the price of inflation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not sure that the Minister has strictly answered my point. I was talking about a factor that had been fed into the TfL model to work out whether a PPP was economically sustainable. All I want to know is how far the hon. Lady predicts a real terms increase in fares beyond 2001.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> I said that our fares modelling was based on the principle of an increase of inflation plus 1 per cent. over the years to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I presume that that could be taken forward in perpetuity, had the modellers been consulting a crystal ball.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> They were your words.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> I am not disputing that they were my words; I am simply attempting to point out to the hon. Gentleman that we have a fare based system at the moment; fare increases are based on inflation plus 1 per cent. That is in marked contrast to fares under the previous regime, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I shall quote the Minister. She said on Tuesday:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the model--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"assumes a real increase in fares after 2001".--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 23 February 1999; c. 755.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I emphasise the word "after". For how long after?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> If that is the official record, clearly that is what I said. I understood that I said that the modelling was for a real terms increase for 2000 and 2001. I repeat, that estimate was based on a fare increase of inflation plus 1 per cent. It may be that that will be in perpetuity what the mayor will decide, but for the purposes of defining the practicalities of the public-private partnership regarding fares, that is the modelling used.
<P>
The bulk of the contribution of the hon. Member for Croydon, South felt like a history lesson. We were taken down the tired old streets of the privatisation versus nationalisation argument. The hon. Gentleman spoke of privatisation sweeping all before it, markedly ignoring this country's experiences of privatisations in the utilities. They certainly did not bring universal benefits for the consumer either in water, gas or electricity.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the model for the privatisation of British Rail. Again, he presented the Committee with a glowing picture of an improved railway system post privatisation. Not so very long ago we heard from the Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee that complaints about the railway system had broken all previous records. The hon. Gentleman spoke of vast investment in our railway system, but that is not matched by the realities of passengers' experiences.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South was particularly agitated by the public-private partnership because he saw it as a recipe for the public and private sectors being continually critical and constantly attempting to blame each other. That is exactly what we have seen since rail privatisation, which is why my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made it clear in the first rail summit last year that we must get away from the blame culture that has suffused the industry post privatisation. Train operating companies blame Railtrack, Railtrack blames the train operating companies, both parties blame the ROSCOs and at times they all try to blame the regulatory regime. It is entirely possible for there to be a third way--as with our proposed public-private partnership--whereby the public and private sectors in partnership acknowledge existing quality and produce the best possible results for London Underground.
<P>
I have responded to some of the issues around privatisation that the hon. Member for Croydon, South mentioned, but perhaps I can remind the Committee of the previous Administration's proposal for London Underground--it was indeed a privatisation. It was estimated at one point that it would take more than four years to introduce the privatisation plans, which would have excised one third of the existing lines of the underground.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would the Government Whip please listen to the Minister rather than discuss matters from a sedentary position. That causes difficulties for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
At the time of the proposed privatisation of the underground, the then Secretary of State for Transport informed the then Chancellor of the Exchequer that, after privatisation, the public purse would have to provide considerable sums of money for a considerable time. That is not what we propose. Our proposal was mandated by Londoners; it appeared in our manifesto. Our central guiding principle is to ensure best value for the public.
<P>
I recommend our new clause and ask the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey not to press their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps I can make my point in a speech rather than in an intervention. Will the Minister say why she believes that the public sector will be able to operate London Underground better than the private sector?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked me that question during our previous sitting and my answer to him--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister did not answer me then.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> I rather think that I answered the hon. Gentleman by saying that his question was another example of his antipathy to the public sector, regardless of what the public service was. It was somewhat ungenerous of him to be so critical of the management of London Underground when the chief executive and the managing director were appointed so recently. The new chief executive had vast private sector experience before he decided that he wanted to work in the public sector.
<P>
There is no division of ability between public and private sectors in the way that the hon. Gentleman believes. It is entirely possible f or them to work in genuine partnership in the best interests of London and Londoners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Minister did not reply to most of the points that I made. The Committee will be pleased that I shall not repeat them in full, but I should like her to make some attempt to answer the major points. Three options were proposed and the Minister failed to address any of them.
<P>
One option is that of a public interest company. It would ensure, in various ways, that borrowings would not appear in the public sector borrowing requirement or, if the Minister pursued the no-state guarantee option, they would not appear on the public sector balance sheet at all. We would like a reply on that.
<P>
Another option is for a relaxed public-private partnership that would make it possible for a public sector operator to bid with private sector companies for infrastructural contracts. The Minister did not respond to that proposal.
<P>
There is also the need for a third option--a reserve position--which would be important given that no money will be set aside by the Chancellor in the financial year after next and the one following that.
<P>
The Minister replied by merely suggesting again that all is sweetness and light in London Transport--the PPP proposals are thought to be the best thing since sliced bread.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would not put words into my mouth that I did not utter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I did not mean to put words into the Minister's mouth; I was trying to paraphrase. What the Minister said was that neither of us was at the meeting and could not know what was discussed by the non--executive directors of London Transport. I am not sure whether any legislation applies, but I am sure that the Minister could ask for the minutes of that meeting to be published, if she is concerned about press reports getting such matters wrong. Then we could really find out what the non-executive directors of London Transport think, and that might help our debate.

<P>

<B> Ms Jackson:</B> I am not concerned about newspaper reports, but I am concerned about the hon. Gentleman basing his arguments on unsubstantiated reports. As I have said to him already, the PPP is creating great interest in the private sector because the Government have made it abundantly clear that what motivates us is best value and the best interests of the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister continually tries to make those points, but she is still failing to answer our substantive Questions. She says, "Those are press reports and therefore shouldn't be taken seriously," but she has failed to publish and give to the Committee the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and its modelling, on which the legislation is presumably based. As she has not given us that information, the press reports are all that we have to go on. If she wants to give us other information so that we can consider the substantive arguments on PPP, we should be delighted. She cannot have it both ways. We are restricted by the lack of information that we have been given and are allowed to give, so we have to go by press reports. The Government should be more open.
<P>
In reply to interventions by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, the Minister said that the modelling may have assumed that fare increases have been built in, in perpetuity. Will she return to that point? It is a significant piece of information for the people of London.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and his hon. Friends advance many arguments about alternatives to a public-private partnership. The basic point that they attempt to make is that they want to see any controls over public spending borrowing requirements abolished--they may use any words that they wish, but that is the basis of all their arguments. We have said before that we do not think that the GLA--as a local authority--should be excluded or excused from the borrowing requirements that are placed on every other local authority.
<P>
As I have told the Liberal Democrats, we examined many alternatives. We believe that the PPP presents the best option, but as the hon. Gentleman is clearly concerned about the matter, I repeat that we will not be driven by an artificial ideology or a deadend date. On the public-private partnership, the Government are driven by best value and by the aim of producing the best results for the people of London. I trust that the new clauses will become part of the Bill, and that the amendments will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not at all persuaded by the Minister's response: She has not addressed the points--that we have been making. I hope that you will exercise your discretion, Mr. Winterton, and allow us to have separate votes on the amendments.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following:
<P>
Government new clause 43--Register of key system assets.
<P>
Government new clause 44--Related third party agreements.
<P>
 Government new clause 45--Protection of key system assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It may help the Committee if, in my introduction, I speak to new clauses 43 to 45 as well as to new clause 42. You have grouped them together, Mr. Winterton, and they all deal with the designation of key system assets.
<P>
New clause 42 will define the term "key system assets". Those assets could comprise property, rights or liabilities and could be designated in one of two ways. First, a PPP agreement as originally concluded could list the relevant assets, or describe the categories within which those assets would be designated. Secondly, the contract may provide for assets to be designated by London Transport or TfL after contract award, in accordance with the terms of the PPP agreement or by amendment to it.
<P>
We envisage that a large range of assets will be designated as key system assets so that they enjoy the protection afforded by new clause 45. That must be done through the PPP agreement or amendments to it, so that assets cannot be designated without the agreement of the PPP contractor.
<P>
New clause 43 will ensure that interested individuals and bodies can find out whether an asset has been designated as a key system asset. I am thinking especially of those that might make financial advances, such as a bank that proposes to lend to a PPP contractor on the security of the assets, or someone wishing to buy equipment from a PPP contractor. If an asset has been so designated, there are significant restrictions on what a PPP contractor may do with it. Those restrictions are set out in new clause 45. It is important that third parties can find out if an asset is so designated so that they do not unknowingly enter into a transaction with a PPP contractor that will be void.
<P>
New clause 43, therefore, will require London Transport, and subsequently TfL, to maintain a register of all key system assets, including dates of designation and sufficient information for assets to be identified. The register must be available for inspection by members of the public, free of charge, at all reasonable hours. Anyone inspecting the register may make copies from it.
<P>
New clause 44 will empower London Transport, and again, subsequently TfL, to enter into agreements with third parties involving the provision of property or rights for use for, or in connection with, a PPP agreement. Such third-party agreements may designate assets, or provide for their designation, as key system assets as if the agreement were between London Transport or TfL and the PPP contractor.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to give the same protection to assets that are owned by third parties and used in connection with the Underground PPP as would be given to assets owned directly by the PPP contractor. It is likely that, for example, a PPP contractor might want to lease new trains or other equipment from the manufacturer or a leasing company. In such cases, London Underground would almost certainly want to enter agreements directly with sub-contractors of a PPP contractor, so that it could step in and take over from the PPP contractor at the end of the contract, or if the contract were terminated before its due end date.
<P>
New clause 44 permits such agreements, and enables property and rights provided by such key sub-contractors to be designated so that they receive the same protection under new clause 45 as other key system assets.
<P>
New clause 45 is intended to ensure that all the assets needed to keep the underground operating are given statutory protection. Ordinarily, a PFI contract would restrict a contractor's ability to sell important assets, or would enable a third party to take security over those assets. Such restrictions could be enforced through the courts. But a PPP is not an ordinary PFI contract, and ensuring the continuity of underground services is of paramount importance. It is therefore vital that at the expiry of a PPP contract, or if a PPP contract is terminated prematurely, for whatever reason, London Underground is able to get back all of the assets that it needs to operate the system without delay or additional expense.
<P>
It would be unacceptable for an outgoing contractor to have transferred assets to others or used them as security for unpaid debts. Tube users cannot wait the long time that it would take to sort out such problems.
<P>
New clause 45 therefore restricts the ability of a PPP contractor to transfer or mortgage key assets, making such transactions void unless they have the consent of London Transport--or, subsequently, TfL. It also protects the assets by making void any creditor's claim to assert title over them.
<P>
As the key assets returned by the outgoing contractor are likely to be valuable, subsection (5) imposes a duty on London Transport--and, subsequently, TfL--to ensure that there is an agreed mechanism for valuing the assets, so that the contractor will not lose out where investment has been undertaken that cannot be recovered from the service payments.
<P>
I am sure that the Committee will agree that this is an important--albeit technical--set of amendments, and I hope that all parties will support them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I have two questions on these new clauses. First, the Minister has not given us a clear description of what will be a key system asset. In his opening remarks, he made a few comments about that, but I want to press him on exactly what the Government mean by a key system asset. By definition, any transport network is inextricably linked. Many assets in a transport network such as London Underground are inherently linked. An escalator may not be regarded by some as a key system asset, but for the travelling public, who want to get to the platform, it is. Are turnstiles key system assets? I should like the Minister to be a little clearer on that point.
<P>
I understand why the new clauses are important. Will deeming assets to be key to the system effectively reduce the value of London Underground? Is that why the previous Government valued London Underground so cheaply, when many people outside valued it at a much higher price?
<P>
My second question is: why is the protection that the Minister proposes necessary? It may be that the Government want to make it absolutely clear to everyone that they have no intention of privatising London Underground. I would have thought that they could make that clear in other ways. I am not sure why the provisions need to be written into the Bill; presumably, they could simply be written into the PPP contracts. Ministers could make statements to that effect; we do not need a statutory provision. Why are we debating new clauses that may be unnecessary?
<P>
I suspect that the purpose of the new clauses--especially new clause 45--is to prevent key system assets from being used as collateral or security. I think that that is the real point, rather than the privatisation issue. If so, that is not the way forward. That will exclude the option that we have been suggesting--allowing a public interest company to borrow money to invest in the underground using assets as security in a reasonable manner. That will prevent efficient capital allocation. Most companies in a market are allowed to use their assets in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): To follow that point through, if the collateral were secured and the party relying on that security repossessed the assets, how could the public transport system continue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am more than happy to answer that question. The public sector would then have to take a view on how to react to the financial state of London Underground. It could put up fares or it could make grants to the company. It could deal with such a situation.
<P>
The risks that the hon. Gentleman is talking about are infinitesimal. Many companies are happy to borrow against their assets, using prudent guidelines to ensure that they are not taking undue risks. I would have thought that a public interest company would be given a set of prudent guidelines for its borrowing against its expected revenue stream and a reasonable valuation of its assets. That would be used as a measure of its credit worthiness. That is certainly how things are run in New York.
<P>
The new clauses will lay the dead hand of the Treasury on the contractors of the new PPP system, which will prevent the efficient use of capital. That is a mistake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman said but he did not completely answer my point. If his ideas were to be put into practice, there would still be considerable delay, during which a large part of the underground system could be stopped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> That may not be the case. The Government can act quickly on many occasions, and it could act immediately. The Government appear to be able to dream up new clauses to put before the Committee overnight, so I am sure that they could act if that were a real danger.--[Interruption.] The Minister says from a sedentary position that I do not understand; I completely understand the issues concerning moral hazard, which is what lies behind the new clause. If a private sector company does not have guarantees behind it, it must be able to go bust. The Government clearly want to ensure that if a private contractor goes bust, key system assets will remain and revert back to the public sector. That is an ingenious device, but an unnecessary one. It prevents efficient use of the current balance sheet of London Underground, and reflects Treasury paranoia, which we have seen throughout the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked a series of questions that I will happily answer, and then embarked on an extraordinary passage that revealed that Liberal Democrats have no practical understanding of how to put together complex financial packages to ensure that infrastructure of the order of London Underground can operate with guarantees and continuity.
<P>
Let me first answer the hon. Gentleman's questions. Her asked what key system assets were likely to be. There is a large number of such items. As he will know from new clause 43, they will be listed. London Underground will be required to produce a register of the key system assets, which will include rolling stock, escalators, signalling, track, tunnel linings and many assets that are fundamental to the operation of the underground and which are the subject of the contractual relationship with the infrastructure company.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the value of London Underground could be reduced by the valuation of those assets. The answer is no--it could not in practice, because the basis of the agreement is that such assets revert to London Underground and are not passed into the private sector. The contractor has the use of the key system assets but is not able either to use them as collateral for borrowing or to appropriate them. Long-term ownership returns to London Underground, which underpins its value.
<P>
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman asked why the Government are incorporating restrictions on the use of key system assets into the Bill rather than into the contracts. We are doing so to make the basis of the contracts clear beyond doubt to anyone who enters into them. It must be desirable to ensure that no one gets into a PPP contract with any misunderstanding about the nature of permitted use of the key system assets. If the hon. Gentleman reflects, he will recognise that it is right for that point to be clarified in statute.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about the new clauses preventing contractors from using the assets for collateral. He must recognise that were they not designed for that purpose, and were one of his beloved public interest companies to exist and to use key system assets as collateral, the banks that had lent the money against the collateral would be able to possess those assets if the company were to get into financial difficulties or be unable to meet its liabilities. Does he seriously suggest that London Underground should grind to a halt while banks possess the assets? If he thinks that such circumstances could be sorted out overnight, he has little or no experience of negotiations between creditors and other parties in the event of liquidation. The hon. Gentleman has revealed only too clearly the Liberal Democrats' inability to understand the nature of the proposed contracts and the disciplines necessary for the effective London underground service that the Government are determined to maintain and to ensure.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will not be bamboozled by the hon. Gentleman's rather naive approach and that it will support the new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall be brief. I am grateful for some of the Minister's reply and clarification, but the final part of his response requires further questioning. In the real world, the financial performance of a company such as London Underground could deteriorate. That would not happen overnight in a sudden financial crisis. It would be fairly easy to see such decline occurring as years pass, rather than weeks or months. It would be easy to suggest to Transport for London that congestion charges and other such revenue streams should he increased. The  mayor could be asked to increase such income, if that were the only other alternative.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): Does the hon. Gentleman really think that the operating companies can just go to the mayor and obtain an additional subvention that would be imposed upon the employers and motorists of London just like that? These are very serious matters. Londoners will bitterly resent the charges, so the hon. Gentleman should not be so flippant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am certainly not flippant about the matter. I am trying to argue that an alternative course may be taken in the extraneous emergency situations that we are discussing, and that trains would not have to stop running, as has been suggested. In the real world, the mayor, the board of TfL and the board of a public interest company would rightly come under severe criticism, because they would have allowed the failures to occur.
 The mayor will have to explain himself or herself to the electorate--that is how it works. The idea that London Underground would suddenly come to a stop is nonsense. The Government should live in the real world and understand how such financial situations arise and what can be done to put them right. I do not know if the Minister wants to try to dig himself out of this hole and argue for the new clauses. If so, I shall be interested to hear his arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I have a small point for the Minister regarding new clause 43(3), which refers to the public being able to inspect the register free of charge. What consideration has been given to the cost of maintaining the register and to whether there should be a charge for inspecting it? There is often a charge for property and company search services. The organisations dealing with the private companies in relation to assets which are not key system assets would normally, in the commercial market, pay a charge for that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a perfectly valid point. The compilation of the register is, of course, in TfL's interests that is why it is so important. It is also important that people should have access to it and not feel that they are prevented by cost from checking whether particular items are on the key asset register, so it is right that the service should be available free of charge.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton revealed, probably involuntarily, his complete failure to understand the whole issue. In the example that he gave in response to my earlier comments, he said that any failure on the part of TfL would take a long time to show itself. He does not realise that we are talking about infrastructure companies rather than TfL as whole. It would be easy for a single infrastructure company, which may not have the same level of assets as Tfl, to get into financial difficulties, particularly if it had interests in other parts of the world. At that point, its creditors could foreclose. In that position, if there were not safeguards, the underground would stop because the creditors would have foreclosed on key assets which enable it to operate. The Liberal Democrats do not understand the mechanics of these essential measures to enable the public-private partnership to operate.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government new clause 47--
Land registration and PPP leases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> New clauses 46 and 47 both deal with property aspects of the PPP. New clause 46 defines a PPP lease. It provides for its designation as such, and disapplies landlord and tenant law from such leases. There is a considerable body of statute and common law which could adversely affect the relationship between London Underground Ltd and the PPP contractors and, in particular, which might make it difficult for the public sector to regain complete control of the network's infrastructure at the end of a contract. New clause 47 would disapply that body of law entirely from PPP leases, so that both parties would interpret their rights and duties purely in accordance with the PPP contract into which they had entered.
<P>
The rights of third parties, such as retailers at tube stations, would be unaffected, as non-operational property will remain the responsibility of London Underground, and will therefore not come within the ambit of a PPP lease.
<P>
The disapplication of landlord and tenant law is precedented in legislation passed under the previous Government. But I stress that we see this as a one-off disapplication, recognising the unique nature of the public-private partnership that we are creating for the London Underground. We are not signalling any change in our general policy on landlord and tenant law, and I hope that nobody reading the record of today's proceedings will take away that impression.
<P>
New clause 47 disapplies the normal requirement to register title with the Land Registry for leases of more than 21 years. Much of London Underground's property was acquired many years ago by different railway companies and other bodies, and has often not been registered. Applying to register title for such land for the first time would be an enormous task. The amendment would disapply the registration requirement, saving the considerable time and money which would otherwise be required to produce copies of suitable plans, deeds, and so on. The effort of complying with the registration requirements would be of little or no benefit because of the very restricted opportunities for the contractors to transfer or otherwise deal with the land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Can the Minister confirm that he has taken advice, and that the lack of registration will be no disadvantage to a prospective other party? After all, that is where people often go for their information.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants. We have consulted closely with the Land Registry, which recommended this course of action. It would not have done so if it had believed that there was any risk to third parties in the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Is the Minister saying that he envisages that in perpetuity the unregistered and uncoordinated approach that he has inherited will continue? Or is he holding out some hope that at some stage in the near future this will be brought into a more orderly fashion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We are dealing with a most complex network of underground tunnels. Many of them were created in circumstances in which the normal land registration requirements were not taken into account. As I have already said, the time and effort that would be required to register all of these, for little or no practical purpose--these are underground tunnels, after all--would be disproportionate.
<P>
I have no doubt that over a period of time, particularly as the development of the key system assets register progresses, there will be a greater opportunity, where it is appropriate, for registration to be sought. I cannot believe that the right hon. Gentleman would suggest an entirely unproductive use of the time of public officials and private companies in compiling lists that would otherwise be of no benefit or beneficial use.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I wish to ask a question about this matter, for which the Minister is entitled to notice. I do not expect him to answer it now, but I should appreciate a letter.
<P>
The general principle under English law is that whoever owns the surface owns theoretically to the heavens and theoretically to the centre of the earth. There are, of course, statutory exceptions, such as the Coal Acts of the immediate post-war years, and the Civil Aviation Acts. If an airliner goes over my back garden at a great height, it is not an act of trespass because of the statutory exemption, but otherwise it would be.
<P>
I can see that the ownership of surface land by London Underground is simple to handle. It is as simple as the ownership of any other piece of surface ground. But how does one own a tunnel? Is it a complex wayleave? Does one have the right to go underneath the surface along a designated corridor?
<P>
I dare say that I have taken the Minister by surprise. I hope that it is not too bizarre a question, but it would be nice to have it settled.
<P>
It is an appropriate moment to ask this question. When the moment passes, it will no longer have the same pertinence.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a very appropriate moment to break for afternoon tea. [Laughter.] I suspect that it may well give the Minister and his advisers time to produce a response.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that we are dealing with Government new clause 46, with which we are considering new clause 47. Just before our tea break, the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) raised the most interesting matter of the ownership of tunnels in a question to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As you rightly said, Mr. Winterton, the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) asked me a question, and I was on the point of giving a detailed and comprehensive reply when you kindly suggested that we adjourn for tea. During our tea break, I reflected a little on the hon. Gentleman's question. I felt that it would probably not be in the Committee's interest if I waxed long about the different bases on which easements have been granted in the 100 years or more in which the underground system has been built. I undertake, therefore, to write to the hon. Gentleman with a fuller answer than it would he appropriate to give this evening.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With, I hope, Minister, copies to all members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Indeed, with copies to all members of the Committee and not least to you, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
New clause 47 is designed to eliminate unnecessary administrative costs in implementing the public-private partnership. I hope that all members of the Committee will support it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> This group of Government amendments creates a special PPP administration order regime. Its purpose is to ensure that the normal duties of an administrator under the Insolvency Act 1986--principally to protect the interests of the company's creditors--do not interrupt the continuity of services for passengers if a PPP contractor runs into major financial difficulties.
<P>
London Underground will want to ensure that PPP contractors are financially robust so that they are well able to finance their obligations. It would, however, be imprudent not to put in place statutory powers to enable TfL, to react in the most effective way if a contractor happened to fail financially, as happens in the real world.
<P>
New clause 48 defines a PPP administration order. Such an order may be made by the High Court in relation to a PPP contractor that is on the point of insolvency or which is winding up. It will be made so that a person appointed by the court can take over the running of the contractor to achieve the purposes of the PPP administration order and to protect the interests of the contracting company's members and creditors. The purposes of the PPP administration order are to transfer the undertaking to another person so that the relevant activities can be continued and to carry on the undertaking until then.
<P>
New clause 48 also introduces new schedules 3 and 2. New schedule 3 sets out the adaptations to the Insolvency Act 1986 that would apply to a PPP administration order. New schedule 2 sets out the powers and procedures applicable to transfer schemes, which could he used to transfer property rights and liabilities from the failing PPP contractor to another company able to continue the business.
<P>
New clause 49 describes the procedures under which a PPP administration order could be made following a special petition from the mayor. The procedures are based closely on those applying under general insolvency law. The mayor--or TfL acting as the mayor's agent--could make a special petition to the High Court applying for a PPP administration order. The court could make such an order if it was satisfied that the PPP contractor was likely to be unable to pay his debts, or if the Secretary of State had certified that it would be appropriate to wind up the company in the public interest--for example, following a report on a company into allegations of fraud.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Will the mayor be able to take action in the first of those circumstances without the authority of the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My understanding is that the mayor will certainly be able to act in such circumstances, if he believes that a contractor is unlikely to be able to pay his debts.
<P>
We would expect London Underground to pick up any emerging problems with a PPP contractors' credit worthiness as part of the normal management of the PPP contracts. However, new clauses 50 and 51 will ensure that the mayor is given formal notice of any steps to wind up a PPP contractor, to put it into administration or to enforce security over its assets, so that he can consider whether to petition for a PPP administration order.
<P>
New clause 50 would prohibit a petition for the winding up of a PPP contractor, other than by the mayor, unless the petitioner had served notice on the mayor and at least 14 days had then elapsed.
<P>
New clause 51 would prohibit both a PPP company from seeking to wind up its own business voluntarily, and any person from taking steps to enforce security over a PPP company's property--again, unless the mayor was given at least 14 days' advance notice.
<P>
In all those cases, the 14-day notice period would give the mayor the opportunity to apply for a PPP administration order if he or she considered that to be the best course of action.
<P>
New clause 52 deals with interpretation of the preceding amendments on PPP administration orders, which, as the Committee will appreciate, are quite complex. I commend this group of important new clauses to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> As I did not want to interrupt the Minister's flow, I saved my question until the end. He has carefully set out what happens if a PPP contractor gets into difficulty. Will he tell us what happens if it is the other way round--if there is an insufficient revenue stream for the underground to pay the contractor?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In that case, the contractor would obviously seek the normal commercial remedies against London Underground. That would probably he provided for in the contractual agreement. It is unlikely that a contractor would enter such a contract without specific procedures to cover the eventuality of non-payment. In the event of non-payment, the normal commercial procedures would apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister has made an important point. Might there be a guarantee by a third party, so that London Underground or TfL could pay the contractor whatever the circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not fully follow the hon. Gentleman's logic. Perhaps he would like to expand on the circumstances in which a third party could be involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was trying to be too clever. I wondered whether the Government would underwrite the debts of TfL or offer a guarantee to the contractor that TfL would be bailed out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly valid and important point, and the best that I can offer him is to give the matter further consideration and return to him. I would be happy to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Minister has just outlined what would happen if a PPP contractor went bust or was otherwise unable to meet his contractual obligations. I tried to make a similar point before the sitting was suspended for a break. I was accused of financial illiteracy and told that such procedures were impossible because it would take a long time to put in place the various moves to ensure that London's transport could continue. The new clauses provide that the PPP contractor will be given 14 days' notice by the mayor, and will therefore be able to solve the problems by bringing in another contractor. The Government seem to have reversed their arguments in the space of an hour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister said that the general provisions for detailed winding-up procedures are transferred across from usual company law, bankruptcy law and so on. As far as I could work out, on the face of it that appears to be true. Is this the first time that English law has provided for the type of organisation in question--a public-private partnership--and set out such a procedure for bringing it to an end? I ask the question in innocence, although I assume that that is the case, and that the Bill not only creates a unique authority but also a unique species of beast that will roam around it. If I am correct my point flags up the importance of getting the legislation right--whether in Committee or on Report--and of ensuring that all the safeguards referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton and others are in place in case something goes wrong. The Government, however, say no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton thought that the 14-day period for the mayor to seek an administration order was inconsistent with the approach that we set out in response to his comments on new clauses debated earlier. There is no inconsistency at all. The structure of the arrangements is designed to ensure continuity of service of the underground. When a contractor is faced with the likelihood of liquidation or receivership, a mechanism must be in place to enable the mayor to obtain an administration order to ensure that the service continues.
<P>
That is precisely the arrangement that is necessary to guard against possible eventualities. The hon. Gentleman proposed an entirely different framework in which a public sector company would be able to borrow money and to operate the infrastructure contracts as well as the underground. If such a company were to become insolvent, there would be no one to step in, because it would technically be operating the railway while also being the body against which the insolvency action was being taken. The hon. Gentleman failed to understand that that is why his proposal is completely different both from the new clauses proposed by my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London and from my remarks on the proposed new clause in question.
<P>
I should tell the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that the Railways Act 1993 contains provisions that set precedents in a number of key respects for the provisions before us. The PPP is a unique framework, so it does not follow the procedures that applied in the Railways Act in all respects. That Act provides for circumstances analogous to those provided for in respect of PPPs to ensure that assets necessary for continued operation of the network are not lost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> As I indicated, I made my inquiry without prior knowledge of the answer. Will the Minister answer another question either now or later? He spoke about the measures in place in case something goes wrong, which have to be in any legislation. Did the example to which he referred provide for public sector provision from the Treasury if it was needed to be drawn on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, I was not involved in progressing the railways legislation through Parliament, as that was done by the previous Government. I cannot give him an instant response, but I undertake to look further into the matter and write to him on it, and to send copies to all members of the Committee.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that hon. Members recognise that these new clauses are fundamental to ensuring the orderly operation of London Underground under the new PPP and to providing a proper safeguard--
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke earlier about collateral and suggested that the Government were changing their mind. In fact, we have been perfectly consistent. The earlier provisions dealt with collateral of third-party companies. Here we are ensuring that the underground continues to operate at all times if the infrastructure companies get into trouble.

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government new clause 54--
Interpretation of PPP provisions.
<P>
I welcome back the Minister for Transport in London.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton. It is a pleasure to be here with you again.
<P>
New clause 53 extends statutory undertaker status to a PPP contractor when carrying out the subject matter of a PPP agreement. London Underground Ltd. is a statutory undertaker, which means that it enjoys particular privileges--for example, under planning law--in recognition of its public service responsibilities. To the extent that a PPP contractor would assume London Underground Ltd's responsibilities for maintaining and modernising the tube network, the new clause would provide that it also assumed London Underground Ltd's status as a statory undertaker.
<P>
New clause 54 is a standard interpretation clause for the PPP clauses and schedules. I commend both new clauses to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> There are some clauses such as new clause 53--which I spotted in time--with perfectly comfortable and conventional titles. Others, such as new clause 52, which was discussed as one of a group and therefore moved formally, fail the plain English test for clause titles. I hope that those who draft legislation end up drafting titles as well as clauses that ordinary people can read and understand. Perhaps when the Bill is on Report, we can correct titles such as that of new clause 52. There may also be others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Titles do not go in Bills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that titles do not go in Bills. That is not my understanding. Some titles certainly do end up in Bills, on the right hand side of the clauses. I am not an expert, so I do not know when they do and when they do not, but I believe that they generally go in the margin of Bills and thus emerge in the margin of Acts. Perhaps someone could ensure by the time that the Bill is on Report that we have phrases or sentences rather than collections of words, commas and full stops.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a somewhat unfair allegation, certainly for those who are responsible for drafting these clauses. As I am sure he knows, the title to which he refers is not a title in the sense that one would understand it, either for a Bills a novel or a play. It is simply an interpretation of what the clause contains.

</UL></FONT><P>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
It seems a long time since today's proceedings began, but this is my first opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton. This is a small landmark in my very brief career in this place, because it is the first time that I have been entrusted with the task of moving a new clause. I hope that the Committee appreciates that that shows the Conservatives' commitment to giving real opportunities to those who are less able.
<P>
It was suggested to me that I might move the new clause late on Tuesday evening, and I am pleased that that task is still open to me. That shows the magnanimity of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, because last night, Croydon's football team was decisively beaten one nil by Uxbridge, but he has decided not to take it out on me.
<P>
I fear that I have been asked to speak because my skills are raw and untested, so I tend to be extremely brief. I am sure that Labour Members will be disappointed to learn that I do not have the exquisite talent of the Liberal Democrat team of managing to extract every little nuance from the deletion of a single word.
<P>
I was interested to learn on Tuesday evening that the Jubilee line extension passes through the constituency of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, among others. I thought that the Committee might consider that, in the manner of Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" and the punishment fitting the crime, it is appropriate that the hon. Gentleman's constituency is being bored by Jubilee line engineers. I think that we would also agree that there is no need for any extra boring in either Kingston or Surbiton.
<P>
However, I turn to the new clause. Another reason that it has fallen to me to move it is because it is simple and obvious. It would introduce a form of universal through-ticketing for London. Many, if not all, members of the Committee would consider that to be a worthwhile aim. Indeed, it may well be pointed out that that is already possible under clause 135. However, there is no duty for that to happen in the Bill as drafted. We want not only to give power for that happen, but to ensure that it is implemented.
<P>
As we recognise that even this Government cannot always deliver overnight the things that the Liberal Democrats think that they can do, subsection (2) sets a deadline for implementation of five years from enactment.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) on his first speech to a new clause. The title of the new clause, in its brevity and precision, matched his contribution--leavened as it was in the most delightful way with the most pertinent wit. I hope that the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Kingston and Surbiton will take note of the extremely humorous piece of advice afforded by the hon. Member for Uxbridge, but I fear the worst.
<P>
New clause 27 would require the mayor to introduce within five years of the Bill's enactment ticketing arrangements allowing passengers to travel on more than one mode of public transport on the purchase of a single ticket. The new clause is unnecessary. Such ticketing arrangements already exist, the most prominent and popular form is travelcard. Travelcard is an extremely popular and successful product. Thousands of people--including those who travel to the capital from destinations beyond the Greater London boundary--make use of it every day. The facility is much valued by passengers. It makes journeys that much easier. It is similarly valued by transport operators for several operational and commercial reasons.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The travelcard scheme is not statutory; it is underpinned by a voluntary agreement between LRT and the train-operating companies. Transport for London will inherit LT's obligations under that agreement and will thus continue to offer the benefits of travelcard to those who visit, live and work in London
<P>
It beggars belief that any mayor would want to risk losing the benefits of such a popular and effective means of promoting public transport. It is much more likely that the mayor will want to build on the advantages that travelcard offers, whether by further developing the electronic smartcard products that LT is currently researching or by other means. For the reasons that I have given, there is no need to legislate to require the mayor to do that.
<P>
There is also no need to legislate because the thrust of part IV is that London's transport should be improved. Clause 122, which we discussed earlier, states plainly
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Mayor shall develop and implement policies for the promotion ... of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Travelcard and products like it will be vital components in helping the mayor to discharge that duty. Indeed, it is difficult to see how reducing the benefits that travelcard offers could be consistent with it. Increasing the potential and possibility of multimodal ticketing will be an express part of the Government's integrated public transport system. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Uxbridge to withdraw the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): It is a pleasure to be under your chairmanship again, Mr. Winterton. I want to congratulate the hon. Member for Uxbridge on the way in which he moved the amendment. It was very entertaining, even if it was at the expense of one or two of my colleagues--
[Hon. Members: "And you."] No, I do not recollect that the hon. Gentleman's contribution referred to Sutton and Cheam--although I am sure that I will in a minute. I invited that comment from hon. Members.
<P>
We support the new clause. The way in which the Bill sets up the relationship between TfL, the mayor and the franchise director does not give us sufficient assurance that we will have a fully integrated ticketing system. At the moment, London Transport is doing well at putting together its prestige ticketing system. There is, however, the potential problem of making sure that the train-operating companies are on board with that system. That is because of their shorter planning horizons. They may have to follow on behind because the investment that London Transport is putting into the system sets the standard.
<P>
It would be better to implement the standard through a duty of the sort for which the new clause provides. That would give us the certainty that the mayor, through his strategies and guidance to the office of Passenger Rail Franchising--inadequate though that guidance may be--could guarantee a consistent ticketing system that could be used everywhere.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said, but the issue of delivering the prestige system and the fact that TOCs are not entirely on board is a concern. The hon. Member for Uxbridge has done the Committee a service by raising the issue in the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> We heard what the Minister said and we are slightly disappointed that the provisions in the new clause will not be mandatory. I am particularly disappointed because I still have to buy two tickets to get to the House of Commons. I have to get one when I catch the bus to Uxbridge underground station outside my house; I have to queue up again to get a ticket to come to Westminster. In order to move our proceedings on and in the light of what the Minister said, disappointing though it was, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We had a constructive debate two weeks ago on the subject of the river, and I shall not detain the Committee for long on this point. The White Paper, "A Mayor and Assembly for London", rightly states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The river is a much under-used resource, with the potential to offer an environmentally friendly alternative for many trips across London.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the new clauses is to explore whether the mayor will be able to introduce inducements or encouragements to stimulate such development. The revelation from the Minister for Transport in London earlier today, that the revenue streams from road pricing and from the parking levy, if introduced, would not necessarily be earmarked for the London Underground, would mean that the mayor would have a cash flow and would be looking for things to do with it. The promotion of economic development on the river would therefore be a highly desirable objective for a much underiused facet of London life.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We entirely support both the objective of the new clause and the idea that there could be rates remission or another form of financial subsidy. If we are to have public private partnership--the Government's choice for the London Underground--the new clause would provide a method for getting public-private partnerships for river use, to the advantage of employers and others. I hope that the Government will at least be sympathetic to the general proposition, even if we have to redraft it on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) is not present. I advised my noble Friend Lord Archer, the other day, of events that took place at the beginning of the century. The progressive party on the London county council--which had controlled the LCC from 1898 to 1906, when the Liberal party won a great general election victory--was defeated the following year in a remarkable swing to the municipal reformers, the Conservative party. The Liberal party was taken out of office on the LCC because of a disastrous scheme for the river run by the LCC.
<P>
It was worth encouraging Lord Archer that it was possible to have such a substantial swing in municipal affairs in London so soon after our party had suffered a great defeat, as we did in 1906. The advice of the great Ernest Bevin, which was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Open that there Pandora's Box and there's no telling how many Trojan horses won't come out of it",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
makes it clear that my hon. Friend mounted a Trojan horse in moving the new clause. I congratulate him on the subtlety with which he has done it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am intrigued at the prospect of the Trojan horse going down the Thames, but I shall not pursue that analogy too far.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Croydon, South not only on the way in which he moved the new clause, but on his perspicacity in sub-contracting his job of moving new clauses and amendments to his hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, who did the job so admirably with the previous group of amendments. As the Conservative party strongly favours contracting out, perhaps he will offer the services of his hon. Friend to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey the hon. Member for Uxbridge could undoubtedly move Liberal Democrat amendments a lot faster than they do, and with greater wit than the Committee has been used to.
<P>
We agree with the sentiment behind new clause 34. We want to encourage greater use of the River Thames and perhaps London's other waterways. However, we do not think that the new clause is necessary. Clause 33(3)(e) would require the mayor to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the desirability of promoting and encouraging the use of the River Thames, in particular for the provision of passenger transport services and for the transportation of freight."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We debated and agreed that earlier. Therefore, there is already provision in the Bill for encouraging the promotion of use of the river for transport of passengers and freight.
<P>
The mayor, through Transport for London, will have general powers to give financial support to such businesses if he chooses. Therefore, there is no need for special provision to single out a form of transport in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. If necessary, the mayor will, have adequate powers to provide support to encourage the provision, for example, of piers and other facilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Will the mayor have the power to take action to reduce rates on businesses as suggested in the new clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> New clause 34 proposes that London businesses that invest in water transport should have their rate bills reduced. Under the rating system, as the hon. Gentleman will know, all rates collected throughout England are paid into a national rate pool and then redistributed to authorities in proportion to their populations.
<P>
The new clause would reduce the amount paid into the national pool and therefore would reduce the amount available for redistribution to all English authorities. One could not justify taking resources from local authorities throughout England in order to fund specific investment by London businesses in water transport. For that reason, the proposal is inappropriate and, as I have already said, is unnecessary as the power to provide financial incentives is already in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> To put my question in another way, will the mayor have the power to give rate grants to businesses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have already said that the mayor will have the power to give financial assistance in several ways. It would be inappropriate to reduce the rate demand as that would impact on other authorities; it would be unreasonable to expect them to pay for provision that is specifically for London. However, we are sympathetic in principle to greater encouragement of water-borne transport and the Bill already provides for that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South mentioned congestion-charging revenue and suggested that that would be a highly desirable use of such revenues. That is one of the issues that the mayor will be able to consider.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has recently sought opportunities for publicity to show his total opposition to congestion charging. It seems slightly odd, therefore, that this afternoon he has extolled the virtues of using the revenue from congestion charging when on a recent occasion he expressed his opposition to the principle of raising that revenue. It looks like the old Liberal Democrat trick of "trying to have your cake and eating it". I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman is following that route.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I an not sure that I am in order, Mr Winterton and I am not sure that the Minister was in order except that he was responding to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. I think that I am right in saying that the Minister for Transport in London, in a Parliamentary answer, said that the product of the charges to which the Minister for London and Construction has referred, would benefit public transport. I am not clear whether cyclists and pedestrians are regarded as part of public transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We are moving away from the purpose of the group of new clauses, which relate to water transport. Public transport services in London will be within the remit for the use of congestion charging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooks:</B> What I seek to verify--and I see that there is an opportunity for the Ministers to confer--is whether facilitating the movement of pedestrians and cyclists would be classified as public transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If I can avoid offending you, Mr Winterton, the answer to the right hon. Gentleman's question is yes: I assume that cyclists and pedestrians wish to travel by taking their bicycles and feet on to water transport. If so, we are within the remit of the new clauses.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 35 would introduce a curious requirement for the Secretary of State to report on measures that he had taken to encourage, or facilitate, the use of waterways for transport.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South did not mention that new clause. I checked with you, Mr. Winterton, to ensure that that was how the clauses were grouped. As the new clause has been included in the group, I feel that I should speak to it.
<P>
The thrust of our proposals is for the mayor to be responsible for the promotion of integrated transport. The Secretary of State's role will be limited. We have been criticised for having sought to give the Secretary of State too much power. I am astonished that the hon. Member for Croydon, South now seeks to place substantial obligations on the Secretary of State to intrude into the mayor's territory. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that, for that reason, we do not intend to accept the new clause and regard it as inconsistent with the line that the Conservative party took earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> On that latter point, I might be wrong but I understand that only the Secretary of State can introduce a report to Parliament. The mayor will have no such standing in Parliament and so will not be able to do so. I hope that that clarifies the wording of the new clause.
<P>
The Minister appeared to quote me as saying that the introduction of road pricing would be highly desirable. The record will show whether I said that, but I doubt it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B>  I think that I correctly recall that the hon. Gentleman said that the use of congestion charging revenue to support water transport would be highly desirable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If I said that, I certainly withdraw the inference that the Minister derives from the remarks. My party remains opposed to the introduction of road pricing in London. However, the debate on that subject is to come--probably next week.
<P>
The Minister for Transport in London said earlier that the model, by which the funding of the PPP will be conducted, did not rely on a revenue stream from either road pricing or a parking levy. Those streams will therefore be available to the mayor. That is a revelation. The mayor will have £200 million or £300 million a year to play with if he chooses to implement that model. We shall explore what will be done with those revenue schemes, and perhaps Ministers will explain that later.
<P>
My point was that if a mayor chose to introduce road pricing--though I might not support him politically--that would be as good a use as any that I could think of for the funds. However, I would not encourage him to do that and I would oppose any mayoral candidate who sought to do so.
<P>
The Minister has given a reasonable response to the new clause and explained how other aspects of the Bill cover the point that I sought to make. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I understand that Opposition Members have agreed to withdraw their amendments to clauses 168, 169 and 170, which deal respectively with concessionary fares, transport for disabled people, and penalty fares. I am deeply grateful to hon. Members for so doing. There will be an opportunity to discuss fully the issues that would have been raised on those clauses in the context of new clauses 56 to 59 and new schedule 4 on concessionary fares, the stand part debate on clause 169, and new clause 60 and new schedule 5 on penalty fares.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not sure that that was entirely a point of order. The amendments cannot be withdrawn from our consideration as they are on the amendment paper and the selection list. Of course, there is no reason for the Opposition to move them, and if the amendments are not moved they will fall. However, I have to call the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster to move amendment No. 415, as it is the lead amendment in the next group.
<H4><center>Clause 168</center></H4>
<H4><center>Concessionary fares</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 415, in page 84, leave out line 14 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1) The Mayor may request the Secretary of State by regulations to make provision for".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B>  With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 562, in page 84, line 14, leave out "may" and insert "shall".
<P>
No. 563, in line 14, after "regulations", insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"issued and in force no later than six months following the coming into force of this Act".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 416, in Clause 169, page 84, leave out line 43 and insert--

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 570, in Clause 169, page 84, line 43, leave out "may" and insert "shall".
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1) The Mayor may request the Secretary of State by regulations to make provision for".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief. I was not among those asked whether I wished to withdraw an amendment. I make no complaint about that. In a moment I shall ask the Committee's leave to withdraw my amendment.
<P>
I regard the action of the Government as a most congenial and agreeable anniversary present to me--it is the 22nd anniversary of my entering the House. The reason why I regard it as an anniversary present is that my amendments to clauses 168, 169 and 170 are on matters that are too small for the Secretary of State, but in which the mayor should instantly become involved. I am deeply moved that the force of the arguments that I would have deployed on amendments Nos. 416, 417 and 418 has caused the Government to table new clauses on such a scale, in order to divert me. May I ask leave to withdraw the amendment now, Mr. Winterton?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman made some introductory remarks. I am not sure whether that counts as his having moved the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I did move it, Mr. Winterton--and now I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I say now that we will seek to press one of the amendments to the new clauses in due course. I expect that one of my hon. Friends will give nortice to that effect later.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall be happy to consider that suggestion.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I congratulate the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster on his 22nd anniversary, and I express my gratitude to him for withdrawing his amendment.
<P>
The concessionary fares scheme is highly valued by elderly and disabled Londoners, and the Government are committed to ensuring that they can continue to enjoy it. Other issues, such as transport for disabled people and penalty fares, will be considered in the new clauses to which I have already referred. I therefore move that clause 168 should not stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do any hon. Members wish to speak? This is the point at which the debate on all the amendments, new clauses and new schedules associated with the clause stand part debate must take place. That is 849 850 important, and I am not sure that Members on the Opposition or the Government Benches are aware of it. I shall be perfectly happy if the Minister wishes to rise again--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr John M. Taylor:</B> I beg to move that the Committee do now adjourn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not accepting that. If the Minister would like more time, I see that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is happy to intervene at this point. Would that help the Minister? I think that members of the Committee are somewhat confused. The matter before the Committee for debate is that the clause stand part of the Bill. Other matters do not, at this stage, have to be moved formally--that will happen later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The confusion has arisen, at least on the part of Opposition Members, because we are also debating a new clause and it would therefore have been helpful to have had the Government's thinking on why the new clause was necessary before we responded and moved our amendments. I still wonder whether the Government might consider doing that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he has given the Ministers an opportunity to gather their thoughts, because it would be appropriate for them to speak to the Government new clauses and new schedule prior to contributions from other hon. Members. Those will all be moved formally later on, subject to the decision on the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I should like to make a few remarks about concessionary fares. A regime that exists on the back of encouraging concessionary fares for particular groups such as elderly and disabled people should encompass not only the obvious areas for concessions with which we have become familiar over many years. The transport authorities and the mayor should have at least the possibility of introducing concessionary fares for London residents, as opposed to people who use the transport system in London but are not residents. I have always thought that to be a neglected matter that should be explored.
<P>
Those of us who are London residents have to accept that the transport that we use daily for getting to and from work and for recreation is also used not only by people coming into London to work but by tourists. I am sure that all Committee members welcome tourists, who come to our great city to enjoy it and to share our enjoyment of it. They also bring welcome revenue and create a large number of jobs for Londoners.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to leave Ministers with a thought about tourists. It would not be unreasonable to charge one level of fares to tourists and to visitors on one hand, and to charge a different and concessionary rate to London residents for using what amounts to their own transport system on the other. I make that suggestion in the context of the overall rubric of concessionary fares, because we always tend to say simply that people should pay the same fares, unless they are in groups singled out for special favourable treatment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that people would have to show their passports when they buy tickets?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I suspected that I would receive a specious intervention of that sort, and that it would probably come from the hon. Gentleman. He has not disappointed me. Such a system is not beyond the wit of man. To apply for passes, people have to supply evidence of their identity, of their age and of various other characteristics. It would be even easier for people to prove in the same way that they are London council tax payers or London residents. In doing so, they would qualify for the lower fare in the fare structure that I am suggesting.
<P>
Such a system would be easy to administer, and it is not unreasonable to suggest that London residents and council tax payers who will be eligible to vote for the assembly and for the mayor might also qualify for a concessionary fare structure when using public transport in London. That approach would have another useful by-product. It would help to encourage the use of public transport by Londoners in London. Everyone usually subscribes to that as a worthy objective. People may accuse me of suggesting that an element of subsidy should come from tourists or visitors to Londoners. I would accept and welcome such subsidy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Euro.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I could well understand the confusion at a newspaper headline passed to me yesterday, which stated, "Blair Plans Death Of Pound" . It transpired that the headline was nothing to do with currency.
<P>
I have two questions. First, does the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst accept that he is moving perilously close to the putative mayoral platform of the hon. Member for Brent, East? Is he aware of that unfortunate confluence of thinking, which causes some confusion among Labour Members?
<P>
Secondly, is he aware of the possibility of reciprocal charging against Britons who--foolishly, in my opinion--choose to holiday abroad? That would almost certainly occur were his proposal to be implemented--retaliation is the word that springs to mind. The impact on London's massively successful tourist industry would be extremely serious. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman has considered those points, and I should be grateful to hear his conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I accept that those considerations would have to be fully examined if such a scheme were introduced. I do not think, however, that the deterrent effect is a realistic idea. I suspect that tourists coming to London will tend to look at the cost of their visit in overall terms. They will consider the relative costs of hotels, of getting here, of restaurants, of our great public attractions and so on. Somewhere in that consideration, they may well factor in the cost of getting around London, but the sort of regime that I have in mind would not necessarily be a deterrent to them. Those of us who venture abroad from time to time have come to expect<P>
that wherever we go, charges are made on visitors to cities in different ways. The concept of the airport tax has now become a reality.
<P>
In some cities in the United States, if one rents a car, one pays an oncost or additional charge--perhaps towards the development of a new airport, as was recently the case in Denver, Colorado. That practice is perhaps more widespread than is imagined. I do not think that it has much of a deterrent effect. I will still return to Denver, Colorado whenever I can, despite the fact that I know that I will be asked to contribute to the building of the new airport.
<P>
I do not want to labour the point, but I wanted to point out that when we discuss concessionary fares and the new regime to be developed, we should not eliminate the possibility that I have described. It strikes me as a power that we may want to make available to the mayor and assembly in order to develop the transport system, integrated or otherwise, that we say that we want. It should be considered as a benefit for Londoners, given the many different uses to which the transport system will be put.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister or the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), may I say that if the Government want to negate the clause, as it were, they will vote against clause stand part. All the matters to be decided upon that are being debated now will be moved formally as and when appropriate, once we have completed our debate on clause 177, and before we embark upon any matters relating to clause 178.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My contribution will be extremely brief. As I recall, the concessionary fares scheme was the outcome of a private venture between me and the former hon. Member for Upminster, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, during the passage of the London Regional Transport Act 1984. No one has since argued against it, although the Whips were not very keen on it at the time.
<P>
The argument made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst merits further examination. Surely, those who pay the precept and the charge to bring their cars into London and to park in London ought to receive a special benefit. I recognise that some employers provide workplace parking, and that the impost will not fall on the disabled or the retired. However, the idea merits further examination and refinement by the mayor.
<P>
A large proportion of motorists who pay the charge to come in will live outside London. They require some compensating benefits. If the elderly and disabled receive a concessionary fare, that would be perfectly reasonable. I am not so sure whether we would want a residence test. Such a policy bears further examination; it covers exactly the sort of matter that the mayor ought to discuss with London Regional Transport. There is a trade-off between benefits to be enjoyed by Londoners, who will face an especially high tax burden, and the difficulty of differentiating on the grounds of residence,  especially when so many of those who have to pay the motorist's tax to come into London will live in the home counties and beyond.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I thought that the speech of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was interesting in itself, and quite extraordinary in the way in which it seemed to present an entirely different side to the right hon. Gentleman, in contrast to his usual approach. I was also interested by the points made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood.
<P>
I was considering the matter while the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was speaking. As I understand it, he would like those who are resident in London to benefit from a concessionary fare scheme, but as we have said, millions of people come into and out of London every single day. They have dedicated their lives to working in London and continue so to do. I would think it somewhat harsh if they were denied any such eligibility for concessionary fares, but I trust that we can debate the issue of concessionary fares in the wider context another time.
<P>
To move on, new clause 56 gives local authorities the power to enter into agreements with transport operators to provide travel concessions for their eligible residents. The categories of eligibility are those set out in the London Regional Transport Act 1984, although the definition of pensioner has been slightly amended to take account of the Pensions Act 1995, which provides for the equalisation of state pension age over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2020.
<P>
The new clause also provides a definition of an "independent service operator", allowing the London boroughs to make agreements with operators of services that are outside the control of Transport for London. The London rail services concession, which is agreed with the Association of Train Operating Companies, is an example of such an agreement and is currently provided for under an equivalent power in the London Regional Transport Act 1984.
<P>
I cannot accept amendments (b), (c) and (d) to new clause 56. They would require the London local authorities to set up a joint committee to act for the boroughs in making arrangements with transport providers for concessionary travel schemes. Amendment (b) refers to powers in the Local Government Act 1972 under which local authorities may form joint committees or otherwise make arrangements for the discharge of their functions.
<P>
We do not regard it as being for the Government to impose rules on how the London local authorities conduct their business. It is not right to use the Bill to that end. The London local authorities have the power to bring forward their own legslative proposals.
<P>
I would also point out that the London Regional Transport Act 1984, under which travel concessions are provided, does not set any rules on how the boroughs should agree on a scheme. The boroughs must look to their own procedures for decision making. If there are boroughs that are averse to this approach, their views deserve to be heard, as it has financial implications for which they are accountable to their electors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I do not intend to go into the merits of the substance, but does the Minister at least recognise that the current system and its predecessor cause regular disquiet and anxiety among pensioners and others who benefit from concessionary schemes? For many of the years that we have had that system, pensioners have not known until very late in the year that all the boroughs have come on board. That annual brinkmanship, variously prompted by different London boroughs--
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Not by Labour councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am trying to make a non-political point. Such brinkmanship is hardly the way to assure some of the most vulnerable in the community that the scheme is likely to continue.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am of course aware of the situation to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. 
<P>
I am sure that even from their sedentary position, my hon. Friends will also have been heard to say that in the main, the doubt in this area has been occasioned by boroughs which are, by any stretch of the imagination, excessively wealthy. Indeed, one borough has purported to stand aside from the scheme.
<P>
However, the scheme goes forward year on year. I believe that the boroughs are as cognisant as the hon. Gentleman of the potential for anxiety. But we do not believe that it is for the Bill or, indeed, the Government, to impose strictures on the boroughs when they have adequate powers to settle the problem for themselves. I feel quite sure that, post our deliberations, the points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey--and, I have no doubt, by others--will be on the record and acknowledged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the argument. Does the Minister believe that it would not be inconsistent if, either now or later, the concessionary fares schemes was set by the Greater London authority? There are many other ways in which the Greater London authority will do things that will result in charges either on the boroughs or on the people in the boroughs. Therefore, as a matter of philosophy and logic, it would be possible to have a Londonwide GLA-fixed scheme as opposed to a borough-agreed scheme.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It would be possible for the mayor to introduce a wide variety of concessionary fare schemes if he or she regarded that as essential and intrinsic to the delivery--the positive outcome--of an integrated transport scheme. But in this instance, I believe that it is a matter for the local authorities, working together, cognisant as they are of the numbers in their own areas. There are inevitably variables in this scheme, dealing as it does with the frailty of human life. It would not be correct for there to be an imposition in the Bill which impacted in that way on the boroughs, particularly as they have the powers to produce a scheme which, according to the hon. Gentleman's analysis, could conceivably ensure no disquiet for those who are eligible for such concessionary schemes in the future.
<P>
I regret that I cannot accept amendment (a) to new clause 56. It goes beyond the Government's intention of carrying forward the existing concessionary travel arrangements. I would, however, expect that local authorities have their own eligibility criteria for the disabled category. It would seem good practice to make those criteria publicly available. However, that is a matter for the local authorities, not the Government.
<P>
On new clause 57, the existence of the reserve free travel scheme is a crucial safeguard for elderly and disabled Londoners. As with our other proposals on concessionary fares, this is a re-enactment of a provision of the London Regional Transport Act 1984.
<P>
In the event of the London local authorities failing to agree a satisfactory scheme under the powers of the previous clause, Transport for London will be obliged to put in place a reserve scheme which will provide free travel concessions on all services under its control.
<P>
It is important that any scheme agreed voluntarily by the London boroughs can be tested to ensure that the users of the scheme are properly provided for. TfL must satisfy itself that any such scheme meets particular requirements as to its scope and uniformity. These tests are set out in detail in other clauses.
<P>
The current statutory reserve scheme, as provided for in the London Regional Transport Act 1984, has never been activated, but its presence has always reassured London's elderly and disabled residents that the travel concessions they rely upon will not be taken away. The reserve scheme cannot apply to services provided by independent service operators as they are outside the control of TfL. However, it will ensure that eligible Londoners will have free travel on TfL services. TfL is also under a specific duty in the new clause to ensure that the travel concessions that are required by the reserve scheme are provided.
<P>
I regret that I am unable to accept amendment (a) to new clause 57. The London concessionary fares scheme is, as I have acknowledged, the responsibility of the boroughs. That is why we made the commitment in our White Paper to leave it with them and not to give it to the GLA.
<P>
Hon. Members will be aware that Parliament examined the arrangements for a concessionary travel scheme at great length in 1984 and was insistent that certain provisions were made to ensure that there would always be concessionary travel for elderly and disabled Londoners. It is not the Government's wish to go over those arguments again. Our prime concern in the Bill is to establish the institutions and procedures for the new London government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I understand the Minister's point about Parliament not re-examining matters into which it went in such great detail during the passage of the 1984 Act. However, it is re-examining those matters at this very moment. The House of Lords has just given a Third Reading to the London Local Authorities Bill, which deals with a rollover scheme for concessionary fares. Why is it necessary for the relevant new clauses to be in the Bill given that London boroughs are working together and solving the problem?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am tempted to ask why the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have felt it necessary to table amendments if London boroughs are already working together to solve the problem.
<P>
In our amendments, the Government carry forward existing arrangements from the London Regional Transport Act 1984, and I want to make it clear what they will do. Provisions will be made for London local authorities to make agreements with transport providers--mainly TfL--for travel concessions for elderly and disabled Londoners. If the boroughs do not provide a scheme that meets the specified requirements--essentially that they give the same concessions to all eligible persons--a reserve-free scheme will come into force. TfL will be obliged, as London Transport is now, to provide the reserve scheme. However, it will be entitled to recover the cost from the boroughs. There is no doubt, ambiguity or confusion about roles and responsibilities. Pensioners and disabled people will get their travel concession, TfL will provide it, and the boroughs will pay.
<P>
The proposal in amendment (a) to new clause 57 is very different. In the event of no scheme being in place, it would provide for the arrangements from the previous year to be carried forward. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to that arrangement in relation to the London Local Authorities Bill and called it the rollover scheme.
<P>
In response to the contribution of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I touched on what pensioners have annually seen as a concern. We are equally aware of the boroughs' concern that the mayor may seek to exploit the concessionary travel scheme under a future London government, by charging the boroughs more under the threat of imposing the reserve scheme. It is, however, not easy to comprehend their concern. It is as much in the mayor's interest as in the boroughs' interests to avoid conflict between TfL and the local authorities. As a high-profile, democratically elected figure, the mayor will be most exposed to criticism if the scheme does not deliver. Furthermore, in the event of the reserve scheme being imposed, the charges that are levied on the local authorities will be open to close scrutiny because we are carrying forward the duty for TfL to account for those costs from the previous legislation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I hope that I have followed everything that the Minister said, but I do not understand why the mayor, who will not have the responsibility for the schemes, will be the most likely to feel the wrath of the pensioner and then influence the result. If the boroughs have the right to choose their scheme, subject only to a fall-back scheme for which Parliament has legislated, the mayor will be out of the action.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman approaches the argument from the wrong end. Surely, it is of prime importance that the elderly and people with disabilities can be assured that their free travel is guaranteed. The hon. Gentleman's argument suggests that, should there be any difficulties based on the proposals of the rollover scheme, the mayor, not the boroughs, would be the focus of the ire of pensioners and people with disabilities.
<P>
The mayor's prominence in London means that he or she would undoubtedly become the focus for any kind of criticism. I pay due respect to those organisations that have brought pensioners together throughout London: they are active and extremely well organised. They campaign directly and effectively, and would have no difficulty in drawing every Londoner's attention to what would justifiably be regarded as a betrayal, should the mayor behave in a way precluded by the boroughs. It is inconceivable that a person in such high office and with such a powerful mandate from Londoners would risk the opprobrium that would justifiably be heaped upon them.
<P>
There are practical difficulties with the rollover approach. In some respects, it may be administratively easier and appear to guarantee continuity. However, I am not persuaded that it would be workable. Under the proposal, existing concessions would continue in the event of the boroughs failing to put a scheme in place by 31 December of any year. However, the arrangements for funding those concessions could be the subject of some uncertainty between Transport for London and the boroughs, who must deal with changing circumstances, such as cost, scope of the network and holders' usage of permits.
<P>
The transport provider--TfL in this case--must have its costs reimbursed and must have the final say on what those costs are. Otherwise, it cannot deliver the scheme effectively. If it is to be under a statutory duty to provide a reserve scheme, it must do so in the knowledge that it will not be expected to subsidise that scheme. The proposals do not contain such a safeguard.
<P>
To make such a scheme workable, it would be necessary to provide a crystal clear specification of exactly what is meant by the arrangements carried forward from the previous year. New schedule 4 prescribes in detail TfL's role to step in and implement a reserve scheme. That provision goes as far as dealing with the issuing of permits.
<P>
Under the scheme proposed in new clause 57(a), there would be confusion over exactly what is carried forward and how that is done. Consequently, users might suffer. Therefore, the current reserve scheme from the London Regional Transport Act 1984 must be adopted as the best guarantee that travel concessions continue to be available for elderly and disabled Londoners.
<P>
Hon. Members should remember that existing arrangements have ensured the availability of travel concessions for almost 15 years. We should not tinker with such a sensible scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If a better reserve scheme has been agreed since the 1984 Act, should we not take that scheme as our base line?
<P>
<B>Ms. Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's question is not precisely clear. The improvements that he talks about are inherent in the changes affecting London, transport modes and those who use the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sorry if was I not clear: I will rephrase my question. The 1984 Act contains a fallback scheme. Authorities charged with agreeing a scheme for London have subsequently improved on that scheme; they have moved on and the scheme has become better. We are legislating again to implement a reserve scheme. So why do we not start at the better place achieved by consensus, rather than go back to the worse place which we legislated for in 1984?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Again, I am somewhat bemused by the hon. Gentleman. I thought that his original amendments were for change to the existing scheme because there was no consensus. His argument was that the danger lay in the fact that the boroughs might not agree and undue anxiety could thus be visited upon pensioners. As I have been at some pains to point out, we are moving the existing scheme into Transport for London precisely because of the guarantee that should there be a failure on the part of the boroughs the concessionary travel will still be there for pensioners and people with disabilities.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman would surely not expect us to place within this Bill or upon Transport for London a situation where--as I was at pains to point out, these schemes must be paid for--costs could be so excessive that--[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey shakes his head, but he should allow me to finish. He talks about improving a scheme that already works. To put it in a nutshell, his suggestions do not strike me as improvements on the existing scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is generally accepted that the present scheme is better than the 1984 scheme. That scheme has been arrived at democratically. The London boroughs came to an agreement. Given that we got that far together, why do we not make that the bottom line--it does not impose extra cost on anybody other than what is currently agreed--instead of putting in a bottom line that can be slipped back to something worse than what is currently agreed.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> If there is this genuine consensus--the hon. Gentleman's original amendment was to protect what he argued was not a consensus on the part of the boroughs--there is nothing to prevent the boroughs in future from improving the existing scheme.
<P>
New clause 58 sets the requirements as to scope which the local authorities must meet in the provision of travel concessions if they are to avoid the imposition of the reserve free travel scheme. Travel concessions must be provided for journeys on all the services that make up the London local transport network. The network consists of local bus, guided transport, railways, tram and river services which are provided either directly by Transport for London or under an agreement under clause 135.
<P>
Subsection (6) re-enacts the existing provisions for terms, limitations and conditions to be imposed in respect of particular journeys and can be different for different eligible categories. That gives the local authorities reasonable flexibility to make different provisions for the diverse transport services which may be under the control of Transport for London. New clause 59 sets the uniformity requirements which the local authorities must meet in the provision of travel concessions if they are to avoid the imposition of the reserve free travel scheme.
<P>
The requirements are that the same travel concessions must be provided for all Londoners in the same eligible category. Everyone who is eligible for the travel concessions must produce a permit in order to benefit from them. The permit should have the same validity for everyone in the same eligible category. The uniformity requirements are met if they apply to each service in the London local transport network individually and this clause defines the benefit of a travel concession as a waiver or a reduction of a fare or charge.
<P>
That definition, does not preclude the imposition of different terms, limitations or conditions in respect of different travel concession benefits. The clause also defines a travel concession permit. That definition like others in these new clauses are taken from the existing provisions of the London Regional Transport Act 1984.
<P>
I now turn to new schedule 4. This makes detailed provision for the reserve free travel scheme that comes into effect if the boroughs fail to reach agreement on a scheme that meets the requirement as to scope and uniformity. It is essentially the same reserve scheme as that for which the 1984 Act currently provides. It covers the scheme's hours of operation, which Transport for London can change by order after a notice period. It also specifies permit-issuing arrangements, arrangements for Transport for London to determine the cost of the scheme, and for the boroughs to pay for it.
<P>
The schedule also gives each borough the responsibility for determining whether a resident fulfils the criteria for receiving a disabled person's permit.
<P>
We cannot accept amendment (a) to new schedule 4. The new schedule would transpose the reserve scheme provisions of the 1984 Act. Those provisions set a start time of 9.30 am for concessionary travel for pensioners and eligible disabled people. The Government do not intend to alter the provisions.
<P>
Paragraph (2) of new schedule 4 includes a power for Transport for London to change the start time after giving due notice and consulting the boroughs and the London Transport Users Committee. That echoes the provision in the 1984 Act.
<P>
Our main objective is to set up a new London government and take forward the institutions and arrangements that work well without further interference. The Association of London Government has put forward arguments; the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey presented some of them in Committee this evening. We have considered them carefully. Nevertheless, the amendments to new clauses 56 and 57 contain unresolved problems.
<P>
If there is consensus in the London local authorities, they should be prepared to establish suitable decision-making machinery. I share the aspiration towards stability and reassurance for freedom passholders. However, the fixed-reserve free scheme has been the most successful in providing such reassurance about the continuation of the scheme. A rollover arrangement could cause more uncertainty.
<P>
I shall explain the Government's responsibility for the London concessionary travel scheme. We shall not tell local authorities what concessions to provide or how to reach agreement on them. We shall provide a fall-back arrangement for a free travel scheme in the event that no scheme is provided for Londoners. Government amendments provide for that, Opposition amendments do not.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for outlining in detail the intention of the new clauses and explaining the reasons for the Government's rejection of the amendments that I am about to discuss. I shall attempt to respond to some of the Minister's points.
<P>
There is genuine misunderstanding of some of the representations that many people outside this place have made about the current operation of the concessionary fares scheme, and their hopes for its operation in future under the Greater London authority, the mayor and Transport for London. I strongly believe that the Government should take the opportunity that the measure provides to reassess the current concessionary fares scheme. Simply to cut and paste the 1984 provisions and transfer them to the Bill is not sufficient to justify rejecting the amendments. It will not satisfy the many organisations that have made legitimate representations to Ministers.
<P>
As hon. Members who have served on local authorities in London know, the current scheme involves London boroughs agreeing with London Transport through the Transport Committee for London, which the London boroughs set up. The Minister is right to say that the boroughs can co-operate. For the past 15 years, they have made agreements that have benefited Londoners through improvements to the concessionary fares scheme. It is incumbent on the Committee and on Parliament to ensure that provisions exist to deal with failure to agree. Under the current scheme, if there is a failure to agree by 31 December, the reserve scheme comes into effect. It is provided for in legislation that went through the House in 1983-84. Since then, substantial changes through negotiation have improved beyond recognition some aspects of the scheme that is now in operation.
<P>
New clauses 56 to 59 and the new schedule effectively cut and paste many of the existing provisions, with a few minor tweaks that were put in place in the 1984 scheme; but we think it extremely important that the Committee consider the amendments seriously along with representations made to all of us by many organisations which are worried about the operation of the current scheme and the uncertainty that it could lead to.
<P>
The problem is that things have moved on since 1984. The current scheme has been enhanced and refined by 15 years of very effective negotiation by the London boroughs. There are now three major differences between the reserve scheme and the scheme operating in London for the benefit of Londoners.
<P>
The current scheme allows for the incorporation of rail services. The Minister referred to the role of the Association of Train Operating Companies in the negotiations which has without doubt benefited Londoners in that they can gain access on a concessionary basis to the surface rail network in greater London.
<P>
The start times under the current scheme are better. In the mornings it begins at 9 am. Under the 1984 scheme it begins at 9.30 am; consequently, many people who wish to get to work--the disabled especially--are disadvantaged by the 1984 scheme. The thought that that scheme might he operated if a consensus cannot be reached amongst London boroughs causes concern to those people. It does not give them the sense of security that the Minister suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It is a hint.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South indicates that that is a hint that perhaps I should note. I agree that there are a number of points that he would want me to make.
<P>
The other point is that the end time for the scheme is 4 am. This allows the use of the night buses. The 1984 scheme--the reserve scheme--ends at 1 am. So, again, people coming home late at night--the disabled or older people enjoying the many entertainments in Greater London--are unable to travel very late. They are being denied that access. We think that is inappropriate and unnecessary and that it creates a sense of uncertainty, because the reserve scheme is there, waiting to come down and reduce the benefits that were secured in the past.
<P>
Representatives of a wide range of organisations have seen, and written to, the Minister. They have made known their concerns to all members of the Standing Committee. Representations on behalf of the disabled and the elderly have been made through organisations such as the travel permit working party and the Greater London Association for Disabled People.
<P>
The Minister has made much of the concern expressed by London boroughs. We argue for the amendments not because of London boroughs' interests, but from the viewpoint of representatives of the users of these services and the beneficiaries of the concessions. But, just to make matters clear, full and effective representations have been made on behalf of the London boroughs by the Association of London Government as well as the Transport Committee for London--the very body that has so successfully secured benefits and improvements for the scheme over the years.
<P>
All those groups call for an index-linked rollover instead of the reserve scheme in the 1984 Act. Such measures are now before Parliament, because the London boroughs, again working together, are promoting a local authorities Bill, which amends the London Regional Transport Act 1984. It passed through the House of Lords and secured its Third Reading only a short while ago. It will come to this end of the building in due course. Therefore I am surprised that the Government have tabled new clauses that will have the effect of extinguishing benefits secured through that private Member's Bill that is being promoted by London boroughs.
Our amendments to the new clauses give effect to the rollover reserve scheme--the scheme being promoted by London boroughs which voluntary and other organisations representing users' interests also seek. It is also something for which the Joint Committee for London Boroughs has been arguing.
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The new clauses introduce the reserve scheme of the London Regional Transport Act 1984. It appears, in these days of word processors, that the 1984 Act has been loaded on to a computer and the relevant sections have been cut and pasted into the Bill. I do not think that that is sufficient, and I do not think that many people outside the House of Commons would regard it as an appropriate way to legislate for an institution and for arrangements that should take us not merely through the next few months but into the next century. The new clauses effectively take a backward step, because they fail to reflect the concerns of every relevant interest group.
<P>
I turn to some of the specific details to answer some of the Minister's questions about our amendments to new clause 56. I take the Minister's point that we should not seek to impose onerous and additional burdens on London boroughs, and that in that respect using the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 for joint arrangements is perhaps inappropriate. That is why we tabled the second set of amendments that would provide for a rollover scheme. However, a joint Committee arrangement is appropriate because, as the Minister rightly said, at the moment one London borough can hold to ransom the other 32, thereby denying the vast bulk of beneficiaries of the concessionary fares scheme their benefits from that scheme. That is wrong, and we should therefore look closely at whether we can change the mechanism to address at least the fact that an overwhelming majority of boroughs--even larger than the sorts of majority that the assembly would need to have on budget measures--could be thwarted by the absence of a proper procedure to enable the London boroughs to come to a decision. Consequently, this inferior reserve scheme could be triggered and people could end up travelling in a way that is not as acceptable as it would have been.
<P>
The Government are clearly not prepared to accept the amendments about joint arrangements. In that case, why not address the issue from the other way round and at least make sure that the scheme that operated last year will continue to operate into the current year if a consensus cannot be arrived at? That would provide greater certainty than having to flip back to the past to the 1984 scheme. I have outlined the three issues that are at stake, and I do not understand why the Government are unable to address them by tabling their own amendments to this set of new clauses. Without such amendments, a very bad scheme will be imposed on Londoners if one London borough refuses to sign up.
<P>
The need for a collective process has been called for by a variety of organisations--Age Concern, the Greater London Forum for the Elderly, the Greater London Pensioner Action Association and many others on which the hon. Member for Ealing, North is commenting in a sedentary way--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I was snoring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Absolutely--in a very sedentary way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Apology accepted, Mr. Pound.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I understand that the hon. Gentleman may find these points tedious, but the organisations that represent users of these services find them essential.
<P>
It is not only the boroughs serving their vested interests that have concerns that need to be addressed. Users also have legitimate worries that should be honestly dealt with tonight. The Minister said that Government lawyers say that placing a duty on the London boroughs to act collectively is not possible--that may be true. However, we have tabled amendments that would put in place, using existing statutory provisions, a means by which the situation could be dealt with.
<P>
I turn to our amendments covering the issue of rollover. If we are to have such a scheme, it should at least be the scheme that operated in the previous year. It does not make sense to move back 15 years to the 1984 scheme. We hope that the Government will listen not only to us but to people outside on that matter.
<P>
The other amendments that the Minister was unable to accept dealt with the freedom pass for disabled people. Some user groups have said that some boroughs are a bit cagey about publishing eligibility criteria. The Minister is right: under existing provisions, they ought to be publishing those criteria. A number of boroughs are at present saying that orange badge holders are not entitled to a freedom pass. That is illegal, but it is happening. What we want, and what the amendments would secure, is a transparent and accountable process whereby boroughs must keep their criteria under review and publish them. Those are not unreasonable requests; they are things that we expect but which are not happening.
<P>
I welcomed what the Minister for Transport in London said, because she acknowledged that concern, and I hope that the Government will take further action to make local authorities aware of their responsibilities in that respect, and ensure that they publish their eligibility criteria. That is a matter of great concern for many disabled people, who are being denied their legal right to freedom passes.
<P>
I turn to new clause 57 and the rollover. As well as the deficiencies to which I referred earlier--the Minister also referred to the time at which the schemes start, and so on--the 1984 scheme also costs more. As the Minister said, it allows London Transport to impose a reserve scheme, and then to come up with its own costings and impose them on the London boroughs. Fifteen years of effective negotiations have achieved a best-value scheme. I know that the Government are committed to best value, yet they will impose a 1984 scheme that by any measure is not best value. The scheme ought to be subject to the Government's best value test. Given the Government's willingness to introduce an arbiter system to deal with the PPP, why can we not have an arbiter to deal with this matter? That is not my preference, but if the Government are unwilling to move on the fundamentals, surely they should appoint an independent arbiter to intervene between TfL and the London boroughs, to ensure that the interests of Londoners are properly and fairly reflected, and that a decent scheme is introduced.
<P>
Our amendment to new clause 57 provides a rollover for the reserve scheme. It uses exactly the same words as the relevant provision of the London Local Authorities Bill. We make no apology for that, because all too often we are told that our amendments have not been properly drafted and have effects that we did not intend. The amendment has been drafted by parliamentary draftsman, it is clear and has passed all the stages in the House of Lords. We hope that it will succeed in its passage through the House of Commons. What will happen when this Bill becomes law, because it appears to negate the efforts of the London boroughs to secure improvements?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will discuss the matter further with the chairman of the Association of London Government, because I know that it is perplexed about new clauses. Toby Harris, the ALG chairman--Lord Harris, as he is now--wrote to the Minister, saying that he was most disappointed to learn that Government amendments to the Bill dealing with concessionary fares merely replicate the unsatisfactory reserve scheme that the ALG has long been seeking to change. He also said that the current reserve scheme offers worse benefits at higher costs to the boroughs in the event of a failure by the boroughs to agree on a Londonwide scheme. The emphasis of the London boroughs, working together with a wide range of voluntary organisations, has been to try to secure a future guarantee of existing benefits. That is what the amendments are all about. It is unacceptable for the Bill to contain provisions made in 1984.
<P>
Our last amendment is to new schedule 4. If the Government are not prepared or able to accept the ALG's case for a rollover reserve scheme, at the very least some aspects of the 1984 scheme should be modified to move it a little closer to where the London boroughs have managed to get with their negotiations. That is why we have tabled an amendment that proposes that the start time for the scheme should changed from 9.30 am to 9 am. Sadly, we heard again that the Minister was unable to accept it.
<P>
We want a scheme that ensures fairness for London and that puts in place a reserve concessionary fare scheme that removes the uncertainty and concerns that many organisations, elderly people, older people and disabled people have about the present scheme. We would like, therefore, to press proposed amendment (a) to new clause 57, because of the rollover that it proposes. That proposal should be tested, and we will also seek, if possible, to press new schedule 4 to a vote, because it goes to the heart of the issues. If we may seek only one vote, we would like it to decide proposed amendment (a) to new clause 57.
<P>
In conclusion, we have tried to outline--

<P>

<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone </B>(Brent East): Outline!
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We have tried to detail proposals for substantial improvements to the concessionary fare scheme, especially for the benefit of the hon. Member for Brent, East, who has been listening closely. We want to ensure that concessionary fares continue to operate and to introduce a reserve scheme to ensure that if mayoral candidates, mayors or whoever else disagree with London boroughs, Londoners get what they want instead of getting the pig in a poke of the 1984 provisions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to respond, I should remind the hon. Gentleman that votes on all the items to which he has referred will take place when the Committee has disposed of clause 177 and before we commence debate on clause 178, as I said earlier. I have noted that the Liberal Democrats would like to press proposed amendment (a) to Government new clause 57.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I shall begin where the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) ended. He condemned the present scheme as a pig in a poke, ignoring the fact that for some time he had been speaking about the specific benefits of the scheme and about its great value to Londoners, and to pensioners and disabled people in particular. He became a scaremonger by saying that if Liberal Democrat amendments were not agreed to, a scheme that is highly prized by pensioners and disabled people would disappear. He ignored the fact that it is precisely because the reserve scheme is in place that such an outcome is impossible.
<P>
The Government have made abundantly clear our passionate commitment to ensuring that pensioners and people with disabilities have the accessibility to public transport that they are given under the present scheme. I find it somewhat bizarre that an hon. Gentleman who is a member of a party that constantly and consistently argues for even greater power to be given to local authorities should now argue that power should be taken away from the London boroughs and that a new scheme should be imposed upon them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman argued for a rollover scheme. One of the present scheme's great strengths is its flexibility; it adapts to meet the variable numbers of people who qualify to obtain the benefits that it provides. He mentioned that some local authorities are failing to publish the criteria required for the concessionary scheme in respect of disabled people. We do not need legislation to deal with that--if the hon. Gentleman writes to me, naming the boroughs, I shall be happy to write to them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the concerns of Lord Harris, leader of the ALG. I have held meetings with the ALG, and Lord Harris has expressed his concerns to me. I still believe, however, that the scheme is for the boroughs. They have the powers to change and to improve it if they so wish. Surely, as an indication of the effectiveness of the reserve scheme, it is an incentive for the boroughs to agree to it. As I said earlier, it has worked well for 15 years.
<P>
<H5>7.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister said that it is about what the boroughs want, and I agree with her, The boroughs have made their wishes clear: they have produced a private Bill that has gone through the House of Lords. 865 866 
Are the Government saying that they will not support that Bill because of the rollover reserve scheme in this Bill?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It is my understanding that there is no agreement even among the boroughs for the scheme to which the hon. Gentleman referred; indeed there is no agreement among the boroughs on the Bill itself.
<P>
The issue is what the scheme is for: it is to ensure that pensioners and people with disabilities will be guaranteed their free, concessionary passes to enable them to live richer, fuller lives around London. The boroughs and the mayor may decide, after discussing the matter, to make a broader scheme, and the boroughs may wish to improve on the present scheme--the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam gave examples of improvements on the scheme introduced in 1984. If that can be done under existing legislation, the best way to proceed is to move it into this Bill. Changes at this stage would be undemocratic; there is no stronger guarantee than the reserve scheme for the people for whom it was implemented. The reserve scheme is there and powers exist for local authorities to improve it if they wish. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> To be helpful, I remind members of the Committee that if it is their wish that clause 168 disappears the should vote against the question.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 168 disagreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 169</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disabled persons' transport services</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> 169 is a "peg" clause inserted before the Bill's introduction because detailed consideration of the necessary provisions for those with disabilities had not concluded. Ministers have since agreed that clause 169 is unnecessary. The provisions required to fulfil the White Paper commitments on services for disabled people are either already in the Bill or will be brought forward by Government amendment. This clause also gives an inappropriate role to the Secretary of State in the provision of transport for disabled Londoners.
<P>
The Bill contains the following provisions relating to services for disabled people: the Mayor will be under a duty in clause 123 to include proposals for the provision of transport which is accessible to those with mobility problems in his transport strategy, and under schedule 8(3), the Mayor must have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the membership of Transport for London represents interests in relation to meeting the transport needs of disabled people.
<P>
Clauses 126 to 131 outline the local implementation plans. As well as other matters concerned with implementation of the Mayor's transport strategy, the provisions will be able to cover taxicard because the Mayor will be able to indicate in the transport strategy how taxicard will be operated.
<P>
Under Clause 135, TfL will be able to enter into agreements with current service providers to aid the co-ordination and/or integration of other door-to-door services; and under schedule 9(2)(2), TfL can enter into agreements with taxi and minicab firms to provide transport services in London.
<P>
We are committed to comprehensive enforceable civil rights for disabled people. We are bringing forward regulations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 which will require new trains, buses and newly licensed taxis to be accessible to disabled people.
<P>
The mayor will be under a strong and unique duty to include proposals for accessible transport in his or her strategy. That duty will, ensure that there is real consideration of the needs of disabled as part of that strategy. The mayor will also have to consider how the interests of those with mobility problems are represented on the board of Transport for London.
<P>
I have touched on those areas for which the mayor will be able to take responsibility. As I have already pointed out, we are committed to ensuring in the long term that all public transport is accessible to everybody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Two things, Mr. Winterton. First, is the import of what the Minister said that by deleting the clause, the powers that it currently gives to the Secretary of State will in every respect be replaced by powers given to the Greater London Authority? If so, that is progress in the direction argued for by my hon. Friends and me throughout the Committee.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister referred to powers, obligations and opportunities given to the mayor elsewhere in the Bill. Do the Government believe that we need to return to problems faced by disabled people that are not covered by national legislation which would bind the GLA? It would be helpful if the Government undertook to return to disability issues elsewhere and notified us of that. Otherwise, we will assume that this is the last transport context opportunity to debate those matters.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> In response to the hon. Gentleman's first question, the answer is yes. As to the second, I cannot conceive that any part of the Bill would impact adversely on the needs of people with disabilities either with respect to the general thrust of the Government's policies the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.
<P>
However, I would be happy to find out more and answer the hon. Gentleman's question in a letter, which I will copy to all members of the Committee, including you, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is there anything else that the Minister would like to add?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I notice that a piece of paper is being proferred.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am most grateful to you for pointing out the piece of paper and the message scribbled on it. Regrettably, it is not the answer to the Question I was asked, so I refer to the answer that I gave to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 169 disagreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> May I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton, and congratulate you on the expeditious and characteristically exemplary manner in which you have conducted today's proceedings?
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Dowd.]
