<P>
Amendment proposed [2 February]: No. 1, in page 1, line 7, leave out first `tax'. [Mr. Pickles.]
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be 
made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this 
we are taking the following amendments: No. 2, in 
page 1, line 7, leave out second `tax'.
<P>
No. 4, in clause 2, page 1, line 10, leave out `tax'.
<P>
No. 5, in clause 2, page 1, line 11, leave out `tax'.
<P>
No. 11, in schedule 1, page 10, line 6, leave out `tax'.
<P>
No. 12, in schedule 1, page 10, line 8, leave out `tax'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): On a point 
of order, Mrs. Roe. I want to raise a matter of which I 
gave you and Mrs. Dunwoody notice last night. At 
roughly 10 o'clock last night, we were given the two 
promised items the impact assessments. I refer you to 
our proceedings on Tuesday, in particular to column 22. 
We repeatedly asked when the impact assessments would 
be delivered and we were given to understand that we 
would get them in ample time.
<P>
Mrs. Roe, you are here to represent the Speaker, who 
represents Back Benchers. It is wholly unreasonable to 
deliberate with this lack of information. Had the old rules 
been in operation, the impact assessments would have 
been delivered a little after midnight. We are expected to 
debate important legislation and to make decisions that 
will affect people's rights without adequate knowledge of 
the issues. I believe that we should adjourn to allow 
members to consider properly these two vital reports 
before we amend the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. 
Gentleman's point of order, but it is not a matter for the 
Chair. There is nothing to prevent us from proceeding 
with the debate. I am sure, however, that the Paymaster 
General has listened carefully to his comments and has 
taken note of them.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> Further 
to that point of order, Mrs. Roe. The draft regulatory 
impact assessment has been published and it is pertinent 
to clause 5. We said that we would publish it in time for 
proper consideration. That has been done. We are 
debating clause 1. Members will want to study the impact 
assessment closely because they rightly have a great 
interest in what it contains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Roe. 
Do I take it that the Government are undertaking to 
publish draft regulations at least three clauses ahead of 
debate? A number of our amendments that are attached to 
clauses 1 and 2 are affected by the impact assessments. 
The Paymaster General's suggestion that we have plenty 
of time is a bit thin. It might have been more helpful had 
she read the amendment before making that statement.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Further to that point of order, 
Mrs. Roe. The regulations have been published. Clause 1 
is a short clause that is pertinent to the Bill's main 
provisions. Committee members have the document in 
front of them, as we said they would, before we debate 
clause 5. If intense debate is to take place on clause 5, we 
may reach it a little quicker by making some progress.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is always an opportunity to 
table amendments on Report. We have covered this 
point thoroughly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): On a point of order, 
Mrs. Roe.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have dealt with the point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> It is a different point of order, Mrs. Roe. 
In the Essex local paper, the Evening Echo, last Thursday 
an advertisement for Marks and Spencer caused me to 
believe that privileged information, which has yet to reach 
the Committee, may have been given to commercial 
companies. The advertisement appears to give details of 
child care costs information that we have been 
requesting for some time which suggests that families 
who earn up to £30,000 a year may be eligible for child 
care payments under the working families tax credit.
<P>
We have been pressing for that information since the 
beginning of the Committee's proceedings, Mrs. Roe. I 
should be grateful for your ruling on whether the 
Committee can proceed if commercial organisations are 
being told more than we are about the regulations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That would be a matter for Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): On 
Tuesday, in arguing for the amendment, I raised the fact 
that the Government are always trumpeting the minimum 
income of £10,000. On Second Reading, the Paymaster 
General said that the Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will give families with children a guaranteed minimum income of 
£10,000 a year £190 a week."	 [Official Report, 26 January 1999; 
Vol. 324, c. 150.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not accurate, because that guaranteed minimum 
income applies only if the recipient is working full time. 
Indeed, elsewhere in her statement, the Paymaster General 
refers to the fact that a minimum income of £10,000 is 
guaranteed to families in full-time work.
<P>
The press release makes the matter clear. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The new Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) will guarantee 
the lowest paid families a full-time income of around £10,000 a 
year".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the Government trumpet their mantras, it is 
important that they do so accurately. The mantras are 
carefully crafted to say one thing but convey another. 
Ministers must repeat them in their entirety, so that the 
public are not misled, whether deliberately or 
inadvertently, by the skipping over of particular key 
phrases.
<P>
We asked for the £10,000 figure to be recalculated. It 
became clear that, to achieve £190 a week, a recipient 
must work at least 34 hours a week. Out of the current 
total of 782,000 recipients of family credit, only 402,000 
work full time. On the same basis, family credit would 
generate an income of £187.19, compared with the £190 
that the working families tax credit will generate. That is 
a mere £3 a week more under the new regime, which will 
be more than eaten up by the array of stealth taxes that 
the Government have imposed on all income levels since 
taking office.
<P>
As I said on Tuesday, in terms of the amount of cash 
received, the working families tax credit differs from 
family credit in minute ways only. That is particularly true 
for those on very low incomes the very group that the 
Government claim the measure will assist.
<P>
In essence, the amendment seeks to delete the word, 
"tax"	 from the phrase, "tax credit"	 to show that, in terms 
of the level of benefit that it will provide to those on low 
incomes, the current regime is similar to family credit. 
The working families tax credit's unique selling point is 
that it pays through the pay packet, which supposedly 
signifies that it is a tax credit rather than a benefit. The 
raison d'e√tre behind such a payment method is that it is 
meant to reduce stigma. On Second Reading of the Tax 
Credits (Initial Expenditure) Bill, The Paymaster General 
said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As a tax credit rather than a welfare benefit, it should also reduce 
any stigma associated with claiming in-work support. We believe 
that that will encourage higher take-up."	 [Official Report, 7 May 
1998; Vol. 311, c. 874.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For the benefit of those who were not ploughing through 
the draft regulatory impact assessment and accompanying 
regulations during the early hours of this morning, 
paragraph 10 of the assessment states that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as a tax credit rather than a welfare benefit,"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the working families tax credit will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reduce the stigma associated with claiming in-work support, and 
so help encourage higher take-up."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Despite our pressing Ministers continually, we have yet 
to hear precisely what take-up rate the Government expect 
from the new working families tax credit. We know that 
family credit has a take-up rate of 72 per cent. by case 
load and 84 per cent. by expenditure. It will be helpful if 
the Paymaster General can tell us exactly what the take-up 
rate will be. Unless she can show that it will be higher 
than under family credit. how will the working families 
tax credit reduce stigma?
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): As the hon. Gentleman 
knows, I have a great deal of sympathy with the points 
that he makes. The only reason that I can think of for not 
supporting his amendment is that, if the new benefit is 
described as a tax credit, it might be more readily 
accepted by claimants, even though it is only spin. For 
that reason I hesitate to support the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
raising that valid point. The Government's claim is based 
on the belief that, simply by packaging this benefit as a 
tax credit, stigma will be reduced. Let us look at the 
evidence for that.
<P>
Martin Taylor, the architect of the new benefit, said in 
evidence to the Social Security Committee:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As far as I am concerned, it does not matter whether the body 
which determines whether or not you are entitled to the WFTC is 
situated in the DSS or in the Inland Revenue. I do not really think 
it matters where it is. As far as the stigma goes, the hard and fast 
evidence in all these non-financial and psychological matters is 
difficult to come by."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the man who devised the system admitted that 
there are no surveys with empirical evidence to suggest 
that merely putting the claim into the Inland Revenue 
rather than the Benefits Agency will have an effect on 
stigma.
<P>
Then we hear from Richard Baron, who works for the 
Institute of Directors. In his evidence to the Social 
Security Committee he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I do not think there will be any perceived reduction in the stigma 
at the point of claim because claimants will still have to claim. They 
will still have to fill in a form which will go to the Inland Revenue 
rather than the Benefits Agencythe claim and the claim form are 
still going to be there."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, Mr. Knox from the Federation of Small 
Businesses, who gave evidence with Richard Baron, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In fact, there could be the added stigma of being an employee 
who receives, and knowingly receives, benefit within the 
workplace."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we have it: the people who have looked into this 
matter most thoroughly believe that there is no reduced 
stigma from an earned income tax credit or working 
families tax credit.
<P>
One of the great hopes when the scheme was devised 
was that it would be paid through the PAYE tax code. It 
could be argued that, had it been paid through the code, 
that might have reduced stigma because there would be 
nothing on the face of it one way or the other. However, 
as we know, the Revenue cannot pay those benefits 
through the code, because when it experimented with an 
N code, after several payment periods a distortion 
appeared in the amount of money that the tables were 
telling the employer to pay the employee, which was 
unacceptable.
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry has similar 
concerns about stigma. It says that employees should not 
have to receive the credit through the pay packet if they 
do not want to. Therefore, single parents not just 
couples should have the choice of receiving the working 
families tax credit as a benefit. Otherwise, the payment of 
credit through the wage packet could increase rather than 
reduce perceptions of stigma.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Dari Taylor </B>(Stockton, South): Will the hon. 
Gentleman respond to a number of clear problems about 
family credit? The first relates to the slow take-up of 
family credit over a number of years. The advertisements 
came out again and again, pushing and persuading, but 
the take-up was very slow.
<P>
Secondly, will the hon. Gentleman respond to the fact 
that it is a costly benefit because a similar form must be 
filled in every few months to legitimise and control 
payment of family credit? Will he also respond to the 
fact that, for many part-time workers, the payment was 
unpredictable because their working lives are not regular 
and the amount of their part-time work varies? They could 
not trust the payments and were very unsure about treating 
family credit as an operational feature of their family 
income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady raises some interesting 
points, but the working families tax credit system is no 
different from family credit. The main differences 
between working families tax credit and family credit is 
that the taper is shallower, the income level at which it 
starts to apply to the working families tax credit is £10 
higher, and the new credit is paid through the payroll. 
Those are the three key differences between working 
families tax credit and family credit.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The slow take-up to which the hon. Lady referred is 
inevitable with any new benefit. There are now 776,000 
people claiming family credit, which is a 72 per cent. 
take-up rate by caseload and an 84 per cent. take-up rate 
by expenditure. Few people who can claim are not 
claiming. The only people who are not claiming are those 
who would be entitled under the formula to a very small 
sum and believe that it is not worth claiming, which is 
why there is an 84 per cent. take-up rate by expenditure. 
That implies that is not worth the while of the remaining 
people to claim. The take-up rate is very high and I 
challenge the hon. Lady to come up with any other benefit 
with such a high take-up rate. If she is convinced that 
working families tax credit will be more successful in 
take-up than family credit, why have no Ministers said 
whether they expect the take-up rate to be higher or lower 
and, if higher, what level they expect? All we have heard 
from Ministers is that 1.3 million people will claim the 
benefit. They have not given an expected take-up figure.
<P>
The hon. Lady referred to forms being filled in every 
few weeks. The new benefit will apply for six months, as 
does family credit. Despite any changes in family 
circumstances during that period, payment of family 
credit does not change. That will apply also to working 
families tax credit.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride (Bromsgrove):</B> My hon. Friend 
always makes good points, but he may have missed one 
small matter. The Government stated that 1.3 million 
people will be able to claim the new family tax credit, but 
that relates only to the greater generosity of the benefit 
and not to new claimants; it merely reflects the greater 
generosity of the benefit and the extension of the taper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The 
£1.5 billion of extra spending is being spent mainly 
on the shallower taper and moving the benefit up the 
income scale.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) referred 
to the naming of the new benefit as a tax credit and the 
fact that it will appear on the pay slip. Will that reference 
to the benefit on the pay slip increase or reduce stigma? 
Conservative Members believe that had the benefit 
applied through the PAYE code, it might have reduced 
stigma, but because it will appear separately on the pay 
slip, it will present a problem. Under clause 5(2) 
regulations will be introduced
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"requiring employers to provide information to employees (in their 
itemised pay statement or otherwise)"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Page 8 of the glossy document, which sets out how the 
scheme will work, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The amount of tax credit paid will need to be shown separately 
on the employee's payslip."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The regulations that we received at 10 o'clock last night 
state I raise this merely to try to impress my hon. 
Friends that I have read them under regulation 5(3):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The employer shall record on the employee's payslip for the 
relevant pay period, as a credit described as a `tax credit', any 
payment made under paragraph (2)."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the appearance of the words "tax credit"	 help to 
reduce stigma? It may be argued that referring to it as a 
"tax credit"	 instead of "working families tax credit"	 will 
reduce stigma, but no one in the payroll department of a 
firm, company or small business would be confused by 
that phrase. It clearly means a state benefit because no 
one's mortgage tax relief is on their payslip. People will 
know that the phrase, "tax credit"	 refers to the working 
families tax credit, and that if they see that phrase on 
someone's payslip, that person is in receipt of a state 
benefit.
<P>
We want the word, "tax"	 to be removed from the clause 
because, as all employers' organisations that have sent 
representations to Committee members have said, it is a 
benefit rather than a tax credit. As my hon. Friend the 
Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said on 
Tuesday, the Government's proposal is really a 
rebranding of an existing benefit  the family credit 
benefit with small changes to the taper and a minor rise 
in the level of benefit. Ultimately, the only difference 
between the working families tax credit and the family 
credit benefit is the delivery mechanism it will be done 
through the payroll, which does not change the payment's 
nature, namely that it is a state benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> My perspective has improved somewhat 
since recovering my glasses.
<P>
The amendments are epitomised by the clause's title, 
which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Certain benefits to be known as tax credits."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Far be it from me to suggest that the Paymaster General 
is a Marxist she is a glowing member of new Labour 
but there is a Marxist dictum that to undermine the 
existing order, one must first debase the language and, if 
I remember rightly, the currency.
<P>
I have an interest to declare: as president of the 
Conservative family campaign, I have taken a close 
interest over the past 10 years in how taxes and benefits impact on the family structure. I want to identify the two main reasons why so many people are coming round to 
the view that the tax system rather than the benefit system 
should play a larger role in looking after families, and I 
want to show why the Government's proposal meets 
neither of those criteria. As such, the clause is wrongly 
labelled, which is the point that lies behind the six 
amendments to which my hon. Friend the Member for 
Brentwood and Ongar spoke.
<P>
I can outline my two reasons simply and quickly. The 
first was referred to earlier as the problem of "churning."	 
Many years ago, several independent-minded Back 
Benchers on both sides of the House pointed out that it 
seemed an absolute nonsense on the one hand to tax 
people with income tax, which is expensive to collect, 
and, on the other, to pay out means-tested benefits, which 
are expensive to deliver. As such, there is a strong case 
for saying. "Let's get these people out of the tax system 
on administrative grounds alone."	
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and 
Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has already alluded to the fact 
that attempts to get the Government's proposal into the 
tax code have failed. The Inland Revenue spent much time 
examining the proposal it studied several different 
models, but, even in the era of computerisation, it found 
that it could not be done, and the fact that it proved to be 
impossible was not simply a question of mathematics.
<P>
That shows that the Government's proposal involves no 
administrative simplification. Our system of organisation 
continues to involve the calculation of a tax, on which a 
benefit is calculated, which gets fed back on a six-monthly 
basis into the tax system. That system involves exactly 
the same administrative complexities as the current family 
credit benefit. No administrative simplification is 
involved.
<P>
I do not want to return to the speech that I made on 
Second Reading you, Mrs. Roe, would rule it out of 
order but the proposed system will bring employers into 
the calculation and, as such, it will add another dimension 
of complexity. It will also reach further up the income 
scale, thereby bringing more people into that complex 
arrangement.
<P>
On the first of the two criteria, the Government's 
proposal clearly fails. The Government want the proposal 
labelled as a tax credit, but it is a benefit. Within a couple 
of years of entering the House of Commons, I came 
around to the point of view held by the right hon. Member 
for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and Sir Brandon Rhys 
Williams. I wish I had entered the House one year earlier 
and voted against the 1988 benefits changes, which took 
us along the road that the Government are now taking us 
further down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins (Westmorland and Lonsdale):</B> My 
hon. Friend is making a powerful case. Would he reflect 
on remarks which might explain the reasons for the 
Government's rebranding of the benefit as a tax 
measure made on my birthday in 1997 by the Prime 
Minister, who said that he had told Ministers at the 
Department of Social Security to consider reducing social 
security bills? This rebranding measure shifts £4 billion from the DSS spending line to I suppose the Treasury tax cut line. That may be the simple and sole reason for 
the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Indeed, I fully appreciated the 
significance of my hon. Friend's birthday. He is 
absolutely right, and I am perhaps being a little naive. 
Perhaps a straightforward "Political"	 point underlies the 
measure. I accept my hon. Friend's point that it is a way 
of dishonestly disguising social security expenditure as a 
tax benefit. None the less, I shall press on with the two 
well-worked and well-thought-through theoretical points.
<P>
The second reason is a little more difficult to outline 
than that relating to churning, but it is even more 
important. A family can be lifted out of the tax system 
with a sufficient structure of tax allowances to ensure that 
it can support itself without benefits. The national 
insurance and tax takes, even where extra benefits such 
as housing benefit exist, tend to be at a level that leaves 
people with a decent incentive to earn more, work 
overtime, undertaking training and improve their lot. To 
use the Prime Minister's phrase, they are more interested 
in a hand up than a hand out.
<P>
If the measure took a step in that direction, I would 
stand up and cheer it I made myself unpopular with a 
number of Ministers in the previous Government by 
continually speaking against their benefits policy. But the 
measure does not take such a step. The reason for that is 
not obscure or difficult, but simply that it is a focused 
measure rather than a universal measure. Universal 
measures appear to be expensive although I have never 
understood how taking less tax can be expensive but by 
focusing on a target group, the Government are forced to 
impose a taper. The taper reaches all the way up as was 
pointed out on Second Reading, to which I shall not allude 
at length to £37,000. The taper on working families tax 
credit is therefore imposed on top of income tax, national 
insurance withdrawals, housing benefit, council tax 
benefit and so on.
<P>
The result, which was a point made eloquently and 
often by Sir Brandon Rhys Williams and the right hon. 
Member for Birkenhead is to leave people with little or 
no incentive to better themselves. We have not seen the 
regulations yet they arrived just before midnight last 
night, and it will require a lot of hard work and calculation 
to see how they work but if the child care tax credit and 
its taper is included, two extra tapers will be imposed on 
top of income tax, national insurance, means-tested 
housing benefit, council tax benefit and so on. A much 
larger body of people will be struck in what is very nearly 
a trap one can argue that it is not quite a trap because it 
does not rise above 100 per cent., but they will be stuck 
on very high rates of marginal tax and benefit withdrawal, 
now working families tax credit withdrawal. That is the 
second reason why what the Government claim is a tax 
relief fails to achieve what a true tax relief would achieve.
<P>
I hope that I have explained why I support the 
amendments. There are no grounds whatever for 
relabelling this benefit a tax relief, other than the purely 
nominal point that it will be raised through the Revenue 
and even that is specious because the Government are 
introducing another measure, which will provide for 
national insurance contributions to be raised through the 
Revenue.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Three or even four Labour Members intervened during 
our previous sitting to challenge Conservative 
Front-Bench Members on what they would do about the 
issue. Those Conservative Members replied that they 
could not be expected to produce detailed measures at 
this stage. Indeed, when I served on the Committee that 
considered the Bill to introduce the poll tax, the Labour 
Opposition produced no alternatives. They did not need 
to because we had to abandon the idea within a couple of 
years, as, I believe, this Government will have to abandon 
this measure.
<P>
None the less, I shall say what I would do. For eight 
years, I have argued that the only way to solve the 
problem is to do what the Government are pretending to 
do under clause 1: solve the problem through the tax 
system and introduce a decent collection of transferable 
allowances and child allowances, so that low-income 
families are taken out of the tax system completely.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait (Beckenham):</B> I rise to support my 
hon. Friends' amendment, which would remove the word, 
"tax"	 from the Bill. I support the amendment for much 
the same reasons as those that have already been 
explained. As has been shown, the tax credit is equal to 
the current benefit, and has merely been moved from one 
Department to another. It reminds me slightly of what is 
called in the City "creative accounting"	. Companies that 
indulge in creative accounting tend to come to grief. I 
contend that the Government are likely to come to grief 
with these proposals, because they have not calculated the 
real cost of the benefit.
<P>
Logically and sensibly, people act in their best 
economic interests, and if generous tax allowances are 
available, they will order their affairs in order to maximise 
their income. It is a well known phenomenon. The Labour 
party is prone to attacking people at the top end of the 
income scale for araraging their tax affairs to maximise 
their income. However, provided that it is not tax evasion, 
of which none of us approves, I have no problem with 
people at the top end of the income scale arranging their 
affairs to maximise their income. Equally, I have no 
problem with people at the lower end of the income scale 
doing precisely the same. They would be foolish not to. 
My experience, both as former Member for Hastings and 
Rye and now, as Member for Beckenham, is that people 
visit my surgery, week after week, and say "I need to 
maximise my income. I am told that the best way to do 
that is to go on benefits or stay on benefits"	. I have an 
opinion about what such people should do, but it is 
difficult to argue against them organising their affairs in 
order to maximise their income. Should the Government 
make available very generous tax credits we prefer to 
call them benefits the number of people claiming the 
benefit will substantially increase.
<P>
Therefore, I have no difficulty whatever in supporting 
the Institute for Fiscal Studies' estimate that it will cost 
£4 billion. When I first brought up the subject in the 
women's day debate last year, I was the only person to 
do so. The debate took place before the Budget, and we 
were dealing in speculation. At that time, I was easily able 
to calculate that the total cost, taking away all the family 
credit benefits that the Conservatives had put in place, 
would be between £10 billion and £15 billion if people 
behaved logically, as I fundamentally believe that they 
will. That is one reason why the Government have found 
themselves on a hook. They will find it difficult to get off 
it merely by moving the benefit from the Department of 
Social Security to the Treasury. Not only will that cost a 
lot, but it will have businesses complaining bitterly.



<P>
We have had the draft regulatory impact study for only 
a few hours I saw it only after 10 o'clock last night. It 
was a case of putting a cold towel round my head and 
concentrating hard, but I have had a good look at the 
study. Far be it from me to suggest that the Paymaster 
General has made a mistake 
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): Will the hon. Lady 
give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I will just finish the point. The regulatory 
impact assessment impinges on clause 1. I will explain 
why once I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> The hon. Lady said that there would 
merely be a transfer of authority from the benefits budget 
to the Inland Revenue and that we were talking about 
nothing more. Before that, however, she began to argue 
about incentives for people on the lower and higher ends 
of the income scale. Will she explain why working people 
will have less incentive to work and increase their 
incomes under working families tax credits than they do 
under the current system of family benefits? Will she set 
out the two scenarios and argue her case through, rather 
than simply stating it into the air?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The hon. Gentleman has only recently 
joined the House and may not have had as much 
experience as some of us of surgery cases. People come 
to us and explain precisely how they will maximise their 
income. I have no difficulty with that. Somebody who 
wants to maximise his income has every right to do so, 
regardless of whether he does it by working and claiming 
tax credits or the credit before us, or by staying out of 
work and far be it from me to suggest this claiming 
benefits while working in the black economy. I could 
suggest that some of the reduction in the unemployment 
figures can be put down to that phenomenon, but that 
would take me right out of order 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Completely out of order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Tempting though it was.
<P>
May I return to the reason why the draft regulatory 
impact assessment impacts on the clause? Our 
amendments show why the clause will impact on 
employers. It is clearly up to employers to pay the credit. 
The amendments remove the word "tax"	 from the clause 
and imply that employers no longer pay for the credit. 
The provision will be expensive for employers. The 
estimate in the draft which seems to have been arrived 
at using slightly rose-tinted spectacles is that the cost to 
small employers will be about £35 a year. That depends, 
however, on how much small employers earn and on how 
many hours they spend on the credit. If they spend 10 
hours over the year, they will be paying themselves at 
employment rates of £3.50 an hour, which is not even the 
minimum wage. The estimates in the impact assessment 
are, therefore, significant underestimates. I hope that the 
Paymaster General can explain matters in greater detail. 
We will seek comments from small businesses about the 
practicalities of the sum involved.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury
(Mr. Brazier) referred eloquently to the problem of 
churning, about which I had already spoken. The 
proposed system will cause an expensive administrative 
churning of benefits, and in due course the National 
Audit Office will realise that it is a complete waste of 
money. That is a further consequence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> In her eloquent discourse, my hon. Friend 
reminded me of a conversation that I have had. I realised 
that the poll tax was fated to utter disaster when a 
constituent of mine who had just retired from the Inland 
Revenue sat down and explained to me how the tax was 
uncollectible. The Inland Revenue has made it clear that 
it is impossible to devise a tax code that works for the 
provisions. Surely that suggests the same fate for the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. He 
merely reinforced the point that he made in his eloquent 
speech, and which I am trying amateurishly to make as 
well.
<P>
When the Conservative party was in government, 
Conservative Members were attacked time and again by 
the then Opposition for encouraging low-pay policies 
through what they called the generosity of our family 
credit, which they said was allowing employers to pay 
low wages. The impact of the Bill will be precisely the 
same, even with a minimum wage of £3.60, which will 
impact heavily on a number of industries. Currently many 
companies pay more than £3.60 an hour, but under the 
Bill they will have no incentive to pay a penny more 
because taxpayers will pay the extra.
<P>
That is one of the Bill's fundamental flaws, which will 
reinforce what the Labour Opposition called the low-pay 
culture, and which Conservative Members firmly believe 
is the first step in employment. There is no chance of 
raising pay, unless it is done by regulation and statute to 
increase the minimum, which will put businesses in some 
sectors of the economy under greater pressure. The culture 
of low pay, criticised by the Labour party when in 
opposition will be reinforced.
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): How can the hon. Lady 
use those arguments about employers paying low wages 
when her Government introduced family credit?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The hon. Lady must recognise that the 
Opposition have a different approach to pay: we regard 
pay as an opportunity to advance, whereas the 
Government regard it as something into which people are 
blocked and set. The Bill will reinforce the low-pay 
culture that they attacked so eloquently in opposition. I 
am sorry to break that news to the hon. Lady.
<P>
Having pointed out how ineffective the credit will be 
as administered by the Treasury, and having spoken in 
support of the amendments seeking to remove the word, 
"tax"	 from the clause, I draw my remarks to a speedy end.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I should like to endorse many of 
the comments made by my hon. Friends about the 
Government's proposals, and to speak in support of the 
amendments that seek to take the word, "tax"	 out of 
tax credits. The proposed system is really family credit 
with a different delivery mechanism. I do not believe 
that it will achieve many of the things that the 
Government intend. It is deeply misguided and could 
in time become a serious administrative nightmare for 
the Government. That makes me wonder how they 
arrived at that position. I think that what happened was 
that Labour in opposition, desperate to return to power 
after 18 years in the wilderness, was keen on its own 
public relations and spin and the idea that, if only it 
handled things better, everything would be all right. 
Labour also knew that the British public were deeply 
concerned about social security in general, how it was 
distributed and its cost.
<P>
The Government are introducing the working families 
tax credit for those two reasons. The Prime Minister 
appealed to the British public with the idea that we must 
"think the unthinkable"	 on social security that we 
needed new, big ideas to make things all right, so that 
social security would be not a millstone around our necks, 
but a great benefit to our citizens. At the same time, he 
encouraged the public to believe that, in thinking the 
unthinkable, he would cut the cost of welfare. We all 
know that, far from doing so, the Labour Government 
have already massively increased the welfare bill by much 
more than their trumpeted increase in health and social 
security spending by about £38 billion, on the 
projected forecasts.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
As we discovered to our cost when in government, 
projected forecasts do not always turn out to be accurate. 
Once people pick up the idea of new benefits, they 
become more attractive. The expected cost of benefit is 
much less than the real cost. I fear that the increased cost 
will be considerably more than the current estimate of 
£38 billion.
<P>
The Labour party was desperate to find a big idea, and 
it was keen to pinch the idea of the working families tax 
credit, which has been in effect for some time in the 
United States where it has caused problems along with 
many other American branding mechanisms. Much of 
President Clinton's campaign style was mirrored by the 
Labour party's election campaign. The working families 
tax credit appeared to fit in with all of that, because it 
sounded wholesome and good. it reinforced the attempt to 
persuade the British public that the Labour party offered 
something exciting and different that would change the 
world that was the pitch. That is how the Labour party 
arrived at the working families tax credit not by thinking 
it through.
<P>
The working families tax credit also had the neat 
advantage that it could be off balance sheet. The 
Paymaster General is in Committee because instead of 
calling it a social security benefit and accounting for it in 
the Department of Social Security, the Government call it 
a tax benefit. A huge part of the £5 billion expenditure 
is being transferred from the social security budget and 
apparently lost. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton knows better, because as a 
former accountant he knows exactly which part of the 
Treasury forecast accounts for it. If I recollect correctly, 
it falls under "minor adjustments"	, it is not properly 
accounted for.
<P>
A member of the public asking this supposedly open 
Government, "Where is my money spent?"	 could not see 
that the working families tax credit costs him as a 
taxpayer £5 billion. It is buried under the bottom line, in 
italics at the bottom of the page, under "minor 
accounting adjustments"	.
<P>
The Government introduced the credit because of its 
two nest advantages. The problem is that, having thought 
of a big idea and announced it, the Government are now 
between a rock and a hard place. How will it work? It 
will not work as a pure tax credit, as does the American 
system; it will remain essentially a benefit administered 
by the Benefits Agency. People will have to apply for it 
in the same way as they do for family credit. There will 
be no real difference in that respect. People will still have 
to apply in exactly the same way, but the delivery 
mechanism will change. The benefit will be paid through 
the employer instead of by cheque from the Benefits 
Agency. That is the only difference between the existing 
family credit and the new working families tax credit.
<P>
The Government have said that millions more people 
will be able to go back to work, but they have not 
been brave enough to put an exact figure on that. The 
1.3 million people who, they say, will claim the credit 
are already claiming it the change will merely draw 
more people into the net. It will not attract new people 
into employment. That is the conclusion to be drawn 
from the Government's figures.
<P>
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that there 
will be 40,000 new entrants to the labour market as a 
result of the changes. That is an incredibly meagre amount 
of people. I have not been in the House for long, but I 
observed it for many years as a journalist in the Lobby. 
That incredible change will upset many employers when 
they wake up to what is to happen to them for the sake 
of only 40,000 more people going to work, who could 
well be pushed into it in another way. I suspect that the 
Government will come to regret this undertaking.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Is the hon. Lady suggesting that 
encouraging 40,000 more people into the labour market 
and helping them to find work is not a worthwhile 
objective?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman completely 
misses my point. I am saying that the Government are 
introducing an overly bureaucratic change, which lacks 
proportion in relation to its potential benefits. The 
prospect of 40,000 people going back to work is welcome, 
but there must be many other ways of achieving that 
without changing the entire system.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> If the Institute for Fiscal Studies is right 
that only 40,000 people will go back to work, the cost of 
£1.5 billion works out at £35,000 a job. Is it not likely 
that many more people will try to claim the benefit 
hence the IFS's other predicted cost of £4 billion for the 
child care tax credit alone?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. 
In addition to the difficulties that the benefit will cause 
employers, it unleashes the potential for a hugh cost to 
the Treasury in child care tax credit. It is a shame that the 
scope of the Bill does not allow us to discuss that in 
greater detail. I fear that the Treasury will be in for a great 
shock when people begin to understand how the tax credit 
could make a difference to their income. The introduction 
of new benefits often has a hugh behavioural impact. It 
takes time before people realise what the impact on their 
incomes might be. It has been predicted that the level of 
take-up of many benefits will result in a relatively modest 
cost to the Exchequer and yet, some years later, lo and 
behold, the cost is found to have grown out of all 
proportion to Ministers' expectations. I confidently 
predict that the child care tax credit will fall into that 
category.
<P>
The problem that the Government have in selling their 
big idea is exemplified by the evidence that was given to 
the Select Committee on Social Security by Martin 
Taylor, the former chairman of Barclays bank, who was 
the Government's guru on the development of the 
working families tax credit. He confidently told members 
of the Committee that it was a great idea. His gut feeling 
was that calling it a tax credit, instead of a benefit, would 
mean that more people would go back out to work. That 
was his view and he thought that we should accept it. He 
could not draw our attention to any relevant studies, or to 
any experiences elsewhere in the world, to prove that 
calling it a tax credit instead of a benefit would have the 
incredible behavioural effect of sending people out to 
work. Nevertheless, he believed that it was more likely to 
happen than not and he intended to proceed on that basis. 
However, he also said that, as he confidently expected the 
benefit to be paid through the tax coding, it would be a 
simple change, straightforwardly administered, and would 
result in the behavioural effect that has been suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Unlike the hon. Lady, I am not a member 
of the Social Security Committee, but from what I have 
seen of the minutes, we may be traducing Martin Taylor 
somewhat by describing him as the architect of the 
scheme. Am I right that he said in his evidence that he 
was told that there would be a tax credit, so he devoted 
most of his attentions to national insurance reform? 
Therefore, the Chancellor is really responsible for the 
scheme.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a 
wonderful point, as he usually does in his interventions 
on social security debates. I would not gainsay what he 
has said.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman says, Martin Taylor was 
interested in the national insurance changes; he also 
believed that the working families tax credit scheme could 
be implemented through the tax coding. So we took it on 
trust that that would happen and started our 
cross-examination of Treasury officials on that basis. 
They looked at us rather gravely and said that it could not 
be done in that way. They had run a lot of models through 
the tax coding to see whether such a thing was possible, 
but it leads to distortion in just a few weeks. They said 
that it would have to be a separate item on the payroll.
<P>
This came as a great shock to all members of that 
Committee, not merely to Conservative Members. We 
were suddenly faced with a very different change from 
the one that the Government had proposed. That is 
fundamental to the problems involved in changing family 
credit to the working families tax credit. Without the 
simplicity of doing it through the tax coding, it is not 
worth the changes that will have to be made.
<P>
Putting that separate item on the payroll will be a 
terrible imposition on businesses, especially very small 
businesses, which are mainly likely to employ people who 
are eligible for the working families tax credit. That is not 
to say that problems will not also be felt higher up the 
system. There will be people in big plcs who will also be 
eligible for working families tax credit. However, by far 
the greatest impact will be on the smaller businesses, 
which already feel overburdened by Government 
regulations, especially those which have been introduced 
in the past 18 months. Lo and behold, now there is an 
even bigger regulation coming down the tracks, and I 
warn Labour Members that people have not yet even 
begun to wake up to it.
<P>
Just the other day, I was having my bracelet fixed in a 
little jewellery shop in Bromsgrove high street. I told the 
owner about the change and his face went white. He said, 
"I have had enough. Here I am, trying to sell my watches, 
clocks and gold necklaces for Christmas and all I get is 
more regulations. Why do I bother? I'm glad that I'm 
going to be 65 soon and that I can retire. I certainly 
wouldn't suggest that my son does this."	
<P>
Small businesses have not realised what the 
Government are about to do to them, or the burden that 
will be imposed on them. When they do wake up to it, 
Labour Members will get a shock, because the many 
disgruntled business men in their constituencies will have 
a lot to say about the Government's regulatory burden.
<P>
I accept what the hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward) 
said about the problems of family credit, there was always 
that potential for collusion with employers who would try 
and abuse the system to pay low wages. The hon. Lady 
should reflect on how much greater the potential for such 
abuse will be when employers, by definition, are forced 
to understand the working families tax credit to administer 
it. At the moment, there is anonymity employers do not 
necessarily know who in their work force gets it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson </B>(Hull, West and Hessle): Yes they 
do.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman intervenes from 
a sedentary position, but I beg to differ. I suspect, 
however, that employers can surmise.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> To help the hon. Lady, the pay 
claims that are made by an employee for family credit 
have to be verified by the employer, so the employer 
knows that a claim is being made when he or she verifies 
the wages.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I fear that the new system will make 
such information much more transparent because it will 
appear on the wage slip.
<P>
Furthermore, with regard to the point made by the hon. 
Member for Watford, employers will have to understand 
the system; that is the difference. They will have to 
understand who the mechanisms work to know who is 
eligible for what level of working families tax credit. The 
minute that some unscrupulous employers understand 
that, they will use it as a depressant on wages. They will 
tell an employee, "I will pay you X so that you can claim 
Y"	. Because they are obliged by the new system to 
understand how the working families tax credit works, 
they will know how they can alter wages.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</b> The hon. Lady does not seem to be getting the point. Under the current system, the employer is 
required to know who is claiming family credit, so her 
argument and that of her hon. Friend the Member for 
Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) that the new system will make 
matters worse is wrong. With the introduction of the 
minimum wage package, there is a much greater chance 
that employees will be far better off under the new system 
than under the current system.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I hear what the hon. Lady says, but 
we must agree to differ. Employers will know how much 
employees get in their wage packets, whereas previously 
there was much less clarity about the family credit benefit. 
Employers will now have to understand the system.
<P>
Some employers will not collect sufficient money in 
taxation from their employees to pay them the working 
families tax credit and will have to apply to the Inland 
Revenue for a cash float. Thus, there will be much greater 
clarity in the system and much more understanding on the 
part of employers. I therefore contend although 
Conservative Members clearly differ from the 
Government on this that there will also be a much 
greater chance that some employers will manipulate the 
system, because they will see the advantages of getting 
the state to pay some of their wages.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the new 
system will mean that more people will officially know 
about claims than did before, hence more employees will 
feel that their affairs are more open to scrutiny by a wider 
audience in any company?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. 
Moreover, there will be a stigma attached to the working 
families tax credit because everyone in the company will 
know who is claiming or who is eligible. It will be an 
open secret from pay slips. The benefit will be much more 
open to scrutiny and could therefore be an embarrassment 
to some people, who would not want their fellow 
employees to know that they are claiming a state 
benefit whatever it is called.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) 
made some curious points, if I may say so. Her argument 
would lead to maintaining the family credit system. When 
the hon. Lady intervened on my hon. Friend the Member 
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, she claimed that 
take-up had been slow. Yes, it was slow to begin with 
because it was a totally new benefit and, at the time, a 
totally new concept perhaps it was a misguided concept, 
but it was certainly new, In fact, take-up is now incredibly 
high for a social security benefit because people 
understand what they are entitled to. Conservative 
Members believe that one of the good things about family 
credit is that people understand it and claim it. In broad 
terms, it is a success because it has had a good take-up 
and therefore has matched our expectations for it.
<P>
The hon. member for Stockton, South was also 
concerned about the security of knowing that payments 
will come through under the family credit system. Again, 
that system was a much more robust and secure delivery 
mechanism, because the credit came as a cheque from the 
Benefits Agency through the front door. The hon. Lady 
shakes her head but if, under the new system, a company 
suddenly disappears or goes bankrupt, where will the 
employees' money come from? They expect a pay cheque 
every week, which pays them not only their pay but their 
benefit. If a company goes bankrupt or if an employer has 
not got his act together to claim back money from the 
Treasury to have a sufficient cash float to pay the benefit, 
suddenly the employee will not have the money. I argue 
strenuously that under the new system there is a 
significant possibility that people will be left vulnerable 
and without money, because the company for which they 
are working has disappeared, gone bankrupt or not got its 
act together and cannot pay the working families tax 
credit that is owing to some of its employees.
<P>
The hon. Lady should consider that point, because one 
the working families tax credit is in place many of her 
constituents may come to her saying precisely that. Under 
the old family credit system they knew that the money 
was coming through the post, but under this system their 
employer, whom they never thought much of, can 
suddenly do a runner on them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend accepted interventions 
from the hon. Member for Stockton, South which 
suggested that there was no substantial difference between 
the systems. My hon. Friend's instincts were right. When 
a person originally claims, he has to send the employer a 
discreet letter. The difference is this: under family credit, 
on renewal the employer simply accepts pay slips; now 
the employer will have a reminder every week.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. 
Friend for explaining that point, because the Government 
Front Bench's earlier intervention was deliberately 
misleading. My hon. Friend has greater knowledge of 
these issues than I have. Nevertheless, there will be a 
substantial difference for employers, as my hon. Friend 
explained.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> In no way did I seek to mislead the 
Committee. The record will show that the hon. Lady said 
that employers did not know when people were claiming 
family credit. I merely pointed out, to assist her, that in 
the majority of cases they would know.



<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The Paymaster General may make her 
point more forcefully, but that does not necessarily make 
it true.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Paymaster General is doing my hon. 
Friend the Member for Bromsgrove a grave injustice. All 
that the employer knows at present is that at one time in 
the past an employee applied for family credit. The 
employer has no idea whether the person is getting family 
credit now. The working families tax credit involves the 
employer week on week in their employees' private 
affairs.
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor</b> rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I shall give way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Lady intervening?
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> Can I make an intervention as a point of 
fact? I do not know how I do it in the Committee. I ask 
for your guidance, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the hon. Lady is making a point of 
order on the way in which the Committee is being run, 
that is fine. If she wants to intervene she should direct her 
remarks to the hon. Member who is on her feet. Will the 
hon. Lady tell me exactly what she wants to ask?
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Roe. I wanted to make 
an intervention on the Front-Bench spokesperson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members may not intervene on 
an intervention. The hon. Lady may intervene only on the 
speech being made at this moment by the hon. Member 
for Bromsgrove, (Miss Kirkbride). She may want to do so 
to elaborate on a point that she is making, in which case 
the hon. Lady can leave some of the points. However, I 
am sure that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar 
will speak later, so the hon. Lady will be able to make 
her point direct to him.
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> On that exciting point, as we wait to 
hear what the hon. Member for Stockton, South says to 
my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, I 
shall close my remarks.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Mrs. Roe, good morning. In 
responding to the Opposition's amendments, I shall try to 
help the Committee I hope that it will be help on the 
figure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and 
Littlehampton was given when he asked the Library to 
calculate the different income from family credit and 
working families tax credit. The hon. Gentleman said that 
there was no difference. Just for the record, the figure of 
£187.19 that he obtained from the Library is incorrect. It 
used the post-April 1999 family credit rates that is 
fine but then it used the working families tax credit 
earnings threshold rather than the post-April 1999 family 
credit threshold. That makes a difference of £10 a week.
<P>
I do not wish to detract from the hon. Gentleman's 
general views on the Bill or the clause, or the comments 
of other hon. Members but it helps to have the correct 
calculation. I am happy to send it to the hon. Gentleman 
and for him to pursue the matter if he is unhappy with my 
answer, but the difference is £10 and not £3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Clearly, the figures are slightly out. As the 
Paymaster General has the figures in front of her, can she 
say what figure corresponds to the £10,000 under working 
families tax credit for a person working the same hours 
in the same circumstances on family credit? What is the 
difference between those two numbers?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman referring to 
the calculation that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis 
and Littlehampton used, which came out at £187? That 
should have been £181 and, for the working families tax 
credit, £191.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> As I understand the Paymaster General, 
she is saying that the £10,000 a year that a person will 
receive form a full-time job and the working families tax 
credit is to be compared with £10 a week less, or £500 a 
year. Is she saying that the corresponding figure for a 
person on family credit is £9,500 and that, as a result 
of the Government's policy, a full-time job that used to 
guarantee £9,500 now guarantees £10,000?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The figures are clear. The hon. 
Gentleman can work them out. I was addressing the point 
about family credit as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis 
and Littlehampton calculated it, and working families tax 
credit. The other element that was missing from his 
calculation, which I left out as well, is the effect of the 
child care tax credit.
<P>
I realise that the Committee will want to discuss these 
issues in some detail, but the hon. Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton made the point again this 
morning and I thought it best to point out that some 
incorrect assumptions have been made which I am sure 
he would like to check.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> We are most grateful for that information, 
which we have no reason to doubt. We understand how 
the Library got in a muddle. On the basis of the Paymaster 
General's correct and more generous interpretation, will 
she revise her estimate of the number of families who will 
start to claim working families tax credit?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No. It does not matter whether the 
Library made an error or was given incorrect information. 
I am merely trying to provide the right figure. The 
Government's view on take up is clear: additional people 
will be entitled to claim working families tax credit. The 
number of eligible people will increase to 1.3 million. I 
do not understand why I should revise that figure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If the hon. Gentleman allows me to 
answer the questions that have been posed, he may find 
his question answered.
<P>
I am delighted that the hon. Member for Canterbury 
found his glasses. It must be a great relief to Opposition 
Members that they no longer have to share.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has argued his views on the family 
for some time. I do not agree with them, but I respect 
them. The difference that he drew between transferable 
allowances and the assistance that the Government want 
to give through the working families tax credit was fair 
enough because it outlined the difference between the 
hon. Member for Canterbury and the Government. 
However, I am not sure that his opinion is widely held or 
reflects Opposition policy.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned hiding and increasing 
social security expenditure. The real average growth in 
Department of Social Security expenditure, including the 
working families tax credit, is 2 per cent. a year over this 
Parliament. That compares with 4 per cent. in the last 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> The figure of 2 per cent. is a forecast 
whereas the figure of 4 per cent. is an actual. The forecast 
of growth in social security expenditure that we 
optimistically produced in 1988 was modest. I believe that 
the figure will be much higher than 2 per cent. because, 
as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead and my former 
colleague Sir Brandon Rhys Williams said, the incentives 
to stay in the system and not to better oneself because of 
high tapers will be extended up the income scale.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman made the point 
that working families tax credit expenditure will be 
hidden because it is being transferred from social security 
expenditure to the tax system. I am trying to explain, even 
if he is not reassured, that that is not the case. Expected 
growth in expenditure, including working families tax 
credit, is 2 per cent. over this Parliament. He argued that 
working families tax credit is not included in that figure 
because we have hidden it. I have answered that point.
<P>
There has been a great deal of discussion about the 
identification of expenditure, to which both the hon. 
Gentleman and the hon. Member for Beckenham referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will be happy to give way when I 
have finished this point.
<P>
It was suggested that expenditure on the working 
families tax credit would not be included in the 
Government's accounts, and that it would not be open 
to scrutiny, but will be hidden away. That is incorrect. 
Opposition Members have forecast what they think will 
occur and painted a picture of doom. When the figures 
are available, they will be able to see whether they were 
right or not, but the cost will not be hidden away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What a pleasure it is to see the hon. Lady 
in her place. I am sure that she took the opportunity to 
read the Committee's deliberations and understands that 
the matter was discussed extensively at the previous 
sitting.
<P>
However, I put it to her that there was an attempt 
by the Government to hide the figures, and that it is 
only due to the Office of National Statistics that the 
figures are now in the open. I also put it to her that 
the figures for the last two years of the Conservative 
Government show a 1 per cent. drop in social security 
spending and then a 1 per cent. increase; and now the 
present Government's proposals will cause a 5 per cent., 
2.7 per cent. and 3.4 per cent. change over the next 
three years.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Of course I read the Official Report 
of the Committee's previous sitting, as I am sure all 
Committee members did in order to remind themselves of 
the points that were made.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar will know 
that the ONS accounting rules under the European system 
mean that the cost of working families tax credit will be 
included in the presentation of the national accounts 
public expenditure aggregate. I think that that was what 
he wanted me to confirm and that it deals with the points 
raised by Opposition Members about expenditure being 
concealed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Lady confirm that the 
expenditure will be included in the social security line of 
the Red Book?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This is a tax credit and it will appear 
as a tax credit, although I realise that Opposition Members 
do not wish to accept the argument.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham also referred to the 
Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates for the cost of child 
care tax credit. In replying to the debate, I am being careful 
not to stray too far from the amendments, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
The hon. Lady probably knows that the IFS uses a 
scenario in which there is a complete shift from informal, 
unregistered child care to formal registered child care; but 
there is no reason why that should happen. It just gives 
the IFS nice big round figures. I know that the hon. Lady 
has followed the issue closely. Indeed, on Second 
Reading, in an intervention on my hon. Friend the 
Financial Secretary to the Treasury, she discussed the 
nature of child care provisions, both formal and informal, 
that parents would choose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> May I finish my sentence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My intervention might be helpful.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sure that all the hon. 
Gentleman's interventions are helpful. I simply want to 
finish my sentence.
<P>
The child care tax credit will give parents the choice. 
There is no suggestion that every parent will abandon his 
or her informal relationship, which is better for some 
parents: it suits their working practices and they think that 
it is better for their children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I want to help the Committee and the 
Paymaster General. The hon. Lady appears to have turned 
over two pages of her brief, no doubt from pressure of 
work and because she wants to make progress. We are 
currently discussing not the child care amendments, which 
we shall reach in a few moments, but whether the 
Government's proposals involve a tax credit. However, 
she was making some wonderful points, and I look 
forward to hearing her speech again perhaps in half an 
hour.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Let me offer to do a deal with the 
hon. Gentleman. Does he want me to discuss only the 
amendments and to ignore the comments and questions 
that Opposition Members put to me? Those comments and 
questions have nothing to do with the amendments but, 
out of courtesy, I was responding to them. If he will not 
complain about the fact that I have not answered those 
questions, I should be happy not to do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If anything was out of order, I 
have made a note of it. The Paymaster General should 
continue with her speech.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Roe, I knew that you 
would take note of that. I have been careful to give 
courteous answers without straying too far from the 
amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> No disrespect was intended.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If those on the Government Front 
Bench and the Opposition Front Bench keep this up, 
Mrs. Roe, you are in danger of being killed by niceness. 
However, in my attempts to keep my contributions in 
order I enjoy the comments of the hon. Member for 
Brentwood and Ongar, and I appreciate his persistence.
<P>
The amendments raise the question of whether the word 
"tax"	 should be in the Bill. Opposition Members dispute 
whether moving the working families tax credit into the 
tax system and paying it through the wage packet 
thereby rewarding work will, as we believe, give people 
the right incentives, encourage them to work more and, 
because of the change in the tapers, let them gain more 
and keep more. It is odd that the Opposition do not agree 
with the work incentive or the need for encouragement.
<P>
Family income supplement, which was the predecessor 
of family credit benefit and which we discussed in our 
previous sitting, was intended by the previous 
Government to be the first step in an attempt to unify the 
taxes and benefits that apply to working families and to 
give those families incentives to work. That system had 
its problems, and it was superseded by family credit 
benefit, for which the rationale again involved incentives 
to work to work more, to be paid more and to get 
appropriate rewards.
<P>
There have been many discussions about whether those 
incentives work. Opposition Members say that they will 
not, but our clear contention is that having a tax credit in 
the tax system that is paid through the wage packet 
underlines the fact that work pays and that, because of the 
change in the tapers, the more one works the greater one's 
pay and the more one keeps. That is why it is essential to 
use the tax credit system.
<P>
It is not often that I quote the Confederation of British 
Industry to support my argument indeed, it may be 
quoted against the later in our consideration of the Bill. 
However, in its press release of 26 January 1999, it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Confederation of British Industry believes that the Working 
Families Tax Credit has the potential to play a very important role 
in raising incentives to work."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are therefore not alone in our view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The press release continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have some real reservations about how well the system will 
work in practice."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to make reference to burdens and to stigma.
<P>
If the Paymaster General is so persuaded by the 
incentive effect of the working families tax credit, will 
she give the Committee her estimate of the take-up rate? 
Will it be higher or lower than that for family credit? If 
it will be higher, what percentage does she expect?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> In seeking assurances from the 
Government, the press release goes on to say some other 
things about the working families tax credit. Hon. 
Members will doubtless raise those points in due course.
<P>
The central points that have been raised are the use of 
the word, "tax"	, and the question of tax incentives and 
incentives to work. I have pointed out to the Committee 
that the Government are not alone in believing that the 
provision, which is part of an important package of 
reforms, will create a very strong incentive to work.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton 
repeatedly asked about the question of eligibility on 
Second Reading, as well. Up to 1.3 million families will 
be eligible, although I recall that he was not satisfied with 
that answer. The Government will seek to ensure that 
those who are eligible claim their entitlement under the 
working families tax credit. The 800,000 families who 
currently receive family credit will automatically receive 
reminders for working families tax credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Paymaster General talks about 
eligibility, which provides the denominator. Is she 
therefore saying that the take-up rate numerator will be 
100 per cent.? She has said that she expects all those who 
are eligible for the new tax credit to raise the take-up rate. 
Does she now predict that the family credit take-up rate 
of 72 per cent. will increase to 100 per cent. under the 
working families tax credit?
<P>
<B>Dawn primarolo:</B> I am saying what I hope the previous 
Government said about family credit: Governments have 
a duty to ensure that people receive their entitlements. We 
will strive to ensure maximum take-up but, as the hon. 
Gentleman knows, I cannot forecast the exact rate. The 
point that I am trying to make is about eligibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will give way to the hon. 
Gentleman, who has been very quiet, although I do so in 
fear and trepidation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Clearly, the Government cannot know 
precisely what the take-up rate will be. However, there 
public expenditure projection for the next three years must 
include a take-up assumption, otherwise they could not 
have arrived at a figure for the number of claimants. What 
take-up assumption underlines the Government's actual 
public expenditure projection?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know 
indeed, he has said as much that the extra £1.5 billion 
is a generous figure that consists partly of the extra 
take-up. He argued on the Floor of the House that he 
would choose to spend the £1.5 billion differently, and I 
know that he has done a great deal of research on the 
matter.
<P>
Because they will be sent reminders, those who are 
already claiming will receive the money. We must then 
make a reasonable projection of the subsequent take-up, 
and set money aside. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that 
inexact science depends on issues such as public 
awareness. Assessing take-up is a matter of estimating 
potential, particularly with regard to child care tax credit. 
We have made it clear that we expect expenditure to be 
in the region of £250 million. However, without a crystal 
ball, it is impossible to say now precisely what will 
happen, and it would be foolish of me to try to do so.



<P>
The discussion has centred on whether the word, "tax"	 
should be removed from the clause. I have dealt with 
incentives to work and ensuring that work pays. The 
Government want to deal with the problem of working 
families who are trapped in the poverty or unemployment 
trap, as did the previous Government. Working families 
tax credit is designed to ensure that the main obstacles 
faced by those families unemployment, poverty and the 
lack of affordable child care are tackled.
<P>
It is not surprising that hon. Members can see 
similarities with family credit. We have used the best 
aspects of family credit, built on it and improved it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall give way to the hon. 
Gentleman for the last time and then I would like to finish 
my remarks on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> The Paymaster General said that the aim 
was to help families in the unemployment and poverty 
traps. However, the poverty trap is occupied by those who 
are earning but have no real incentive to better 
themselves, and the Paymaster General has used the word 
"taper"	 only once or twice in her remarks so far. She has 
not looked at the arithmetic at all.
<P>
Several Opposition Members have put heavy emphasis 
on the combined taper of income tax, national insurance, 
housing benefit, council tax benefit and now, working 
families tax credit. The latter has exactly the same defects 
as family credit, but it extends much further up the income 
scale. Far from less people being caught in the poverty 
trap, more families will be caught in it. When will the 
Paymaster General deal with the arithmetic of the taper? 
The Government have been very coy about letting us have 
the relevant figures.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That does not relate to this 
amendment, which proposes that we take out the word 
"tax"	. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the taper in the 
working families tax credit is considerably lower than the 
taper that operates in family credit. He will no doubt want 
to make his point again when we reach the relevant point 
in our discussion.
<P>
The word "tax"	 creates the link with the tax system 
and the pay packet. That is the radical change that the 
Government seek to make. It demonstrates the reward of 
work and underlines the incentive for people to work, earn 
more and keep more. Clearly a stigma is associated with 
claiming benefits, which we are seeking to tackle. I 
understand that hon. Members will want to ensure that 
that stigma is not attached to those who claim their rights, 
whether in the tax or benefits system. We believe that that 
stigma can be tackled by providing benefit in the pay 
packet and rewarding work with a tax credit. By removing 
the word "tax"	, hon. Members would break that link, 
distort that view and remove that incentive.
<P>
Opposition Members will not be surprised to hear that 
we will resist their amendment. By using the tax system, 
which will provide a tax credit through the wage packet, 
reinforce work, assist families in work with the more 
generous disregard and the taper, and provide the option 
of claiming the child care tax credit, we will make that 
shift of perception and assist in solving the problems that 
all Committee members have identified the poverty trap 
and the unemployment trap. I am sure that hon. Members 
will follow the progress of the working families tax credit 
vigorously to ensure that incentives are firmly in place 
and that they work as the Government expect.



<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I should like to make a few brief remarks. 
The amendments stem in some respects from an 
intervention that I made on the Paymaster General on 
Second Reading. I do not mean this disrespectfully, but 
she did not seem to understand my point. I said that the 
Bill does not introduce a tax credit it may be called that, 
but that is not what it is.
<P>
I can do no better than to quote a Chartered Institute of 
Taxation document, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Despite the name, the extent to which the proposed credits will 
be integrated with the current tax system as it affects employers is 
very limited."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is to be no direct link between the PAYE tax for the period 
or the pay on which it is based, and the amount of the credits paid 
out to the employee."	</font></ul>
<P>
The matter might be better summed up by an excellent 
book that was posted to me by its author, Mr. A. J. Carroll. 
It was probably the first thing that the Paymaster General 
chose to read on receiving her new appointment. The book 
is up to date, and deals with whether the Government are 
introducing a tax credit. It states that the Contributions 
Agency
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><ul>
"was outmanoeuvred by the professionals: in 1998 the Inland 
Revenue staged a successful takeover, brandishing the weapons of 
greater efficiency and cost savings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As in most revolutions, the defeated did not disappear, but survive 
as moles within the Revenue structure. They are involved in the 
wily plot to re-label benefits as `Working Families Tax Credits'. In 
reality WFTCs have nothing to do with tax at all, but are simply 
handouts masquerading as tax reliefs. They are part of a dastardly 
plan hatched by ex-DSS officers to make people work for their 
benefits instead of child-minding, cooking, cleaning and watching 
daytime TV."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the author's words, not mine. It is clear, 
however, that the Bill involves not tax credits, but a 
mechanism that will deliver benefits in a much more 
difficult way. While I assure the Whips' Office that the 
Opposition do not intend habitually to divide the 
Committee, I shall seek to press the amendment to a vote 
because it deals with a matter of principle.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we come to amendment No. 26, 
I should tell the Committee that, although it is unusual to 
appear to go backwards in consideration of amendments, it 
is procedurally perfectly proper to do so. As Erskine May 
states on page 524:

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 
1, line 7, leave out `families' and insert `families''.
<P>
I do not believe that the amendment will be an issue at 
the next general election. Nevertheless, it is worth tabling 
it to raise the subject of the wording of the working 
families tax credit. It does not have an apostrophe after 
the final "s"	, whereas the disabled person's tax credit has 
an apostrophe. It would be helpful if the Paymaster 
General dealt with the grammatical phrasing of the tax 
credit.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am stunned that hon. Members are 
not all rushing to speak to the amendment, which is 
curious because it is partial it deals with only one 
missing apostrophe. To prove to the Committee that I am 
not an unreasonable person, if the hon. Gentleman 
withdraws his amendment, I undertake to ensure that, on 
reprinting, the Bill is corrected throughout, rather than 
only in one place that the hon. Gentleman suggests. It is 
unusual for amendments to concern punctuation, but none 
the less, I am grateful for the official Opposition's 
assistance in the matter, and we will restore the 
apostrophe to its rightful place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On that great victory for the Opposition and 
on the basis of the Paymaster General's assurance, I beg 
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It gives me pleasure to speak to the 
amendments and the new clause. In a sense, this is a 
continuation of our previous debates, given the number of 
times that we have mentioned the child care tax credit. It 
is an integral part of the Bill but surprise, surprise 
nowhere does it appear in the wording. The primary 
purpose of the amendments and the new clause is to 
include in the Bill reference to that crucial part of the 
working families tax credit.
<P>
The Bill does not contain a huge number of clauses, 
but it is not terribly easy for people who do not understand 
legislative wording to know what it is all about. 
Therefore, in the spirit of helpfulness, we invite the 
Government to accept the amendment, to make it clearer 
to the outside world exactly what the Bill means. I hope 
that we will get a positive response of grateful thanks 
from the Government for our suggestion.
<P>
Child care is a crucial part of what the Government are 
trying to achieve with their working families tax credit. It 
is potentially an expensive part of that credit. We were 
not able in previous debates to entice the Paymaster 
General into giving us any estimate of how many people 
she expects to claim the benefit in the next few years. As 
I said earlier, we are concerned that people will arrange 
their affairs to maximise their income. Part of that will be 
to arrange their child care costs accordingly.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury said, 
the taper has been increased to a much higher level of 
withdrawal we discovered from parliamentary questions 
that it could go up as high as £37,000. As the Paymaster 
General implied in the answer I do not suggest anything 
underhand in that not many families have an income of 
£37,000 and five children. However, a number of families 
earn enough to be paying 40 per cent. taxation and have 
children, so they will be eligible for this benefit. I can 
imagine all those families who are the ones most likely 
to have an accountant's advice altering their child care 
arrangements to ensure that they maximise their tax 
position. As far as they are concerned, that is the sensible, 
laudable and right thing to do.
<P>
Then there are those further down the income scale 
whom the Government say, rightly, they are trying to 
help. It is my firm belief and contention that they too will 
alter their arrangements to ensure maximum access to 
child care tax credit. The hon. Lady said that she did not 
expect many people to change their informal child care 
arrangements. I am sure that she says that with the best 
of intentions and that many people would not wish to 
change them because, as the hon. Lady said, they suit 
them. However, the Bill will in effect allow those people 
to formalise those arrangements.
<P>
For example, mum, aunt or a neighbour might be 
looking after the children. That is an informal child care 
arrangement, with which most of us have no problem. It 
is probably one of the most effective and loving situations 
in which child care can be offered to a family. However, 
given the incentives that are built into the Bill, such 
informal arrangements are likely to be formalised as result 
of those people registering as child minders. That will 
lead to a huge increase in the number of registered child 
minders there would need to be an increase in 
registration to meet the provisions of the Children Act 
1989, so that children between the ages of eight and 14, 
or 16 if they are disabled, can go home after school or to 
their next-door neighbour, granny, auntie or whoever to 
be looked after. Not everyone wants to go to homework 
clubs or take up the variety of other suggestions that the 
Government have come up with Not only will the 
Children Act need to be amended accordingly, so that 
children get proper care, but that is a further incentive for 
grannies, aunties and whoever to register as child minders.
<P>
There will therefore be an explosion in the number of 
child minders. Local authorities will find it difficult to 
register and inspect them they will certainly need more 
money to do so. Those people will be able, rightly, to 
claim child care tax credit. I do not have a problem with 
that. Indeed, it will bring yet more people into the formal 
employment network, which I am sure that all hon. 
Members on both sides would support.
<P>
When I represented Hastings and Rye, I remember 
urging various people that it could be a logical step for 
them to register as child minders under the child care 
disregard and family credit which existed when we were 
in Government. The child care tax credit makes that even 
more logical and sensible.
<P>
As well as a huge explosion in the number of formal, 
registered child minders, I submit that there will also be 
an explosion in demand for the child care tax credit to 
pay for those child minders who register. I have no 
objection to that. Conservative Members accept that 
people behave as logical economic beings and that that is 
what they should be doing. Whether we approve of the 
consequences is another matter. The Government clearly 
have not taken on board the costs that are involved. They 
have also chosen to ignore the consequences to the 
ordinary taxpayer, who will pay 40 per cent. tax yet 
another hidden tax from the Government with none 
hand and get it back with the other. The usual costly 
administrative chaos approaches.
<P>
Given the scope of the Bill, this is the Committee's 
only opportunity, to discuss child care tax credit and the 
problems surrounding it. The tax credit will be available 
to two parents who are working and, in particular, to 
single parents. It will be more difficult for the traditional 
family, in which the mother is usually at home looking 
after the children, to claim child care tax credit. I suspect 
that such families, if they wish their children to have 
access to the sort of child care that is developing, will 
organise their affairs so that they are able to claim.
<P>
Yet again, the Government are further reinforcing their 
desire for the strengthening of an a typical family pattern. 
That is not the traditional pattern, where the mother stays 
at home and looks after the children certainly, at least, 
when they are under the age of five. The measure 
represents even more pressure to get both parents working 
and, rightly, gives further encouragement to single parents 
to go out to work. However, it makes single parenthood 
more attractive, which Conservative Members find 
problematic.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The hon. Lady mentioned the traditional 
family and the incentive for it to adjust its affairs. I am 
unclear as to whether the mother in her example could 
register as a child minder and be paid by the father, 
through a contract, to bring up their children. Does the 
hon. Lady believe that they would be eligible for child 
care tax credit?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> That is an option that I had not considered. 
It is a reasonable point and one that is worth exploring. I 
hope that the Paymaster General will be able to clarify 
the siltation. I may be wrong, but I do not believe that we 
have yet seen the relevant regulations [Interruption.] I 
see that I am wrong. I am sorry I have not been able to 
get a cold towel around my head to read that part. Will 
the hon. Lady tell the Committee whether a mother could 
register as a child minder and claim working families tax 
credit for her children? That is an interesting wrinkle that 
we had not considered. It is well worth getting an answer 
to the question. I shall be happy to wait until later for it.
<P>
The Paymaster General said that the regulatory impact 
assessment will not come into play until we reach 
clause 5. The impact assessment in my possession states, 
on page 10:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The figure in Table 3"	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is not necessary to quote them at this stage 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"do not include any estimates for the additional costs arising for the 
childcare industry from having to deal with the verification of claims 
to childcare tax credit"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As this is the only opportunity that the Committee will 
have to debate child care tax credit, will the Paymaster 
General tell us whether she is doing any further work on 
the matter?
<P>
If my argument is correct and there is a huge increase 
in child care provision, it will be an issue for those who 
become part of the industry that is quite apart from the 
present nature of the industry. Inevitably, there are a lot of 
small businesses, many of which involve only one person. 
Several nursery schools are part of chains and fall into 
the larger employer category. Those chains will, however, 
probably employ people who have the right to claim 
WFTC and CCTC. They will, therefore, face a heavy 
regulatory burden. So, too, will small businesses and the 
country's many child minders. They will have to cope 
with local authority registration and inspection systems 
that are not the easiest. Claims are made throughout the 
country of different standards of inspection. We will 
probably have to issue national guidelines. Local 
authorities will have to employ more people. People who 
register as child minders will have to come to terms with 
a lot of bureaucracy. They will face the continuing costs 
that arise from collecting and verifying claims for child 
care.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be helpful if the Paymaster General could 
advise us as to whether the child care industry is being 
consulted on how much it thinks that the provisions will 
cost as that will come into our debates later. It is 
mind-boggling that the draft passed it over so lightly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it would 
be helpful if the Paymaster General reconciled her 
remarks with the Prime Minister's comments in a speech 
earlier this week in Bristol? He accepted that excessive 
regulation destroyed jobs.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I very much hope that the Paymaster 
General will do so. It is clear from my consultations with 
local businesses that red tape and bureaucracy have taken 
over as the No. 1 concern in business. I am afraid that, for 
many reasons, the working family tax credit will impact 
dramatically on businesses' perceptions. Many of them do 
not realise what will happen to them and how quickly. 
Indeed, I talked this week to representatives of a large 
company that employs and does business with many 
women. I briefly explained how the provisions would 
work and a senior person from that business paled visibly. 
The same happened when my hon. Friend the Member for 
Bromsgrove talked to her jeweller. That business man will 
have to grapple with the paperwork that goes with all the 
measures that the Government have introduced. The 
thought of yet another level of bureaucracy was clearly a 
great concern.



<P>
I want to draw my remarks to a close and I hope that I 
have raised most of our concerns about the child care tax 
credit, although I am sure that my hon. Friends will want 
to contribute. However, I want to raise a point that I made 
on Second Reading. It comes entirely from my experience 
of the Child Support Agency, which I am sure that many 
hon. Members who were here in the previous Session of 
Parliament share. I promise that my point is in order,
Mrs. Roe I am sure that you will pull me up if it is not.
<P>
Because of my experience with the Child Support 
Agency I seek, through new clause 9, to amend the way 
in which the child care tax credit is paid. I want to take 
account of the situation in which two parents with shared 
care do not live together. Many of us entirely support the 
principle behind the Child Support Agency. However, I 
encountered several big and distressing issues when 
dealing with problems that arose with the agency. One 
was that of two parents who do not live together but share 
the care of the children. Quite legitimately, the parent who 
looked after the children for the shorter period usually 
the father claimed a reduction in maintenance payments 
to the mother.
<P>
Given that I believe that people are rational economic 
human beings and given the value of the child care tax 
credit, in cases where care of children is shared, has the 
Paymaster General given any thought to the problem of 
claims that will inevitably arise for a share of the child 
care tax credit? If a father is looking after the children for 
just one third of the year which is broadly the 
qualification for the Child Support Agency definition of 
shared care he could legitimately also claim for a share 
of the child care tax credit. It is up to the mother and 
father to decide how those children are looked after, and 
we all know the infinite variety that exists when it comes 
to family structures and looking after children.
<P>
I am assuming that the Treasury and the Paymaster 
General h ave considered that important point, but there 
has been no comment on it so far. Will there be any 
flexibility in the way in which the child care tax credit is 
paid? I suspect that without flexibility heaven forfend that 
we get into the same administrative nightmare that we did 
with the Child Support Agency we shall reinforce some 
of the problems about maintenance of children and 
antagonism between parents. People will come into our 
surgeries demanding what they see as a fair share of the 
tax credit. The Treasury will have to think again and work 
out some way of sharing the tax credit between both 
parents.
<P>
This is our only opportunity so far to debate the child 
care tax credit, although our ingenuity may well provide 
us with some more. It is a crucial part of the working 
families tax credit and I very much hope that, as this is 
one of their key policies, the Government will recognise 
that it would be sensible to put the child care tax credit 
on the face of the Bill. Then at least they can take the 
credit for introducing a benefit of which they are proud.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I want to take the opportunity to make one 
or two brief remarks about the amendments. The hon. 
Member for Beckenham has obviously thought deeply 
about these issues and is right to bring them to the 
Committee's attention. To the extent that amendments 
Nos. 20, 21 and 22 are facilitating measures that enable 
us to table other amendments about the child care tax 
credit, I warmly welcome them.
<P>
In passing, Mrs. Roe, I apologise for the absence of my 
hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). I 
have had a note saying that he is at home in bed with flu 
and asking that his apologies be conveyed to the 
Committee.
<P>
I have reservations about the practicality of what is 
proposed in new clause 9. I understand the hon. Lady's 
point. One can envisage a situation in which a couple are 
separated and the child spends weekends or holidays with 
one parent and week days with the other, or some days in 
the week with one and some with the other.

<P>
New clause 9 proposed that the child care tax credit, if 
paid to one parent, would be available pro rata to the 
other. Surely that is not necessary, because my 
understanding is that if the parents are not living together 
they are potentially separately eligible to claim working 
families tax credit. If each of them were spending money 
on child care, that could be factored into their claim for 
the working families tax credit. My presumption is that if 
both are on a low income separately 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's 
thinking and would not disagree with it, but I am 
fascinated that he seems to be suggesting either that two 
parents will share the same working family tax credit or 
a doubling of the cost. Will he comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am certainly not suggesting that two 
parents would share the tax credit. Without new clause 9 
and if both parties were on a particularly low wage, both 
would be able to claim working families tax credit, 
providing that they are receiving a share of the child 
benefit, because that is the eligibility rule. There could be 
two children in the family, one living with one parent and 
one living with the other. A simpler mechanism might be 
for each party to make independent claims based on their 
actual income. They would not be assessed as a joint 
benefit unit if they were not living together, but trying to 
work out how much of the total was related to child care 
tax credit and who was spending what in which week on 
how many nights a week seems to be fiendishly 
complicated.
<P>
The hon. Lady is trying to tackle a genuine problem in 
an increasingly common situation. The original proposal 
may be necessary and I have a nasty feeling that the 
subsequent proposal might be even messier.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Let us hope that the Paymaster General can 
clarify the matter for us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> On that upbeat note, I hope that the 
Paymaster General will also respond to whether mothers 
can register as child carers and for child care, and under 
what circumstances.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Perhaps I may deal with that point 
first. The answer is, no, it will not be possible. The draft 
regulations that we exposed on Monday show that we are 
building on the rules for child care disregard in family 
credit. The existing family credit rules prevent the child 
care disregard from being used in the way described in 
the scenario in which a father pays a mother for looking 
after their children.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham also referred to page 
10 of the impact assessment and the costs on the child 
care industry in paragraph 46. The costs are not dealt with 
in the table because the calculations are extremely 
difficult to make with any certainty. The hon. Lady will 
see that paragraph 46 makes it clear that the figures fall 
within approximately 5 per cent. of the recurrent and 
non-recurrent costs. The figure is mentioned there because 
it is the best estimate of the likely costs if proof was 
required that the payment had been made. I know that the 
hon. Lady supports that.
<P>
The hon. Lady's amendment is unnecessary and would 
be horrendously complicated. Opposition Members have 
spoken at length about the need not to create problems 
under the Bill for example the problem of those who 
might make less-than-honest applications. The Bill 
provides the power to make regulations covering the 
scheme for the WFTC and the DPTC. The provisions of 
the child care tax credit are included in those regulations; 
they are part of the overall scheme. The child care tax 
credit is an integral part of the WFTC and the DPTC. The 
credit will provide extra help to cover child care costs for 
people receiving those two tax credits. The draft 
regulations show the structure of the child care tax credit 
an dhow it fits in with the WFTC and the DPTC. 
Therefore, the points raised by the hon. Lady are 
unnecessary.



<P>
New clause 9 proposes that if child care tax credit is 
paid for a child whose parents are living apart, it should 
be split proportionately between them. I remind the 
Committee of a few basic facts about working families 
tax credit. It will be paid to family units to help 
low-income families with children. The level of the award 
will be calculated on the basis of total household income, 
which was, I think, the point made by the hon. Member 
for Northavon. Child care tax credit will be awarded if, 
having qualified for WFTC, families are paying eligible 
child costs. Clearly, one set of child care costs should not 
be calculated twice in two separate claims.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Working families tax credit is awarded where the 
applicant has responsibility for the children as members 
of the household. The regulations provide that when a 
child spends time in different households, parents can 
decide who receives the payments, but it cannot be split. 
Child care tax credit is part of the WFTC and is awarded 
only when a parent qualifies. A parent must qualify on 
income to receive WFTC.
<P>
The new clause would split the WFTC package, giving 
rise to an impossible situation. It would not even produce 
a pick-and-mix bag of measures, it would cause chaos. 
What the regulations propose is clear. I have dealt with 
the hon. Lady's points on the parent with responsible care. 
Parents can choose who receives the credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Paymaster General comment on the 
cost of child care tax credit, in particular the discrepancy 
between the Government's estimate of £200 million and 
the IFS's estimate of £4 billion? In its evidence to the 
Social Security Committee, the Inland Revenue said that 
the £200 million is based essentially on estimates of the 
extent to which people would move into paid child care. 
It is clear that the Government have made some 
calculations. Will the hon. Lady provide those estimates 
how many people will move into paid child care and on 
what assumptions are those estimates based? What figure 
will be inserted into the blank in regulation 12 on the 
disregard for weekly maintenance payments? The figure 
was 15, now there will be a blank.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I dealt with the IFS estimate of 
£4 billion in the previous debate. It was based on the 
assumption that everyone would move from informal to 
formal, registered child care. As for the blank, the figure 
will be a 100 per cent. disregard for the CSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Paymaster General has taken me aback 
by saying that the disregard will be 100 per cent. Will she 
clarify that for the record? I understand that the 
regulations refer to the current rate, which allows £15 of 
maintenance to be disregarded in the calculation of family 
credit. Is she saying that all maintenance paid will be 
disregarded under WFTC? I am grateful that she dealt 
with whether a mother could be the approved child carer. 
Is that the only exemption? Can a grandmother, sister or 
aunt register? Are mothers the only relatives to be ruled 
out?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> First, the person has to be engaged 
in a business, registered for childminding under the terms 
of the Children Act and fall within the eligibility criteria 
for family credit. Secondly, I am happy to confirm that 
for the purposes of the WFTC there will be a disregard of 
100 per cent. of any maintenance that is paid as a result 
of the CSA's intervention. That standard is used in the tax 
system and it is another way of showing the difference 
between the WFTC and the family credit benefit. It should 
also reinforce the work incentive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Paymaster General said that she had 
dealt with the difference between the Government's 
figures and those of the IFS. She has done, but only to 
some extent, not completely. There is still a piece missing 
from the jigsaw and having it would speed up our 
deliberations. This is the key question: is there anything 
to prevent those in informal child care from registering 
as childminders?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The rules for our proposed system 
are the same as those that apply to family credit benefit. 
Those people could not register under family credit 
benefit and they should not be able to do so under the 
WFTC, because the two benefits use the same eligibility 
criteria. The question is, could a mother be paid by a 
father to care for their own children? The answer is no. If 
the hon. Gentleman is making a different point that I have 
overlooked, I hope that he will write to me so that I can 
deal with it. The eligibility criteria are the same for both 
benefits. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that such people 
could register under family credit benefit? If so, he should 
give some examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Paymaster General should examine 
the IFS's comments on the matter. She has not helped the 
situation very much. She said earlier this morning, "We 
will take the family credit benefit, and extend and build on 
it."	 She also said and I am certain that my recollection is 
correct that one of the key elements of that extension is 
the child care tax credit. She cannot say one thing at 
roughly 10.30 am and something quite different at 
11.22 am. The incentives will be greater under the 
Government's proposed system and, as she eloquently 
pointed out, its regime will be different. Why does she 
think that the current criteria will prevent those who are 
currently engaged in more informal child care from 
registering?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The simple answer is that the rules 
will prevent it. The eligibility criteria, in combination with 
the provisions of the Children Act 1989, state that paid 
child care, which includes a childminder or an 
out-of-school club, has to be involved. The rules for 
family credit are also tight in this context. It is the rules 
about who qualifies that matter, not the incentives. If 
people think that they can fiddle the system, they are 
sorely mistaken.



<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I wish to pursue that point. The Paymaster 
General will recall that the Select Committee on Social 
Security met officials from the Inland Revenue, who 
suggested exactly the opposite. They said that it would 
be "permissible"	.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> What would be permissible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> To register. The officials said that there 
was nothing to prevent that. I press this matter not to 
embarrass the Paymaster General but because it is the key 
question. The Children Act 1989 says one thing, but 
experts in taxation gave the Select Committee on Social 
Security straightforward advice.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> They have to register and to comply 
with the registration criteria, which are contained in the 
provisions relating to family credit benefit and to WFTC.
 Under both sets of criteria a wife could not register for a 
husband to pay her to look after their children. I have now 
answered that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have a further point to put to the 
Paymaster General
