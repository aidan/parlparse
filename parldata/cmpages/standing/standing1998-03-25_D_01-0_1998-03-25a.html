</P>
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Issue of guidance to registered social landlords and to registered housing associations</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to take new clause 1 Issue of guidance to registered social landlords and registered housing associations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Efford </B>(Eltham): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I hope that under your expert guidance we can proceed expeditiously. To help the Committee, I shall start by saying a few words on the Bill's background.
<P>
The Bill will improve the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995. That important Act required local authorities to draw up and act on energy conservation plans for housing stock in their areas. As a result of that legislation, much progress has been made in improving home insulation, in helping people to keep warm and in reducing CO2 emissions.
<P>
However, a problem has arisen in the flow of information between registered social landlords and local authorities. The Bill is intended to rectify that. In England and Wales, housing associations are now called registered social landlords, although the original term still applies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>
In many areas, there is good co-operation between RSLs and local authorities, which are the energy conservation authorities responsible for implementing the 1995 Act. I recently visited a project run by Hyde Housing Association in south-east London. It was an excellent example of good practice but unfortunately that is not the case everywhere.
<P>
Problems arise when local authorities have difficulties obtaining information on housing association stock, which hampers preparation of their plans under the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995. RSLs have also complained of difficulties for instance, when they have houses in several areas under different local authorities. They may be required to give information in various ways, leading to a burden of bureaucracy when dealing with energy conservation.
<P>
More than 1 million low-income households are RSL tenants. Dealing with the information problem in the context of energy efficiency and energy poverty is an important part of the Bill.
<P>
The amendments are in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Housing, whose Department the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has given me a great deal of help. That assistance has been gratefully received and, as a result, the Bill has been compiled by the Parliamentary Counsel.
<P>
New clause 1 will replace clause 1. It amends the Housing Act 1996, and in particular section 36, which deals with the Housing Corporation's supervisory role with regard to RSLs. The Housing Corporation currently monitors RSLs' performance and is empowered to advise them about maintenance, management and other functions. Similar arrangements exist in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>
However, no provision exists enabling the corporations to give guidance to RSLs and housing associations regarding the achievement of energy efficiency in their housing stock. The Bill will rectify an omission in the Housing Act 1996 and in corresponding Scottish and Northern Irish legislation.
<P>
Under the new clause, the Housing Corporation will be able to give guidance on energy efficiency matters in general and on how RSLs which are still called housing associations in Scotland and Northern Ireland should co-operate with local authorities to assist them in the discharge of their duties when the Bill is enacted.

<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I shall conclude my comments on new clause 1 by commending it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, and thank the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Efford) for his introduction.
<P>
The Bill has been reprinted because of a minor and inconsequential error in the first version, but I am sure that I speak for all Conservative Members when I welcome what I might call a Benthamite Bill: everyone will gain by it and no one will lose. It will be greatly welcomed by people whose homes are difficult and expensive to heat and which must be improved as fast as possible.
<P>
The burden on the registered social landlords will not be immense, but the gains will be significant. The Bill is a worthwhile addition to the 1996 legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): I also welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, to the Chair. I congratulate the hon. Member for Eltham on the Bill, and the Minister for helping it to fruition.
<P>
The Bill has the full support of Liberal Democrat Members, and I hope that the Committee is not detained too long.
<P>
<B>Ms Julia Drown </B>(South Swindon): I too congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham. We should not underestimate the power of information to improve the energy efficiency of homes. In time, the Bill will improve the environment for us and for future generations and it will also improve the pockets of the residents of those homes.
<P>
A number of groups in my constituency will welcome the Bill. They want information about energy to be much more freely available to residents and to local authorities, and to be shared properly between housing associations.
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend and I hope that the Bill will pass quickly through the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): I apologise for not being contentious. This is an unusual occasion in that all hon. Members are virtually of one opinion on the Bill. It is very much to the credit of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham that he has brought this timely and well-drafted Bill before the Committee.
<P>
Until 1 May 1997 I was an employee of a housing association as I call it, in my quaint, old-fashioned way. I should nowadays refer to it as a registered social landlord. I am, therefore, aware of the problems.
<P>
I pay tribute to the way in which the Government are bringing together the disparate agencies involved local authorities, registered social landlords and, let us not forget, the people who live in the homes. It is in the interests of those tenants and residents to bring the relevant parties together.
<P>
I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) in hoping that the Committee does not sit for long; I doubt that it will. It is an excellent Bill. I wish that all Bills were so well-drafted and so well-supported, and achieved such unanimity of cross-party backing.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> On behalf of the Government, I welcome the Bill and thank my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham for his work on its drafting. The Bill and the amendments reflect his ambitions and the Government's desire to introduce legislation that is enactable and meets the wishes of the parliamentary draftsman.
<P>
The Bill will make a significant contribution to improving energy efficiency in the housing association sector throughout the United Kingdom, and to the operation of the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995. Many housing associations already have a good record on energy efficiency. That is partly a result of the Housing Corporation's use of its investment and regulatory levers, but it is also a result of the commitment of many housing associations throughout the UK to developing good practice in energy efficiency.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham mentioned Hyde Housing Association; there are many others. Last week I attended a conference of the housing association sector devoted to sustainable development. The housing associations were especially interested in how they could promote sustainable development good practice. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to be complacent.
<P>
The Bill will give further impetus to our energy efficiency policies in regard to social housing, and provide further practical means of carrying them forward. The amendments are extensive, but will ensure that the Bill meets the overall purposes that my hon. Friend intended and to which the House agreed on Second Reading on 6 February.
<P>
New clause 1 will raise the profile of energy efficiency standards in social housing by adding them separately to the list of management matters on which corporations may give statutory guidance. I support my hon. Friend in commending new clause 1 to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, it is worth making it clear that three Acts are being amended. I may have given the wrong date for one of them in my earlier remarks.
<P>
New clause 1, which replaces clause 1, will amend the Housing Act 1996, the Housing Associations Act 1985, the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 and the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995. I do not want to confuse the issue, but to make plain which Acts and orders will be affected.
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take new clause 2 Energy conservation reports and new clause 3 Guidance as to requests for information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I am grateful for hon. Members' kind comments and am happy to be the vehicle for the Bill. I also thank people outside the House who have done a great deal of work on the Bill.
<P>
Clause 2 will be replaced by new clauses 2 and 3 as drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West I am not used to procedure, and so I bow to his superior knowledge and sense of humour.
<P>
New clause 2 makes provision for registered social landlords and housing associations to supply local authorities with the information that they require. Local authorities will be enabled to obtain that information under the 1995 Act and the relevant Acts pertaining to Northern Ireland and Scotland.
<P>
Subsections (3) and (2) deal with the properties for which local authorities may require information. Subsection (3) requires registered social landlords I cannot get my tongue around that term, I keep trying to say housing associations to provide all the information that they possess.
<P>
Subsection (4) is important because it deals with enforcement, should that be necessary. I hope that such a measure need never be implemented. It is merely a long-stop that enables the Housing Corporation, which is the monitoring body for registered social landlords, to take account of compliance under subsection (3) when deciding whether an RSL is guilty of mismanagement. Subsection (4) acts as a gentle nudge to registered social landlords or housing associations that may be acting in an unsatisfactory or dilatory manner.
<P>
Subsection (5) deals with definitions and is self-explanatory. I commend the new clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> New clause 2, which has been drafted in the same manner as new clause 1, seeks to improve the 1995 Act. That Act requires energy conservation authorities to prepare reports setting out energy conservation measures that the authority considers practical, cost-effective and likely to result in a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of the residential accommodation in their areas.
<P>
I welcome the provisions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham has explained, the Bill will require RSLs and registered housing associations to assist energy conservation authorities in the preparation of their reports by providing them with information about the energy efficiency of their residential housing. Our amendments retain the basic intention of the Bill, but tighten up the wording.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
One of the strengths of the Home Energy Conservation Act is that, by making local authorities energy conservation authorities, it recognises the key role that they can play as catalysts for change. It does not require them to do everything themselves, but to act as coordinators and encouragers in partnership with others who have a role to play. They know their areas and the people who live there. They know local businesses and voluntary bodies and they will knowthe landlords with whom the Bill is concerned.Co-operation and partnership are at the heart of the 1995 Act, and it is welcome that the Bill will further that theme.
<P>
The provisions also amend the Home Energy Conservation Act to give the Secretary of State a more specific power to issue guidance to energy conservation authorities. Rather than the more general wording of clause 3, new clause 3 makes it clear that such guidance may cover the categories of information and form, and the timing of relevant requests. We envisage wide consultation about guidance, which will involve local authorities and the housing association movement. It will also involve other bodies that helped with the development of existing guidance, including the Association for the Conservation of Energy, which is advising my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham.
<P>
I am confident that the Government can in this way devise something that will help both energy conservation authorities and the landlords described in the Bill. I shall endeavour to ensure that our guidance will meet the aims of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham by encouraging co-operation and reasonableness on all sides.
<P>
As with the Home Energy Conservation Act at present, when the Bill is enacted, separate guidance will be produced and issued for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Committee will discuss commencement shortly, but I assure it that the Government intend to issue guidance for each territory as soon as possible once the Bill has received Royal Assent. Our aim is to have the legislation in place in England in time to help local authorities to complete their 1999 progress reports.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I am delighted to follow the Minister, and to echo much of what she said. The legislation is uncontroversial. The new clause, which will replace clause 2 in the same way as new clause 1 replaces clause 1, will mean that the legislation will extend to the whole of the United Kingdom, and that all four countries will be covered without a delay for Northern Ireland.
<P>
It is worth recalling that relevant tenants generally stay longer in the same premises. The same applies to other social housing, which is usually in the hands of local authorities or, in the case of Northern Ireland, the Department of the Environment Housing Executive. There is a tendency for such tenants to be older and poorer, and for them to pay more for heating and to have less comfort. That is a generalisation. The circumstances in the private sector should be at least replicated, if not improved on. As in the private sector, when homes turn over roughly every seven years, people, should get information, and the opportunity to replace their boilers, to improve their system of heating controls, to improve their cavity wall or roof insulation and to deal with draft proofing. Too many examples remain of people paying œ20 a week to be cold in winter, when they should pay œ5, œ7 or œ10 a week to be warm. The Bill and new clauses, which I am delighted to support, will make that possible by drawing attention to what is going on, and, as was spelt out, by giving powers to the Minister to step in if people are not taking action that is reasonably practicable and necessary.

<H4><center>Short title and commencement</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 10, leave out subsection (2) and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2) This Act, except this section, shall not come into force until such day as the Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument appoint; and different days may be appointed for different purposes or different areas.

<P>
(a) the reference to the Secretary of State shall be construed as a reference to the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, and
<P>
(b) the reference to an order made by statutory instrument shall be construed as a reference to an order which is a statutory rule for the purposes of the Statutory Rules (Northern Ireland) Order 1979.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 11, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) Subsection (1) of section (Issue of guidance to registered social landlords and registered housing associations) extends to England and Wales only; subsection (2) of that section extends to Scotland only; and subsection (3) of that section extends to Northern Ireland only.
<P>
(5) Except as provided by subsection (4), this Act extends to Northern Ireland.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Efford:</B> The clause deals with the reasonableness of the relationship between registered social landlords and local authorities. It gives authorities guidance on what information they can require of registered social landlords and housing associations. It also sets out how information should be presented and the time scale within which it can be expected.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening to the hon. Gentleman and judging by what he is saying, I think that he is speaking to the short title.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I am speaking to new clause 3.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are on amendment No. 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I am sorry.
<P>
Amendment No. 3 deals with the commencement date and allows the Secretary of State to make commencement orders that provide for the Bill's extension to Northern Ireland. I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell the Committee that such orders will be made expeditiously, and I am grateful for that. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment and explains the extent of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I support the change that the hon. Member for Eltham proposes to the commencement date. He has explained a complicated issue in a way that is understandable to us all. It is worth noting that one reason for the difference in Northern Ireland is that the Secretary of State or probably a junior Minister currently exercises the power of the housing authority because the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland controls the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Nobody expects that to remain the case. In time, the 26 local councils, their successors or devolved government might take direct control of housing.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Eltham and the Minister on proposing arrangements so that we will not have to wait for Orders in Council, which would delay the introduction of the Bill's provisions in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The amendments to clause 3(2) of my hon. Friend's Bill are the only ones that make a real change. I understand why my hon. Friend wanted the commencement date to be written into the Bill he does not want his Bill to go through the whole parliamentary process and then to languish on the shelves. I assure him and the Committee, however, that the Government intend to introduce orders promptly so that the Bill's useful measures can be implemented.
<P>
There are two main reasons for using the appointed-day procedure. First, it will allow greater flexibility for the different parts of the United Kingdom. As the hon. Member for Worthing, West said, that is particularly necessary in Northern Ireland, which has separate commencement arrangements. Amendment No. 3 should be welcomed because it would allow the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland to commence the Bill's provisions directly.
<P>
The other reason for the commencement procedures is to allow time for the necessary guidance to be prepared and for the bodies that are to be given a new duty to prepare themselves. The corporations want to consult before issuing guidance to registered social landlords and registered housing associations. Departments will also consult widely before they issue guidance to local energy conservation authorities.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that that is entirely sensible and reflects no wish on the Government's part to delay implementation of the Bill's provisions.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I, too, would like to thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I am sure that Members of the Committee do not realise that we are neighbours. Our constituencies are probably a little colder than that of the current hon. Member for Eltham an that of the previous hon. Member for Eltham, the hon. Member for Worthing, West, so the Bill will certainly be welcomed there. I hope that the House will learn of the co-operation in the Committee and allow the Bill to proceed through its next stages. I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham on his work on the Bill, and I hope that the Bill will progress further.
