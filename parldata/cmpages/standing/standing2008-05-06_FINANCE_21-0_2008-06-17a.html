passenger duty: class of travel with large seat pitch</div>
<a name="08061777000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question proposed,</i> That
the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061777000176"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.30
am</div><a name="08061777000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061777000221"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): Since the clause was originally
put into the Bill, we have been slightly overtaken by events on two
fronts. First, we know that the air passenger duties that we currently
have will be replaced by a per-plane duty at some point&#151;I think
in November 2009. We discussed that when we considered clause 146 last
week.</div><a name="08061777000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
we know that, because of the rising oil price and other pressures on
the industry, some of the key companies and business-only jets that the
clause was aimed at are facing challenging circumstances. Some people
would say that the Government are perhaps closing the stable door after
the horse has bolted in that respect. Others may say that they are
closing the stable door after the horse has died. Nevertheless, there
are a few points I want to raise to get the Minister to talk a little
more on record about the Government&#146;s thinking and to clarify,
in relation to the consultation document and the Government&#146;s
response to it, which option they are going for. My understanding is
that it is option three, but it would be helpful for her to clarify
that.</div>
<a name="08061777000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems a
sensible step to amend the existing air passenger duty in this way,
because the way in which the duty was structured meant that
business-only flights were essentially able to have the duty charged at
a reduced rate. The measure aims to ensure that they pay the standard
rate.</div>
<a name="08061777000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted to
ask the Minister about the choice of 40 in for the seat pitch, at which
seats can no longer be considered standard class. As she is aware, a
number of airlines still have business class seats with pitches below
40 in. To give a few examples, Air Sahara, Aloha Airlines, Estonian
Air, Icelandair, Jet Airways,
Luxair&#151;</div><a name="08061777000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000222"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):</b> The
big
boys.</div><a name="08061777000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000223"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The Minister says, &#147;The big boys.&#148;
Nevertheless these are still airlines that have business class seats
with a pitch below 40 in. I wanted to ask her 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column720" />Column number: 720</div>what the thought process was for the cut-off at 40 in rather than
perhaps 38 in, which would have captured the overwhelming majority. Can
she also clarify what the revenue impact of the clause is? My
understanding is that, if we are looking at option three being
implemented&#151;perhaps she can confirm that&#151;the revenue
impact would be small. Unfortunately, given the demise of some of the
business-only airlines recently, it could almost be negligible. The
Government&#146;s response to the consultation, published back in
January of this year, said in paragraph 4.34 that the impact of
introducing option three would be negligible and that,
currently,</div>
<a name="08061777000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only two of the
290 registered airlines provide a business class only
service.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061777000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps she can clarify
whether either of those two airlines are still
operating&#151;otherwise, the clause becomes entirely academic.
Obviously, the provisions that it brings forward will last only for 12
months while the per-plane duty comes in.</div>
<a name="08061777000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the
main questions. Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether, in the
Treasury&#146;s assessment, those business-only airlines that remain
will have to bear any undue bureaucracy and administration as a result
of the provision. Obviously, they will pay more tax, and I understand
why the Government are bringing the clause forward, but, in the
conditions of rising costs and challenging economic circumstances which
all companies are facing at the moment, we do not want to put any
additional pressures on them unnecessarily. At the end of the day, they
are employing people and generating work in our
economy.</div><a name="08061777000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061777000224"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I would like to
declare two interests: the first is recorded in the Register of
Members&#146; Interests and the second is that I am rather tall. This
measure is an attack on tall people and it will discriminate against
them&#151;if only my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham
(Daniel Kawczynski) were here. This is a nasty tax. It has always been
simply a tax and has never been a green or environmental tax. I know
that the Government realise that and will abolish and change it, but it
seems rather strange to alter the rules now for business-only carriers.
As far as I am aware, business-only carriers have gone out of business
in this country, so I would be interested to learn which of those
businesses are still flying.</div>
<a name="08061777000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
behind this tax is to catch business-only airlines, but it will of
course catch many others as well. If I want to fly and ask for an
emergency exit seat so that I have more leg room, will I now have to
pay double the airport duty tax because the seat immediately in front
of me is more than 40 in away? What about occasions when an airline is
overbooked and puts economy passengers in business class or premium
economy? More passengers would get on the plane, which is what the
Government say should happen, but will they be asked to pay double the
air passenger duty?</div>
<a name="08061777000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many economy
airlines want to have a seat pitch of more than 40 in because one of
the obvious ways of avoiding deep vein thrombosis, which is an
important issue, is to have a larger seat pitch so that people can
exercise while in their seats. Therefore, everything that the
Government are doing with regard to this tax is wholly wrong. As my
hon. Friend has said, it is closing the door after the horse is dead.
It is an attack on tall 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column721" />Column number: 721</div>people and it will discourage airlines from flying at full capacity and
economy airlines from increasing seat pitch.</div>
<a name="08061777000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">In America,
some economy airlines have a larger seat pitch as a selling point
because of the problems with cramped conditions and deep vein
thrombosis, but we are discouraging companies such as EasyJet and
Ryanair from doing likewise. This change cannot have any significant
revenue implications, and it must have been thought up in an office in
Whitehall by a bureaucrat who knows nothing about the aviation
industry.</div><a name="08061777000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061777000225"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): I take an interest in
flying matters, and I think that I am the only qualified fast jet pilot
in the House. When I was a Minister in Northern Ireland, I flew 400
times between London and Belfast in three years, and I once worked out
that I have spent six months of my life in the air. I do not understand
how the clause came to be put forward, as it is remarkably
unsophisticated to concentrate only on pitch. If one were genuinely
trying to introduce environmental aspects into the cost of air travel,
one ought to take into account the height and width of the cabin and
the width, as well as the pitch, of the seat. If one were seriously
trying to introduce an environmental aspect and cut back on air travel,
one would have thought that it was possible to produce a far more
sophisticated measure, such as a comparison between the weight of the
passengers in an aircraft and the weight of the aircraft. I will be
interested to hear how the Exchequer Secretary will explain and defend
the
clause.</div><a name="08061777000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000226"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I will seek to deal with some of the issues that
have been raised. We seem to be in an interesting situation. The hon.
Member for Putney said she is broadly in favour of the clause, but
complained about aspects of it. The hon. Member for Wellingborough,
albeit that he is very tall, is in complete revolt against the clause
and the hon. Member for Gosport gave a more measured contribution. He
was quite right to ask some technical questions. Before Committee
members get carried away with the idea that this is some
bureaucrat&#146;s plan gone mad and that somebody in Whitehall is
thinking of ways to tinker with taxes just for the sake of it to
justify their own existence, I tell them that this issue was raised by
the industry as part of the 2006 pre-Budget report
process.</div><a name="08061777000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
industry raised the issue with the then Financial Secretary, my hon.
Friend the Member for Wentworth (John Healey), because it had concerns
about the definitions of classes of travel. Those matched broadly the
classes of travel marketed when they were introduced in 2001. Since
then, developments in the industry have meant that definitions have
created market distortions, particularly in the area of business class
and premium economy class seating. The industry raised the issue with
us, not the other way around. I hope that the hon. Member for
Wellingborough will put away his rather crude caricature of where the
provision might have come from and recognise that it came from the
industry.</div><a name="08061777000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Current
definitions stipulate that the lowest cost of travel available on an
aircraft attracts the reduced rate of air passenger duty. On
mixed-class flights, that means that travel on anything other than the
lowest class attracts standard or higher rates of air passenger duty. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column722" />Column number: 722</div>On a single-class flight, only one class of travel is available.
Consequently, that class meets the definition of being the lowest class
of travel. Travel on those flights therefore attracts the reduced rate.
The industry complained that under current definitions, on business
class-only flights all passengers meet the definition of travelling on
the lowest class available on the aircraft and receive the reduced rate
of air passenger duty. In contrast, premium products on mixed-class
flights attracted standard rather than reduced
rates.</div><a name="08061777000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the worry from the industry that classes of travel
distorted decisions, the Government announced in the last Budget that
they were open to changing the definitions, provided that doing so was
broadly revenue neutral and that any change was transparent and simple
for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the industry to
operate.</div><a name="08061777000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
plans to move to a per-plane duty make it even more important that we
do not impose a burdensome change on what is left of the current system
of air passenger duty. As the hon. Member for Putney mentioned, a
number of options were discussed in the consultation, which was
launched on 1 May last year and closed on 1 July. Following the
consultation, the Chancellor announced in the 2007 pre-Budget report
that changes would be made to the class of travel definitions so that
travel on business class-only flights would attract the standard rate,
rather than the reduced
rate.</div><a name="08061777000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to the hon. Lady&#146;s question, that was not the most
favoured option by the industry, but it had the benefit of affecting
only a small number of carriers. She rightly pointed out that they are
not in existence. There were three such carriers at the time of the
consultation. Since then, the business class-only carriers have ceased
to operate. That may be a dead horse or only a temporary stay. One does
not quite know what the market will do, but it is quite possible that
business class-only flights will return at some stage. That was why it
was felt reasonable to continue with these
changes.</div><a name="08061777000035"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000227"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> As air passenger duty is to be abolished and the
possibility of new business class-only airlines starting up is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000228"></a>Angela

thought that the different classes were creating distortions in

way to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08061777000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to realise that operators come and go in these markets. I
agree that it is important that any change does not involve a huge
burden in changing systems, which is why we went for the option that we
did. It makes the least disruptive change, and the simplest and easiest
change to the system in the circumstances, especially given the amount
of time we have left before the proposed introduction of per-plane duty
in 2009.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column723" />Column number: 723</div><a name="08061777000177"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000231"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister mentioned the introduction of the
per-plane duty in 2009 and referred to this arrangement as having only
a year left to go. We are all aware of the hostility of the United
States to the proposed per-plane duty. I wonder whether she is able to
update the Committee on that issue, and whether there was any
discussion of the difference of opinion between the UK and the US
during the President&#146;s visit. Has it been escalated to that
level of attention, and does she expect that the 2009 change will be
able to take place?</div>
<a name="08061777000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000232"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I am flattered that the hon. Gentleman thinks I
would be privy quite so quickly to the discussions that the Prime
Minister has just had with the President of the United States. The hon.
Gentleman has a flatteringly high opinion of me, but I am afraid that
at this moment I am unclear as to quite what the Prime Minister and the
President discussed during their tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte
yesterday. I promise that I will try to find out for him.</div>
<a name="08061777000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the revenue impact, an additional &#163;5 million
is what was worked out, which, when one looks at the size of the
revenues from APD, is broadly revenue-neutral. The industry&#146;s
favoured approach, which would have made changes that raised the APD
liability of seats on business class-only flights and lowered the APD
liability on premium economy seats, would have cost &#163;60 million.
That would have been extremely complex to implement and would have
resulted in system changes which would have affected a large sector of
the airline industry&#151;clearly not a very sensible approach to
take with only a year to go of this tax
plan.</div>
<a name="08061777000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000233"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The Minister said that the original estimate of
the revenue impact was &#163;5 million. I am assuming that that
figure is now zero, given that she does not think that the provision
will affect any airline companies that are currently operating. Is that
correct?</div><a name="08061777000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000234"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I am not certain, and it would be wrong of me to
give the Committee a figure, given the changes that there have been in
the airline industry. I think that the hon. Lady needs to bear in mind
also the implications of the change of premier economy class, which is
not completely out of the picture. I am happy to return to the
Committee with an updated estimate of the revenue effects of that if
one has been done. It is clearly not revenue-neutral to put into being
the most popular option favoured by the industry, which would have cost

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000235"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; she is
being extremely generous. I am a little worried about what she has just
said, because there should be a zero revenue implication as there are
no business class-only airlines now flying. However, I suspect that
passengers who are flying economy&#151;such as those people who are
sitting in exit rows, or happen to be caught in a seat which has more
than a 40 in seat pitch&#151;will now be paying double duty. Can she
assure the Committee that that will not
happen?</div><a name="08061777000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000236"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman used several particular
instances of where he thought there might be difficulties, in terms of
passengers being upgraded and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column724" />Column number: 724</div>such. I have to say that, if a passenger has been upgraded when they
have not asked to be upgraded, it would be fairly churlish of the
airline then to pass on the charge of the APD.</div>
<a name="08061777000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Air passenger
duty is charged to the airlines and it is up to them whether they pass
that cost on to the customers. I do not know what every airline in
existence would do for passengers whom they upgraded in those
circumstances, but it would be odd to upgrade and then demand an extra
payment, if the individual had not asked to be
upgraded.</div><a name="08061777000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000237"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I do not want to help the Exchequer Secretary
out too much, but can she confirm that the 40 in pitch is in relation
to either the seat in front or the seat behind, and that if there is no
seat in front it will be based on the seat
behind?</div><a name="08061777000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000238"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> That is the case. In his approach to the tax, the
hon. Member for Wellingborough has allowed himself to be carried away
by the consciousness of his
height.</div><a name="08061777000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000239"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> My understanding is that the defining class is
the class of travel that the passenger is contracted to have through
his agreement for carriage, not the one that he travels in. Therefore,
it seems clear that an upgrade would not necessarily result in a higher
charge. Is the Exchequer Secretary aware that it is the practice of
some airlines and some brokers or bulk agents of airline
travel&#151;or at least it used to be, I do not get much opportunity
to travel these days&#151;to enter into guaranteed upgrade
arrangements, where one buys a ticket of a certain class on the
understanding that it will be upgraded at the point of departure? Has
she taken that practice into account, and is she certain that there is
no potential revenue loss as a result of such practices being used to
avoid the impact of the
measures?</div><a name="08061777000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000240"></a>Angela

loss, but I will certainly check that we did not miss in the

doing.</div><a name="08061777000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

that the hon. Member for Wellingborough made was about the class of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000247"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Cook, and to get these amendments out of the departure
lounge and onto the runway. I said to my hon. Friend the Member for
Putney that there were insufficient puns in her speech in spite of the
ample opportunity, so I thought that I might get one of my own in. The
amendments are relatively simple and I do not want to detain the
Committee for too long. They relate to sharia-compliant sukuk
products.</div><a name="08061777000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the principles of sharia law is that interest should not be charged
on debt, but it is permissible for people to share in risk. In these
bonds, there is often an agreement between the person who has issued
the bonds and the purchaser of the bonds about the maximum level of
return that someone can enjoy on the bonds. The concern raised with me
about how those bonds are exempted from stamp duty is that, in some
cases, the bondholder is entitled to all of the return on the
underlying asset; we will talk about underlying assets in more detail,
perhaps on schedule 46. The bondholder is entitled to all of the
return, subject to a cap of, say, 7 per cent. My understanding is that
bonds structured like that do not get the same exemptions as bonds
structured in alternative ways and, therefore, some sukuk products are
not treated in accordance with the other bonds. I am keen to understand
why that is the case. Amendments Nos. 358 and 359 aim to tackle that
issue. The Government amendments in the next group tackle a slightly
different set of circumstances, but both groups have the same
ends&#151;to ensure that the treatment of these bonds and of more
conventional products is
comparable.</div><a name="08061777000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000248"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> It is a
pleasure as always, Mr. Cook, to serve under your
chairmanship.</div>
<a name="08061777000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the hon. Gentleman for his general understanding about what we are
attempting to do. The problem is that the amendments he proposes go far
wider than addressing the issue that he seeks to deal with.</div>
<a name="08061777000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments remove the condition that the return must not be dependent
on the results of a business where the instrument concerned falls
within the definition of loan capital that we are discussing. The
effect would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column726" />Column number: 726</div>be that alternative finance investment bonds would not have to qualify
for exemption under the loan capital rule at all. Those types of bonds
would be afforded more advantageous treatment than their conventional
equivalents. They would have a more advantageous position than normal
types of debt and loan capital raising, because the conventional
equivalents would still need to qualify for exemption under the loan
capital rules. Therefore, it is contradictory to Government policy. We
are trying to ensure broadly equivalent treatment of sharia-type
products and their conventional equivalents.</div>
<a name="08061777000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would extend the scope of the loan capital exemption to
include bonds that have a return based on the results of the business.
We think that that kind of return is closer in substance to an
equity-like return rather than a debt instrument-like
return.</div>
<a name="08061777000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000249"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Although in principle the Minister is right that
the bondholder would benefit from the full results of the business, in
these circumstances the bonds are structured so the cap of, say, 7 per
cent. prevents them from enjoying those full benefits. Therefore, it
moves away from the traditional equity model in which the shareholders
are entitled to full rights over the
profits.</div>
<a name="08061777000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000250"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The dividing line between us is that I think that
having a cap involves a greater sense of risk sharing than is
appropriate for this type of policy measure. If there is a cap, which
is up to X per cent. it is more like an equity-type product than a
conventional debt-type product. It is economically different from a
product that has a fixed rate as opposed to a cap that can be up to
that point. I understand that one member of our Islamic Finance Experts
Group has raised that concern and we are happy to explore it in more
detail.</div>
<a name="08061777000178"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="08061777000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have fundamental reservations about allowing an exemption for products
that are not economically a debt-type instrument, even though they are
arranged in a sharia-compliant way. To go down the route suggested by
the hon. Gentleman looks like a change to our policy. It would also
tilt the playing field for sharia-compliant and conventional methods of
raising finance to the advantage of sharia-compliant products, which is
not fair, so that is another reason to resist the amendment. There is
no reason why we cannot explore the fact that there are, we have just
been informed, some types of sukuk that have a cap rather than a
specified rate of return. We can then deal with the matter in a more
appropriate way if we judge it necessary, but accepting the amendment
would distort our policy. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw
it.</div><a name="08061777000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000251"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation
of why the Government oppose the amendment. She raises a very important
principle as to how these products should be looked at. They are meant
to mirror conventional products, not be given advantages over them. We
will deal in clause 149 with the way in which the exemptions for
sharia-compliant products have then been used for tax avoidance. We
must be sure that we do not provide advantages that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column727" />Column number: 727</div>others can exploit. On that basis, and with the Minister&#146;s
reassurance that she will look at this issue, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw.</div><a name="08061777000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

little more explanation about the amendment. I understand that it
refers to situations in which the interest paid is below a certain rate
where there are insufficient profits to generate the rate that people
expect on their bonds. That would also suggest that it mirrors
equity-like participation, rather than
bonds.</div>

Ussher:</b> There obviously is a demand for more detail about
the amendments, so I am happy to provide it. With your permission,
Mr. Cook, I will describe the purpose of the clause, then go
on to the technical amendments. If the Committee is in agreement,
perhaps we can hold the clause stand part debate at the same
time.</div><a name="08061777000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
148 introduces stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax rules for
alternative finance investment bonds, sharia-compliant versions of
which are commonly known as sukuk. The three most recent Finance Acts
have introduced rules for direct tax treatment of a number of
sharia-compliant alternative finance products. Such products, as we
have heard, prohibit the payment or receipt of interest, but pay an
alternative finance return instead. The broad principle of our tax
rules is to ensure that where a return that is paid to, or by, an
issuer or investor is economically equivalent to interest, it should be
treated as if it were interest. For stamp duty purposes, that principle
is extended so that where a financial instrument is economically
equivalent to a debt instrument it will be treated as if it were a debt
instrument. Where the arrangements are in substance the same as those
for a company raising finance by issuing a conventional debt security,
the stamp duty rules will treat the instrument as if it were loan
capital, thereby enabling the instrument to be exempt from stamp duty
on transfer in the secondary markets.</div>
<a name="08061777000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
alternative finance arrangements, however, are closer in substance to
holding shares in a company or to a profit-sharing arrangement, and the
new stamp duty rules will not apply to those types of arrangement. The
extension of the definition of loan capital for securities which are
classified as alternative finance investment bonds that we are
attempting to make will allow businesses and individuals to access a
wider range of alternative finance products while helping to create a
broadly level 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column728" />Column number: 728</div>playing field between those products and their conventional equivalents
for this important and growing market. We are in uncharted territory,
and after the Finance Bill was published, we found that we needed to
tweak the drafting, because the interaction of the rules in the clause
with existing tax rules was not fully anticipated. Our amendments are
not intended to change the substance of our proposal at all, but simply
to make sure that it is completely
watertight.</div><a name="08061777000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the details, Government amendment No. 309 amends clause 148 to
ensure that alternative finance investment bonds may benefit from the
stamp duty exemption provided by section 79(7)(b) of the Finance Act
1986 on an equivalent basis to securities raised on conventional terms.
Amendments Nos. 310 to 312 amend clause 148 to ensure that alternative
finance investment bonds may benefit from the stamp duty exemption
provided by section 79(7)(b) of the Finance Act 1986 on an equivalent
basis to securities raised on conventional terms. That is achieved by
amending the definition of capital market investment and capital market
arrangements where the loan capital concerned is raised under
alternative finance principles. I regret that we have had to amend the
Bill to make it completely perfect, but I hope we have the
Committee&#146;s support in so
doing.</div><a name="08061777000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

Government-issued sukuk product would offer by providing a benchmark,
keeping liquidity, and providing another asset class for investment.
However, as we discussed in relation to clause 148, these are not
straightforward products, which is reflected in the Government&#146;s
response to the consultation on the issuance of Government-backed sukuk
products. Clause 150, and schedule 46, will facilitate the
Government&#146;s issuance of such products in
future.</div><a name="08061777000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
identified the complexity of those products in previous clauses, so
there is a need for proper parliamentary scrutiny of them. I am
disappointed that the Government have gone down the route of secondary
legislation, rather than introducing fuller legislation in the Bill, or
a subsequent Finance Bill, because there are difficult issues that must
be resolved. I would like to highlight them for the Minister, before
the Committee considers giving the Government powers to facilitate the
issuance of those
bills.</div><a name="08061777000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issues were outlined in a Government consultation paper, and the
Minister has a copy of the response published by the Government at the
beginning of this month, including the draft legislation we are
debating today. Clearly, that paves the way for the Government to issue
these products. I want to discuss a number of issues with the Economic
Secretary so that I can understand the Government&#146;s approach to
the regulations, which we will debate in
future.</div><a name="08061777000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
essential step for private sector companies developing sharia-compliant
products is to seek approval from a board of Islamic scholars before
they are marketed. The scholars will determine whether a product
complies with sharia law. Will the Economic Secretary say whether the
Government think that the issue of sukuk products by the Government
depends on obtaining approval from those scholars? Do the Government
have an alternative route that they could adopt to ensure that products
pass the requisite tests in sharia law for the benefit of those
interested in buying
them?</div><a name="08061777000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
was identified in the debate on clause 148, sharia law prohibits the
payment of interest, but it permits people to share risk and the
returns that come from it. In a conventional bill, holders are paid a
coupon, which is straightforward. As I understand this case, the
Government envisage a sukuk bill with an underlying lease. In effect,
the proceeds from the issuance of the bill will be used to acquire an
asset, which will be leased, and the lease payments will provide the
return for the bill holders. Will the Minister expand on the type of
assets that will form the basis of the lease, given that those assets
must be sharia
compliant?</div><a name="08061777000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s preferred route for dealing with the issue is to
provide sukuk bills, rather than bonds. Bills, by their nature, have
relatively short maturities. The consultation paper suggested
maturities of one, three and six months. What sort of assets does the
Minister expect will be part of the leases? If the Government went down
the route of issuing sukuk bonds with longer maturity rates, they might
consider including in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column731" />Column number: 731</div>the lease assets, for example, for private finance initiative projects
where, typically, the lease is for a period of 30
years.</div>
<a name="08061777000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000266"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am listening carefully to my hon. Friend, who
has researched the subject in great detail. He has explained how sharia
law prohibits the payment of interest, but allows the sharing of risk.
As he has developed his case, I understand that the lessee in the
leases will be the Government. Will he explain to the Committee what
risk is to be shared when the lessee is a sovereign
Government?</div><a name="08061777000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000267"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. I will
come on to the issue of risks and returns, because one of the
challenges faced by the Government and the public sector in designing
these products is securing a degree of equivalence. The point that my
hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham highlighted under
clause 151(8) deals with the point of
equivalence.</div><a name="08061777000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
people who are seeking to invest, the bills must comply with sharia
law, and there must be some risks, which is why the underpinning of the
bills by assets is important. For example, on private finance
initiative contracts, the operator of the hospital bears some risks on
maintenance. The rental stream that they earn is offset by the costs
that they incur, so there is some risk. The risk might not be in
default&#151;the point to which my hon. Friend the Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge alluded&#151;because, on the whole,
Governments do not default on bills. However, some operational risk
underpins the element of risk in a sukuk bill. If there is no risk, I
am intrigued to find out why the Minister believes that the measure is
sharia compliant? That is an important point, so I should be grateful
if the Minister would make it clear and indicate what type of assets
will underpin a sukuk bill issuance? Will she explain what control will
be exercised over those assets? The special purpose vehicle will act as
the issuer of the bill, as I understand it from the consultation
document, and will use the proceeds to acquire the assets which are
going to be leased. Who will control the assets while they are owned by
the special purpose vehicle?</div>
<a name="08061777000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061777000268"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Hammond:</b> I am interested in the way in which my
hon. Friend is developing his theme. The clause provides for money to
be raised in sterling or in currencies other than sterling. Presumably,
if money were raised in a currency other than sterling, payments made
under the lease would have to be denominated in that currency. Is it
his understanding that the Government already have the power to make
such payments in a currency other than sterling, or are they taking
such power? Does he see some dangers to the Exchequer and loss to the
taxpayer in going down that
route?</div><a name="08061777000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000269"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. In their
response to the consultation document, the Government deal with the
issue of the denomination of the bonds and the payments under those
bonds, and they opt for sterling, notwithstanding my hon.
Friend&#146;s comments. The enabling clause that we are going to
debate in a moment gives them the power to vary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column732" />Column number: 732</div>between sterling and other currencies. If they make payments in other
currencies, we are exposed to exchange rate risk, which would have to
be
managed.</div><a name="08061777000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000270"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> This raises a number of important questions. First,
as it is likely that a large number of target investors for this type
of instrument are based in the middle east, there will be a demand for
a US dollar-denominated asset. It is by no means clear whether the UK
Debt Management Office in the Treasury would want those
dollar-denominated funds. I think we need some clarity as to whether
the UK as an issuer would want to keep the US dollar proceeds, or might
wish to swap them back into sterling. At the moment, as I am sure my
hon. Friend agrees, the whole thing is
unclear.</div>
<a name="08061777000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000271"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend is right. We need some clarity on
these matters, which is why I have taken the opportunity in our debate
on clause 151 to raise them, as it is important that we know what we
are going to approve later on.</div>
<a name="08061777000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The target
market for these bills raises an important issue. Having talked to a
number of people in the private sector who issue sharia-compliant
products, I understand that there is a significant number of such
products in the UK. They provide an alternative asset class in which to
invest, with the security that comes from being, in effect, a sovereign
issuer. There is a certain amount of such investment in the UK, and it
may well be the case that there are investors elsewhere who will seek
to take advantage of the market, including the City of London, which
takes a close interest in these issues and is keen to see London
develop as a wholesale market for those products, attracting money from
other jurisdictions. It may well be the case that, as the bill issuance
programme develops, there will be demand from people overseas.
Returning to the issue of denominations, it would be useful if the
Minister clarified the Government&#146;s thinking, and explained
whether they will seek to use the power to issue bills in currencies
other than sterling, and what further obligations that imposes on the
Debt Management
Office.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000272"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> This clause gives the Treasury the power by
regulation to make provision for raising money. Does my hon. Friend
know how much further opportunity for debate there would be in the
House of Commons, if the Treasury decided to take up the right to make
regulations? How would the regulations be debated? Would they have to
come before the House, or could the Treasury make them without further
reference to the
House?</div><a name="08061777000181"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="08061777000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000273"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I understand that, through either the affirmative
or the negative procedure, there will be an opportunity for the
regulations to be debated in the House. Of course, that process
includes a restriction, as the regulations are not amendable. As this
brief debate on clause 151 indicates, there are important issues to be
resolved, and different commentators have different views about the
applicability of the rules and how they would work in practice. We
would be prevented through either the affirmative or the negative
procedure from tabling amendments to flush out the Government&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column733" />Column number: 733</div>thinking, or to amend the regulations. In an area where there is so much
uncertainty and complexity, primary legislation is far better that
secondary
legislation.</div><a name="08061777000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
issue I sought to raise with the Exchequer Secretary, and which came
out of the consultation paper, was the cost of the bills to the
taxpayer. With conventional products, if there is a big bill issuance
programme, the liquidity of markets and people&#146;s familiarity
with those products help to reduce their price. However, unless there
is a sufficiently large issuance of sukuk bills, there is unlikely to
be sufficient liquidity in the market, thus the cost will increase.
Government recognise that on page 23 of their response, but they take
the view that the price differential would be short-lived. What
assessment have they made of the scale of issuance required to bring
the price of a sukuk bill in line with that of a conventional one? Will
the Exchequer Secretary elaborate on the Government&#146;s comments
on the impact of a sukuk product on the conventional bill market? The
Government suggest that the cost of that programme would build up to
about &#163;2 billion. Does the Exchequer Secretary think that that
will reduce the attractiveness of the conventional bill issuance
programme, and impair the liquidity of those
markets?</div><a name="08061777000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned earlier, in the context of the asset that would underpin the
sukuk bill, that there would be a special purpose vehicle, which would
issue the bonds and hold the lease to the asset. The consultation paper
rightly highlights the issue of who owns that vehicle. That goes back
to the comment by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
that the shareholder would ordinarily bear the risk. There is a
difficult interaction. Traditionally, shareholders bear the risk in
that situation, but under sharia law, holders of sukuk bonds need to
share that risk if the bond is to comply with sharia law. If the bond
holders bear the risk, they expect a higher return, which would make
the sukuk product more expensive for taxpayers than a conventional
bill. That gives rise to a challenge, because we could find ourselves
meeting the demand for sukuk products from retail and wholesale
markets, ending up with a bill issuance programme that incurs
additional costs for the taxpayer, because the rate of return is higher
to reflect the higher degree of risk faced by the sukuk bond
holder.</div><a name="08061777000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000274"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> My hon. Friend has studied the
Government&#146;s response carefully. Is it clear that the motive for
the programme is debt management? Is it clear that the Government will
proceed only if they can reduce the overall average cost of debt, or is
there some other motive that suggests that the Government might issue
the bills even if the cost is higher than that of conventional
finance?</div><a name="08061777000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000275"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My understanding of the Government&#146;s
response is that it is clearly their intention to ensure that the cost
of the sukuk bills is in line with that of conventional ones. It is
important for the Committee to understand how the Government intend to
get there, given the size of the bill issuance programme that they are
contemplating, and the need to ensure that the bills are compliant with
sharia law, which means that holders must participate in some of the
risk. There is a different level of risk for people who invest in an
asset and those invest in a sovereign issue, so I am keen to hear from
the Minister on that subject. These are important issues.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column734" />Column number: 734</div><a name="08061777000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another risk
arising from bills issued by the Government, as opposed to those issued
by others, is that, at the moment, a Government-backed bill attracts a
low-risk rating in terms of the capital resources required by a bank. I
expect that the Government intend to ensure that the risk attached to
sukuk bills is sufficiently low that any bank holding them is not
required to hold additional capital. That creates another tension,
because if these are meant to be risk-sharing bills to satisfy sharia
law, they must therefore have a higher risk than sovereign-issued
bills, and carry a greater capital requirement. I hope the Minister
understands that tension and will respond to it in her
remarks.</div><a name="08061777000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
earlier clause dealt with the way in which rules governing stamp duty
were being used by companies to avoid paying that duty.<b class="B"> </b>As I
understand section K of the consultation document, we are in danger of
imposing a double stamp duty. Stamp duty will be paid on the
acquisition of the asset underlying the lease, and when the lease is
sold back to the Government, there will be a further stamp duty charge.
That, too, will add to the cost of the measure. Will the Minister
clarify the Government&#146;s thinking? Are they content with a
double hit for stamp duty, or are they seeking to create a situation
whereby Government-backed transactions avoid that double charge? If
they can avoid such a charge, does that leave a window open for others
to exploit?</div>
<a name="08061777000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
conscious that I have spoken at some length on an enabling clause, but
I think it is an important topic for the Committee to debate. It raises
some challenging issues about the cost to the taxpayer of issuance of
this nature; about how it will be structured to minimise additional
capital requirements placed on banks seeking to hold these issues; and
about how we structure the measures correctly so that the right type of
assets are included in the underlying lease. It is important to raise
these issues now, when the Government are contemplating this as a
matter of principle, rather than simply waiting until the introduction
of secondary legislation, when we will get into the detail and the
mechanics of the
measure.</div><a name="08061777000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000276"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> May I echo many of the concerns raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Fareham and develop some of his arguments? I
totally agree with his points about the complexity of the issuance, the
potential cost to the taxpayer, and the question of what may, or may
not, happen to the non-sterling proceeds of the issuance. With your
permission, Mr. Cook, I should like to speak at some length,
because I have almost a decade&#146;s experience in Government bond
markets and related activities such as derivatives, structured notes
and so on, both in London and in New York.</div>
<a name="08061777000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to illustrate some of the dangers that the Government may face by
providing some examples from past Government issuances of structured
notes. There are two things at work in the clause. The first is the
Government&#146;s desire to encourage Islamic finance, which is
partly a political issue, but it partly a general and laudable
intention better to align investors and borrowers, which is part of the
well-functioning financial system of a proper financial
market.</div>
<a name="08061777000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000277"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman when he
is just getting into full flow. I look forward to the enlightenment he
will provide the Committee from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column735" />Column number: 735</div>his expertise in this area, but I was just wondering why he said that a
desire to promote Islamic finance was a political
desire?</div><a name="08061777000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000278"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I mean &#147;political&#148; not in a party
political sense, but purely in the sense that, almost by necessity,
what all Governments do is something political; it is an aspect of
public
policy.</div><a name="08061777000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second question&#151;and this should be a separate question&#151;is
whether the Government should propose that they themselves act as an
issuer of a sharia-compliant security, which is effectively a
structured note. Traditionally, the United Kingdom, in common with most
other western G7 countries, has avoided becoming an issuer of this kind
of structured note and finance for reasons which, as I shall explain,
have absolutely nothing to do with sukuk or sharia law. I think we need
to have a genuine debate about that: it is not just about Islamic
finance, but whether the UK Government should become an issuer of
structured notes in general, and of sukuk in particular.</div>
<a name="08061777000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
explain what a structured note issuer is in due course, but that is
what we are proposing in the vaguely worded schedule 46. Although the
Government&#146;s intention is to legislate for sukuk issuance, the
rules as they stand would allow the issuance of almost anything, as
long as it did not have what the bond market calls a coupon, which is
an interest payment. Many dangers arise for the UK, not just
operationally, but for our standing as one of the world&#146;s
best-reputation borrowers in the market.</div>
<a name="08061777000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sukuk,
however we want to look at it, is a form of structured note issuance.
It might not belong to the structured notes that grew up in the 1980s
and 1990s, when coupons were linked to all kinds of exotic indices and
so on, but it is nevertheless structured in a way that determines that
those issues are highly unlikely to be liquid, or to be transparent in
their pricing. Structured notes are tailor-made bonds or other
securities tailor-made for the requirements of an investor, where the
cash flows are not typically the kind of liability sought by the
issuer. Clearly, Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the Debt
Management Office would not normally like to have such a liability on
their cash flow. I am not an expert in the narrow, specialist field of
Islamic finance, but know rather a lot about structured note issuance.
It seems highly unlikely that the Debt Management Office would want to
keep the sukuk cash flow on the books, as that would lead, almost
inevitably, to a derivative transaction especially, as my hon. Friends
the Members for Fareham and for Runnymede and Weybridge have pointed
out, if the cash flow is denominated in another currency.</div>
<a name="08061777000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Minister to provide information and explain whether she expects the
Debt Management Office to swap the proceeds. Typically, that would be
into some kind of sub-LIBOR funding, which would provide cheaper
financing for the Government in theory, but with a number of risks
attached, which I shall discuss. So far, the debate on sukuk has
focused largely on the needs of investors. I want to talk about the
UK&#146;s reputation as a borrower in the market, which is absolutely
vital, especially at a time when our volume of issuance&#151;our
volume of borrowing&#151;is going up all the time. The reputational 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column736" />Column number: 736</div>risk to the UK could be considerable if we take the route that proposed
in clauses 151 and 152, and in schedule 46.</div>
<a name="08061777000182"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08061777000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the Government have taken on the role of providing sharia-compliant
investments, the UK&#146;s interests as a sovereign borrower have
taken second place in the debate. Sovereign borrowers behave in
particular ways in the market. Generally, they behave in a conservative
manner, and with good reason: they have reputations and triple-A
ratings to preserve. Sometimes in the past they have got things
wrong&#151;not, thankfully, in the United Kingdom, but I shall use as
an example the Kingdom of Belgium Ministry of Finance, which got into
awful trouble about 15 years about by entering into all kinds of
structured finance in which it really should not have become involved.
It bet a huge amount of taxpayers&#146; money&#151;tax
proceeds&#151;on further exchange rate mechanism convergence, at a
time when Belgium was already dependent on ERM convergence.
Essentially, it bet the bank on that, and the whole thing went
pear-shaped in 1992 and 1993 when the ERM blew apart.</div>
<a name="08061777000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was an
enormous cost to the Belgian taxpayer&#151;not just the pure cost but
the damage to Belgium&#146;s reputation as a borrower. I am using
Belgium as an illustration, but the position is not exactly the same
for the UK, because it will probably swap the proceeds from the sukuk
issuance back into sub-LIBOR funding. However, a severely negative
impact on one&#146;s reputation as a borrower if one is careless, if
not slightly cavalier, in one&#146;s approach to the capital markets
could be very telling. The people who made all the money out of the
Belgian fiasco were not the Belgian taxpayers who were forced to foot
the bill, nor the Kingdom of Belgium Ministry of Finance, which was the
issuer, but the banks.</div>
<a name="08061777000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the time,
there were investment bankers in London who, at the end of each year,
would calculate three figures: first, how much the Kingdom of Belgium
Ministry of Finance had lost that year in its structured finance
transactions; secondly&#151;tongue in cheek&#151;the cost that that
caused to the Belgian taxpayer; and thirdly, the likely impact on their
bonus for that year. I cannot remember the exact figures,
Mr. Cook, but they were astronomical. It was the Belgian
taxpayer who ended up footing the bill. The damage to Belgium continued
for some
time.</div><a name="08061777000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000279"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am listening with fascination to the story my
hon. Friend is recounting. This is clearly in large part an issue of
scale. Can he indicate what proportion of the Kingdom of
Belgium&#146;s debt is raised in this structured finance form? Will
he suggest that the Minister might like to tell us whether the
Government have any ideas about the proportion of sharia-compliant debt
that would be safe to have in the overall mix to prevent the problems
he is talking
about?</div><a name="08061777000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000280"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> On the second question, I am unable to provide an
answer. On the first question, it was not the Kingdom of Belgium that
issued structured notes or raised finance in that way. The Kingdom of
Belgium essentially betted the bank on off-balance sheet derivative
transactions that were structured in a not dissimilar way 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column737" />Column number: 737</div>to how the structured note market works, often with similarities to
sukuk, which I shall come on to later. I was using that as an example
to show how a sovereign borrower, not in this case in an example of
borrowing, could suffer a very negative impact to its reputation and
triple-A credit rating.</div>
<a name="08061777000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example at the time, perhaps even more relevant in the issuance of
structured notes, was that of the US Government agencies. They were all
effectively part of the US Government&#151;Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
the federal home loan bank system&#151;which were all triple-A rated
and going directly into the issuance of structured notes. A lot of
these would have extremely exotic structures.</div>
<a name="08061777000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face
of it, the investor would get a triple-A rated US Government risk,
denominated in US dollars&#151;all the same things that we are
talking about here today with regard to the sukuk issuance to a UK
domestic issuer. However, the coupon or payout on the bond would be
linked to an exotic index, quite often a currency exchange rate. It
might have been linked, for example, to the deutschmark-peseta exchange
rate. Essentially, the investor would be paid a very high coupon in
return for taking the risk on an exotic index. It might have been an
index of commodity prices, for example. It might have been oil-linked
bonds, which I think are going on today. My point is that structured
notes have been around for a long time. The sukuk, although having a
different motivation and philosophical basis, will have a similar
structure.</div>
<a name="08061777000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">What happened
with the federal home loan bank issued bonds? They were all triple-A
rated, issued by a sovereign or quasi-sovereign entity into the
domestic market, denominated in US dollars. One could not imagine a
more perfect and easy investment for a US domestic investor.
Unfortunately, most of the bonds went wrong because the bet that was
inherent in the structuring of the bond ended up being wrong. A large
number of people in the United States in the early to mid-1990s thought
that they had a perfectly safe, triple-A-rated Government investment
that would pay a high coupon, but it ended up paying them almost
nothing. One might even see parallels with CDOs and CMOs in the US. One
could say, &#147;So what? The investors should have been aware of
what they were getting into and instead followed a buyer beware
policy.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061777000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">My only point
is that in this case it was not the damage to the reputation of those
selling that kind of instrument&#151;the investment banks&#151;that
was particularly severe, but the damage to the reputation of the issuer
or borrower, which in that case was the federal home loan bank system,
also known as the US Government. That reached a particular height in
1995, when an investor called the US army facilities management fund
had been investing in a huge number of those securities, which were
issued by a separate part of the US Government. The bonds that were
issued ended up paying absolutely no coupon at all. The US army
facilities management fund was at that time a short-term money market
fund driven essentially by post-cold war base closures, and all that
those responsible for it had to do was park the proceeds into the money
markets until the end of the financial year. However, for reasons only
known to them and the investment bank advisers, they decided to bet the
proceeds of that on the market through structured note issuance
generally issued by the federal home loan 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column738" />Column number: 738</div>bank, which is a different part of the Government. When that reached the
front page of <i class="I">The Wall Street Journal</i>, the real damage was done
not to the US army, but to the federal home loan bank system as an
issuer of those notes, and that greatly concerns
me.</div>

Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): This has been an
interesting discussion of an area of policy with which, I must admit, I

Gentleman&#146;s points to the issue. Is he suggesting that there is
some risk that the British Government might use tools of this kind as a
means of raising funds? Some of his examples suggest that that is his
concern. Surely that is a matter of public policy, rather than a point
about the precise content of the Bill. Or is he concerned about the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000282"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises some interesting
questions. I think that it is a mixture of all of those. The Financial
Secretary told us earlier that those products will be extremely
complex&#151;I think she described them as &#147;uncharted
territory&#148;. I am suggesting that the UK, as a sovereign issuer
of debt, should be extremely careful before getting into that uncharted
territory. Secondly, I do not believe that the Islamic or Muslim
communities in this country would be the real winners in this or that
those lobbying for it have been purely from those communities. Among
the biggest lobbyists for such issuance have been the banks, and I
believe that that is because the products will be very complex, as the
Financial Secretary has already agreed. The big winners from this kind
of issuance are likely to be my former colleagues who work in
activities related to the Government debt market and in structured
derivatives.</div>
<a name="08061777000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000283"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The issue of the regulation of those products will
be pursued separately, because that would be an obligation on the
Financial Services Authority. We are debating the mere availability of
products of this kind within the UK. I leave it to the Financial
Secretary to respond, but I assume that, were they to be available,
they would be regulated in the normal way so as to protect against any
damage to the reputations of both the investors and the wider financial
community. The hon. Gentleman, however, may have other
assumptions.</div><a name="08061777000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000284"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, but
history shows that it is extremely difficult to regulate structured
note markets, partly because they are so lacking in transparency. It is
difficult to price that kind of thing. Often a structured note could
only be priced by three people in the world: the person at JP Morgan,
the person at Morgan Stanley, and the person at the Union Bank of
Switzerland. I have not been able to study the precise structure of
sharia-compliant instruments, but, in my view, there is an extreme
risk, because the banks are likely to be taking a large amount of money
out of those products. Let me take you back to the example in the
&#146;90s of the federal home loan bank system, Mr.
Cook.</div>
<a name="08061777000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061777000285"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): Does the hon. Gentleman agree
that the vagueness of the regulations and the schedule associated with
them allow very few people, and yet almost anybody, to be involved? The

<div class="Column"><a name="Column739" />Column number: 739</div>clause may provide for the involvement of people and for a person to be
able to be specified as a body corporate&#151;a company possibly
formed only for the purposes of raising money through alternative
finance arrangements and maybe independent of the
Treasury.</div><a name="08061777000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000286"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful
point about some of the dangers. As he rightly pointed out, both the
clause and the schedule are extremely vague. It sounds like the sort of
company that might be set up under the regulations would not be
dissimilar to a special-purpose vehicle, the like of which has been in
the news a lot in the past year. Such a vehicle could issue things like
collateralised debt obligations or collateralised mortgage obligations,
a large number of assets are parked into a vehicle and the ensuing cash
flow out of the other side is what the investor gets. To my mind, there
are a lot of similarities between the two
products.</div><a name="08061777000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the federal home loan banks&#146; issuance in the 1990s, there would
typically be a small issuance&#151;which I think we are likely to be
talking about with these sukuk bonds&#151;&#151;of, say, $25
million in principal. I clearly recall being on the trading floor when
one of those $25 million structured notes was issued. The
bank in question, which I worked for, was proud of itself for having
taken a million dollars out of the transaction. That was, and still is,
a very lucrative part of finance, and the bank did incredibly
well.</div><a name="08061777000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finance
profits from complexity, especially from instruments of extreme
complexity, where the number of people who can price them can be
counted on one hand. Who were the losers in that? After the ensuing
swap transaction, the federal home loan banks ended up with sub-liable
funding&#151;quite nice funding&#151;of probably liable minus 25,
which was very attractive compared with the plain vanilla bond that the
federal home loan banks could have issued. The real loser was, of
course, the
investor.</div><a name="08061777000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the investor had been in a position the next day to put a call in and
seek evaluation of that bond independently&#151;regrettably, for the
bank concerned, years later that happened&#151;they would have been
surprised to find that the valuation the next day, even before the bond
had settled, was only 96 instead of their principal of 100, because the
bank had taken 4 per cent. out of the transaction. I think that that is
the kind of thing that we have to be extremely careful of with
structured notes. We may say &#147;buyer
beware&#148;&#151;whoever bought that bond should have been
aware&#151;but here we are talking about the issuer being the United
Kingdom Government, which is where my major concerns come in as a
politician rather than as a
banker.</div><a name="08061777000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
face a reputational risk if we are the issuer of this kind of financial
instrument. Sukuk bonds are fine in principle and we want to encourage
Islamic finance. As I mentioned earlier, the Government should have an
interest in combining matching investors with issuers. Nevertheless, if
it would lead to reputational risk for the United Kingdom Government as
the issuer of the securities, we need to debate this more clearly. Bear
in mind, sometime afterwards the investment bank, or whatever it is
that sold the security in the first place, will have long disappeared,
but the name left on the piece of paper&#151;that sukuk
bond&#151;will be the United Kingdom Government.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column740" />Column number: 740</div><a name="08061777000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
pointing out that there are not that many triple-A sovereign borrowers
left: the United Kingdom, Germany, France and, despite the problems in
the &#146;90s that I described, the United States, are all triple-A
sovereign borrowers. It is not impossible for a sovereign borrower to
be downgraded. Fifteen years ago it would have been inconceivable that
Japan could be rated anything lower than triple-A, but it is now a
double-A minus rated sovereign
issuer.</div><a name="08061777000183"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08061777000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061777000287"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I have listened to my
hon. Friend and it has been hugely instructive, but his examples were,
in many cases, assets that were sub-prime, so the underlying assets
were at risk and the Government were effectively layering their
triple-A security on top of sub-prime assets. What I am not clear about
in what the Government are doing and where their argument is going is
in respect of where the risk lies with the underlying assets such as
with the Federal Homes Association&#151;Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and
so on&#151;and as we have seen recently in the sub-prime
market.</div><a name="08061777000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000288"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The answer is twofold. First, at least according to
the Bill and the two clauses with the schedule, it is impossible to
know. It sounds like property might be implied. It says it includes
land, but it is not any clearer than that. It sounds to me as though
almost anything could be put into that vehicle. The bigger risk, in my
view, is that the investor will end up with a pretty raw deal because
the bank is highly likely to take out a large amount of money in the
middle and we could end up with investors who are very angry with the
UK Government, which is something we ought not enter into
lightly.</div><a name="08061777000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Traditionally,
sovereign issuers such as the UK and the Debt Management Office, have
been very conservative borrowers. There is a good reason for that.
Reputational risk is extremely important in the markets, especially
with an issuer like the UK Government, who are about to start issuing
rather a lot more gilts and other instruments than in the past. It is
vital that we preserve their reputation. The reputation of the UK
Government as an issuer in the sovereign bond market is likely to be at
risk if we go down the road of issuing structured notes in general and
sukuk bonds in particular. The clauses in the schedule in front of us
allow us as a Government not only to issue sukuk, but to issue pretty
much anything, so long as it does not pay a coupon and does not pay
interest. It may even be collateralised on sub-prime assets, which was
another point made. I think we should pause, debate what we are looking
at here and be careful that what we are getting into is in the best
interests of the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="08061777000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000289"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I found that extremely interesting and I defer to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s expertise. I was for some years a
country-risk analyst and sovereign-debt analyst for the Economist
Intelligence Unit, so I am very aware of mistakes that Governments can
make across the world and I can assure him that it is not our intention
to do anything remotely similar to the examples he gave. We have not
decided whether to issue a sovereign sukuk, we will only do so if we
think it is in the overall interests of the UK, including value for
money for the UK 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column741" />Column number: 741</div>taxpayer. We would not issue something that we knew had a significant
risk premium or had any likelihood of affecting our credit
rating&#151;we would have no interest at all in proceeding down that
route.</div><a name="08061777000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061777000290"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): During the speech by the
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, the Minister intervened to ask
what he meant by the Government having a political motivation, which he
then clarified. Is there a political motivation in what the Government
are seeking to do in this field? Do they see potential diplomatic or
cultural benefits from going down this
path?</div><a name="08061777000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000291"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> No, not necessarily, and that is not the reason we
are doing it. I was going to come on to our motivation, because it is
important. There are two motivations, one more important than the
other. The first and most important is that entering these uncharted
waters, as I happily said previously, will enshrine the City of London
as an international centre of expertise in issuing sukuk, both
sovereign and
corporate.</div><a name="08061777000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000292"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Does the hon. Lady at least concede that the
question of whether the City of London takes a lead on Islamic finance
is a different question from that of the UK Government as an issuer of
sukuk
bonds?</div><a name="08061777000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000293"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Of course, and it is because the City of London
already has a comparative advantage in this area and because deals
originating from all over the world are being done through London in
this area in the entirely private sector that we wish to give a fillip
to that, to the greatest extent that we can, by making the very clear
PR and economic point that this is something that the UK Government
recognise as important. We want to send out a marker that we wish it to
continue.</div>
<a name="08061777000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
an extremely important point here about the learning curve that we are
rightly being forced to climb to see whether this is in the national
interest. We are uncovering little issues here and there around the tax
and regulation system that affect not only a potential UK sovereign
issuance, but also the corporate issuances that routinely take place.
We feel that by working with the industry to address each of these
issues as they arise, we will create a more conducive atmosphere for
entirely private sector activity that leads to more jobs and greater
prosperity in the City of
London.</div><a name="08061777000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000294"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister mentioned that she was an analyst of
sovereign risk, so perhaps she might think back to the origins of most
of the important markets in London at the moment, such as the euro bond
market. All those are now centred in London and do extremely well. In
none of those cases was the UK Government the very first issuer of a
new product. Surely, she must see that we can easily separate the
future of the City of London from the role of HMG as a
borrower.</div><a name="08061777000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000295"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Of course, an enormous number of things happen in
the City of London that have not been done by Government, and we
welcome that. But there are other examples of innovative practices that
have started off in the public sector, such as methods of trading, for
example, IT systems. The point I would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column742" />Column number: 742</div>make to the hon. Gentleman, and more generally to his party, is that we
feel&#151;and there seems to be an extremely broad consensus out
there&#151;that the road we are currently travelling, which may or
may not eventually lead to a sovereign sukuk issuance, is likely to
help entrench London as the world&#146;s leading place for Islamic
finance. Given that a number of Islamic countries are currently
perceived as emerging markets, and so developing quite rapidly their
ability to issue corporate sukuk, we think there is huge potential here
to be tapped by London, and now is the time to do it, when our actions
could potentially
help.</div><a name="08061777000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000296"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister again for giving way. She is
being generous. Surely she must see that it will not enhance the
City&#146;s reputation at all if the bond issuance goes wrong and
investors end up out of pocket because the banks have taken too much
out of it. If investors have instruments priced at 98 or 99p in the
pound the next day, that is likely to do great damage to the reputation
of the City of London and that of the
Government.</div><a name="08061777000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000297"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> By definition, if a policy goes wrong, it is not a
good thing for the Government who have proposed that policy. That is
why we have not made a final decision. We will only do this if it is in
the broad interests of the British economy and the taxpayer and
demonstrates sufficient value for money. If we feel that, once
launched, a sovereign sukuk would not be able to attract a return that
was in our interest, we would not proceed. We have not got to that
point yet, and we need to get as far as we can before making that final
judgment. I have an enormous number of points to deal with, and would
like to make
progress.</div><a name="08061777000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
said that there were two main motivations for proceeding in this way,
and that the first and main motivation was the boost we felt it would
give to jobs and prosperity in the City of London. The secondary
motivation is that we feel it may indirectly help the development of
Islamic retail products&#151;for example, sharia-compliant high
street savings accounts&#151;if the outlet on the high street were
able easily to invest in sharia-compliant Treasury bills, therefore
ensuring that the entire investment chain is sharia
compliant.</div>
<a name="08061777000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would be
an indirect effect, based only on anecdotal evidence, but it fits with
our broader policy objective of ensuring that nobody in this country
should be denied access to conventional financial
products&#151;savings, insurance and so on&#151;simply because of
their faith. It is about having a level playing field for the
relatively small number of people who currently feel excluded because
of their faith, which is by no means all Muslims, it is important to
say. I hope that that answers the hon. Member for Taunton&#146;s
question. It is not our intention to attract a different class of
investor, or&#151;although there may be spin-off effects&#151;to
curry favour with a certain sector of society or certain countries
around the world. We have two aims and the first and most important is
economic, for the City of
London.</div><a name="08061777000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the time scale, as the hon. Member for Fareham made clear, we published
on 2 June the response to a consultation which did not include a final
decision on whether to proceed. There are a number of issues that have
not yet been resolved and some of the questions raised today involve
issues that have not yet been resolved, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column743" />Column number: 743</div>so while it is important to take the power in the legislation that is
before us, we will not proceed until we have been able to discuss these
issues more widely. The final regulations that are brought in, if
indeed we decide to proceed&#151;and I think this answers another
point that was raised&#151;will be subject to affirmative procedure
and so will be debated at that
point.</div><a name="08061777000171"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000298"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> To take the Minister back a moment, I have not
been following the emergence of this market as closely as my hon.
Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has, but she just said
that one of motives of the Government was not that of attracting a
different class of investor to UK Government securities. That surprises
me. I had always assumed that one of the motives for looking at this
initiative was the assumption that there was a class of potential
investor, potential buyers of UK Government securities, who felt
excluded from that market at present because of faith-based
restrictions on the products they could be involved with. That could
include domestically based investors as well as potential overseas
buyers of UK Government paper. Why does she not regard that as a
potentially beneficial avenue, a potentially beneficial source that
could be tapped by this
initiative?</div><a name="08061777000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000299"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> That is a very important point. As I said when I
discussed the indirect effects that could be positive and affect the
sharia-compliant retail market, it may be, for example, that a
sharia-compliant bank, or a bank offering sharia-compliant current
accounts or savings accounts to the British population might find it
useful to have the whole investment chain sharia-compliant. In that
sense, it will attract a different type of investor. I was thinking
more of whether we are trying to tap funds from the middle east and
extremely wealthy people who want to invest in sharia-compliant
securities. I would be delighted if they wanted to invest in UK plc and
they would be welcome to do so, but our research suggests that a
slightly higher return is required to guarantee that we would attract
that type of investor and we do not think it is in the UK
taxpayers&#146; interests to arrange a product specifically to
provide that kind of return. Of course, there is nothing in a
sharia-compliant sovereign issue that implies that one has to be a
sharia-compliant investor in order to buy it; we did not think it would
work because, if we had to offer a higher return in order to attract
some of the individuals I just referred to, everybody would want it and
so there would be distribution
problems.</div><a name="08061777000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
most important point is that we aim to ensure that when these products
are launched on the market, as far as the end user is concerned, they
look the same as any other T-bill. They are obviously structured in a
very different way, but we hope to structure it in the least
complicated way so that the sukuk, to the end user, does not look any
different in risk from a conventional T-bill. That is why we are not
going to go for extremely complicated products. I should clarify what I
mean by &#147;uncharted waters&#148;. We are in uncharted waters
because we have not done a sukuk sovereign issue before, but the actual
products we intend to launch, if we decided to proceed down this route
are not uncharted waters at all&#151;we are proposing a plain-vanilla
ijara structure of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column744" />Column number: 744</div>the kind that is widely traded internationally and so would not have the
potential for margin-grabbing from the institutions and banks that, as
the hon. Gentleman mentioned, could take an enormous amount out of it.
Our intention is that the products should be completely understood by
the market and should have the same risk rating as any other sovereign
issue. The British Government are rightly proud of their triple-A
rating in that
regard.</div><a name="08061777000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061777000300"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I wish I could share the Minister&#146;s
confidence that she will avoid banks trying to take out too large a
margin from these transactions. The language she is using highlights
the dangers here. She was talking about how the bills would look
conventional. That is what has happened in the past: people have bought
into products where the issuer was a triple-A rated Government.
Denominated in their own currency, they looked as safe as houses, but
turned out to be anything but. The Minister talked about easily
tradable securities. The Government expected a rolling market of about
&#163;2 billion in principle of those securities. One of
the answers to their consultation said that in order to guarantee a
liquid issue, they would need a principle probably in excess of
&#163;1 billion. Is she envisaging a large number of pieces of
&#163;25 or &#163;50 million, or does she envisaging one or two big
benchmark issues of &#163;1 billion? That will make an enormous
amount of difference to the likely success of the measure, and
especially&#151;to return to a point that I made&#151;to the
reputation of the UK as a
borrower.</div>

decided. We are holding a consultation about the nature of a programme
of issuance. We think that it would be about &#163;2 billion in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000127"></a>Mr.

Government&#146;s position, but there are many ifs and buts, and a
great deal of uncharted water. She has said: &#147;We have not made a
decision on that; we are delegating it to regulations and we will bring
it in when we think it is in the national interest.&#148; Would it be
better not to introduce anything at this stage, and come back next year
when Ministers have made a decision? The measure could be debated in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000128"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman thinks that I am
confusing him. I am attempting to create some clarity and light amid
some rather large questions that were raised this morning, and I will
do so for as long as it takes. We thought it was simply sensible
government to take the power in this year&#146;s Finance Bill.
Obviously, if we decide not to proceed with a Government sukuk
issuance, that power will not be used. We have not yet decided whether
to proceed; we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column745" />Column number: 745</div>have said that we will decide&#151;or at least give an
update&#151;by the time of the next pre-Budget report. If the
Opposition wish to oppose the taking of that power, I advise them not
to do so, given the huge consensus of support in the City of London for
our proceeding as fast as possible. I will continue to attempt to shed
as much light as possible on the matter, in the hope that that will
reassure the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08061786000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000129"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I was not trying to imply that the Minister was
confusing; I was just saying that the legislation is confusing. I
understand that, if the measure is put into practice, it will go
through the affirmative statutory instrument process. The problem with
that is that we cannot amend it: we have to accept or reject it. That
is one of the disadvantages of not doing this through primary
legislation.</div><a name="08061786000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000130"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> If the hon. Gentleman thinks, either at this
stage, or at that later stage, that we are not doing the right thing
for Britain, he is within his rights to reject it. I must say, however,
that given that the Debt Management Office routinely issues Treasury
bills, on a minute-by-minute basis&#151;that is a completely standard
procedure&#151;the idea that we have to debate every single change on
the Floor of the House in great detail, together with the ability to
amend the measure, could be destabilising. We think that we have done
it right: we are having a debate now, and if we decide to proceed, the
regulations will be laid according to the affirmative procedure. We are
consulting in the open as fully as we possibly
can.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000131"></a>Mr.

<a name="08061786000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000132"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am conscious of the fact that I have an enormous
number of questions to answer, so I will give way to the hon.
Gentleman, then move on to another
question.</div><a name="08061786000115"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000133"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister referred to the importance of the
issuance for the development of the retail market in the UK. What
assessment has she made of the appetite for a &#163;2 billion
issuance? Are there enough savings in the UK market to absorb bills of
that extent, or does she expect that some of these bills will be sold
to overseas investors?</div>
<a name="08061786000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000134"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We do not mind who buys Treasury bills. We do not
think that there will be any lack of appetite for them, compared with
other products. One reason why we decided to proceed with a
consultation on T-bills, rather than larger gilts, is that we believe
that they will be even more liquid, and that demand is extremely well
established. I do not know whether that answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question.</div>
<a name="08061786000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000135"></a>Mr.
Hoban</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="08061786000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000136"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I feel as if I am going up and down like a yo-yo.
I will give way to the hon. Gentleman one last time, and then I will
make
progress.</div><a name="08061786000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000137"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister has not answered my question. What I
seek to understand is what appetite there is among existing UK-based
Islamic retail financial organisations for an issuance of about
&#163;2 billion. Is there &#163;100 million in savings out there to
be invested in the bills, or is it &#163;2 billion,
&#163;3 billion or &#163;4 billion?  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column746" />Column number: 746</div>The Government talk about a &#163;2 billion issuance programme. It is
important to know what appetite in the institutions the measures aim to
help and develop.</div>
<a name="08061786000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000138"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> It is entirely up to those institutions whether
they wish to purchase Government Treasury bills and invest in them. We
have not taken the &#163;2 billion and disaggregated it; it is
entirely up to the market, which is extremely liquid. We have examined
the amount of issuance required to achieve sufficient liquidity to
ensure that the bills can be traded easily, as well as demand among
investors, which is how we came up with the figure &#163;2 billion,
but it would not be right to set a target for the proportion that
should come from Islamic retail institutions as opposed to the broader
investor base which, thankfully, would happily invest in a large number
of Government securities whether they were sharia-compliant or not.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am going to make
progress.</div><a name="08061786000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked about foreign currency issuance. It is right that we have
taken powers to make payment in foreign currency, but we have no
intention of issuing any sukuk not denominated in sterling. We are
taking the power more broadly, simply to mirror the provision in the
National Loans Act 1968 that gives the Treasury the power to borrow in
foreign currency. To put it in context, the Treasury issued a five-year
US dollar bond in 2003, but it has not issued bonds denominated in a
foreign currency since then, and we have no intention of doing so in
that area. It is simply a matter of legal
consistency.</div><a name="08061786000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original question posed at the beginning of this debate was how we
would ensure sharia compliance. As our consultation document says,
there are a number of ways for institutions to ensure the sharia
compliance of similar securities. They can use a board of
internationally recognised scholars appointed by a bank or other
institution; their own board of internationally recognised scholars; or
an internationally recognised Islamic standard-setting institution such
as the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial
Institutions or the Islamic Financial Services Board.</div>
<a name="08061786000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not
decided which of those that we will use, but it is obviously in our
complete and manifold interest to ensure that the security, if and when
we launch it in the market, is perceived as sharia compliant. We will
take advice from legal firms and investment banks if we pursue that
route on issuance. It is standard practice for advisory firms to
approach sharia scholars on behalf of their client, which in this
instance would be the Government. We will make our procedure entirely
clear.</div><a name="08061786000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000139"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> What happens if the underlying asset in the vehicle
or company referred to in the schedule changes? Surely, that would
prompt another assessment of sharia compliance. What would happen if
the new assessment said that the bills were no longer sharia-compliant?
Presumably, the market would tank and the UK&#146;s reputation as a
borrower would again suffer a severe negative
impact.</div><a name="08061786000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000140"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I sometimes get the impression that the hon.
Gentleman is trying to talk the measures down. I am not sure that that
is in the national interest. I would be interested to know whether, if
we solve the problems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column747" />Column number: 747</div>that he identifies, he would be in favour of
proceeding&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The type of
asset has not been decided; it will be made publicly known once it is.
It will be sharia-compliant, so if we decide to rotate what is in the
special purpose vehicle, we will not put anything into it that is not
sharia compliant, for precisely the reason that he mentioned. We have
no incentive to get into that
situation.</div><a name="08061786000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of assets, there has been understandable uncertainty about
who will own the asset in the ijara structure if we decide to issue a
Government sukuk. The asset will remain on the Government&#146;s
balance sheet, and we will keep full control over whatever asset it is.
We are simply designing a legal construct that is sharia compliant.
Ownership or control of the asset will not be passed over to anybody
outside Government. It would not be in our interests to do
so.</div><a name="08061786000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
point relates to some of our earlier discussions about risk. The
measure involves risk sharing, in the sense that an asset is subdivided
and used to launch Treasury bills in the market that are backed by that
asset. We will not proceed if there is any additional risk. The risk
will be exactly the same as that for any other sovereign security that
is issued. The sharing comes from using a special purpose vehicle to
securitise and subdivide the asset so that there is more than one
holder. That is where the sharia-compliant sharing notion comes from. I
hope that that answers the questions asked by Opposition
Members.</div><a name="08061786000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue of a double charge for stamp duty land tax was raised. We are
aware of that issue, and we announced in the Budget that we will
address the problem in next year&#146;s Finance Bill after
consultation. The consultation document is due to be published on 26
June.</div><a name="08061786000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000141"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If that issue, which is important in structuring
the product, is to be addressed in next year&#146;s Finance Bill, why
can we not debate the measure in next year&#146;s Finance
Bill?</div><a name="08061786000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000142"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Because we thought it sensible to take the power
now. We wanted to demonstrate to the constituency with which we are
working that we are serious about doing this. We also wanted to
increase the opportunities for debate, which I would expect the hon.
Gentleman to
favour.</div><a name="08061786000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point was raised about whether the Debt Management Office will swap the
proceeds that it receives from any potential sukuk issuance. I have
said that we will undertake only sterling issuance, so the question of
swapping the proceeds back into sterling does not arise. I am advised
that the issuance of a sukuk will not require the use of swaps or other
derivatives. I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for Hammersmith
and Fulham even further. While we are in uncharted waters with the
possibility of the Government issuing a sukuk, it is not perceived as a
complicated product by the end
user.</div><a name="08061786000033"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000143"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Economic Secretary for her generosity
in giving way, and I accept her assurance that no swap or other
derivative transactions will be involved. May I take her back to some
of the costs of the issuance? I think that we are talking about
one-month, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column748" />Column number: 748</div>three-month and six-month Treasury bills, but there has been no
appreciation of the cost of setting up those issues. There is
presumably a certain cost in ensuring that they are sharia compliant.
There is a certain cost to the banks in structuring the issue. A fair
amount of cost will be involved in marketing the issues, at least for
the first few times. How can all those costs be built in, while still
making competitive one-month, three-month or six-month Treasury
bills?</div><a name="08061786000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000144"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> If we think that proceeding with this matter is
not in the overall interests of the taxpayer, we will not proceed.
However, I point out to the hon. Gentleman that there will be huge
reputational advantages if we manage to achieve this proposal. It will
attract significant business to the City of London, which will lead to
increased taxation
revenues.</div><a name="08061786000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the fundamental point that I made at the beginning of my
remarks: we will do this only if we feel that it is in the national
interest. We will proceed up to the point where we can have a full
understanding, both of all the benefits and costs and of any regulatory
changes that are required. When we have the legal basis for proceeding,
we will take a final judgment about whether it is something that a
sensible Government would do in the national interest. A preliminary
indication shows that the potential wider economic benefits are
substantial, which is why we are pushing this as far as it will
go.</div><a name="08061786000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000145"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> At what point does the Economic Secretary believe
that the cost to the taxpayer of this issuance, compared with other
issuances, becomes so great that it is not worth proceeding down this
route? There is a premium to be paid for these bills, which will fall
on the taxpayer. At what point does she think that it is not worth
proceeding, if there is a premium over conventional bill
issuance?</div><a name="08061786000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000146"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> As I have already said, we intend the bills to be
perceived by the market as conventional products or as near as possible
to that. As I have just said, we will make the value-for-money judgment
at the appropriate point and provide an update in the pre-Budget
report. I cannot quantify exactly what the relative cost-benefit
analysis is because we have not done it
yet.</div><a name="08061786000122"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000147"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am rather pleased that I have triggered a debate
on this issue. It has been interesting.</div>
<a name="08061786000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s response troubles me, because a large number of areas
have yet to be resolved, but the Minister is seeking in the Bill powers
to enable the Government to introduce resolutions to implement a sukuk
issuance programme. The work does not appear to have been done to
justify the economic benefit of such an issuance.</div>
<a name="08061786000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
began by saying that there were two benefits. The first was to signal
clearly to the wider market the importance of developing the UK as a
centre for sharia-compliant products. It would be good to see London
continue to lead the way, but I am not sure that the Government should
driving that through the issuance of products. I accept that the
Government have taken steps by presenting the third Finance Bill to
create a level playing field on tax matters. That is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column749" />Column number: 749</div>important, and the Government can continue to take the lead by enabling
such change, but that does not necessarily mean that we need to issue
sukuk bonds.</div>
<a name="08061786000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
argument made by the Government was about developing retail products,
but the Minister gave no indication that there is a significant retail
demand to justify a &#163;2 billion programme of issuance. She made
some important points about how we can review all sorts of regulatory
and tax issues along the way. I am sure that it will help to facilitate
the development of wholesale markets, but I do not think she persuaded
the Committee of the economic rationale and the benefits for the
taxpayer of pursuing that route. However, she expects us to give the
Government powers under this clause and schedule 46 to introduce
secondary legislation to facilitate the issuance.</div>
<a name="08061786000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
important points to be made about the structure and the use of
scholars. This is a fraught issue, and I have spoken to a number of
private sector providers who have tried to structure products with the
help of scholars. They got quite a way down the route, but were then
been refused permission, or did not receive agreement from the scholars
that those would be sharia-compliant products. It is important to
understand how the Government will seek to validate these products as
sharia-compliant, as significant issues are attached to the
measure.</div>
<a name="08061786000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
uncomfortable that the Government have not made much progress. The
Minister spoke about using legislation in the Finance Bill 2009 to
correct the issue of double-hitting stamp duty, which suggests that the
Government could have waited until 2009 to introduce the provision and
have a proper detailed discussion in advance, so that we, as
Parliamentarians, knew what it was we were going to pass into
law.</div><a name="08061786000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000171"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> One might say that we are going from the sublime
to the ridiculous. This part of the Bill is entitled
&#147;Miscellaneous&#148;, and now we discover why. Clause 152 is
headed &#147;Power of Treasury to make payments&#148;. Some of us
might have thought that the Treasury already had power to make
payments; it certainly seems to have been doing so for some time. It is
a parliamentarian&#146;s delight: wonderfully obscure language. We
are going to deal with a situation</div>
<a name="08061786000116"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where a
financial claim relates to...a case where money is paid into a
government account, but the money should not have, or need not have,
been paid into that account, or...a case where money should have
been, or needed to be, paid out of a government account, but the
money...was not paid out of that account, or...was paid out
of that account, but not as it should have been, or...needed to
be,
paid.&#148;</div><a name="08061786000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000172"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Might one of those examples be when all those
pensioners sent the then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, cheques in
the post for 74p, or however little the rise in pension was that
year?</div><a name="08061786000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000173"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, and I
was going to go on to ask the Minister to explain just what the issue
is here. One can easily conjure up visions of somebody discovering in
the Treasury that decades&#151;perhaps centuries&#151;after
practice began, payments were made that were not properly authorised to
be made, or receipts were paid in that should not have been paid in.
This is billed as a tidying-up exercise but we clearly need to
understand what lies behind it. We are told that there have been cases
where types of claims could not be paid under the Treasury&#146;s
existing powers, and we are invited to believe that amounts that might
have been paid out were not able to be paid out. Clearly something has
triggered the clause; something has happened that has drawn attention
perhaps to a problem that has existed for a very long time but has only
now become
apparent.</div><a name="08061786000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does slightly conjure up the tantalising suggestion that amounts that
have been paid erroneously into Government accounts have been trapped
there for very long periods. Is there some huge pot of money that we
are not aware of, indeed perhaps comprised of all the
pensioners&#146; cheques&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
The hon. Member for Taunton is right. I do hope so. I spend a great
deal of my time looking, largely in vain, for huge pots of money hidden
somewhere in the Government accounts. Generally what I find is that
detailed exploration yields huge black holes that were previously
undiscovered, rather than huge pots of
money.</div><a name="08061786000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000174"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I wish the hon. Gentleman well in his ongoing
searches, but I invite him to speculate that the clause may be helpful
for the Government as they seek to untangle the mass of tax credits
that have been erroneously paid in or out of the various accounts of
private
individuals.</div><a name="08061786000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000175"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The hon. Gentleman may be right and it may be
that the Economic Secretary will tell us that it is the tax credit
debacle and fiasco that is at the root of the problem. It might be
better if I now listen to her and then
respond.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column751" />Column number: 751</div><a name="08061786000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000176"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am sorry to disappoint both the hon. Member for
Taunton and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, but the need
for the legislation is not as a result of either of the issues that
they have raised. The best way to characterise it is possibly as
&#147;a bank error in our favour&#148; which can then be returned,
but the issue does not relate to an amount of money that is in error
transferred into a Government account, or indeed in error transferred
by anyone to anyone involving the Government estate, which can be
returned. There has simply been an odd anomalous historical situation
where, let us say, due to a processing error, a large amount of money
has been transferred into a Government account by mistake, noticed,
rectified and sent back perhaps the next day. If it is a large amount
of money, obviously we would have garnered some interest as a result of
it remaining in our account overnight. In some circumstances, there has
been no mechanism for that interest to be paid back to the person it
belongs to. The reason we are addressing the matter now is
that&#151;</div><a name="08061786000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000177"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08061786000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000178"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Mid-sentence? All right, go
on.</div><a name="08061786000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000179"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am sorry, I thought it was a semi-colon. The
example the Minister just gave may not be a vast amount of money for an
individual citizen, but it would nevertheless impact on people who have
wrongly had their tax credits transferred to the Government in a way
that has been unfavourable to them and who have had to wait before
being
reimbursed.</div><a name="08061786000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000180"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am not in any way implying that the amounts
involved in tax credit overpayments are insignificant for the
individuals involved. The complete answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question is that the normal HMRC revenue-raising and
disbursement operations are not covered by the proposal before us
today; it tends to be large institutions or anything involving a bank
transfer that we are dealing with. It goes potentially wider, but the
proposal does not cover the individual benefit payments that he rightly
raises.</div><a name="08061786000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure before us is simply to create for the public sector an
arrangement that already exists in the private sector. If there is
&#147;a bank error in your favour&#148; between banks, there is a
protocol between banks for resolving the interest payments that land in
one institution when they should be in another. There is not a similar
protocol within the public sector for simple historical reasons. I was
asked, &#147;Why now?&#148; We have had a number of ad hoc cases.
By definition, the problem is arising in the private sector&#151;it
is giving us money by mistake. It is simply a clerical error and we are
giving it back immediately.</div>
<a name="08061786000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would love
to go into details, but obviously it is commercially confidential and
would lead to all sorts of excitement if I start explaining which bank
has done what. It is not an enormous amount. A couple of cases recently
have prompted us to see whether we can work in a more sensible way.
There is no Exchequer cost, because, by definition, we were not
expecting those amounts to come into the public sphere, so there was no
budget for them. The measure before us simply enables us to have a
vires for making payments from central 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column752" />Column number: 752</div>funds in order to solve those problems, rather than opening ourselves up
to the risk of having to resolve the matter in court, which would lead
to an unnecessary legal cost and be a waste of taxpayers&#146; time.
We can do that relatively simply by updating our provisions
here.</div><a name="08061786000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000181"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I have two questions. First, implicit in what the
Economic Secretary is saying is that this situation has existed for a
long period, it was not considered to be material such that it needed
to be addressed, and now it has come to be considered material. Does
that imply a change in the frequency or magnitude of such errors,
because clearly that is the implication? Secondly, although she gave a
clear explanation, I think that the whole Committee&#151;I hope it is
not only me&#151;will be dependent upon her explanation, because what
is written in the Bill could have much wider ramifications. Will she
confirm that this is only about the repayment of interest on amounts
inadvertently or erroneously transferred and that it goes no
wider?</div><a name="08061786000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000182"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Yes, I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that it
goes no wider than that. With regard to why now, I do not know, but it
happens that there have been a cluster of occasions when we have had to
consider how to pay back the interest from erroneous bank errors in our
favour. We have been able to resolve each of them case by case in
rather convoluted ways, but the energy required to do so made us think
that we should perhaps make life easier for ourselves, so there is no
secret agenda to pay money to anyone. With regard to HMRC, I should
probably add that it has ex gratia powers to settle such claims, and it
is only the central Exchequer accounts that do
not.</div><a name="08061786000089"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000183"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Will the Economic Secretary explain the scale of
those recent errors? There might have been only a few, but if they are
due to IT failures it is important to know whether massive amounts of
money were transferred. I know that she mentioned commercial
confidentiality, but surely she could tell us how many millions of
pounds are
involved.</div><a name="08061786000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000184"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I want to respect commercial confidentiality, but
it is probably all right for me to say that the amounts transferred are
potentially very large and the interest tends to be tens of thousands
of pounds in the recent individual
cases.</div><a name="08061786000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000185"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I cannot let that pass without commenting that an
amount that has been transferred cannot be potentially very large: it
is either very large or it is not. It is probably fair to record that
the Economic Secretary has given the Committee the critical assurance
that this is narrowly focused and deals only with the specific issue of
interest in erroneous payments. That having been clarified, we have no
further
concerns.</div><a name="08061786000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000186"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The clause is linked to clause 152 and provides,
among other things, that any issue made under subsection (2) in respect
of a payment to be made under clause
152</div><a name="08061786000117"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
be recorded in the daily account under section 15(5) of the Exchequer

wonders whether it shall be recorded with a quill pen.</div>
<a name="08061786000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether there is something more significant here. The clause seems
rather long and detailed if all it does is tell us that any payments
made under clause 152 shall be recorded in the books of accounts.
Perhaps the Economic Secretary will clarify why it is necessary to have
this complicated mechanism set out in half a page for what I would have
thought could be done with three key strokes on a computer
somewhere.</div><a name="08061786000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000187"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The lesson that I have drawn from today&#146;s
debate is that while it was probably useful to have been in a former
life a sovereign risk analyst, perhaps I should also have had some
training in parliamentary counsel so as to be able to answer the
specific legal and drafting points that have arisen. Thankfully, we
have people to advise us, and I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that
all that clause 153 does is ensure that any payments that are made
under the new power to simplify things, as I have previously described,
are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as indeed
are any payments made by Government. Payments from these funds can
generally be made only for services specifically authorised by
Parliament via primary legislation, but the Treasury is obviously not
required to seek Parliament&#146;s separate approval for every single
payment made under the powers.</div>
<a name="08061786000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000188"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> There&#146;s an
idea.</div><a name="08061786000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000189"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We would be here for some time if that were the
case. Instead, the Treasury is required to seek the approval of the CAG
and his team, who check on Parliament&#146;s behalf that the Treasury
is making proper use of the powers to provide the right checks and
balances before payments are made, to enable the Treasury to make the
payments needed to meet the Government's obligations without undue
delay while ensuring that parliamentary control is not jeopardised.
Since it is the avoidance of undue delay in the accumulation of
interest that we are trying to achieve here, this is a sensible thing.
I am sure that the writing of things in a book is now being done
electronically, and if the hon. Gentleman wishes to know the exact
details, I will be happy to let him
know.</div><a name="08061786000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

to give statutory effect to
concessions</div><a name="08061786000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061786000190"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> This is a more substantive issue. The clause
introduces legislation enabling existing HMRC extra-statutory
concessions to be made into statutory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column754" />Column number: 754</div>provisions by the issuing of a Treasury order. In other words, tax law
will be made by statutory instruments rather than by primary
legislation. While statutory instruments are extremely useful and have
a role to play, particularly in this kind of detailed, technical
legislation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough pointed
out this morning, they have the major disadvantage of being
unamendable. The clause proposes that the Treasury or HMRC will be able
to propose that an existing extra-statutory concession be given
statutory effect with such amendments as they see fit, but Parliament
will not have any opportunity to add its own amendments, even, for
example, to remove Treasury or HMRC amendments so that the
extra-statutory concession is given statutory effect in the form in
which it has in fact operated for many
years.</div><a name="08061786000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Existing
extra-statutory concessions normally give relaxations in tax liability
to which taxpayers would not be entitled under a strict interpretation
of the wording of the legislation. They are usually introduced on the
grounds of fairness, where it has been discovered that an unintended
consequence arose, or for administrative simplicity, for example where
a class of taxpayer would have to be pursued for a trivial amount of
tax in a way that does not make any sense for anyone, or for
clarification of poorly drafted legislation.</div>
<a name="08061786000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
been effort in recent years increasingly to put extra-statutory
concessions into statute, mostly through the tax law rewrite process. I
am told that the famous example, much beloved of accountants, is the
Christmas party exemption, which is now enshrined in section 264 of the
Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, but previously had effect
as an extra-statutory concession. It could be called the
&#147;anti-Scrooge&#148; concession, and waives the usual
prohibition on tax-deductibility of entertaining expenses in the case
of reasonable entertainment of staff at Christmas.</div>
<a name="08061786000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
case in the House of Lords of R <i class="I">v</i>. Her Majesty&#146;s
Commissioners of Inland Revenue applied for by Adrian John Wilkinson,
it became apparent that HMRC&#146;s powers to make extra-statutory
concessions on the strict application of the law were not as wide as
had been understood. The case established that HMRC has discretion
under section 1 of the Taxes Management Act 1970</div>
<a name="08061786000118"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to formulate
policy in the interstices of the tax
legislation&#148;.</div><a name="08061786000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
it is not for me to criticise the judgment, I would have thought that
it would be for HMRC to interpret rather than to formulate policy in
the interstices of the tax legislation. The judgment goes on to say
that HMRC can formulate
policy</div><a name="08061786000119"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;dealing
pragmatically with minor or transitory anomalies, cases of hardship at
the margins or cases in which a statutory rule is difficult to
formulate or its enactment would take up a disproportionate amount of
Parliamentary
time.&#148;</div><a name="08061786000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
sometimes sits in Committee and is moved to wonder what a
disproportionate amount of parliamentary time would be. The judge
clearly thought that there was such a concept. Crucially, the judgment
established that HMRC&#146;s powers under section 1 of the Taxes
Management Act 1970 could not be
construed</div><a name="08061786000120"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;so
widely as to enable the commissioners to concede, by extra-statutory
concession, an allowance which Parliament could have granted
but&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column755" />Column number: 755</div><a name="08061786000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">had not granted. Since
Parliament could have granted anything, I take that to mean that an
extra-statutory concession cannot be used to give a concession to a
taxpayer that Parliament could reasonably have anticipated could have
arisen and that Parliament could have given but chose not to, because
either the Government or the Opposition of the day chose not to bring
forward such a concession. My layman&#146;s understanding is that
HMRC&#146;s powers are thus restricted to dealing with the
unforeseen, the unenvisaged, the trivial and the minor, rather than
creating any new significant provisions.</div>
<a name="08061786000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hopefully the
Minister will be able to give us an update, but I understand that HMRC
is reviewing the legality of all currently operational extra-statutory
concessions. The Committee will be interested to know how many of them
there are and whether HMRC still expects to complete that review in
autumn 2008. Since seasons in Government-speak often have a
non-intuitive meaning, for example the spring normally ends when
Parliament rises for the summer recess and the autumn 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column756" />Column number: 756</div>has been known to run till the Christmas recess, could the Minister
clarify, in calendar-speak, when we can expect that process to be
completed?</div><a name="08061786000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, the point is that extra-statutory concessions had become a
lazy answer to the problems of slack drafting and gaps in tax
legislation. To that extent, we acknowledge that clause 154 is a
practical measure to ensure that concessions relied on by taxpayers and
HMRC can be preserved. That is proposed to happen through a Treasury
order to give the concessions statutory effect. Therefore, they cease
to be extra-statutory concessions and become statutory provisions. Will
an extra-statutory concession that falls foul of the Wilkinson judgment
be able to be enacted under the clause? Clause 154 (2) defines an
&#147;existing HMRC concession&#148;. What if the concession was
ultra vires ab initio? I assume that that is the effect of concluding
that a concession contravened the provisions of the Wilkinson
judgment.</div>
