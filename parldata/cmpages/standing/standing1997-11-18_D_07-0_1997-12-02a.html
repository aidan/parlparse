<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) Provided that--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) no such notice as is mentioned in subsection (1) shall be issued to an undertaking with respect to the affairs of any individual customer of that undertaking; and<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) where such a notice is issued, the undertaking concerned, or such person as appears to the Bank to represent that undertaking, shall be afforded an opportunity to make representations to the Bank about the need to furnish the information specified in the notice.'.--[Mr. Boswell.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I am reminded of the story of the controversial lecturer at Salamanca university who, in the middle ages, incurred the wrath of the Inquisition and was put away for five years; he returned and immediately launched into his next lecture. It has not been five years since our last sitting, although it is a long time since we had a change of Chairman. We are pleased to see you back, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That point would have been out of order if my fellow Chairman had been wearing a hood this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall continue with my remarks and although they may not necessarily be grammatically correct, I hope that they will incorporate a continuity of thought.
<P>
When we concluded our proceedings this morning, we had just moved the amendment and I had said that its inspiration was the wit and wisdom of subsection 4(3) of the Bank of England Act 1946. I had recourse to the repeals part of the Bill and noted that that subsection is not being repealed. I wanted to ensure that the point had been made and to have the Economic Secretary's assurances on it because it is important and is one of a series of safeguards that we shall ask the Committee to consider and, if appropriate, accept. We are concerned--as, I am sure, were the inspirers of the 1946 Act--that the Bank, in its legitimate and necessary request for information, should not go on unnecessary fishing expeditions into the affairs of individuals.
<P>
The Economic Secretary will know that one of her colleagues has attracted some attention in the media, and I shall say only that while issues of principle should properly be raised, it would be an abuse of power if the Bank, with the connivance or under the instructions of the Chancellor, or on its own initiative, were to pry into the private relationship between any client and his banker--or, as it is now more widely worded, ``undertaking''--if it were not absolutely necessary for the compilation of information for the Bank. In terms of the compilation of proper statistics that would not normally be a problem, unless a strange bank or financial institution that had only one client were involved.
<P>
That is the first amendment that we propose. The second, which reinforces the first and reproduces the substance of the wording of the 1946 Act, sets out the need for the Bank to be prepared to consider representations, from an institution or undertaking with which it has dealings and from which it has requested information, about why it might be inappropriate to furnish that information. Those are reasonable safeguards--what the lawyers present would, I am sure, call natural justice--on how matters should be handled. They are designed to prevent the Bank from being--I am not saying that it wishes to be--oppressive or inquisitive about individuals' affairs or from upsetting the relations between bankers and their clients, and also to give the institutions and undertakings a reasonable chance of making representations to the Bank. Nobody is seeking, overtly or covertly, to suppress the flow of necessary information; we are merely anxious that it should be given on a fair basis and should not intrude unnecessarily ino individuals' affairs.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): We have had an interesting debate. I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) will not press the amendment to a Division, in the light of some assurances that I will give him arising from our debate this morning.
<P>
We have further considered the points raised, particularly the concern that the Bank might use the powers to collect information that is not essential for it to discharge its monetary policy functions and go on what the hon. Gentleman so graphically described as a ``fishing expedition''. I take this opportunity to assure the Committee that we fully recognise the weight of such concerns.
<P>
To give effect to the powers, the Treasury will by order define the scope of the information that the Bank will be able to collect. In drawing up the order, the Treasury will, first, consult as widely as required under subsection (6), and, secondly, include only those types of information which we are satisfied the Bank needs. In doing so, we will take fully into account the cost to business--in response to the point made by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn).
<P>
Ministers will also expect the Bank to exercise the powers given under the clause in ``a reasonable manner''--to return to the phrase that we discussed this morning--and for the sole purpose of discharging its monetary policy functions. We do not expect the Bank to collect any more information under the power in the clause than it does currently. The Bank's code of practice for statistics commits it to placing the minimum load necessary on data suppliers, and to keeping data suppliers' costs to a minimum.
<P>
I hope that that reassures the Committee, because it is important that we should be explicit about the nature of the information that will be required. The hon. Member for Daventry drew attention to the fact that it is not inconceivable that even generalised information about an institution's transactions will reveal information about the affairs of a particular customer--if, for example, the dealer is working for one specific customer. However, schedule 7 provides protection for individual information obtained by the Bank.
<P>
I hope that with those reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will see fit not to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is my birthday.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): How reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, how reasonable. Even if we have not been able to collect &#163;200, at least we have passed go, or fist base, on this matter. I am grateful to the Economic Secretary and her colleagues for responding to the concerns that have been expressed. I claim little credit, but I commend in particular the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford.
<P>
There is no malice in our tabling this clutch of amendments; we are genuinely concerned that information should flow, that it should be available for proper purposes and that it should not be improperly or maliciously obtained. From what I know of the Bank, I very much doubt that that would be its intention, but we should alway legislate for the worst case, if it is prudent to do so.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that she now intends to proceed by means of a Treasury order. I would like briefly to flag up three points before I beg the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment. First, can the hon. Lady assure us that we will have an opportunity to consider that order in Parliament in one form or another?
<P>
Secondly, will she at least consider the valuable point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford concerning compliance cost--to which we will no doubt return in a moment--as it affects smaller businesses? It is well known to those of us who have been involved in any kind of business that the smaller the business, the higher the proportionate compliance cost. We are anxious to minimise that cost, as I hope that the Economic Secretary is.
<P>
Thirdly--this is a small point, but I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary could reflect on it; she does not have to give me an instant answer--as I read the Bill, my amendment would be redundant, which is one reason why I am happy to withdraw it. Presumably, section 4(3) of the 1946 Act, which embodies the same safeguards, will stay in place as it does not seem to be repealed by the Bill. If I can receive that assurance and a helpful answer to my other two points, I shall withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman's final point about the failure to repeal the relevant clause in the Bank of England Act is correct. As for an opportunity to discuss the order in Parliament, I understand that that would take place by the affirmative resolution procedure, as required by clause 40. Furthermore, I referred specifically to restricting the burden on smaller institutions in my opening remarks, when I said that there was a need to take into account the full costs to business in requiring that information. I hope that that information helps the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 7, line 18, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) A notice shall not be issued under subsection (1) save in exceptional circumstances of urgency, unless a periodical cost compliance assessment has been completed and published, and approved by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment also touches on the costs on business and, in particular, business in the City. It may give the Economic Secretary an opportunity to say what burdens will be placed on banks and financial institutions under clause 17. Our amendment would ensure that a formal cost compliance assessment is carried out from time to time and placed before both Houses of Parliament for approval. The latter provision would ensure that the cost compliance assessment was conducted thoroughly and was to the satisfaction of Parliament.
<P>
I stress that the exercise should be made periodically and not carried out for each notice that is required under subsection (1). In other words, under the amendment a cost compliance assessment would be carried out when material changes were made in the type of information that was required by the Bank or, more often, if Parliament required it. The measure contains an explicit provision to allow the Bank, in exceptional circumstances, to request necessary information; it will not inhibit the usual operation of the Bank or its obtaining information in exceptional circumstances. The amendment puts the spotlight on the important issue of cost.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Given that some amendments that have been tabled by the right hon. Gentleman were inspired by the British Bankers Association, does he not think that, when consultation is undertaken under subsection (6), the association will readily tell the Government about any excessive costs involved in collecting information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, but I am looking ahead. Subsection (6) may well have a potent effect in the laying of orders. I approve of it.
<P>
I wish to stress, however, that the House must be satisfied that cost compliance assessments are carried out regularly to safeguard the permanent and continuing competitiveness of the City of London and the United Kingdom. That is best done in the familiar and traditional way of requiring cost compliance assessments. I am sure that the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) will accept that, throughout previous Parliaments, the Government regularly and routinely published cost compliance assessments when they introduced various regulations. Bills were accompanied frequently by cost compliance assessments that were carried out prior to the draft legislation. That was done to assess in plenty of time the potential effect of statute law provisions. I should like that practice to continue. It was widely welcomed by businesses throughout the United Kingdom. When the hon. Lady replies, will she tell us roughly what volume of information the Bank will request or, in other words, how frequently the clause will be used? Will she also explain whether there will be an increase in the cost?
<P>
Conservative Members are worried about the lack of formal constraints on the Bank. It is easy for any organisation to slip into thinking that if any reason can be given for requesting information, it should be requested. It may be assumed that the outside world is watching and wants us to regulate and control, and ensure that all decisions are correct and thoroughly researched.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I said, much of the burden can be thrown on to the private sector, and the regulator can be too ready to request information that may not strictly be necessary. The Government have already rejected an amendment that would have deleted ``or expedient'' from subsection (1), so we need to build up a countervailing force to ensure that requests for information are made only in the context of a compliance cost assessment. That would ensure that costs are examined carefully and help to prevent damage to the long-term competitiveness of the City of London.
<P>
I am not making a particularly radical suggestion. It is compatible with previous statute and I want the hon. Lady to explain not only the volume of information but why we cannot have routine compliance cost assessment. If a review is carried out, however informally, it would be useful to have some of the fruits of it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am not sure whether the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) was in his place when we started our afternoon debate. I have already provided the Committee with some assurances about how the clause will progress. We shall put an order before the House and consult widely on subsection (6). I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. Member for Daventry on his birthday. Celebrations seem to be marked in both our cases by having to be in Committee. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will get away slightly earlier than I did on my last celebration in the House. I should also like to commend the hon. Member for Guildford for his intervention this morning, which had the effect of concentrating our minds on these matters.
<P>
Let me return to the points raised by the right hon. Member for Wells. The Government's aims are simply to put the Bank's current information onto a statutory basis. The Bank intends to collect only the information that it currently collects on monetary policy. No one can rule out the possibility of changing financial practices in the future, which might make it necessary to amend those requirements. However, we are not intending to open the way for a fishing expedition to acquire irrelevant information and we also want the Bank to keep compliance costs to a minimum.
<P>
The amendment would not improve the situation. It would add greatly to the complexity of requiring information and might make the Bank reluctant to change its requirements even if it were clear that new financial practices made that necessary. When one adds another loop to the system, one inevitably adds other costs to it.
<P>
We will abide by the Bank's current code of practice for Bank of England statistics. As I said earlier, it places the minimum load necessary on data suppliers and requires the Bank to keep their costs to a minimum. We will engage in consultation before introducing any order. That will allow us to take into account the views of individual institutions on the costs of compliance.
<P>
I cannot supply a figure today on compliance costs. However, all the statistical reporting procedures will be entered into after extensive consultation with the industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I had better share in the aura of goodwill occasioned by the birthday of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 7, line 43, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5A) Section 105(6) of the Financial Services Act 1986 shall apply to any information requested by the Bank under this section, and to information requested under sections 39, 41, 65, 79 and 94(3) of the Banking Act 1987.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 42, in page 7, line 43, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5B) No duty to which a person who is an authorised institution under the Banking Act 1987 or an authorised or exempted person under the Financial Services Act 1986 may be subject shall be contravened by reason of that person's having communicated in good faith any relevant information required by a notice under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I say at the outset that we are deep into an issue for lawyers and technicians. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), who made an helpful intervention this morning, may wish to contribute again.
<P>
The amendments reflect the concerns of the British Bankers Association on technical matters that may arise from the disclosure of information. In a sense, they mirror one another. The first relates to whether legal and professional privilege for information that is submitted may be protected as part of the regulatory requirement. In its comments on the Bill, the British Bankers Association writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``As a matter of principle, the Bank of England should not be entitled to use the powers conferred by Clause 17 (or Schedule 2) to require the disclosure of information which might be protected by legal and professional privilege eg advice received in relation to legal proceedings.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain how legal and professional privilege could have anything to do with the information that is likely to be relevant to monetary policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We heard this morning--I am conscious that I am beset by a clutch of lawyers who are here for love rather than money--that the Monetary Policy Committee should consider a wide range of information. On both sides of the Committee there was consensus that it should lay its hands on any relevant data, which could include information on the strength of the regional economies and so on It is not for me to give a precise example, but some information might carry with it access to privileged information that may then cause difficulties for the institution and the clients involved.
<P>
As we all appreciate, people are fairly free with litigation these days if they see a chink in the armour. They would not look favourably on the institution with which they have dealings if it has--albeit for the best of motives--disclosed information that they regarded as privileged. There could be further repercussions. For example, a third party may tender information to the institution by reporting to it on a professional basis about, say, the status of one of the clients or the likelihood of winning a case of litigation. If that information forms part of the file that is submitted, it would amount to the disclosure of privileged information and could cause difficulties between the institution and its clients.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> May I pursue the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North? Part III of the Bill deals with the supervisory powers of the Bank of England. If Part III becomes law, the powers will go elsewhere. Part II deals with monetary policy and the Monetary Policy Committee, but the amendment refers to the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Act 1987, which deal with regulators and supervisors who investigate potential breaches of the law. In such circumstances, questions of legal privilege might arise. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North made the point that it is difficult to conceive of a situation where legal professional privilege might arise when simply collecting information for monetary policy purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stafford for pointing out the difficulties that some of us have at this level of complexity. He will know that the British Bankers Association's proposed remedy was an amendment to the clause. Faithfully and at short notice, I sought to adapt section 105(6) of the Financial Services Act 1986 for that purpose. The two hon. Members concerned--although professionals, they are modest and diffident--would conceded that we are not the world's best drafters, which is why we hire parliamentary draftsmen or draftswomen.
<P>
I am not sure that the clause is necessarily the right place for such an amendment. However, I am sure that, as the amendment is in order, it is right that we debate the issue and that the Minister replies. We shall then discover whether some kind of safeguard is necessary, either in this context, where it might be needed, or in financial regulatory reporting. We want to ensure that institutions that have privileged material are not obliged to cough it up inappropriately because it is unnecessary--which is the substance of what we said on consultations. That might create problems for themselves, their clients or, if they surrender such information, other people who might want to sue for a breach of privilege.
<P>
Amendment No. 42 deals with customers who might threaten to sue. If an institution passes on material in good faith under a notice, clients should not penalise them for doing so. Those are important legal matters. I do not claim to know their final solution.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman explain another difficulty that I have with the amendment? I had the same difficulty when the right hon. Member for Wells was speaking to an earlier amendment. Should the bank not collect information if doing so becomes too costly or if legal professional privilege comes into operation--I suggest that it will not--even though that information might be highly relevant to the operation of monetary policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a very real issue. We are rightly concerned with safeguards, so perhaps we need a disputes resolution procedure. I am thinking on my feet, but perhaps the bank could apply to a High Court judge to consider such matters. I notice that, far from being mindful of the fees that he might receive, the hon. Member for Dudley, North is looking askance at that proposal. There is a need to protect the rights of the individual and the relationship between clients and individual institutions in a way that is, so far as possible, consistent with the bank's requirements.
<P>
I do not think that many cases will cause difficulites. However, if there are such cases, it will be most important in forming the consultation process, which the Economic Secretary has assured us will follow our consideration of the Bill, to ensure that such matters are teased out and got right. Neither the hon. Member for Dudley, North nor I or any other member of the Committee would want injustices to occur to individuals or institutions inadvertently because someone had used his powers legally but oppressively to drag out something that would embarrass that individual or institution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): In wishing the hon. Member for Daventry a happy birthday, may I ask whether he agrees that there is a danger that the amendments--as well as amendment No. 39 on cost compliance which, thankfully, was withdrawn--will compromise the Bank's duty to pursue reasonably the information it needs for monetary policy purposes? The amendments could result in the Bank not fulfilling its duty and all sorts of technical problems.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> There is always a danger that safeguards will make it less easy to meet the primary objectives of any legislation, but that is part of the argument for safeguards. We are suggesting--I would be surprised if the hon. Gentleman dissented, although perhaps other Labour Members would--that the Bank of England should not have untrammelled power to ``go fishing'', as I put it earlier, without such safeguards.
<P>
I am entirely at one with the hon. Gentleman in believing that we need a proper flow of information. We do not want information to be ``unreasonably withheld'' on some legal technicality. We tabled the amendments because of the concerns expressed by the British Bankers Association and to elicit the views of the Economic Secretary. I am not gunning for her on this matter; we are having a constructive debate this afternoon. What has been interesting is that Labour Members have contributed, as there is a common interest in achieving the right balance between information and safeguards, and I should be grateful to hear the Economic Secretary's response.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It might help the Committee if I were more specific about the nature of the information that is required. I suspect that the amendment is not totally relevant, as there is no question of illegally gathered information being made available under the clause.
<P>
Our intention is to maintain the Bank's current coverage of financial information. The specific information that will be collected is likely to include: the financial assets and liabilities of an undertaking; off-balance-sheet financial assets, liabilities and commitments, such as guarantees; transactions in income and expenditure accounts and capital expenditure; interest rates and other fees and commissions charged for the provison of financial services; agency business on behalf of customers; assets and liabilities, financial transactions and changes to ownership associated with direct investment; and issuance and redemptions of relevant debt securities.
<P>
That should allay the concerns about the clause raised by the hon. Member for Daventry. The information that will be specified in the order will be generalised information about specific financial transactions of the institutions themselves. It will certainly not include legal advice or anything else to which professional privilege might attach, about which my hon. Friends the Members for Stafford and for Dudley, North made helpful interventions.
<P>
The Government believe that the amendment is unnecessary. We will debate related issues when we consider a further Bill on the reform of the financial services regulations--we may return to the subject then. As to the Bank carrying out its monetary policy functions, I hope that the Committee will accept my assurances that the information to be gathered will be specifically constrained to the relevant areas, which are extremely precise. The Bank already gathers such information in performing its duties; the clause puts that on a statutory basis.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see fit not to press his amendment to a Division, as we share a common purpose in seeking safeguards relating to clause 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary. In the light of what she said, I shall not seek to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
First, I have reflected further on the point and it is not inconceivable that some aspect of advice might be relevant. For instance, if a financial institution had made an advance, advice might be sought from lawyers or merchant bankers on what might be called the fungibility of getting the loan back, which could affect the financial viability of the institution. I do not seek to trip the Economic Secretary, but such a case could occur.
<P>
Secondly, the Economic Secretary referred to material that has been obtained illegally. Her comments on that subject were not as helpful as her other remarks. I presume that the hon. Lady means material that comes into the Bank's purview by accident--for instance, material that has been photocopied and mistakenly stapled to other documents. Separate legal considerations would, of course, apply in such cases. We are worried that information requested legally under the stated terms might give rise to difficulties between clients and their institutions.
<P>
I accept that the points raised will be considered by the Government and the Economic Secretary. It is right that they should be. I accept also that there is more of a locus in relation to financial regulation than to monetary policy. Indeed, we may wish to return to those matters later in relation to the Bank's surrender of its role of financial regulation. Subject to those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reports</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 8, line 26, after `Committee' insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 36, in page 8, line 35, after `fit' add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and shall be communicated to and discussed with the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I can deal with this amendment briefly, because the territory has been well rehearsed in other contexts. Clause 18 provides that the Bank should prepare and publish reports, containing certain material, which should appear once every three months or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other period as the Treasury and the Monetary Policy Committee may agree''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause mentions one or two other details.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to cut in our old friend the Treasury Select Committee. Amendment No. 35 deals with the period, and amendment No. 36 deals with the Select Committee's ability to discuss the report with officials of the Bank and, by inference, to hold evidence on it. We have debated this matter before, and the Economic Secretary has given certain assurances, but, in terms of the flow of information, it would be desirable and entirely natural for the reports to be communicated to the Treasury Committee.
<P>
The Economic Secretary will have seen from the Select Committee's report that it wishes to meet with the Monetary Policy Committee twice a year. It wants to receive the quarterly inflation report, unless that period is altered. We think that that is a valuable nexus to provide an input to an independent all-party Committee. I doubt very much whether the hon. Lady would dissent from that. We want to achieve the right sort of dialogue, and it is in that spirit that we have tabled the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I want to wish the hon. Gentleman a happy birthday. I also want to draw on his long parliamentary experience. Is it not a breach of parliamentary privilege to purport to tell a Committee what it should discuss and when?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comment. It is not quite like that. We are talking about the frequency of reports made by the Monetary Policy Committee, as an arm of the Bank of England, to the Select Committee. We are anxious to ensure in statute that those reports should be made. The only duty that we impose on the Treasury Select Committee, which I believe it would readily adopt, is the duty to discuss the reports. I suppose that the hon. Gentleman is formally right--those who are familiar with Zen Buddhism will know the question: given what is the sound of two hands clapping, what is the sound of one hand clapping?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the amendment had been in breach of privilege, it would not have been selected. The House can do anything that it likes by legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful for that clarification, Mr. McWilliam. You seek to help me; I was seeking in turn to help the hon. Member for Dudley, North.
<P>
In practice, we all know that the Treasury Select Committee is licking its lips and foaming at the mouth in its enthusiasm to get at the reports, and rightly so. We seek by the amendments to ensure that the Monetary Policy Committee is prepared to report regularly and to discuss matters in an adult manner with the Treasury Select Committee. I am sure that, one way or another, it will want to do so, but we invite the hon. Lady's response.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The thought of the Treasury Select Committee foaming at the mouth with enthusiasm causes me some anxiety.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 is unnecessary. It is intended that reports will be issued on a regular quarterly basis. The only reason why there is provision for changing the period is technical. For example, if the Office of National Statistics had cause to change the publication date of certain key statistics for whatever reason, that might make it necessary to delay or bring forward the report by a matter of weeks. There is a clear requirement that the report should be issued on a quarterly basis. The Treasury and the Monetary Policy Committee are well aware of the Treasury Select Committee's interest in the quarterly inflation report. If changes to the date are needed, the Treasury Select Committee will be given sufficient notice and will be made aware of the circumstances.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would not have any practical effect. The Treasury Select Committee will be able to obtain a copy of the report as soon as it is published. I am sure that the Bank will want to ensure that the Committee obtains copies as soon as possible, and will be prepared to make arrangements to ensure that that happens. The Treasury Select Committee already has the power to call any member of the Monetary Policy Committee before it to discuss the inflation report, and it has already said that it wants to take evidence from the Governor of the Bank, along with an internal and an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, on publication of the November and May reports.
<P>
I think that that covers the hon. Gentleman's point. To take up the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North, while the amendment does not raise matters of privilege, it would indeed be unusual for legislation to presume to tell the Treasury Select Committee what it can and cannot do in relation to another body. That is our reservation about the amendment.
<P>
In view of the fact that the amendment would have no practical effect, and in the spirit of goodwill that pervades the Committee this afternoon, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press it to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Economic Secretary tempts me to revert to my more rebarbative mode, but I shall not do so. I intend by leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment, partly on the basis of the assurances that the hon. Lady has given us--we like to hear her giving such assurances. Perhaps the reports of the Monetary Policy Committee would be more valued if they were published only in samizdat editions and not available except at great personal risk. Having said that, of course we agree that they should be freely available. I have a feeling that in its enthusiasm the Treasury Select Committee will obtain copies and discuss them regularly, as it intends to do. In the light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 8, line 35, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) A report under this section shall include references to any constraints experienced by the Monetary Policy Committee in discharging its responsibility under section 13(1) which inhere in other Government economic policies, including the effect of any open market operations undertaken in conjunction with the Government's exchange rate objectives.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment enables us to examine further something that has considerably exercised the Opposition: the possibility of divergence between various policy aims of the Government of the day, and in particular between monetary and fiscal policies. In previous debates, we noted that that is not an infrequent occurrence; we considered the case of modern Germany, where it has happened. The other example, which we did not discuss but which I might give as a further illustration of that point, is the American experience. In the early 1980s, President Reagan ran a large budget deficit, partly because of his rearmament programme, but also because he was reluctant to raise taxes. This side of the Atlantic witnessed a large and growing--and potentially inflationary--American budget deficit which the Federal Reserve, under Paul Volcker, had to counter by a restrictive, tight monetary policy. Interest rates rose and the dollar rose on world markets--it reached almost $1 to the pound, which now seems extraordinary--because Paul Volcker's monetary aims conflicted with what came to be known as ``Reaganomics''--an economic policy that was summed up as sound money and plenty of it. I do not know whether Reaganomics succeeded in the round--economists differ about that--but I do know that the Federal Reserve was alarmed by that mismatch between its responsibilities and those of the American Government.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is possible that something similar could happen in this country and the amendment ensures that the Bank of England would be able to comment so that the rest of the country could judge for itself whether that risk were being run. Conversely, if there were nothing in the report or if the Bank of England were entirely happy, that too would send a reassuring signal. It is important that the Bank of England--by that, I mean the Monetary Policy Committee--be required to comment on that danger in its inflation report because it has a responsibility to formulate monetary policy. It is clear from our previous debates, and from the example I have just given, that there is a large overlap between various economic policies. The amendment also refers to Government's ``exchange rate objective'', which has similar monetary implications; the attainment of that objective can conflict with other needs, particularly the need to control inflation.
<P>
I ask the hon. Lady to return to that important general issue. She must agree that that has happened in other countries and at home. That being the case, the amendment is a good way of ensuring that information is provided--and information is the beginning of wisdom in terms of tackling such discontinuity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I shall not this time attempt to flatter the hon. Gentleman. Is he aware that the Monetary Policy Committee is already commenting on such matters? I refer him to the minutes of the August meeting, which is before us in the Library research paper. He will note comments in paragraph 55 about the Government deficit and its effect on monetary policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's observation. I have read the Bank's recent inflation report. However, I want to be sure that it is required to comment on that aspect of its responsibilities. Although the Bank may occasionally make observations that go somewhat wider than its statutory requirements to comment, it is none the less important that it be required to comment on that matter. That would not place an unnecessary constraint on the Bank because, as the hon. Gentleman said, it roves fairly widely in the subjects of its reports. A requirement under clause 18 would provide reassurance and prevent friction or criticism of the Bank from developing if it were to be alleged in future that it was straying outside its responsibility and commenting adversely on aspects of Government policy. I should not want the Government or anyone else, at that point, to require the Monetary Policy Committee to get back in its box and confine itself to monetary policy. To avoid that, the amendment would require the committee to comment on the possibility that at some future date it would be prevented from or inhibited in attending to its other responsibilities because the Government were pursuing contrary policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I support the amendment but also want to put an end to the spirit of good will that abounds in the Committee and with which I am slightly uncomfortable.
<P>
The amendment is crucial to the Bill. Throughout the debates, Opposition Members have tried to elicit from the Government a resolution of the conflict that may well arise between the conduct of monetary policy for purposes concerning inflation and the conduct of a policy with regard to the exchange rate. Despite many attempts to obtain an answer, none has been forthcoming. The necessity for an amendment therefore becomes ever more compelling. It is important for us to know precisely what the Government are trying to achieve in relation to exchange rate policy.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells quoted many examples of conflict, in this context abroad and in this country. That conflict is fundamental to the conduct of monetary policy. It was fundamental in the mid to late 1980s, when the Chancellor was shadowing the deutschmark, pursuing an exchange rate policy that conflicted with the inflation policies of the time. During the exchange rate mechanism period, policy was geared to ensuring that the exchange rate remained within set parameters, which conflicted with the domestic requirements of monetary policy, because we were in a recession and needed to get out of it. Our exchange rate policy kept us in it. It was only when we were forced out of the exchange rate mechanism that interest rates could fall and the recession could cease.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, North raised the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee. They refer to the level of the exchange rate, but discuss neither Goverment policy in relation to that, nor what the Government are doing in the marketplace to pursue the exchange rate objectives. That is the point of the amendment. We need to know what the Government do, which may be in complete opposition to what the Bank of England does.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): I apologise, Mr. McWilliam, for not acknowledging the Chair when I arrived.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has still not fully responded to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North. Lengthy discussion has taken place about the interrelatedness of economic policies. In particular, the hon. Gentleman has made much play of the interrelatedness of exchange rate policy and inflation policy. Logically, therefore, will not clause 18(2)(b), which requires the report to contain
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an assessment of the developments in inflation in the economy''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
necessitate comment by the Monetary Policy Committee on issues in relation to exchange rates? The amendment is intended simply to over-complicate the clause or perhaps even to enable Opposition Members to air some of their party's internal concerns about exchange rate policy in this Committee. This is not an appropriate forum for that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> These so-called internal concerns are crucial to the conduct of monetary policy in Britain and in every country in the world. The fact that the hon. Lady views such arguments as matters of concern only to the Conservative party demonstrates that the Labour party does not understand how to conduct economic policy. That will emerge in the months and years ahead. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) should not heckle his colleague. He is in danger of losing his slice of birthday cake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for keeping my hon. Friend in order.
<P>
	The Monetary Policy Committee should discuss the matter. Under clause 18(2)(b), the committee might mention issues relating to the exchange rate, as the Economic Secretary has pointed out, but there is no requirement for it to do so. There is no requirement that the Monetary Policy Comittee should be made aware of what the Government are doing. Unless the committee is informed, there is no reason for it to know. The committee might examine figures that are available to the public--or it may even examine figures and data that are not available to the public--but such material might be misleading, if the committee is not made aware that the Government are intervening in the foreign exchange markets and therefore distorting that data.
<P>
	The amendment requires the Monetary Policy Committee to discuss the effects of Government policy on the conduct of monetary policy. It will also require the committee to have been given that information by the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> At present, the committee comments about the exchange rate context in which inflationary targets must be achieved. The hon. Gentleman seems to be going further by suggesting that the basis of the amendment is that the Monetary Policy Committee should act in such a way as to criticise the Government's exchange rate policy, presumably in a bid to excuse itself for not achieving its own inflation targets. The intention seems to be that the Bank fulfils the Government's requirements for inflation targets and, at the same time, operates an exchange rate policy. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the committee should forget that and should spend its time criticising the Government's exchange rate policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I know that the Labour party is panic-stricken by any criticism of it. That is the raison detre for the Government's conduct. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not in order for members of the Government to heckle members of the Opposition either. I also remind hon. Members that interventions should be just that, and not mini-speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not think that the amendment will lead to the Monetary Policy Committee criticising the Government's exchange rate policy. There will be occasions, however, when the two conflict and the purpose of the amendment is to highlight that. The amendment is not intended as a tool with which to attack the Government. It has been proposed to promote transparency, so that there can be a genuine discussion about how the economy is run. We are not talking about the economy of the Labour party; it is the economy of the country in which we all live, and we all want that economy to be run properly. The Government's exchange rate policy will come into conflict with inflation targets and with the objectives of the Monetary Policy Committee. To deny that there will be occasions when that will happen is to deny reality. If the Govenrment will not accept the amendment, will the Minister explain to the Committee what they will do when there is a conflict between the Government's exchange rate policy and the activities of the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I echo the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). Much of our concern about the conflict between interest rates and exchange rates would be resolved if the Economic Secretary would explain how the Government see the matter. She was unequivocal when she spoke in an earlier sitting. She stated that responsibility for interest rates lay with the Monetary Policy Committee and that responsibility for exchange rates lay with the Government. I hope that she has had an opportunity to read the transcript of the subsequent sitting when we pressed her colleague, the Paymaster General, to expand on the matter. He implied that there were no conflicts under the present Government. There were conflicts under the previous Government, which he put down to bad, inconsistent and short-term economic policies; yet the Conservative Government delivered on their inflation targets, which is more than the present Government are able to do.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Paymaster General explained blandly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government's inflation target is clear, and the Bank is setting monetary policy to achieve it. The Government want a stable and competitive pound. Nothing could be clearer.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 27 November 1997; c. 146.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wanted to check Ministers' consistency on the subject and it did not take me long to discover the same hon. Member for Coventry, North-West--now the Paymaster General--putting a question to the previous Chancellor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), three years ago. He asked him about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the interrelationship between interest rates and the value of sterling, and the implications of both, for British industry''.--[Official Report, 3 March 1994; Vol. 238, c. 1056.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must find out how the present Government view that interrelationship. Conflicts do arise, and we must know how the Government will cope with them. We may be seeing such a conflict today as we watch the pound going above DM3 yet again, and there is still talk of interest rates rising further. At DM3 many businesses regard the pound as over-valued. That is a key problem faced by the Government today.
<P>
The amendment has greater force because the Government are refusing to answer our questions. The Government will not answer them now, but the amendment would ensure that they do answer in due course our questions about the terms under which the Act will operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I rise briefly to reinforce the views of my hon. and right hon. Friends. Let me start with some consensual points. First, as the Economic Secretary and her hon. Friends have acknowledged, the conduct of monetary policy is not the sole and sufficient instrument of economic policy. For example, whether the exchange rate remains stable and competitive over the longer term, the implications of fiscal policy and other matters are relevant.
<P>
Secondly, although the amendment deals with exchange rate policy, it is but one element; and there are others, including the Government's fiscal policy. Today the Government have announced their proposals for independent savings accounts and they are not congenial to all of my hon. Friends, but we need not dilate on them now.
<P>
Thirdly, the operation of policy on the exchange rate, involving open market operations, will by definition affect money supply considerations and therefore comes back to monetary policy. That cannot be denied.
<P>
Finally, in response to the exchanges over safeguards between the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the essence of the amendment--formally, at least--is the timing. My hon. Friends argued vigorously that there is a possibility--and even Labour Members would concede that there is a theoretical possibility--of there being a disjunction between the objectives of other aspects of the Government's economic policy and those of monetary policy. Once that is conceded, the Monetary Policy Committee is put under strain in fulfilling its target obligations.
<P>
The hon. Lady may say that if the Monetary Policy Committee cannot achieve its objectives, members could write an open letter to the Chancellor saying, ``Sorry, guv. We did out best, but you made it impossible for us; we have failed.'' Under a robust Governor, an extremely vigorous letter to that effect--couched in diplomatic language but saying exactly that and making it clear precisely what aspects of Government economic policy outwith the Committee's control were responsible for its failure--could be drafted.
<P>
The amendment would accelerate the process. The Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee would be able to say in the inflation report, ``We have a problem with this. The Chancellor has instructed us to do certain things and to meet certain targets, but other things going on in economic policy are making that impossible for us.'' That would be a warning shot or an amber light rather than the red light that would appear--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am finding it difficult to hear the hon. Gentleman. If members of the Committee want to hold discussions with strangers, they should withdraw from the Committee Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am about to conclude. The amendment would change the time at which any potential problems and conflicts between Government economic policies generally and their monetary policy would become known. Things may go wrong if the objectives do not add up or contradict one another. In those circumstances, the Governor could write a letter in the appropriate diplomatic language to the Chancellor saying that the Monetary Policy Committee had done its best, but things had gone wrong because he had made its work impossible.
<P>
However, we think it would be better if the Bank were able to make it clear in the inflation reports that--because of the Chancellor's exchange rate policy or otherwise--the Monetary Policy Committee was running into difficulties, and if it were able to ask him to help it find its way through them. That process should be put on a formal and transparent basis and in a way that would enable the problem to be met up-front rather than thereafter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> These issues are already being considered and will be discussed in the Monetary Policy Committee. As I told the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the amendment would, to an extent, change the context in which comments will be made.
<P>
The duty of the Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee is to meet the Government's objective for the inflation target, given economic constraints and the Government's other objectives. It will have an opportunity to adjust the bandings if there is a shock to the world, regional or local economy. We all appreciate the relationship between interest rates and exchange rates. Nobody would deny that for a moment. The Government are also pursuing a policy for stable and competitive exchange rates. Under certain conditions, that may conflict with their inflation target. It is obvious that, after observing exchange rates for the past six months, pressures exist.
<P>
Those pressures do not mean that the Bank should not continue to keep its eye on its inflation target. It should not be sidetracked. People understand the reasons for the difficulties that we face with the level of the exchange rate. They can be explained by the relative position of Germany, the rest of Europe and Britain on the economic cycle, and by the views of currency buyers as we approach the introduction of the single currency. They are considering where to put their money given their views on whether the Spanish and Italian economies will legitimately satisfy the convergence criteria. That is putting short-term pressure on exchange rates and is causing the pound to rise.
<P>
The Bank could consider fiddling around with interest rates to compensate for the rise in the pound, and that sort of thinking would be encouraged by the structures that the amendment prescribes. That would be quite wrong. The Monetary Policy Committee should not sit around to explain and criticise exchange rate policy. It is accountable for meeting the inflation target.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> How would the hon. Gentleman resolve a scenario whereby the Government and the Bank of England were separate entities, the Government were trying to bring sterling down below the current level of DM3 to the pound by busily selling sterling into the marketplace, and the Monetary Policy Committee noticed that money supply figures were going through the roof because of the selling of sterling and so raised interest rates to rein back the increase in the money supply, and, consequently, the exchange rate continued to rise and the Government carried on pumping money into the economy to bring it down--the vicious circle persisting. How would the hon. Gentleman resolve that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is clearly the case that people throughout the economic community will observe that happening and it is for the Government, through the Chancellor, to take action. We should not ask the Bank of England to resolve issues outside its remit, which is why we are confining its remit to monetary policy and the control of inflation.
<P>
I agree that, in theory, the scenario that the hon. Gentleman describes could arise--we all know about Reaganomics and so on. It does not follow, however, that we should accept the amendment, which widens the debate beyond the levers of control over economic impact relevant to the forum that we are discussing. The economic impact that the hon. Gentleman is talking about relates to a different set of levers, which is at the Chancellor's disposal.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> If Billesley Bear had wandered in from the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) to listen to our discussion, he would have wondered what was going on. Yet again, the amendment is not directly relevant to the subject under discussion and fails to take into account our previous considerations.
<P>
It is self-evident that the inflation report will cover the impact of Government economic policy on developments in inflation. The clause clearly states the requirement that the Bank
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall prepare and publish reports in accordance with the provisions of this section.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Moreover, subsection (2) clearly states the requirement that the inflation report should outline how the Monetary Policy Committee should reach its objectives and the constraints and parameters that will have an impact on that.
<P>
It is not inconceivable that an aspect of Government policy will have an inflationary impact that the Monetary Policy Committee should take into account, but Conservative Members have made extremely heavy weather of that. The Monetary Policy Committee's stated objective--we have been round the houses on this more than once--is to maintain price stability and, subject to that, to support the Government's other economic policies. The whole point of the framework that has been laid down for the Monetary Policy Committee is to give it operational autonomy to achieve its target, to enhance its credibility and to give a long-term commitment to price stability.
<P>
The Government set not just the monetary policy objectives, but the other economic policy objectives. It would be perverse indeed if the Government were to set inconsistent policy objectives. We are committed to a stable and competitive pound. We believe that one way to achieve that is through promoting macro-economic stability, which includes price stability. The Government set both the inflation target and the exchange rate regime and, I repeat, it would be perverse to make them inconsistent--a number of my hon. Friends have made that point clearly.
<P>
It is not inconceivable that the Bank should intervene as an agent of the Government in the foreign exchange market by buying and selling the Government's foreign exchange reserves, as the Chancellor made clear in his letter of 6 May. That would not affect the monetary aggregates, but it would ensure that there is protection; to make an analogous point, the intervention would automatically be sterilised.
<P>
As we said today, the Government are committed to publishing a quarterly report on their foreign exchange operations, which will include the United Kingdom's forward book. It will be the first time that that has been done and should ensure that market participants are aware of the Government's dealings and position in the foreign exchange market. The Monetary Policy Committee will not have to take some kind of Trappist vow not to look at the report or discuss it.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells referred to the possible conflict between monetary and fiscal policy. If the Government's fiscal policy objectives are clear, the Monetary Policy Committee should be able to set its policy accordingly. We have taken steps to make fiscal policy more predictable, which was one of the purposes behind last week's pre-Budget statement and the associated consultation that was carried out alongside it.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is bizarre to suggest that, when the Government set their monetary and fiscal policy objectives, and create the exchange rate regime, there is a need for the amendment. We have had an interesting debate, in that it has rehashed old arguments. We do not seem to be making headway with the Opposition to make them recognise that there is more to the running of the economy than monetary policy. The Government take into account the need to have effective monetary and fiscal policies, and an effective exchange rate regime, aimed at setting the criteria for stability and growth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Economic Secretary said that the amendment was not relevant. I do not know how she could have said that. The issues that we have been debating concerning monetary policy and the degree to which it is influenced by other economic objectives surely go to the heart of the Bill. The Monetary Policy Committee is being asked to formulate a monetary policy to hit an inflation target. At least we can agree in Committee that monetary policy is influenced by other policy considerations, especially fiscal policy or exchange rate policy. We are simply asking that, in its report, the Monetary Policy Committee is required to comment on that.
<P>
There are trade-offs and even conflicts, some of which have been drawn out during the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton cited the example of what seems to some people to be an overvalued exchange rate at present. Complaints have been made that our exporters are finding life difficult, so the Government may get it into their head to set an exchange rate target and reduce the price of the pound in international markets by massive intervention through the selling of sterling. Increasing the price of imports would affect inflation. There are also monetary effects to be taken into account through intervention on such a scale. The Monetary Policy Committee may find itself unable to meet its inflation target because of the conflict with other Government objectives. It is only right that that should be referred to explicitly in the reports from time to time.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that the inflation report would deal with the matter under the other provisions of the clause. I am not sure that that is correct, however. No reference is made to it and, although the Government may consider it in order to range more widely, that is not the point. We want to require the Bank of England to report, so that no embarrassment will be created nor will there be criticism from the Government or elsewhere about it straying into the Government's policy. Otherwise, I can well imagine the Chancellor of the Exchequer responding adversely to what he might perceive as ultra vires criticism from the quango that he set up. He might therefore ignore its observations on the grounds that they stretch the provisions beyond what was intended at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the amendment would buttress the independence of Monetary Policy Committee members for the reasons that he was going on to develop, and would prevent Ministers attacking members of that committee for straying off into areas which are not deemed by Ministers to be their province?

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, I agree with my hon. Friend.

There is a worrying degree of potential interference with the committee through the terms of appointment and the terms that members will serve. My hon.

The amendment is another way of bolstering the committee's independence and giving members of that committee the duty to report on perceived conflicts. I and other of my hon.

<H4><center>Reserve powers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 8, leave out lines 41 to 43.
<P>
We come now to the Treasury's reserve powers. The nature of those powers as a mirror image of the Treasury's devolution responsibility for monetary policy was discussed at the beginning of this part of the Bill, and I do not intend to rehease the whole debate again. We received some assurances from the Treasury Bench--albeit assurances that it is not always easy to justify except after the event--that the reserve powers would be used only in wholly exceptional circumstances and that they mirror the prudent provisions of, for example, the Federal Reserve, the Bundesbank and others. We must concede that such a need might conceivably arise.
<P>
However, a suspicion lingers among Conservative Members that such powers may be used to overcome, for example, Government embarrassment at the conduct of the Monetary Policy Committee or in other circumstances that do not constitute an extreme international emergency. The analogy that had been in my mind all through the consideration of this part of the Bill, of which we are nearing the end, is that of a long-standing married couple of my acquaintance. Their entirely politically incorrect dialogue goes something like this: he says, ``But the lady concerned promised to obey me; she replies, ``Ah, but I had my fingers crossed at the time.'' There are, of course, analogies with that. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For some reason, hon. Members seem to be anticipating dinner. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to be listened to in silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry if I have excited hon. Members.
<P>
Let us for the purpose of this argument accept the bona fides of all Labour Members and the assurance that the provision will be used only in wholly exceptional circumstances of national emergency or great economic crisis. We must then consider the nature of the powers that the Treasury is arrogating itself. The amendment would leave out subsection (2) because like Reich Marshall Goering when he heard the word ``culture'', when I read words such as those in the subsection I reach for my revolver. The order may, according to the Bill,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``include such consequential modifications of the provisions of this Part relating to the Monetary Policy Committee as the Treasury think fit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have debated long and hard--in the Economic Secretary's view, redundantly--about exactly what those powers are and under what circumstances and in what ways they should be adopted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be reaching for his revolver a little too quickly. The key word in the subsection is ``consequential''. The hon. Gentleman will be aware, for example, that there are certain provisions in this part relating to time periods in which notices or minutes have to be published and so on. They are the sort of consequential changes that might have to be made as a result of an emergency order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will accept my bona fides. As a good lawyer, he has rightly pointed to the critical word. I hope that he will accept my assurance that that was precisely the word with which I was about to deal.
<P>
I was explaining why, metaphorically, the hairs were rising on the back of my neck when I read the provisions that the Treasury might do such things as it deems fit. Although it is never possible to say so at this stage, the Bill may not be certified as a money Bill. Interestingly, for example, it has no money resolution. It will, therefore, fall to consideration in another place. I know that in this House we are occasionally a little casual in our commitment to constitutional niceties, but their Lordships become extremely excited on the subject of Henry VIII clauses and will no doubt want to give consideration to the matter. I am concerned that any reserve powers will be properly controlled and expressed, and no more than is appropriate to the need.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman--I assure him that he anticipated my remarks--drew attention to the word ``consequential'', which is an important saving point. He rightly said that there may have to be changes in periods for reporting or for publishing minutes. I agree that if that is all that is intended by the subsection, we may look on it with greater favour. However, the provision is not necessarily confined to such matters. For example, the reporting requirements could be changed, or the order relating to them, which the Economic Secretary kindly offered us this morning, could be suspended and institutions could be invited to report even more or not at all. There might be other changes in the duties of the Bank and Monetary Policy Committee, on the one hand, and the Bank and the Treasury, on the other, as set out in this part of the Bill. Those are matters of substance rather than detail.
<P>
I do not like general enabling powers and I do not readily concede them to the Government or the Treasury unless they seem to be absolutely necessary. It is for the Economic Secretary to make the case for the power, explaining what the safeguards are, whether other safeguards could be embodied and whether our friends Mr. Reasonable or Mr. Proportionate could be inserted. As the provision stands it sends a shudder down my neck and I do not commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> This is specifically an amendment to tie the Government's hands in a crisis. The clause ensures that the Government have the necessary flexibility--the one thing that you need--to act if the country is in crisis. The amendment is a specific means of removing that flexibility from the Government. You could be in a ludicrous situation in which the Monetary Policy Committee had to follow all the procedures in part II of the Bill while being specifically directed by the Government to act in a particular way because the nation is in crisis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call Mr. Ruffley, I remind the Economic Secretary that I am not in a crisis, not even a mid-life one.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the Economic Secretary explain the apparent discrepancy between clause 19(1) and 19(2)? The Treasury can give new directions to the Bank after consultation with the Governor--there is a requirement to seek his views before making the new directions in an emergency--yet there is no similar requirement in clause 19(2). Why is that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I should have thought that it was self-evident. There are courtesies, particularly in a crisis. Members of my party have co-operated with members of the Conservative party in crisis because the national interest was at risk. The measure specifically takes into account the requirements of the national interest. [Interruption.] So that I do not create a crisis for you, Mr. McWiliam, I shall desist from responding to the heckling from Conservative Members. I apologise for suggesting that you might have been in crisis.
<P>
Constraining the Government in such a way and putting the MPC through the procedures that we discussed earlier would be absurd if they had to act rapidly and without their hands being tied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is not a wholly satisfactory anwser. With the notable assistance of the hon. Member for Dudley, North, I have sought ways in which the response may be proportionate to the problem. The Economic Secretary's response has been to say, ``If we are in that kind of crisis we must have absolute flexibility to do anything.'' I will not necessarily hold her to a final position, but we must make a demonstration on the point of principle. Is it possible to beef up the assurances so that we can be satisfied that the measure is only a response to waive the legal requirements for procedural matters in relation to the conduct of the MPC and not an enabling provision that will allow the Government to go much wider in the conduct of their policies?
<P>
Such a situation--it might not be the Government's fault--might arise because of the failure of the Government's policies. There would be a strong temptation for a future Government of any political colour to close down the whole business by order and to say that that was consequential on a crisis, making the enactments necessary. As a matter of principle, we should not concede to the Government such sweeping powers without a more precise explanation or without consideration of whether those powers could be further constrained. If it is not possible to obtain either of those, we should press the amendment to a vote to make the point.

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is asking us to decide on the amendment he wishes that he had tabled rather than on the amendment he has tabled. It is possible, if the sun cycles come round again, that there might be a Conservative Government. If a Conservative Government were dealing with a national crisis, they would feel the need for reserve powers.
<P>
It is important to ensure that Governments have flexibility in times of crisis. I find it strange that the hon. Gentleman does not see that the national interest must be an overriding principle, especially as I have seen his arguments in this and other debates. I advise the Committee to reject the amendment on those grounds.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 9, line 6, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) Provided that after an order under this section has been made, no further such order may be made within the period of six months starting with the date on which the previous order was made, unless the further order has first been approved by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 34, in page 9, leave out lines 7 to 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> In the debate that has just concluded, we heard that the powers in the clause are potentially draconian. It is some relief, therefore, to see in subsection (4) that an order under the clause must be approved by both Houses of Parliament before the end of 28 days.
<P>
The end of subsection (4) catches my eye. Under it, if Parliament does not approve the said order,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it shall cease to have effect at the end of that period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not a constitutional expert, but I have always understood that if an order was not approved, it ceased to effect ab initio--in other words, it was as if the order had never had effect. It is surprising that, if Parliament did not approve an order, the order would nevertheless have effect for 28 days and that it would fall only at the end of that period. Will the hon. Lady comment on that? It is a departure from what usually applies to most orders laid before Parliament.
<P>
On the face of it, there is nothing to stop a Government who fail to achieve the approval of their order simply laying another one at the end of the period in question, which brings the Committee to the amendment's aim. Such an action would entirely circumvent the reasoning behind the clause and behind subsection (4). The Government could introduce rolling orders, none of which obtain Parliament's approval. In that way, the Government could introduce the draconian provisions, to direct monetary policy and to tell the Monetary Policy Committee what to do, what reports to write, and whether it should avoid criticising the Government. A Government could get up to all sorts of things without Parliament's approval.
<P>
The amendment would provide that, if Parliament refuses permission, no further order could be made for six months. That would neatly remove the possibility that a Government could deliberately circumvent the wishes of Parliament.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 deals with the time when Parliament is in recess or is otherwise prorogued or dissolved. At about three months, this summer's recess was the longest that anyone can remember. So it is possible that, for a period of nearly four months, the Government could use all the powers in this clause without even needing to get the order approved. The omission of the clause would ensure that Parliament could be recalled.
<P>
That must be right, as we are talking about extreme economic circumstances--in other words, a crisis. If a Government wanted to alter their monetary policy by decree and override the intentions and provisions in the Bill, the amendment would mean that they would have to recall Parliament to do so.
<P>
Both amendments are constructive, and I hope that the Minister will respond reasonably to the points that I have made.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall respond as positively as I can, but I repeat what I said earlier: in a crisis, there is a need for flexibility. All hon. Members will agree that clause 19 should be used rarely, if at all. We hope that the nation is never in such a state of crisis that the powers in the clause would have to be invoked.
<P>
Amendment No. 38 is inflexible. It would tie the Government's hands and render them unable to act in extreme economic circumstances. It is also illogical. The amendment would restrict the Government's power to act simply because an earlier extreme economic circumstance fell within the time period that it specifies. In effect, it would mean that one crisis had to be regarded as more important than another.
<P>
Orders made under the clause are meant to take effect immediately. They last for three months, but only if they are validated within 28 days. The amendment would mean that a second order in the six-month period would not come into effect until after it had been approved by both Houses of Parliament. That would remove the Executive's power to act quickly, which is needed in a crisis situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Economic Secretary seems to misunderstand the amendment. If there is a crisis, it is proposed that Parliament would approve an order within 28 days. If there were a need to continue with a subsequent order in sequence at the end of three months, the Government would have plenty of opportunity to arrange for Parliament to be on hand to approve it for a second time. The Government would have to act in advance of consultation of Parliament only when the crisis first blew up.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As I said earlier, I can deal only with the amendment as tabled, not with the amendment that the hon. Gentleman would prefer. It would be unacceptable for the Government's hands to be tied in the manner proposed.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 34. I repeat that all hon. Members would hope that the powers in the clause would be used rarely, if at all. The amendment would require the recall of Parliament if extreme economic circumstances were to obtain during a recess. However, there are circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to recall Parliament. Indeed, a crisis could be so severe--for instance, in the event of war--that Parliament would be recalled anyway. To constrain the Executive in the action that they could take and therefore to limit their power to act overnight, for example, would not be in the nation's best interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It might help matters if the hon. Lady could describe in more detail what she regards as extreme situations. For example, would it be an extreme situation if the Government's so-called exchange rate ``regime'' came into conflict with their interest rate policy? If that happened, does she envisage that the powers in clause 19 would be used to ensure that her Government got their way with the Bank of England and overrode the Monetary Policy Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman can make that point in clause stand part but he cannot make it under the amendment, which is quite narrow.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It is difficult to assess what such a situation would be. The hon. Gentleman is not treating the issue with the gravity that it requires. We are talking about extreme economic circumstances--a major catastrophe, for example, that affected the nation and had an impact on economic circumstances, or a major catastrophe that affected another economy that impacted on the British economy. As the Chancellor said when he introduced his statement on the single currency, the thing about unforeseen circumstances is that they are unforeseen.
<P>
	It is not inconceivable that Parliament would be recalled if, as I said earlier, we were at war or if there was an external threat to our economy. But we cannot say that the Government cannot act because Parliament had not been recalled. The speed of international economic developments nowadays is such that taking time to recall Parliament could limit the Government so severely that the economic circumstances that they were seeking to deal with could be made even more severe. Moreover, if Conservative Members are serious about the prospect of ever forming a Government again, they will want the Government to be given such flexibility.
<P>
Mr. St. Aubyn rose--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Do not worry. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman; he need not do his jack-in-the-box act. Opposition Members must see the logic of having these powers in the legislation and not being constrained by the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> As a new Member, I have difficulty understanding why, within 28 days, in the sort of crisis situation that the hon. Lady describes, it would not be possible to recall Parliament. Under the amendment, the 28-day period would be kept, during which there would be the opportunity to recall Parliament. The renewal of the order could take place once Parliament had been recalled.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> One of the difficulties with extreme economic circumstances is that they can arise very fast and hit very hard. I keep going back to the fact that, if we were at war, Parliament could already have been recalled. But to tie the Government's hands would be dangerous and damaging.
<P>
	We hope never to see the powers in the clause used, and I am sure that Opposition Members would agree. The powers would be used only in extreme circumstances. We must also take into account the fact that economic circumstances can change rapidly. Crises can develop rapidly and the Government must have the ability to act rapidly. That is not to say that Parliament must not or should not be recalled, but the Government's hands must not be tied. I urge members of the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We are becoming used to inadequate replies to our debate, but this one takes the prize. The hon. Lady spoke very briefly to our points on amendment No. 38, despite my asking her a specific quesiton, to which there must be a factual answer. It was about the status of orders laid before the house. I suggested, in a spirit of inquiry, that orders that were not approved usually fell and ceased to have effect from the start.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the hon. Lady can answer this question I should be genuinely grateful for illumination.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I thought that I had clarified that point. Perhaps I was not clear enough, or perhaps the hon. Gentleman was engaged in conversation. The orders would take effect immediately. They would last for three months, but only if they were approved by both Houses within 28 days. Does that answer the right hon. Gentleman's question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Not really. We know that the orders would take effect immediately. Unless approved, most orders fall completely and have no effect from the start, whereas it appears that orders under the Bill would have effect for 28 days even if Parliament were to vote against them. They will cease to have effect only after 28 days. Therefore, it would be possible for a Government to introduce a series of orders, none of which would be approved by Parliament, all of which would have effect.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am not a constitutional expert; others in the Committee undoubtedly are, not least yourself, Mr. McWilliam. Unlike the right hon. Member for Wells, I am not a long-standing member of the House, so I am not well versed in such matters. However, I understand that such orders will take a recognised form; they will be so-called 28-day orders. The instrument is laid after making but cannot remain in force after a specified period--usually 28 days, sometimes a month or 40 days--from the date on which it was made, unless it is approved within that period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> In that case, the amendment has additional force. It would deal with the possibility that a Government who could not get such an order through either House could simply dismiss the problem by tabling a series of orders. Therefore, the draconian provisions in the earlier part of the Bill could continue to have effect in defiance of Parliament's wishes. That would worry anyone with an interest in constitutional matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that any such order made must be intra vires the Act? In other words, it must satisfy the extreme economic circumstances test and the ancillary aspects of the order must be consequential to that. So there is legal control of the scope of such orders. Can he deal with the point about unscrambling the eggs when they have been broken? If an order is introduced and economic changes are made, it is difficult to see how that can be reversed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The force of the hon. Gentleman's intervention seems to be, ``Trust the Government. It is all written down in statute, so why have an order? Parliament is irrelevant.'' I do not agree with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My intervention may give my right hon. Friend an opportunity for some in-flight refuelling. The hon. Member for Dudley, North was right to say that any order must be intra vires the Act, but if Parliament either cannot consider or rejects an order, the courts could not consider it in time. For example, if extreme economic circumstances were to apply, that could not possibly be tested until so long after the events as to be entirely worthless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. Friend is right. The more we debate the matter, the more concerned we are and the more convinced we become that the amendment would be extremely useful in guarding the powers and privileges of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Would not Opposition Members be jumping up and down and using their spin doctors in the press to agitate about that matter if what the right hon. Gentleman says were so? [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) must not heckle her hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I had better not pursue that intervention. I am very ignorant about spin doctors. I do not believe in them. I like public policy and statute law, which is what we are trying to improve. That returns us to amendment No. 34. The points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford were not really answered; the Economic Secretary simply kept repeating that such circumstances would be terribly unusual and rare, and that the whole procedure would be triggered only in times of war or similar crises. That makes our point for us: it is precisely because a highly unusual event in extreme economic circumstances would be involved that it is all the more desirable that Parliament be recalled, so that the intention behind the provisions should not be overridden by the fact that the Government of the day might have sent us away for three months on our summer holiday.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Government seem intent on picking and choosing from examples of independent central banks around the world. They have chosen the example of the New Zealand Reserve bank, which has an override clause. They have chosen not to use the example of the US Federal Reserve bank, which does not have an override, or that of the Bundesbank, which the Government can ask only for a one-off delay of two weeks in the implementation of a decision with which they disagree.
<P>
The Government are picking and choosing; they have decided to use the example of New Zealand on this occasion, but they reject that example when it comes to single person responsibility. In New Zealand, one person is responsible for monetary policy; the Government have decided to reject that example and have instead gone along with the federal system of the United States and Germany.
<P>
The Government are choosing the easy option in every case. There is no requirement to have an override clause; there are examples of independent central banks that do not have such a clause. For the Economic Secretary to exaggerate the necessity for such a clause in the country's interest is disingenuous when there are central banks that do not have override clauses.
<P>
Finally, will the Economic Secretary be a little clearer about her definition of ``extreme economic circumstances''? She defined them as a catastrophic event, either in this country or abroad, but that is just as subjective as the phrase ``extreme economic circumstances''. For example, does the collapse of Yamaichi constitute a major catastrophe? It is certainly a major catastrophe for the Japanese; is it a major catastrophe under clause 19(1)?
<P>
Can the hon. Lady be a little more explicit about what is meant by ``extreme economic circumstances'', and explain why she has decided to follow the example of the New Zealand Reserve bank in this instance, not that of the US Federal Reserve or the Bundesbank?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I follow on from my hon. Friend's point. Clause 19 summarises the Jekyll and Hyde nature of the whole Bill: on the one hand it is supposed to be giving the Bank of England independence; on the other, control of all the levers goes back to the Treasury, and if it gets cold feet; it can pull the rug on the whole scheme. The Library's research paper points out that clause 19 does not comply with the requirements of those who wish to join the euro. I have my own views on that subject; perhaps I should welcome the clause as a stop against us ever being able to join the euro.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Does the Economic Secretary believe that clause 19 would need to be invoked before the Government determined that the needs of what the hon. Lady called the exchange rate ``regime'' overrode the needs of pure monetary policy? It would also help to understand what is meant by ``extreme economic circumstances''. In view of this morning's debate, does the hon. Lady believe that the clause would need to be invoked if a crisis in the banking system required interest rates to be lowered as part of a programme to restore confidence in the banks, despite the fact that a pure reading of the monetary situation might determine another level of interest, a rate that would be determined by the Monetary Policy Committee?
<P>
I do not wish to anticipate the Economic Secretary's response, but it is important to our understanding of the Bill that she attempts to answer those questions. On any interpretation of clause 19, we are seeing a fundamental shift not from the Treasury to the Bank but from the Governor to the Chancellor. In the light of what was said this morning about other amendments, whereas the Governor could previously take a decision on interest rates in the interests of the banking system, and his authority would be accepted by the Chancellor, the decision-making process will now rest with the Chancellor. Any debate about it will be within Government, not between the Government and the Bank. That shift is fundamentally to the detriment of our banking system. It is a mistake and it reflects the haste with which the Government's scheme has been cobbled together.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I support the comments made by my hon. Friends the Members for Guildford and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I have a slightly different question for the Economic Secretary. Both sides of the House need to know what is likely to be contemplated by Treasury Ministers when they exercise their ultimate judgment on whether to invoke those new powers in ``extreme economic circumstances''. The clause contains a fig leaf--the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after consultation with the Governor''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Notwithstanding that, it is ultimately a Treasury call. That being so, will the Economic Secretary consider one of the hypothetical examples set out by my hon. Friends? Have any economic or political events occurred during the past 25 years that, in her judgment, would meet the requirements of ``extreme economic circumstances''? That is not a hypothetical question; it is a specific question about whether an economic, socio-political event has happened during the last quarter of a century. Such an example would elucidate more precisely what might be in the minds of Treasury Ministers when they exercise that immensely powerful judgment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Let me take the last point. Labour Members have been much exercised in trying to think of an extreme economic circumstance that would necessitate the powers coming into play. The questions of the hon. Member for Bury, St. Edmunds help clarify that; there has not been an extreme economic circumstance in the past 25 years that would trigger--

<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall give way to the cavalry in a moment.
<P>
A situation such as the Gulf war, which had extreme economic consequences in terms of its impact on oil supplies, could trigger extreme economic circumstances. However, the fact that we cannot give a precise example of the situation we are thinking of demonstrates how rarely the power would probably be used. It is none the less important to have such a power in place for whatever sufficiently extreme circumstances may apply. The hon. Member for Guildford was referring to matters that are part of the normal, run-of-the-mill dealings with the day-to-day fluctuations of an economy. The powers would never be used for such circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Would the exit from the exchange rate mechanism not have qualified for such a definition of extreme economic circumstance?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> By the same token, would the calling in of the International Monetary Fund by the previous Labour Chancellor, Lord Healey, in 1976--which is within the 25-year period--also not have constituted an extreme economic circumstance, given that the International Monetary Fund sought immediately to influence the course of Government policy?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> That is an interesting point. I was thinking of Lord Healey earlier, when the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was speaking; I was thinking about his comment on dead sheep with regard to Lord Howe.
<P>
It is difficult to extrapolate whether the powers of the Bill would have been brought into play in those circumstances because the reason that we must have those powers--and the reason for our debate--is that we are putting in play a different kind of economic management, whereby we are devolving to the Monetary Policy Committee the power to set interest rates, in line with the Government's inflation target.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about what happens in other countries, one can pick and choose those countries. One of the most useful things that I have picked up, in my advancing years, is that one learns from best practice. The hon. Gentleman talked about the United States and Germany, but failed to take into account the fact that they have target as well as instrument independence--they have the right to establish the target, which would remain with the Chancellor in this case. If the hon. Gentleman wants an example of countries that have the power of override, Canada and New Zealand both have similar provisions, which neither country has ever had reason to use. I am interested that an Opposition Member should say that we should be tied to the way in which other Governments or central banks organise their affairs. We seek a British solution for a British economy--an economy that we are determined will be based on stability and prospects for economic growth. However, I reiterate that we intend that the reserve powers should be used only in extremis; many economic shocks can be dealt with by adjusting the inflation target or acknowledging that the Monetary Policy Committee will miss its target for a time. That would not in any way require the use of the clause. The clause exists for extreme economic circumstances, which is why it is an essential part of the legislation. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I do not know whether we had an opportunity to vote on both the amendments in the previous grouping.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I elucidate that for the hon. Gentleman? If the hon. Gentleman had told me that he wanted to move both amendments formally, I would have allowed him to do so, but he did not. Perhaps he can remember that in future. I am happy to allow such things, but if hon. Members express their wish before the start of proceedings, it makes life much easier.
