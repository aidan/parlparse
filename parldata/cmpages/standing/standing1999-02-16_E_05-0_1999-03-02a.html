<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and </B><P>
Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following order: 
Clauses 17 to 26, Schedule 4, Clause 15, Clause 1, Schedule 1,
Clause 2, Schedule 2, Clauses 3 to 7, Clauses 27 to 35, Schedule 5, 
Clauses 36 to 38, new Clauses, new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to postpone our 
consideration of clause 15, which deals with the dismissal 
of striking workers, to allow time for members of the 
Committee to study properly the Government's 
amendments that were tabled late on Friday, which would 
replace clause 15 with a new clause and schedule. The 
amended order of consideration would place the 
amendments to clause 15 after clause 26 and schedule 4 that 
deal with the certification officer and before the recognition 
procedure in clause 1 and schedule 1. I hope that the change 
is acceptable to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Mrs. Dunwoody, you of 
all people will remember the quotation from Hamlet 
indeed, the entire play is described sometimes as a 
quotation when he wished
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Oh! that this too too solid flesh would melt".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I gazed upon the expanse of clause 15, my wishes 
were fulfilled dramatically because the Minister of State 
took it away and we now have an order of reconsideration 
that will enable it to be considered later.
<P>
To put the Minister's mind at rest, I wish to say that 
we shall not object to the motion. However, he gave no 
material explanation of why it was tabled. If he is genuine 
in his wish to assist the Committee, as I think he is, it 
would be useful given that clause 15 in its pristine state 
and the new clause and schedule that will replace it are 
somewhat opaque if he could spare a little time to 
explain exactly to the Committee, if not by word then by 
letter, the material effects of the change. We shall 
examine the matter with our advisers to see if we can 
make head or tail of the changes but, given that we are 
doing our best to approach the Bill in a business-like 
manner and make it as effective as it can be within the 
context of the Government's policy, we should appreciate 
some elucidation.
<P>
This is the second reordering motion that has been 
tabled since the Committee began. Such motions are 
becoming a way of life. I do not know whether that is 
how the Minister of state regards himself as fulfilling the 
requirements of greater productivity. If he is concerned 
about the number of reordering motions, he is an absolute 
stakhanovite and he had better be made a hero of the 
Soviet Union. I am sure that he is seeking advice on the 
precedents set by Conservative Ministers who have 
occasionally redrafted Bills. However, it is a little difficult 
for members of the Committee and for those who advise 
and support us in such matters the unseen heroes of the 
proceedings to know exactly what is going on if, 
whenever we reach the last days of discussing the Bill, 
the whole thing disappears "just like that"	, as Max Miller 
would have said, and we end up doing something else.
<P>
We do not want to approach our proceedings in the 
spirit of faction and, with those mild jokes at the 
Minister's expense and with those warning shots, I 
commend the motion to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries to trick me; 
he and his hon. Friends wanted me to give them additional 
time and opportunity, and I have done that. I am quite 
happy to make such an amendment; indeed, I am entitled 
to do so. However, at our first sitting I gave the hon. 
Gentleman an assurance that I would be absolutely 
flexible, because I wanted to ensure that no one left the 
Committee feeling that they had not had the chance to 
debate the legislation or to prod me on it as the Minister 
responsible for the Bill. I do not want hon. Members to 
be able to say that they have not had an opportunity to 
discuss the Bill in detail. I propose the change to assist 
the hon. Gentleman, not to assist the Government.
<P>
There is no change of substance. The new clause and 
new schedule set out how we intend to deal with unfair 
dismissal its prevention, remedies for it and a way of 
persuading employers and employees who are in 
industrial dispute to try to resolve their disputes fairly and 
effectively. There is no difference in substance between 
the new clause and clause 15. The only change is in how 
to achieve what we want a change that is helpful to the 
Committee. I can add nothing to what is on the order 
paper. However, I shall be happy to engage in debate with 
the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members when we 
come to the matter.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the remainder of the Bill be considered in the following 
order: Clauses 17 to 26, Schedule 4, Clause 15, Clause 1, Schedule 
1, Clause 2, Schedule 2, Clauses 3 to 7, Clause 16, 16, Clauses 27 
to 35, Schedule 5, Clauses 36 to 38, new Clauses, new Schedules

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 109, in 
page 10, line 24, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Provided that in the event that such a fixed-term contract is not 
renewed, there shall be no unfair dismissal solely on the basis that 
the fixed-term worker was selected for dismissal or redundancy 
without there having been included in the process of selection 
employees not on fixed-term contracts.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now come back to the business of the Committee. 
The amendment deals with a complex and important 
matter. I acknowledge that both sides wish to be fair to 
part-time workers, particularly to workers on fixed-term 
contracts, of whatever status. The numbers are substantial. 
There are about 6.5 million part-time workers and the 
number of those on fixed-term contracts is 850,000. They 
are an important part of the industrial scene, and we want 
to preserve a degree of fairness in the way in which they 
are treated.
<P>
The Minister will no doubt want to refer the Committee 
to the work that has been done, in terms of the social 
contract and the agreement between those that we must 
now learn to call social partners both sides of industry. 
Doubtless, he will wish also to say that he has the broad 
understanding of the Confederation of British Industry, 
although perhaps only qualified rapture from some of the 
small business organisations for what he proposes.
<P>
I have already declared an interest, as I have one full-time 
employee. However, my family still has a farming 
operation, which inevitably has seasonal peaks and troughs 
so, from time to time, we make use of part-time 
employment. Oddly enough, circumstances this week have 
come together to allow me to make a number of points that 
are entirely germane to our consideration of the Bill as a 
whole, though not, I confess, Mrs. Dunwoody apart from 
my declaration of interest to the amendment.
<P>
My full-time employee has, with my full knowledge 
and consent, had to take off such time as he needs for a 
domestic incident the sad death of his mother-in-law. I 
said, "Of course you must go"	. However, we have 
livestock to feed, so we have arranged for a retired 
employee, who already does part-time relief work, to slot 
in to relieve the full-time worker. I have no complaints 
about that. Indeed, it takes place under the existing 
employment regime. However, I thought that I should 
mention it because it is an example of the entirely normal 
and proper arrangements that already exist.
<P>
Clause 17 deals with fixed-term contracts. It is clear 
from the White Paper, the explanatory notes and the rather 
bare text of the clause that the Government do not want 
fixed-term contracts to be subject to artificial 
arrangements that strike out their commonsense, 
comparable rights. Although we do not want to challenge 
that intention, the amendment is designed to probe what 
will be included. The Minister will remind the Committee 
that the provision will exclude the arrangements that 
applied in the past for workers on fixed-term contracts to 
waive their rights to unfair dismissal compensation. I am 
not sure whether that is necessary solely because the 
Government are reducing the qualifying period for 
employment rights to one year or whether they have 
another agenda. The explanatory notes contain a reference 
to several other elements such as health and safety. 
Perhaps the Minister will clarify my rather confused 
thinking on that matter.
<P>
With this amendment in particular, we have a good 
point to make in relation to what constitutes unfair 
dismissal. We are trying to flag up the case of a group of 
people working on fixed-term contracts with another 
group of full-time employees who are not on such 
contracts, and who are, presumably, fully able to avail 
themselves of their employment rights in relation to unfair 
dismissal. The narrow amendment would prescribe that it 
was not unfair to consider the dismissal, if that be the 
appropriate term, of people whose fixed-term contracts 
are about to expire. It would not be necessary or 
necessarily appropriate to treat them exactly as on all 
fours with the entire population of workers, including the 
majority who are not on a fixed-term contract the 
proportions could be the other way around, although that 
is unlikely to be the case.
<P>
It is not inherently wrong or stupid for an employer of 
a full-time work force and of some people on fixed-term, 
contracts, perhaps because he is gearing up to complete a 
particular job, such as the completion of a major 
construction contract, to argue, possibly indeed quite 
probably with the agreement of local unions, that as 
those jobs run out, it is sensible to consider not renewing 
the fixed-term contracts before becoming involved in the 
dismissal of staff across the piece. We are trying to flag up 
that concern and to ascertain whether that process might 
unwittingly fall foul of the clause as drafted.
<P>
For the avoidance of doubt, I should say that I am 
aware that the Government, having consulted on the 
matter, do not propose to extend redundancy rights to 
workers on fixed-term contracts. They are right not to do 
so, because it would compound some of the difficulties. 
By definition, if you were to accept a fixed-term contract, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, you would not expect to benefit from 
the full battery of redundancy rights at the end of that 
contract. Redundancy rights relate to frustrated 
opportunities and to a reasonable presumption of 
continuing employment. I understand the argument that 
unfair dismissal may constitute a different category, and 
therefore ask the Minister to speak a little more in general 
about why the provision is required and how it kicks in 
with the other provisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Does the notion of 
unfair dismissal have any meaning in the context of 
someone completing a fixed-term contract that is not 
renewed?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is an interesting point that I have 
often debated myself as I have come to know more of 
employment law. Under the existing arrangements, if an 
employee with a fixed-term contract is unable to carry on 
in the end and has not taken out a waiver explicitly before 
the contract's initiation or during its term, there is to use 
a lawyer's term of art, which I do with all due deference 
to lawyers a presumption that the contract might 
continue unless it is specifically excluded. The provision 
of the clause is what in football would be called a 50-50 
or a 49-51 ball. The Government have taken the view 
and they have support, including among employers' 
organisations that that should not necessarily apply.
<P>
The Government have rightly not extended the 
redundancy payments, but it would help, given the point 
that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham
(Mr. Bercow) made, if the Minister spoke some more 
on the general concept's rationale and the way in which 
it fits in with the other provisions, including the 
reduction of the qualifying period for unfair dismissal 
rights from two years to one year. Some of my hon. 
Friends may have reservations about that and its cost 
implications.
<P>
It would also help if the Minister spoke about the 
amendment, which suggests that, if an employer were to 
practise sensibly the discontinuation and non-renewal of 
fixed-term contracts before going into the labour force 
at large 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): The hon. Gentleman 
makes an interesting point, and, I suspect, one based on a 
confusion of terms. I do not suggest that we ask the 
draftsmen to come up with a new term that means 
something like a fixed-term contract but is not one. Many 
people are now effectively self-employed but work for 
several employers that is an established fact that we 
understand. Given that, I can see problems arising when 
people work for several employers on the basis of 
fixed-term contracts. I cannot see how the concept of 
dismissal can relate to that mode of working. Will the 
hon. Gentleman elucidate on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman has exposed some 
of the difficulties. He is right to say that many people 
have overlapping contract arrangements we will debate 
the matter on a later clause which relate substantially to 
their right to work rather than generally to the provision 
of a service to the companies involved. It is a contingent 
matter whether those arrangements coincide, and whether 
companies want to terminate contracts at the end of the 
fixed term or a reasonable presumption can be made that 
the contract is to be continued. It may be impossible to 
give equality of treatment to individual cases, not least 
because the fixed-term contracts may have different 
durations. As I understand it, the Minister is not 
proposing except in the generic term that I have asked 
him to explain to reduce the fixed-term contract 
entitlement to the lower period of a year, because that 
would not cut into the general entitlement on unfair 
dismissal. Will the Minister speak about that? We need to 
realise that the matter is complex, but that employees need 
to be treated on a basis that is fair and not discriminatory.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will want to emphasise that 
at the back of his mind it is explicit in "Fairness at 
Work"	 and some of the explanatory material is a worry 
that people will produce what for shorthand I will call 
phoney contracts bogus fixed-term contracts. Such 
contracts are designed simply to avoid ever getting to the 
point at which employment rights are created. I do not 
like that practice, and I believe that later we will have an 
opportunity to discuss how it cuts in and the implications 
of trying to stop it.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Wills):</b> As the hon. Members for Daventry 
(Mr. Boswell) and for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) have 
been meticulous in declaring their interests, I shall follow 
their example. I currently employ two part-time workers 
and one full-time worker. I retain a limited financial 
involvement in the independent television production 
company that I set up 12 years ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Name?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> It is called Juniper Communications Ltd. I 
am sure that you are familiar with it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, I am not. However, undoubtedly 
I will become so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am sure that you will, Mrs. Dunwoody, if 
the hon. Member for Buckingham has anything to do with 
the matter.
<P>
I retain a limited financial involvement in the company, 
as my wife is employed by it and I have an outstanding 
loan to it. We also lease premises to the company.
<P>
I will now address the concerns raised by the hon. 
Member for Daventry. Clause 17 is relatively 
straightforward. An employee working under a genuine 
fixed-term contract is normally engaged to carry out a 
specific job. If his or her contract is not renewed when 
the term expires, that is because his or her position and 
not that of another person has become redundant. 
Should the employee complain to an employment tribunal 
that he or she has been unfairly selected for dismissal or 
redundancy because his or her employer did not consider 
selecting someone else, the tribunal would be unlikely to 
uphold the complaint, unless, of course, the employee was 
selected for a prohibited reason, such as trade union 
membership or in relation to Sunday shop work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Will the Minister confirm that a 
fixed-term contract applies correctly to a fixed piece of 
work? When the work is finished, so is the contract, 
therefore there can be noon question of unfair dismissal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will give me a 
moment, I will shortly address that mater in greater detail.
<P>
I hope to reassure the hon. Member for Daventry that 
his amendment is unnecessary. When a genuine 
fixed-term contract relating to a particular time-limited 
job is entered into, the employer will be able to dismiss 
the employee when the job ends, at the time expected 
by both of them. However, if fixed-term employees are 
genuinely recruited not for specific assignments but for 
open-ended work a lot of which has occurred in recent 
years as a result of changes in the labour market there 
is no reason why such employees should not be able to 
complain, if they have colleagues on open-ended contracts 
who are not considered for redundancy. That is logical.
<P>
Amendment No. 109 suggests that a fixed-term contract 
worker whose job was continuing could be selected for 
redundancy in place of an employee whose job was 
actually redundant. There may be circumstances in which 
it is quite proper for the employee who is made redundant 
not to be the one whose job has disappeared. However, it 
would be wrong to rule out any consideration of the 
second employee. The abolition of unfair dismissal 
waivers is intended to counter precisely those abuses that 
can result when fixed-term employees are recruited for 
open-ended work.
<P>
I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman, and that 
he will now withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): 
Some years ago, just before Christmas 1985, I worked at 
the Boots store in the Arndale centre in Manchester. 
Whether it was because my work was so splendid or for 
other reasons, rather than ending my fixed-term contract 
on 24 December as originally planned, Boots kept me and 
some other employees on to assist during the January 
sales. Our term of employment went beyond the fixed 
term originally agreed and some people on permanent 
contracts may have felt aggrieved if they, rather than we, 
had been selected for redundancy at the end of January.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am not clear about the precise point of the 
hon. Gentleman's contribution, but in the circumstances 
that he describes, he would not have qualified under the 
proposal as the qualifying period is a year. At that point 
he was no doubt about to resume his illustrious 
academic career.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the Minister has 
resumed his seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I welcome the 
Minister's maiden speech in the Committee, and the 
clarity and charm with which he made it. I hope that in 
his second contribution he will further clarify matters that 
have arisen during the debate.
<P>
The Minister's explanation prompted me to make a 
speech. There are many Ministry of Defence workers in 
my constituency who were made redundant by the 
Government some time ago and then taken back on 
one-year, fixed-term contracts. One of those workers 
wrote to me recently saying that he had been on four 
one-year, fixed-term contracts and was being made 
redundant because the Navy-based, uniformed staff were 
moving away from Portland and civilian workers were no 
longer needed on the site. My Constituent asked whether 
the Government were treating him unfairly because some 
people were being transferred to other, full-time MOD 
employment in Dorset. Would the Minister please respond 
to such genuine anxieties? I am sorry if he gives comfort 
to my constituent but causes alarm in the MOD, but I 
should like to know what impact the provisions will have 
on people in my constituent's position.
<P>
The reason for the fixed-term contracts was that the 
Government knew that eventually they would not need as 
many civilian workers at Portland. In fact, because the 
situation continued for so long, some people who were 
given permanent contracts to work for the MOD at 
Portland had worked for only a couple of years. My 
constituent had worked for four years on a fixed-term 
contract, and more than a dozen years as a permanent 
member of MOD staff. How will the proposal affect my 
constituent?

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Pearson </B>(Dudley, South): It would be helpful 
if the Minister would say how the clause will apply in 
practice 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a difficult Committee 
Room. I ask hon. members to speak up and to address 
the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pearson:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. The matter 
on which I seek clarification is whether the clause could 
be evaded by unscrupulous employers who, instead of 
issuing one-year contracts, decide to issue 51-week or 
364-day contracts to get round the legislation? I have not 
read the relevant section of the Employment Rights Act 
1996 to know whether that is the case, but it would help 
the Committee if that could be clarified.
<P>
Without wishing to invade the territory of a stand part 
debate, I welcome the clause. As the hon. Member for 
Daventry said, it is correct that redundancy rights are not 
included in the ambit of the clause. There is a difference 
between unfair dismissal rights and redundancy rights and 
it would be unreasonable if employers who had taken on 
an individual for a one-year or longer-term contract were 
faced with redundancy payments under the legislation. I 
think that the Government have got it right.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I welcome the Minister's maiden speech 
in Committee. He has now lost his Committee virginity; 
it was not much use to him while he had it, but 
nevertheless there is no going back to it. I listened intently 
to what he had to say. As he knows, it provoked thoughts 
on the Opposition Benches. If I understood him correctly, 
he drew a distinction between those on short-term 
contracts who were charged with the performance of 
measurable and quantifiable tasks and those whose work 
was potentially of a longer-term nature and more difficult 
concretely to measure or define. I am concerned with the 
second category. My concern is a straightforward one 
which I hope the Minister will be able to allay. My 
anxiety is that a no doubt inadvertent result of the 
proposals is that a considerable number of senior and 
highly-paid employees on fixed-term contracts will pursue 
cases under the Bill. I doubt that that is the Minister's 
intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Has my hon. Friend noticed that the 
Government's initial proposals to lift the limit on unfair 
dismissal proceedings, and their revised proposals to set a 
cap of £50,000 on compensation, ran the risk of benefiting 
almost exclusively those in the position to which he 
referred rather than those whom we can for shorthand call 
the horny-handed sons of toil?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful 
point. I always thought it curious that the Government 
were proposing such an arrangement and that it must 
have resulted from confusion rather than calculation on 
the part of the right hon. Member for Derby, South 
(Mrs. Beckett) in fairness, it is right to say that since 
her departure from the Department of Trade and 
Industry, the right hon. Member for Hartlepool
(Mr. Mandleson) and the current Secretary of State for 
Trade and Industry the right hon. Member for Tyneside, 
North (Mr. Bayers) have seen sense, at least to the 
extent of deciding against removing the cap. We still 
have grave concerns about the potential expense and 
about the possible pursuit of vexatious complaints, but 
the situation is better than it was. My point to the 
Minister remains relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Does the hon. Gentleman 
not understand that the qualification for unfair dismissal 
has nothing to do with the level of compensation or cap? 
One is either unfairly dismissed or one is not 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been reasonably tolerant, 
but we have limited time and we must not discuss other 
clauses. I hope that the hon. Member for Buckingham will 
address the amendment specifically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I certainly shall, Mrs. Dunwoody. I never 
intended to stray in the first place I was tempted by 
extraneous elements that I wished to have nothing to do 
with.
<P>
The point made by the hon. Member for Eccles about 
the fundamental difference between unfair dismissal and 
compensation is quite right, and I need not dwell on it. 
My concern is that because of the Government's 
proposals, quite a lot of people, who are extremely highly 
paid, could falsely claim unfair dismissal. I invite the 
Minister to recognise that these proposals are unlikely to 
be of any significant benefit to the vast majority of people. 
The people whose cause the Minister is, inadvertently or 
otherwise, advancing are very highly paid. They know 
perfectly well that a fixed-term contract means that they 
could be out on their ear at the end of it. I am genuinely 
confused as to why the Government are so anxious to 
cosset such individuals. It is an extraordinary inversion of 
what one would usually expect from a Labour 
Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> A vast range of people are employed on 
a fixed-term basis to provide services, rather than to 
having an input into a production process. It is common 
for people to provide such services on a daily or monthly 
basis. Providing a service is not defined as a job and 
finish to use the vernacular; in the case of a marketing 
service or an accounting service, the people providing it 
are employees. I appreciate that anyone working for an 
employer is an employee, but a service provider could be 
working for several employers.
<P>
I want to tease out from the Minister whether the 
Government have recognised that the people who provide 
such services could be made vulnerable. Are they covered 
by the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> You were quite right, of course,
Mrs. Dunwoody. My intervention earlier was far too 
long, but there was such evident fascination with my 
personal experience 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that we are absolutely 
absorbed in the employment procedures of Boots the 
Chemist, but it would help if the hon. Gentleman would 
stick with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is precisely the 
relevance of my experience that I am seeking to bring to 
the Committee. I do not think that the Minister's response 
adds up because he relied entirely on the specific 
circumstances that I raised, rather than on the vast number 
of comparable, and somewhat similar, circumstances that 
are important in the labour market as a whole. To say that 
my example is not an issue because it relates to a period 
of perhaps only three or four months of employment 
misses the point. Wherever the line is drawn for unfair 
dismissal, it can become an issue whether the period is 
three months plus one month, or 2 months plus one 
month. I was working in my gap year. I could have 
continued in employment for more than the 12-month 
period to which the Minister alluded, so my point is 
relevant on a personal basis.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham referred 
to the benefit that the Government may be seeking to 
bring to highly paid people on fixed-term contracts. The 
clause gives greater reason why employers should be 
wary of allowing employment contracts to roll beyond the 
12 months envisaged in the Bill. It risks a greater 
disbenefit to people on short-term contracts, which is of 
much more concern in this instance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend has prompted a further 
thought. Is there not a serious danger that the 
Government's proposals will encourage a number of 
highly-paid employees on short-term contracts to ensure 
that there is provision in their contracts for substantial 
pay-offs in the event that they are not renewed? Would 
that not bring to the fore a problem that has been 
prominent in recent years, and which has been greeted 
with widespread opprobrium by the public? I refer, of 
course, to large rewards for obvious failure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am pleased to have prompted that 
thought in my hon. Friend's fertile mind, but I shall return 
to the specific issue, which probably relates to a far 
greater number of employees. Indeed, I raise this point 
not from the perspective of a public policy under which 
highly paid professionals might benefit inadvertently 
although people might think that unwelcome but 
because the Government might create a problem for a 
large number of lower-paid people.
<P>
The Government are removing from employers the 
flexibility that may lead to full-time employment. 
Perhaps, in certain circumstances, an extra month's pay is 
important. By resisting the amendment, the Government 
will add to the pressure on businesses to terminate 
contracts within 12 months.
<P>
The Minister seemed to introduce the idea of a 
type-of-work test. That is a remarkable suggestion 
certainly, it would be difficult to police practically. To 
suggest that a person on a fixed-term contract is 
necessarily performing a specific and finite task is a 
remarkable assertion, which is not borne out by 
experience in the labour market. Many more fixed-term 
contracts are awarded to augment the supply of labour for 
work that is already being done. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Daventry had precisely those circumstances 
in mind when he tabled the amendment.
<P>
We are dealing with cases where the work being done 
is precisely comparable between a person on a fixed-term 
contract and a person in permanent or long-term 
employment. It is common sense that an employer should 
be able to decide whether people whose fixed-term 
contracts have ended should continue their employment, 
rather than those already in permanent employment.
<P>
Perhaps the Minister has worked in the type of business 
that lends itself to closed-project working. However, he 
has inadvertently closed the door to a far wider set of 
circumstances. Hon. Members should be concerned about 
people who work for a fixed term in the hope that that 
might become a longer-term arrangement, but the 
employer is not certain of the financial viability of a 
long-term arrangement. We find ourselves at the margin 
where the Government might make it less, not more, 
likely that people will go into long-term work if that is 
their wish.

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am rather overwhelmed to hear quite so 
many thoughts from Opposition Members. I hope that 
they have not exhausted themselves too early. [Hon. 
Members: "No."	] Good we are in for a long and 
fruitful debate.
<p>I shall address my remarks first to the hon. Member for 
South Dorset. Of course, the Government will be subject 
to the provisions of the Bill, as will other employers. 
Obviously, he would not expect me to comment on any 
individual constituency case in Committee. If he writes to 
me, I shall be happy to pursue the case in the appropriate 
quarters. I hope that we can move on from that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South
(Mr. Pearson) is concerned about continuity and 
employers taking advantage of the provision. However, 
employment tribunals will be able to establish whether 
continuity of employment has been preserved when a 
break has been designed simply to circumvent rights. Of 
course, that will have to be considered in the light of 
circumstances case by case. In some circumstances, work 
may genuinely come to an end and be resumed shortly 
afterwards. That will be for employment tribunals to find 
on case by case.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was moved by the hon. Member for Buckingham's 
sudden conversion to the cause of the poor, the down 
trodden, the exploited and the abused in the work force. 
I hope that his conversion is genuine. His anxieties are 
unnecessary. We are an inclusive party and I am delighted 
to welcome him into the big tent.
<P>
The provisions will benefit all workers, but I say again, 
only when there is a case for unfair dismissal. That is the 
key point. No employment tribunal will find in favour of 
a case brought on vexatious or other grounds, unless it 
represents a genuine case for unfair dismissal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Opposition Members have had so many 
thoughts already this morning that I would like to move 
on.
<P>
Concern has been expressed about where the line for 
unfair dismissal should be drawn. I apologise to the hon. 
Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) for 
having been so fascinated by his experience that I focused 
entirely on Boots the Chemist. I should like to draw his 
attention to the modern labour market, in which 
fixed-term contracts will not be determined solely by 
employers fudging and mudging in attempts to avoid 
conferring particular employment rights. That is true for 
the most part, at least, though there is a risk of it 
happening. the legislation is designed to mitigate against 
such a risk [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We should sit down when 
members of the Committee are speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Thank you, Madam Dunwoody 
[Laughter.] I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> By all means, call me Madam. All 
sorts of people do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I was following the tradition of gross 
flattery, which seems already to have been adopted.
<P>
Modern employers will not be so short-sighted as to 
dismiss productive staff simply to prevent them from 
qualifying for employment rights. If they do, they will 
quickly find that they cannot recruit and maintain the 
motivated and skilled work force that they need to 
succeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister did answer, but I would like 
to posit a particular scenario and invite his response. Let 
us consider the example of a chief executive of a public 
relations company who is employed on a fixed-term 
contract, at the end of which the company dispenses with 
his services. Given that his tasks are not easily 
measurable, would such an employee be able to pursue a 
case of unfair dismissal under the Government's 
proposals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If the contract has come to an end in line 
with the expectations of both employee and employer, as 
I said in my opening remarks, there would be no case 
for unfair dismissal. The only circumstances in which the 
clause will come into effect is where there is a genuine 
case for unfair dismissal. That is the position, and I am 
baffled why the hon. Member for Daventry has such 
difficulty in grasping the difference between dismissal and 
unfair dismissal. If it is my fault, I have no doubt that the 
hon Gentleman will enlighten me further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I first congratulate the Minister on 
his opening contribution to the Committee's deliberations. 
However, for all his clarity, he has not quite answered all 
the concerns of my hon. Friends and myself. He referred 
to the concept of fixed work coming to an end in a finite 
term. I quite understand why he did that and it is in 
keeping with the concerns of his hon. Friends and others 
about bogus fixed employment contracts. His attempt to 
underwrite that with a new test cannot be as objective as 
the tests that are set out in current legislation. If a person 
has waived his employment rights, that is a matter of fact 
and can be verified easily. The Minister is effectively 
saying that it will be a matter for the tribunal to assess 
when an aggrieved ex-employee at the end of a fixed term 
chooses to try his or her fortunes at an employment 
tribunal. The Minister will know from other parts of the 
Bill that the stakes in employment tribunals on matters of 
unfair dismissal have been raised, which makes it a 
relatively more attractive option.
<P>
A concern that goes more deeply than the Minister's 
dismissal of it suggests relates to the new doctrine that 
will preclude people from opting out of the law in respect 
of unfair dismissal rights while retaining their ability to 
do so with respect to redundancy rights. That should make 
it relatively less attractive for people working on 
fixed-term contracts to make claims, but a fine balance 
needs to be struck.
<P>
When we move on to the next clause we will be able 
to debate some of the economic implications of part-time 
work. It may be appropriate to raise those concerns again 
then. In order not to prolong our considerations now, 
however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, except where there is justification on the grounds of increased 
costs to an employer rising from employing more than one part-time 
employee in place of a comparable full-time employee.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I proceed with a slightly different 
consideration with respect to part-time workers. From the 
tenor of our earlier discussions, the Committee will be 
aware that many of the issues are quite closely related to 
the proceeding ones and I do not intend to re-open them. 
However, the Bill contains a statement of principle and 
Opposition Members are concerned about whether it will 
help to achieve the Government's objectives. Our 
amendments reflect that concern.
<P>
The general principles of the regulations set out in 
clause 18(1) are such that no reasonable person could take 
exception to them. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State shall make regulations for the purpose of 
securing that persons in part-time employment are treated, for such 
purposes and to such extent as the regulations may specify, no less 
favourably than persons in full-time employment."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That objective is entirely acceptable. The difficulty lies, 
of course, in the implementation and the detail.
<P>
It will be within the experience of many members of 
the Committee that employing part-time persons is not the 
same as employing full-time persons. We are talking not 
about employers who are contriving part-time 
employment as a means of avoiding having to confer 
rights but about business people who have to take an 
objective decision as to whether to employ two or more 
part-time workers or one full-time worker. A different 
pattern of costs and benefits will obtain in each case. A 
good commercial case can often be made for part-time 
employment. I repeat that opting for part-time work may 
not be a means of evading or diluting employment rights. 
The explanatory notes make it clear that statutory 
employment rights are secured across the part-time sector 
as they are across the full-time sector. There may be a 
good reason why it is sensible to have two people working 
part time, rather than one working full-time. For example, 
as I said earlier, a firm may wish to continue to employ 
someone who has reached the statutory retirement age 
because he has been associated with the business for many 
years. It might therefore offer him part-time employment, 
carrying less responsibility and requiring less 
commitment. The resulting differences in cost for the 
employer have been noted in my amendment and, acutely, 
in that of my hon. Friend the Member of Altrincham and 
Sale, West.
<P>
Amendment No. 110 is a probing amendment; if there 
is an appropriate pattern of employment, remuneration or 
conditions for part-time workers that is not identical to 
that available to the full-timers, it is not in itself unfair. It 
should at least be a factor to be taken into account in the 
regulations. I shall make more general points about the 
regulation making powers in the clause in the stand part 
debate.
<P>
I have not checked the current position with the 
Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales, but I 
understand that for any given level of skill or work 
activity, the prescribed minimum rates of pay in the 
orders they are modified by the provisions of the 
national minimum wage are different for part-timers and 
for full-timers. The explanatory notes and documents on 
the clause make it clear that the regulations will bite on 
the issue of pay too. That is an interesting implication 
because, from my experience of the industry, it seems that 
there may be cases in which the productivity of the 
part-time, casual worker who is taken on at harvest time 
to assist the full-time employees may be lower than that 
of a full-time employee, so there is at least a basis for 
some discrimination. My amendment and, I suspect, that 
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and 
Sale, West, would provide that when it is appropriate to 
discriminate it should not be impossible to do so. I hope 
that the Minister will consider the amendment in that 
light.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I should tell my hon. Friend that it was not 
acuteness on my part that led me to identify the issue, 
but the fact that the Employment Sub-Committee of the 
Education and Employment Committee of which the hon. 
Member for Wentworth and I are members, has been 
taking evidence on part-time work for some time and is 
close to producing a report.
<P>
I investigated the issue by questioning witnesses and 
found some support for the view that, far from it being 
unfair to those who want to work part-time that their 
employment conditions may be different from those of 
full-time employees for good financial and operational 
reasons, it may be contrary to the interests of those who 
wish to work part-time if the Government press ahead 
with the Bill as drafted. There may be circumstances that 
are different from those envisaged by the Minister and his 
colleagues in drafting the Bill. Amendment No. 116 is 
intended to be a recognition that in certain circumstances, 
especially in certain businesses and professions, there are 
objective cost grounds on which an employer can justify 
a differential rate of remuneration for a part-time or 
full-time member of staff.
<P>
Obvious examples occur in professions that have 
particularly high training costs to keep staff members up 
to a given level of skill. For instance, the employment 
measures being generated by the Government will result 
in employment lawyers spending a great deal of time 
honing their skills and keeping up to date with all the 
changes. Of course, those changes will bring those 
lawyers enormous commercial benefits.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us examine the situation of two lawyers advising 
clients on the implications of what is likely to become the 
Employment Relations Act, each of them working 
half-time. Most lawyers would tell me that such half-time 
work would amount to more than 35 or 40 hours a week, 
but at least it is well remunerated. The overhead cost of 
maintaining training and knowledge at a level adequate 
for those lawyers to give the advice to which their clients 
are entitled, would be considerably greater than the cost 
of maintaining a similar level of training for a single 
full-time specialist.
<P>
Such costs go beyond the run-of-the-mill costs which 
are always greater when two people are employed instead 
of one and which result from having two sets of personnel 
records and dealing with two lots of PAYE and national 
insurance. The additional training costs for the employer 
could be considerable.
<P>
Periods of intensive retraining may be the result of 
legislative changes impacting on lawyers who advise on 
employment relations. During such periods, lawyers may 
put in a large number of unproductive, non fee-earning 
hours to keep up with legal developments. It is entirely 
reasonable that an employer should be able to reflect that 
situation in the levels of remuneration that are paid to 
full-time and part-time workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that even a 
simple, less exalted task, such as administering a payroll, 
is likely to cost more for two part-time workers than for 
a single individual?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I strongly agree. That matter affects 
practically all part-time work. Indeed, it raises a wider 
question with regard to the theme that I was developing 
on the impact of legislation.
<P>
Over the past few months, business has complained, 
ever more loudly, about the weight of regulation that the 
Government are loading onto it. In such circumstances, 
the additional cost of maintaining suitable working-time 
and minimum-wage records builds onto the unit cost of 
employment. The cost arises from having an employee, 
not from the number of hours worked or from the period 
of time productively expended.
<P>
Such matters extend beyond the law. When I was taking 
evidence for the Select Committee on Education and 
Employment, I put the issue to senior members of the 
medical profession, which must clearly maintain training 
levels. Some countered that it did not matter because we 
had the national health service, the employees of which 
could return to full-time work later. However, we are 
legislating for the future, and the measure will apply to 
those who are in private practice, as well as those who 
are exclusively in national health contracts.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry raised the 
matter of those who are employed at a less exalted level. 
Will the Minister consider the situation of those employed 
in certain manufacturing processes? An example that was 
brought in public evidence to the Employment Select 
Committee was that of knitwear manufacturers, where the 
changeover in shift from one operator to another, 
involving dead time on the machine, incurs costs. Again, 
we are talking about a real, quantifiable loss of 
productivity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): The 
hon. Gentleman is right. That process does involve dead 
time, but is there not also a measurable financial benefit 
to the employer in such changeovers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who 
has knowledge of the textiles industry, but I fear that we 
are getting into philosophical territory. My view generally 
is that the employer is better able to judge such benefit 
than members of the Committee. There may be 
circumstances in which a changeover is beneficial to an 
employer, but there are many instances in which as I 
think the hon. Gentleman accepted it necessarily 
involves cost. To change shift twice in an eight, 10 or 
12-hour period rather than once involves a measurably 
increased cost to the employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry to trouble my hon. Friend 
again, but does he not agree that there is an important 
safety argument for spending time on a proper briefing at 
the changeover to eliminate risk to the incoming 
employees?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Indeed there is. We may identify the 
unintended consequences of not doing so. Some important 
safety or other procedures may be compressed and 
squeezed out of the timetable and made less effective by 
a change in the law. That change is meant to be beneficial 
to the employee but may ultimately carry a cost to the 
individual in financial, employment or health and safety 
terms.
<P>
I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments 
on piece-work. In theory, there is no question to answer 
because one is paid for producing a given part or 
machining a given item, but the situation in practice is 
different. I shall not go into the detail of my even earlier 
experience in heavy engineering, because that might lead 
me forwards to the time when I assisted a vet in bovine 
fertility I am sure that the Minister would not wish me 
to go into that but from my experience of piece-work 
when I worked in the production control office of a heavy 
engineering company, I know that the practical approach 
to the execution of piece-work and the payment of those 
engaged in such work is not always dependent on the 
number of units produced. If a task is regularly performed, 
payment is sometimes dependent on a presumed level of 
productivity, and sometimes on a combination of a 
minimum of take-home pay with an additional element 
for piece-work. In such circumstances, how could one 
practically measure the comparative levels of pay and 
treatment between an employee engaged in full-time 
piece-work and two employees, for example, doing the 
same work on a part-time basis? What are the implications 
of that, particularly where there is a presumed minimum 
weekly income, which may again be questionable for two 
employees rather than one, given the cost of setting up 
pieces of equipment and so on?
<P>
The Government for laudable reasons, I am sure 
believe that the clause will add to the quality of work for 
part-time employees, raise the status of part-time working 
and probably increase the total volume of part-time work 
in the economy. However, I fear that they do not accept 
the commercial reality that, in some circumstances, such 
a remuneration package could involve an employment 
cost. If the Government do not accept that, they will be 
doing a grave disservice to part-time workers; more 
important, they will discourage the development of 
part-time working in the economy.
<P>
The Minister of State will be aware that the principal 
growth area in employment is in part-time work 
something for which the Labour party used to criticise the 
previous Government. However, that growth may mask 
a decline in full-time employment, and to proceed with 
legislation that may make part-time working less viable 
for employers is folly.
<P>
The Government would be wise to accept the 
amendments, which seek simply to allow reasonable 
flexibility if it is justified. Neither my hon. Friend the 
member for Daventry or I seek to provide a charter for 
unreasonable behaviour; we seek simply to set a 
threshold if there is objective justification. Under 
amendment No. 116, such a justification could be made 
on cost grounds, which would be readily quantifiable. 
I do not see how the Government can frame an 
argument against the fact that measurable justifications 
might apply in certain circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Laxton </B>(Derby, North): The thrust of the 
argument of the hon. members for Daventry and for 
Altrincham and Sale, West would weaken the protection 
that the regulations would give part-time workers. The 
hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West argued that 
there might be objective reasons for a pro rata differential 
in the remuneration of part-time workers. From a moral 
standpoint, that it is difficult to justify. I acknowledge that 
part-time working seems to be growing. It obviously suits 
employers to take people into part-time employment, 
otherwise we should not have seen such growth in 
part-time work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> Let me first expand my argument. The 
arrangement clearly suits part-time workers. I realise that 
part-time workers are not exclusively women, but a large 
proportion of women want to return to work to make a 
contribution to the economy and to the financial position 
of their families. If an employer employs two people 
instead of one, it will result in additional costs for 
instance, the costs of keeping personnel records, of PAYE 
and of administration. However, if it suits the employer 
to employ two part-time workers instead of one and if 
it also suits the employee why should one morally 
expect the employee to bear the costs? The hon. Member 
for Altrincham and Sale, West made it clear that the 
employee should be expected to bear the costs. I am 
certainly not prepared to support that argument.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's 
views about morality. Let us suppose that a senior lawyer 
who earns £120,000 a year works alongside two senior 
lawyers who have the same qualifications, who each earn 
£60,000 a year for two-and-a-half days a week. Will he 
consider the morality of the situation in which the 
employer recognises that he must lose one day a week for 
six months to train each of those employees to a given 
standard in a certain subject, perhaps because of a change 
in legislation?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> That judgment must be taken by the 
employer. If the employer genuinely believes that an 
inordinate amount of time will be lost because of activities 
associated with training people or keeping them up to 
speed, it should be up to the employer to decide whether 
there should be one part-time employee, two part-time 
employees or one full-time employee. Employers have to 
make such judgments.
<P>
I was surprised by some of the contributions that have 
been made. The hon. Member for Daventry said at the 
outset that our objectives under clause 18 were acceptable. 
He then sought to qualify them and talked about the 
Agricultural Wages Board, minimum payments and other 
such arrangements. We receive views from various 
quarters, and the latest one to come out of my fax machine 
concerning the wages provision was from the 
Confederation of British Industry. It said that the clause 
gives the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Secretary of State the power to ensure that part-time workers 
receive the same pay rates, on a pro rata basis, as their full time 
counterparts; this is necessary because the original part-time work 
Directive did not cover pay."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CBI accepts that pay should be covered by the 
regulations. In general, it seems content with that situation 
and gives the impression that it is desirable. It is almost 
rooting for some specific clarification in that direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Given that clause 18 requires broadly 
equal treatment between full and part-time employees, 
only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for such purposes and to such extent as the regulations may 
specify"	,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will the hon. Gentleman concede that there are some 
circumstances in which differential treatment may be 
legitimate and appropriate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> I have some difficulty in conceding the 
circumstances to which the hon. Gentleman refers, as he 
was general rather than specific. With your agreement, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, he can speak if he wants to. I should be 
interested to hear him spell out those circumstances. I 
cannot read his mind, and would not want to even if I 
could, as it would probably cause me too many internal 
psychological problems. I see no case for reducing 
protection for people who choose to work part-time and 
whom employers choose to employ on a part-time basis, 
as amendments Nos. 110 and 116 are intended to do. 
Part-time employment is a growth area of the economy. 
Morally, those employees have an absolute right to 
equality of conditions of employment with people who 
work full-time. I therefore shall not support either 
amendment, but as the hon. Member for Daventry 
suggested that amendment No. 110 was a probing 
amendment, it is likely to be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brain Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I had not 
intended to contribute, but I thought that it might be 
helpful briefly to give an example from my company of 
22 employees. As a family company, we try to be 
reasonable in dealing with our employees. That is our 
practice, built up over the years. I have a little chat with 
employees approaching retirement and say, "Tom, would 
you like to continue to work for us over the next few 
years. How do you feel?"	 I mention that as an example 
of how some small family companies operate. It is the 
culture of my company to tell such employees that we are 
sorry that they are going, and to ask whether they would 
like to stay and work a few hours each week. More often 
than not, they want to stay. I do that partly as a way of 
respecting their long service. We are well know as a 
company that looks after its employees, without sounding 
too patrician, and that is one of the ways in which we do 
so. It works well on the other side of the coin, because 
such employees are experienced. I currently employ two 
such people with people following on from them 
whose experience makes the handover period successful 
because they know the job, having worked for 20 or 30 
years for the company. I thought that it might be helpful 
to mention such cases, especially in relation to the 
amendments. The arrangement suits both parties, and 
creates no problems. On the other side of the coin, such 
employees do not press me and demand their pound of 
flesh, because they are happy with the implications of 
being a part-time employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for sharing his 
valuable experience with the Committee, which is 
probably indicative of how many small and medium 
businesses operate. Can he envisage circumstances in 
which perhaps not in his company, but in another 
enterprise an employee with long service is ready to 
retire, and the employer wants to offer that employee a 
benefit for long service, but cannot offer a part-time 
arrangement at precisely the same rate of pay? The 
employee might nevertheless want to accept that benefit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Members of Parliament are 
full-time in this Committee. Perhaps brevity might help 
them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I shall not respond to the hon. 
Gentleman's comments, as circumstances dictate each 
case. The terms and conditions may or may not be as 
he says, but I made the point to illustrate that there are 
relevant examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): I had not intended to 
speak in the debate, but I would like to respond to the 
hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West. He is I 
say this in the privacy of the Committee Room a valued 
member of the Select Committee on Education and 
Employment. He drew heavily on much of the evidence 
that has been presented to it over the past few months. I 
have several points on his amendment No. 116. The issue 
with which it deals is not so much for legislation as for 
decisions made by employers, company by company, 
workplace by workplace. Making business decisions is the 
proper role of employers, and the proper role of the 
Government and Parliament is to set the legislative 
framework in which we expect employers to operate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West 
concentrated as he has done in the Select Committee 
on bolstering the business case against part-time workers. 
He cited the Knitwear Manufacturers Association, whose 
evidence suggested that some companies in its industry 
may have problems with the directive to which clause 18 
applies. In our inquiry, that evidence was outweighed by 
the business case for better conditions and equal treatment 
for part-time workers that was presented by a host of other 
employers and employment associations retail, banking, 
and service industries across the piece. Interestingly and 
increasingly, that case was presented by productive 
industries as well. Time constraints on production 
delivery to customers, and the requirement to be 
responsive to deal with peaks and troughs in orders, have 
meant that employers in such sectors increasingly see the 
value of part-time workers to their businesses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry started our debate by 
saying that the objective of clause 18 was entirely 
acceptable. He said that no reasonable person could take 
exception to the principle that part-timers should be 
treated the same way as full-timers. That is precisely the 
principle of non-discrimination embodied in the European 
directive to which this clause applies.
<P>
We need to be wary of the same siren warnings that we 
heard on the introduction of the Equal Pay Act 1970, 
which we were told would badly hit the employment of 
women. Of course, it did no such thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> That argument is wheeled out frequently, 
and is offensive to women. The act did not have a 
deleterious effect on the employment of women because 
they are as productive as men. The amendments are about 
specific circumstances in which an employee is less 
productive because of time or costs of training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> I hardly think that it is offensive to 
women to argue for equal pay for them, or for equal 
treatment for part-time workers, most of who are women. 
I lay that matter aside.
<P>
We need to be careful on three matters as we translate 
the European directive into domestic law. First, we should 
not create two categories of part-time worker, one 
protected by legislation and one excepted from it.
<P>
Secondly, we should not increase the complexity of 
our legislation's application to business. Amendments 
Nos. 110 and 116 would do that.
<P>
Thirdly, we should not increase Government 
intervention in this territory, which is the proper remit of 
employers. In summary, the argument against the 
amendments, especially amendment No. 116, is simple: 
leave detailed business decisions to business and keep 
parliamentary draftsmen away from them.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I take a far less charitable view of the 
clause. The amendment would sort out the problem to 
some extent. I declare an interest: I employ a part-time 
cleaner in my home. I say that because I shall explain 
how part-time cleaners will be caught by the provision. 
Before I do so, it is important to explain the logic of the 
matter.
<P>
First and foremost, under the Bill, any person taking on 
a part-time employee who is not paid sufficient to come 
within the national insurance minimum will, per se, have a 
different set of conditions for full-time employees. Many 
people want to work for a short enough period not to 
come within the national insurance minima, and such 
part-time employers are not entitled to several state 
benefits. Effectively, the state is putting the employer in 
the impossible position of having to ensure that part-time 
employees have the same terms of employment as 
full-timers. If people are not paying national insurance, 
they are not entitled to certain benefits.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> In a spirit of openness, would my hon. 
Friend care to tell the Committee the terms, including the 
remuneration, on which he benefits from the part-time 
services of his cleaner?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall be happy to do so, but, logically, I 
should come to that towards the end of my speech, and 
my remarks will be relevant to the amendment.
<P>
I take issue with the Government because, under the 
clause, they will give a right to part-timers that full-timers 
will not have. Many full-time employees would say that 
their contracts do not allow them the privilege of going 
home early and starting later. The clause will create a 
privileged group of people by stating that part-time 
workers must be as well off as full-timers in every 
particular, and I suspect that full-timers will be very 
unhappy about that. Perhaps the Minister can reassure us 
that he will not go down that route in the regulations.
<P>
The amendment is intended to find whether there is an 
economic reason why it is unacceptable for an employer 
to consider cost when deciding whether to employ a 
part-timer or a full-timer. The hon. Member for Derby, 
North (Mr. Laxton) made an interesting comment about 
who should and who should not pay for that, but that is 
not the issue.
<P>
The majority of part-time jobs in offices involve an 
employer providing a work station, which must have a 
computer and so on. The employer will consider the cost 
of getting a number of units of work out of a particular 
office set-up when deciding whether to employ someone 
full-time or part-time. He will rely on market forces.
<P>
I thought that all hon. Members had accepted that 
market forces should not be willy-nilly gainsaid. 
However, an employer will ask himself, "I want people 
to do the work for my customers. How can I best provide 
that?"	 In many cases, the individual will say, "I can't get 
enough good quality staff to work for me full-time, so I'll 
look at the possibilities of setting up more 
expensively the facilities to provide part-time 
employment."	
<P>
I used to run an employment agency, which I have 
mentioned before. The filing cabinets in my office were 
stuffed full of application forms from women who wanted 
to work part-time. The attractiveness of part-time work to 
women who also have the job of home maker and look 
after children is enormous. They want to work from 10 
until 2 or 3, or whatever suits school hours. Market forces 
say that such individuals want to down-shift their life 
styles and that they are willing to work part-time for lower 
wages and in poorer conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall finish my speech in my own way. I 
am glad to see that I have the attention of Labour 
Members.
<P>
Such individuals are reacting to market forces. 
Employers may prefer employees to work a long shift, but 
they, too, are acting on market forces by saying, "If I can 
get good, high quality people who are currently at home 
because they cannot work full-time, I will set up a scheme 
that is attractive to employees who want to work 
part-time."	 It may cost the employer more to do that as 
he may not get the productivity out of the work station 
whether that is a factory machine or a computer.
<P>
I saw the reaction of Labour Members as they leapt to 
their feet, saying, "That's terrible,"	 but the next clause 
is about encouraging people to work part-time. We want 
family-friendly policies. the full-time employee, who is 
willing to be at work from 9 in the morning until 5.30 
possibly at his inconvenience will not think it fair that 
people who are willing to work for a great deal less will 
have exactly the same pay and conditions.
<P>
The Government are saying, effectively, that, although 
they do not have to include pay under the European 
legislation, they want to include it. Therefore, for every 
hour that the part-time employee in a equal-status job 
works, he should receive the same amount of money as a 
full-time employee. The Government are moving against 
market forces. What is wrong with an employer looking 
at the marketplace and saying, "How can I get that work 
done, if I have to make sure that I fulfil all the 
Government's criteria offering £3.60 an hour, holiday 
pay, and everything else?"?
<P>
<B>Ms Sandra Osborne (Ayr):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman 
give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stewart:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall make my own speech in my own 
way. I know that our time is limited.
<P>
The Committee is missing an important issue. Labour 
Members laugh and imagine that my concern is the 
foolish twitching of the right wing of the Conservative 
party, but it is the reality of market forces, which must be 
taken into account.
<P>
I shall cite a couple of examples, as promised earlier. 
Many supermarkets take on employees on part-time 
contracts. Let us say that the full-time employee of the 
supermarket usually work five days between Monday and 
Saturday and, for that, they are on single-rate pay. If the 
employer wants to encourage his full-time workers to 
work on a Sunday, he may pay double time, or at least a 
premium, for Sunday working. However, there are many 
people, such as students, who want to work on Saturdays 
and Sundays because they have other things to do from 
Monday to Friday. Usually, the supermarket will set up a 
rate of pay for people to work on a Sunday either to fill 
the shelves or to run the supermarket itself but that rate 
is not double the standard rate during the week. Do the 
Government want to go down the road of saying that 
someone taken on only on a Sunday at a particular rate of 
pay in particular circumstances must not be discriminated 
against in relation to a full-timer who is working overtime 
on that particular Sunday? I doubt it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> No, I will continue my speech.
<P>
Another important issue relates to an employer taking 
on a part-time cleaner. Let me explain. A cleaner comes 
into my home for a few hours each week and, for some 
time, that person has been on benefit. A person in those 
circumstances can earn £15 without loss of benefit. It 
provides a good opportunity for a part-timer who is 
looking for full-time work to do a job for a few hours and 
earn £15 completely tax free and perfectly legally.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> How many hours?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister will be grateful to know that 
it is four hours and that I pay well over the minimum rate. 
The individual could be identified so I would prefer not 
to provide too many details.
<P>
I am that person's employer and I also employ two 
full-time staff, who both receive a salary a little more 
than £15 a week paid though the House of Commons 
system, but they are entitled to receive 10 per cent. extra 
paid by the Fees Office into a pension scheme. I decided 
that my part-time worker could have four weeks off 
during the year and receive £15 for each of those weeks 
in holiday pay, but do I now have to tell my part-timer 
that I will have to pay £1.50 a week towards a pension 
scheme? Will that individual have all the employment 
rights of my staff who are paid by the Fees Office? It is 
a single place of work. My cleaner works in the same 
place as my two full-time staff, although the household 
rather than the office is cleaned.
<P>
That is a simple example, which shows that the Bill 
will provide bear traps for perfectly good employers who 
are doing as well as they can. The regulations might lay 
them open to prosecution for criminal offences. I believe 
that I have made a powerful case for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I am delighted to 
follow my hon. Friend for South Dorset who, despite the 
righteous indignation of Government Ministers, makes 
some valuable points. All legislation has a subsequent 
behavioural effect and, sadly, some of the consequences 
pointed out by my hon. Friend dismissed and laughed at 
by Labour Members may well come to fruition, to the 
detriment of our constituents who value the flexible 
employment patterns achieved over the past 20 years.
<P>
I broadly welcome, however, many of the 
Government's objectives for part-time employees, not 
least because it seems that, at last, they value such 
employees. As my hon. Friend the Member for 
Altrincham and Sale, West pointed out earlier, Labour 
Members for many years despised part-time employment 
and believed that it was unacceptable because the jobs 
were not full-time.
<P>
We should recall that around 6.5 million people are 
employed in the part-time economy and I especially 
welcome the fact that pension provision will be made for 
part-time employees, the vast majority of whom are 
women and who, sadly, because of the breakdown in 
family relationships, find themselves in their later years 
without a private income of their own except that which 
is provided by the state. The proposal is a welcome 
extension of employment law.
<P>
Labour Members often say, "Well you had 18 years, 
why didn't you do something,"	 but society changed 
beyond recognition in those 18 years 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is not a stand part debate 
but a specific debate on amendments No. 110 and 116. If 
the hon. Lady wishes to make a speech later on the 
general principles of part-time working, the Committee 
will listen to it with interest.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I understand what you say,
Mrs. Dunwoody. I wanted to make it clear that I 
approved of temporary workers being given extra 
employment rights in many respects, but I feared that 
my remarks might attract the same opprobrium as those 
of my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset, who 
said that there were realities to be faced in giving 
temporary workers greater employment rights, and that 
there should be a balance. The Government should think 
about the impact of their proposals and consider 
accepting the amendments. Flexibility in implementing 
the measure would be welcomed because it may change 
employment patterns.
<P>
The hon. Member for Wentworth, who is not in the 
Committee Room, claimed earlier that Conservative 
Members were against the proposal and that we had said 
that the Equal Pay Act would be a disaster. I welcome 
that Act, but it has not changed things as Labour Members 
believed that it would, because women are still much 
lower paid than men.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> I want the hon. Lady to clarify her 
remarks, as there seems to be a misunderstanding. My 
hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth said that 
Conservative Members argued against the Equal Pay Act 
on the grounds that it would reduce the number of women 
in employment. The matter in question is whether a 
part-time worker should receive the same amount of 
money and the same terms and conditions pro rata as a 
full-time worker in the same job. Although all members 
of the Committee acknowledge that on the whole women 
are paid less than men, it is because of the types of job 
that women do.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am nervous of continuing the Equal 
Pay Act argument for fear of being called to order by the 
Chair. Although I accept some of what the hon. 
Gentleman said, the Act had behavioural effects, one of 
which was to increase part-time working. Because 
part-time workers did not have the same employment 
rights, employers recruited women into part-time work 
with the result that women earned proportionately less 
than male manual workers.
<P>
The Bill will have behavioural effects in respect of 
part-time employment rights. The proposals should be 
implemented sensitively so that its good effects are not 
destroyed. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry raised 
the matter of part-time workers who are over retirement age 
and want to return to work to keep their hand in. The hon. 
Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) took up the 
point, but his conclusion was not clear. There will, 
inevitably, be employers who are not as decent and 
benevolent as the hon. Gentleman, who will be nervous 
about creating employment rights for retired people. Many 
people who are about to retire want the flexibility to keep 
their hand in in a small way. They are keen to be allowed to 
do so without their employer worrying about unacceptable 
employment rights.
<P>
Will the Minister provide reassurance that that will not 
apply to people reaching retirement age? That may help 
terms and conditions to benefit everyone. Retired people 
often want to go back into work. Why should an obstacle 
be created for employers who fear that rights are being 
accrued? We are hardly doing a disservice by considering 
how to apply the rules in a flexible manner.
<P>
Pay differentials have already been addressed. I do not 
wish to compete with my hon. Friend the Member for 
Altrincham and Sale, West, whose employment record is 
fascinating. When I was a student, I worked for Marks 
and Spencer. That company is experiencing difficulties, 
but it was far more fashionable then. Jobs were difficult 
to come by, but I got vacation work as a part-timer. I was 
paid a lower rate of pay per hour than a full-time lady 
with many years' experience who knew the sales routine 
and the location of the stock department.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> I congratulate the hon. lady on being 
more courageous in taking interventions than the hon. 
Member for South Dorset. Does she accept the morality 
that there should be equity in pay between two workers 
one full-time and the other part-time doing the same 
piece of work? Variables should concern the appropriate 
premium for weekend work and the number of hours 
worked. Hourly pay should not be used as the bargaining 
issue between individuals doing exactly the same work.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirdkbride:</B> I am interested in the hon. 
Gentleman's remarks. However, I was not sure whether 
he was responding to the hon. Member for South Dorset 
in saying that weekend rates should be comparable with 
full-time rates. I am not sure what he means.
<P>
Of course, there are cases in which part-time rates 
should be the same as those for full-time workers. 
However, there are also cases in which differential rates 
are justified. Many of the ladies with whom I worked at 
Marks and Spencer would be really cross about an 
itsy-bitsy student earning the same as them, if that student 
did not know where anything was, and they had to tell 
her everything, including the location of the ladies' loo. 
Clearly, such a student as I once was is not as 
productive or as capable of doing the job as they were.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Miss. Kirkbride:</B> I will give way to the hon. Member 
for Oldham, East and Saddleworth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> I seek clarification on the amendment's 
purpose. Is the hon. lady using her example to argue that 
the full-time worker should be paid more because she is 
more skilled and experienced? Or is she arguing that the 
Marks and Spencer worker should get more because she 
works more hours than a part-time worker? The two 
arguments are entirely different.
<P>
Surely the question is, other things being equal, ceteris 
paribus, should a part-time worker be paid the same as a 
full-time worker? She and the hon. Member for South 
Dorset do not accept that principle: she has confirmed his 
twitch. That is an argument against the clause, but it does 
not support the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If Committee members could 
avoid Latin, they would make themselves more popular 
with Hansard. Latin might improve clarity of thought, but 
in this instance it will not help.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am grateful for your approbation, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, because I did not study Latin at school 
or university. I am always nervous when people throw 
Latin words into the conversation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps the hon. Lady would 
like to return to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Labour members and Conservative 
Members view matters differently. Labour Members want 
hard and fast rules, whereas Conservative Members want 
flexibility. Consequently, we foresee certain problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if an 
employer ideally wanted one full-time employee but was 
unable to find one perhaps because, in a small village 
community, no such person was available and that he 
was therefore obliged to employ two part-time workers, 
which was better than nothing, though not as good as his 
preferred choice, it would justify him treating the two 
part-timers slightly less favourably than he would have 
treated a permanent full-time employee?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. 
That was where my remarks were leading.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, 
West has explained in wonderful detail that employers 
might perfectly legitimately have greater costs in 
employing part-time rather than full-time staff. He has a 
great deal more experience of such matters, so I shall not 
go over again the instances when it could arise.
<P>
Although I broadly welcome enhanced rights for 
part-time workers, including pensions rights, I fear that 
the change that it will introduce to the labour market may 
not be welcomed by many of our constituents. Many of 
the working women in my constituency like being able to 
work part-time for reasons that have already been given; 
it fits better with family life, and mothers can pick up 
their children from school and have time to make dinner 
when they get home. It means all sorts of things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I think that I am being told that I 
cannot give way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No; I am happy that the discussion 
should take place, but we are talking about less favourable 
treatment, not whether or not people should work 
part-time.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I obviously accept what you say, 
Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do hope so.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The reason for us talking about less 
favourable treatment and why it is important for the 
Government to take on the notion of less favourable 
treatment in some circumstances is the effect that the 
Bill will have on employers. Forgive me for trying to 
explain my remarks further, Mrs. Dunwoody, especially 
as you have told me off a little, but I believe that it is 
relevant.
<P>
The huge surge in part-time employment has been 
welcomed by the vast majority of people, because they 
like to work part-time, fitting in their work with their 
families. My hon. Friends have said that, instead of 
offering part-time jobs, which suited previously because 
fewer employment regulations were attached, employers 
will want to offer full-time jobs, because they are cheaper 
and easier to administer. That will not necessarily be 
welcomed by those of our constituents who are offered 
full-time jobs at Sainsbury's instead of the part-time jobs 
that they might have been offered in the past. That is why 
we want the Government further to consider exactly how 
they should apply part-time rights for workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope </B>(Corby): I should tell the Committee 
that I used to work for Woolworths rather than Marks and 
Spencer or Boots the Chemists. I hope that the Opposition 
will put the amendment to the vote. I look forward to 
reading Hansard tomorrow morning, particularly the 
remarks of the hon. Member for South Dorset, who 
seemed to make an eloquent case against the amendment. 
It appears that he ran an employment agency, with the 
express purpose of supplying employers with part-time 
workers, mainly women, at a lower rate of pay than other 
workers, which not only exploits those women part-time 
workers but undercuts wage rates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. 
I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. He said that he 
would read Hansard, but he clearly did not listen to me 
because I made none of the remarks that he attributes to 
me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Luckily, the Chairman does not have 
to rule on whether Members of the Committee have read 
Hansard or, indeed, on whether they are capable of 
reading Hansard.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</b> To draw my remarks to a close, I confess that appalling practice. The hon. Gentleman and the 
Opposition obviously wish to allow employment agencies 
to continue unscrupulous bad practice. On Third Reading, 
I shall draw attention to the many part-time workers, 
particularly women, throughout the country who have 
been experiencing such exploitation and who can look 
forward to having it ended forthwith.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry began his 
remarks by saying that the issues were important. Indeed 
they are and I am grateful to Opposition Members and to 
my hon. Friends for raising them, which gives me the 
opportunity to clarify the Government's intentions and, I 
hope, to allay some of the concerns that have been 
expressed.
<P>
The clause provides a power under which the 
Government intend to fulfil their obligations under the 
part- time work directive. The directive sends a powerful 
message that part-time work is not second-class work, but 
a valuable tool in the labour market which can be of 
enormous benefit to businesses and employees. The hon. 
Member for Weston-super-Mare spoke eloquently from 
his experience of how part-time work can genuinely 
benefit businesses; I am sorry that we did not hear more 
about that from Conservative Members. We also heard 
much on the subject from my hon. Friends, who cogently 
explained how part-time work can also benefit employees.
<P>
Part-time workers have a right to be treated on the same 
basis as others; they should not suffer worse treatment 
simply because they work fewer hours. That is the 
fundamental principle behind the clause and behind the 
directive. To digress briefly, we criticised the operation 
of the labour market under the previous Government 
because the sort of part-time work that they encouraged 
did not offer such treatment or the choices and 
opportunities that part-time work can and should offer and 
which the clause is designed to promote.
<P>
However, that basic right to equality does not mean that 
part-time workers should have equal treatment whatever 
the circumstances. That addresses the concerns of the hon. 
Member for South Dorset. The directive recognises that 
there may be objective justification for different 
treatment, just as, for example, employers may be able to 
justify a requirement that impacts more heavily on women 
that men, if there is a good reason for the requirement that 
is unrelated to the employee's sex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Can one take it from that that the level 
of pay or remuneration would be a factor where, in 
principle, an objective justification could be sought or 
pleaded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If I may continue, I think that all will 
become clear to the hon. Gentleman in a moment.
<P>
The clause also recognises the need to provide for such 
justification. In particular, the power in clause 18(1) 
allows for regulations made under it to provide for no less 
favourable treatment
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for such purposes and to such an extent as the regulations may 
specify"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My. right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will use 
that power to ensure that those who have proper 
justification for offering different terms and conditions to 
full and part-time workers are able to do so.
<P>
It follows from that that I am sympathetic to the 
principle behind amendment No. 110.
<P>
However, the amendment is unnecessary because the 
ability to justify different treatment will be spelt out in 
the regulations. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State 
made clear, we shall consult fully on the regulations, 
which will provide an opportunity for those who may be 
affected by them to comment. I assure the Committee that 
today's debate will inform the drafting of the regulations.
<P>
As for amendment No. 116, it follows from my remarks 
that I recognise the point made by the hon. Member for 
Altrincham and Sale, West. His concern with the costs 
of employing part-timers and job-share arrangements, in 
particular, is longstanding. It is clear that employers 
overwhelmingly offer jobs on a part-time basis because it 
suits their business needs and their working arrangements. 
Research shows that cost factors are hardly an issue.
<P>
It may be true, however, that employers who do not 
offer part-time work could be deterred from doing so 
because of unwarranted fears that it would add to their 
costs, but that is rare. While part-time workers require the 
same training and overheads as other workers, they will 
often repay that in terms of their commitment and 
productivity, especially if they are treated well and 
properly valued, which is the crucial point. In many cases, 
they will save costs for employers, as they will be doing 
work that does not need to be undertaken on a full-time 
basis, which enables employers to manage their work 
forces in the most cost-effective way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his 
common-sense approach to the amendments. It is nice to 
hear a little about the practicality of such matters rather 
than the morality, which he clearly rejects in this instance. 
In accepting the point of amendment No. 116, will he 
state explicitly that cost justification might constitute 
objective grounds along the lines that he outlined 
previously?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> All those detailed matters will be dealt with 
in the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I wish to continue for a little while. I do 
not accept the basic philosophical point made by the hon. 
Member for Altrincham and Sale, West that morality and 
common sense are separate. In my mind, they go hand in 
hand, which is what is embodied in the clause. I know 
that the costs of part-time working are close to his heart 
and I wish to deal with that in more detail. Even when a 
full-time job is split to provide two part-time jobs, which 
is one of his particular concerns, employers can often reap 
benefits from such job sharing. For example, two people 
will be working on an issue, bringing their combined 
energy, skills and different experiences to bear on specific 
problems that the job involves. That can often be more 
productive and efficient than having one set of those 
attributes to bear on the job. Cover can be given when 
one of the job sharers is ill or has to attend a domestic 
incident.
<P>
Let us consider the alternative to providing for such an 
arrangement. Employees might be forced to leave the 
labour market or an occupation where they have been 
happy and fulfilled because their domestic circumstances 
have changed or because they can no longer work 
full-time. Employers will lose the benefit of their skills 
and experience of the workplace, and the results of the 
training that has been invested in them. They will incur 
extra costs in recruitment and training.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will bear in mind that, 
despite the advantages that we have heard about today, 
we are legislating not to require employers to offer 
part-time work, but to encourage it. We shall no doubt 
touch on that when we analyse the next clause. The statute 
will not require employers to find part-time jobs when 
that is not an economic viability. It will simply require 
that, when such jobs exist, the employees should have no 
less favourable treatment than colleagues doing equivalent 
work full-time. It is a simple proposition, with morality 
and common sense going hand in hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> If I may continue, as I said, we shall ensure 
that different treatment is not prohibited when it is 
justified. However, for the reasons that I have given, 
employers would have difficulty in justifying 
discriminatory treatment solely on cost grounds. Under 
European law, the costs of non-discrimination cannot of 
themselves justify discriminatory treatment. In practice, 
part-timers are unlikely to cause long-term costs to the 
business but will in fact contribute to its competitiveness. 
In the light of what I have said, I hope that the hon. 
Members for Daventry and for Altrincham and Sale, West 
will consider withdrawing the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been a fascinating and rather 
extended debate, to which I do not want to reply at length. 
It has established above all that, just as we found last year 
in considering the national minimum wage, circumstances 
differ hugely among industries, companies, individual 
jobs, individual employees, and, as has eloquently been 
said, within individuals' careers at different times in their 
profile of working employment. One especially interesting 
suggestion was made by my hon. Friend the Member for 
Bromsgrove (Miss. Kirkbride) arising out of some 
interesting comments from the hon. Member for 
Weston-super-Mare that the regulations which we have 
not seen might contain special provision for part-time 
work following retirement from full-time work.
<P>
Despite earlier exchanges and the assertions of the hon. 
Member for Wentworth, whom I greatly respect for his 
knowledge of industrial affairs, the amendment is about 
flexibility. The Minister made a virtue of that, and said 
that it was already embodied in the clause. It should be 
for an employer to take all circumstances into account in 
setting the terms, conditions and associated pay rates of 
employment. Those factors are all relevant. We welcome 
what the Minister said, almost getting it right, about the 
possibility of that including circumstances and costs. He 
said that that would constitute at least a basis for a 
justification for a discrimination or a difference, to use 
a less loaded term in the arrangements presented to the 
employee. It is my strong view and that of my hon. 
Friends that the employer should be able to calculate the 
pay rate based on the circumstances, and that if he can 
justify that objectively, it should be accepted in litigation. 
It is simple for an employer to legislate in the knowledge 
of the underlying framework provisions. Some of my hon. 
Friends touched on my genuine anxiety about the danger 
of prescription in legislation, which, however much we 
dislike it, often has perverse or even irregular effects. I 
strongly suspect that an employer faced with a crunch 
situation, where he or she wants to discriminate between 
employees on the basis of whether they are part-time or 
full-time, may be placed in the position of which hon. 
Members from both sides of the Committee will not be 
unfamiliar in relation to equal pay legislation, whereby 
efforts may be made to reclassify the job away from 
parity. Given that we agree on the objectives, that would 
be unfortunate.
<P>
I hope that Ministers will consider, perhaps at a later 
stage of the Bill, the fact that what sometimes seems like 
the longueurs of a debate give occasion for a little lateral 
thinking, which it is sometimes necessary to introduce. 
Amendment No. 110 would establish the basis for a 
principled distinction or discrimination between full-time 
and part-time employment. The Committee should 
consider the possibility that the sums could go the other 
way a part-time employee might be paid a more 
favourable rate than full-time employees. Strictly 
speaking, that is not covered by the clause. I am not sure, 
but I suspect that that could fall foul of certain other 
European measures.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In clause 14 and in clauses that we shall debate shortly, 
the Government want a wider definition of "employee"	, 
so they might argue that, for example, agency workers are 
included as employees or workers. For example, agency 
nurses might be paid more than the full-time rate, or the 
rate paid for their work might be higher if agency fees are 
involved. That could create a difficulty if full-time 
workers then claimed the part-time rate.
<P>
It is odd that the clause contains no reciprocal 
restriction. If the Government are going for the principle 
of equality, it should go across the piece, rather than the 
provision stating that part-time workers must not be 
treated detrimentally. Ministers should consider that point. 
No one wants to fall foul of charges of discrimination or 
to impose large costs on an essentially full-time work 
force because of the need to employ extra staff to meet a 
particular peak.
<P>
I have listened with interest to the Minister's reply. In 
a sense, he has given the game away. Under 18(2)(c), the 
regulations, which we have not seen, will enable 
Ministers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"specify circumstances in which persons in part-time employment 
are to be taken to be, or not to be, treated less favourably".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could include pay, terms and conditions.
<P>
Despite his being conciliatory even to a fault; he 
seemed to excite or disturb one or two of his Back-Bench 
colleagues the Minister was nevertheless unable to come 
clean on pay or the implications of cost. If he had done 
so, we might have taken a more charitable view of his 
conclusions. Although I acknowledge that he has perhaps 
the best intentions he certainly shares the common 
objectives that we all have I do not find his response 
entirely satisfactory. He has not given the precise 
assurances that we require and about which my hon. 
Friends have spoken with eloquence. We must therefore 
press the amendment to a Division.
