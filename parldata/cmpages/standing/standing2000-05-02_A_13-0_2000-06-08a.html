<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 345, in page 27, line 14, leave out 'local government' and insert 'relevant authorities'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 346 and 511.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We have reached part III, which deals with ethical standards. The clause requires the Secretary of State to specify by order the general principles that will govern the code of conduct of members and co-opted members of relevant authorities, and lists the relevant authorities to which part III will apply. Subsection (3) sets out the form of consultation that the Secretary of State is to carry out before making such an order.

<P>
The amendments will replace the requirement for the Secretary of State to consult representatives of "local government" with a requirement to consult representatives of "relevant authorities" when drawing up general principles. That has been introduced, in part, to ensure consistency throughout the Bill, but more importantly, the existing phrase could have restricted formal consultation on the members' code and employees' code to local authority bodies. We want to ensure thorough consultation on these important documents. The amendments will broaden the definition to include non-local government bodies such as the Association of Police Authorities, and unions representing the wider interests of relevant authorities that are not simply local authorities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): We have no qualms about the amendments. I simply wish to seek your advice, Mrs. Michie, on whether we shall have a clause stand part debate in which we can set out our stall in respect of the clause and, more importantly, the rest of part III.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, I would like to have a clause stand part debate.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 346, in 27, line 21, leave out "local government" and insert "relevant authorities".--[Ms Armstrong.]

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 347, in page 27, line 33, at end insert--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() the Metropolitan Police Authority,

<P>
() the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment simply adds both authorities to the list of relevant authorities to which part III should apply. Those authorities were set up after the inauguration of the Greater London authority, and will be formally constituted on 3 July. The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority replaces the existing London fire and civil defence authority, and the Metropolitan police authority is similar to other police authorities covered in part III.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> As I said, we have no qualms about the amendments. I want to talk in more general terms about this part of the Bill.

<P>
Despite the fact that more than 400 Government amendments were tabled in the House of Lords, the selection paper shows that we are faced with scores more at this late stage of the proceedings. I accept that many are technical, but it reinforces the view that the Bill was cobbled together in a hurry and is still only partly finished--like a Spanish hotel, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) said on Second Reading.

<P>
The Bill is essentially about probity in local government. Some months ago, at the start of the Bill's passage, the Under-Secretary said that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Effective democratic government relies on the bond of trust between the people and those who represent them, whether in local, central or regional government.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am sure that we would all echo those words. Sir Jeremy Beecham of the Local Government Association has said that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Councils must base change on what the local residents want.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Conservative Members would certainly agree with that. So far, however, our scrutiny of the Bill has suggested that the Government are not prepared to trust the people of local council areas who want to maintain the status quo because of their local circumstances, nor to guarantee people and the press rights of access to executive meetings. The clause imposes a national system with a whole new raft of investigators, adjudicators and quasi-judicial members of standards boards.

<P>
As was said earlier, the Bill appears to be about local government, not for local government. I pay tribute to the enormous amount of work that hundreds of thousands of councillors all over the country undertake, largely voluntarily, without which our democratic process would not function as well as it does. The Bill's underlying ethos is that we have to find ways of ensuring that more members of the public share that enthusiasm sufficiently to want to go out and vote for their elected representatives.

<P>
Despite the high-profile cases of abuse against which this part of the Bill is largely targeted, 99 per cent. of councillors are entirely straight and dedicated and perform their functions with the utmost integrity. The same is true of council officers. That is put into context by the annual report of the local government ombudsman, which stated that, in an average year, out of a total of 16,000, he would receive 60 to 70 complaints which either wholly or partly included a complaint about a member's conduct. The problem is not mainstream poor standards, but exceptions to the rule, yet 32 clauses deal with conduct of members in order to clamp down on the few offenders. That is overly prescriptive and amounts to an excessive degree of regulation. The vast majority of councillors who behave themselves and acquit their functions well will have to accommodate these provisions so as to carry on doing the good job that they were doing before.

<P>
The truth is that this part of the Bill has been necessitated by a tawdry catalogue of corrupt, unethical and politically motivated scandals in a wide variety of Labour-run rotten boroughs. [Hon. Members: "Westminster".] Well, if Government Members will wait, I shall give them many examples to their one. Labour rotten rotten borough syndrome means that the Bill is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Inevitably, the vast majority of councillors, who are straight, are tarred with the brush of suspicion implicit in the many extensive measures contained in these 32 detailed clauses. There seems to be an assumption of guilt before innocence is proven, and I have reservations about the draconian powers prescribed in the Bill for the ethical standards officers. Many of the proposals have been introduced simply to help the Labour party to clean up Labour-run councils, but every councillor will be subject to the same vast increase in regulation, checks and penalties.

<P>
We agree that the system should be tightened up and classified. We need a redefinition of the code of conduct set out in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which is couched in terms that suggest that councillors should never do anything that they cannot justify to the public. That is open to a wide variety of interpretations. Local government already observes high ethical standard. In the light of the publicity given to Donnygate-type scandals, however what is most needed is a disciplinary procedure that is clear, open and quick and will deal with those rare instances of serious wrongdoing. The proposals in part III are convoluted and time-consuming and go way beyond the proposals contained in the Nolan committee report.

<P>
In the report, Lord Nolan stated that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The vast majority of councillors and officers observe high standards of conduct. The number of people who have used their position in local government for their own ends is small, compared with the vast majority who genuinely wish to serve their community.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Lord Nolan, of course, recommended that a new independent body, such as the Standards Board, be set up to arrange investigations, determine the substance of allegations and decide penalties. We have that, in some form, in the Standards Board; in addition to that, there are the adjudication panels and tribunals, the standards committees, the ethical standards officers with their extensive powers, statutory codes of conduct and a medley of new penalties.

<P>
More than 81 per cent. of local authorities have either established some form of standards committee, or are considering doing so. They are establishing structures that best suit local needs but they will now have a uniform code imposed on them. Part III removes even more local discretion. The new national code of conduct, which is especially pertinent to the opening clause of the part, will be subject to the negative resolution procedure. We have expressed our concerns about that before. The new code is to be drawn up with the help of the Local Government Association. What progress has been made on that? When will we see it? In the Joint Committee report on the draft Bill, there was a recommendation that the core of the code of conduct should be included in the Bill, so I would like more detail on what differences there will be in the statutory model code.

<P>
There are also problems with the potential overlap with the work of the local government ombudsman, as well as that of the National Audit Office. Will the Minister comment on the possibility of a double jeopardy scenario, in which the same complaint is investigated by different bodies? We also need further clarification regarding the stage at which a claim becomes sufficiently serious to merit criminal investigation and becomes, potentially, a criminal charge. There are interesting questions to be answered about the interplay with the European convention on human rights, which applies to various civil rights. I wonder whether Departmental lawyers have done any work on that, which might be applicable to certain parts of the Bill. I believe that that would be particularly relevant.

<P>
9.15 am

<P>
There is also concern about compromising the independence of the Standards Board and the Adjudication Panel if they are brought under a common organisation. The Council on Tribunals made the comment that that could damage the perception of the two bodies' independence from each other. Has the Minister had any further thoughts on that? There is also the question of the length of time that the complaints process could take after investigations have been initiated. If councillors are to be suspended for a prolonged period because they are waiting for the results of an investigation, that would be unfair to the potential victim.

<P>
There appears to be little to cap the cost of all the new committees and offices. Will the Minister tell us what work has been done on costs, both nationally and locally? Will the new procedures required of local councils have to be paid for out of standard council budgets, or will additional funding be made available to set up those processes? At the outset, there will be considerable costs attached to setting up the new procedures, committees and offices, in addition to the national standards Board, which, it seems, will be able to take on an unlimited amount of staff to help in its work. There are no guidelines as to what they, or the members of the Standards Board itself, should be paid.

<P>
A further concern relates to how the Standards Board or the standards committees propose to deal with vexatious and unreasonable complaints. Complaints made by the opponents of certain councillors could be politically motivated in an attempt to muddy the waters and damage re-election chances, for example. The central Government ombudsman has a system of filtering out vexatious complaints at the outset, which determines whether they should be taken on to the proper investigation stage or not. I wonder how they are to be fileted out in the case of local government.

<P>
The proposals will introduce immense changes, including substantial new structures and committees with offices attached to them; many councils will have teething troubles in bedding them down. The new system represents a major departure from what went on before, which was conducted largely on a voluntary basis. Will the Minister tell us what facility there will be for the workings of the new structures to be reviewed--after a period of, say, three years, as would happen in other new structures--to see whether they working?

<P>
What requirements will there be in the annual report by the Standards Board to give information that will allow Parliament to assess the success of these new structures? Will a Select Committee be mandated or understood to be able to assess the annual report and ask relevant questions? I see no provision in the Bill for checks and balances on whether all these new structures are deemed to be working. I having spent most of the past year in Committee on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which sets up investigative processes and a very powerful body, the Financial Services Authority. There was an understanding that the FSA would be beholden to the Chancellor and that it would subject its workings to the Select Committee on the Treasury. Will similar arrangements exist for this new structure?

<P>
I shall pose various questions as the debate progresses. Many of our amendments are probing amendments that are designed to discover detail that is not included in the Bill, and which, given the newness of the structures, we need to know.

<P>
Government members of the Committee are keen to hear examples of corruption, so I shall look at three different scenarios of "problems" in various local councils. The first concerns matters that constituted criminal corruption and were dealt with through the courts. This notable case occurred in Rotherham. Garvin Reed, former deputy leader of Rotherham council, was investigated by the police for misuse of public funds at the national local government forum against poverty, of which he was convenor. The forum, which produces research on poverty and makes suggestions for tackling it, is based in Rotherham and funded by subscriptions from more than 200 councils in Scotland, England and Wales. Large sums of money were apparently squandered on hotels and prostitution. Rotherham council loaned the forum nearly £500,000 to start up, but only half has apparently been repaid. Council officer Bob Bone, who was seconded to the forum, was suspended by the council and, along with Mr. Reed, placed under investigation. While both men were visiting Dublin on a "fact-finding mission" and staying in a five-star hotel at the forum's expense--they claimed more than £25,000 in expenses in 1993-94--the organisation's offices were raided by the police. A report has since been published that concluded that 13 appointments were unsafe. As a result, disciplinary action has been taken against senior figures. Garvin Reed has been forced to stand down as deputy leader, and has been suspended by the Labour party.

<P>
Let us range a little further afield--to Doncaster--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): We shall be here all morning.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall give a potted account of events in Doncaster, but I should say that my point about councils' code of conduct concerns using the whole of part III to prevent, or intervene in, various abuses of local government.

<P>
The scope of corruption in Doncaster first came to light in a report by the district auditor in January 1997, which accused councillors of abusing trips, expenses, gifts and hospitality. In March 1997, the fraud squad was called in, and a month later a specialist team of police officers was set up to carry out the investigation. It emerged that councillors had inappropriate relationships with developers, who profited from key planning decisions on green-belt sites.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions </B>(Ms Hilary Armstrong): There have not been any prosecutions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Minister says that there have been no prosecutions and that is a good point. However, in what way would the 32 clauses in part III have prevented such incidents, or enabled intervention or criminal prosecution? She will have plenty of opportunity to illustrate that point.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): I hope that my hon. Friend has on his list Preston, which is a classic example of connivance between members and officers, which is the real concern that the Bill should address. As the Bill is drafted, such individuals might not be discovered, because secrecy could be maintained in respect of their performance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing up a relevant point, to which I hope he will return. Because of the enormous volume of such cases--they occur almost exclusively in Labour councils--I had to be selective according to quality and seriousness. Otherwise, we would indeed be here all day.

<P>
The Doncaster case makes interesting reading. Malcolm Glover, who took over the leadership in January 1997 with a mandate to clean up the council, has resigned following his arrest on charges of making false expenses. The entire Doncaster Labour party was suspended by the Labour party's national executive committee in July 1997. Those suspensions were internal Labour party matters, and the codes of conduct that we are considering would not apply to them directly.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> How did the Tories deal with Westminster?

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I think that we are striking a few sensitive nerves. I hope that the Under-Secretary will bear in mind such cases when she considers the relevant provisions.

<P>
The Doncaster affair has rumbled on since 1997, and the police have launched a major fraud investigation into grant payments totalling £400,000 for home  improvements. It is alleged that, although grants were paid for several years up to 1996, no work was carried out, that homes received two grants for the same work and that some tenders were approved at a cost that was well above the going rate. Councillor Jack Meredith has become the latest Labour member to be arrested, joining a list of 30 people, 17 of whom are sitting or former Labour councillors, who have been arrested since the police launched their inquiry in 1997. The Doncaster case is obviously slightly worrying.

<P>
We need to consider the perception of local government that such episodes give to the public. The Rotherham Advertiser gave the headline, "Here we go again" to an article about Irene Furnell, who was sent in to clean up the situation but who was herself suspended. Other headlines include, "Disgraced council unit to be wound up" and "Boss suspended"; they do not inspire much confidence. What will the Labour party do to stop the problem, and where will it intervene? I now turn to--

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales </B>(Mr. David Hanson): Westminster?

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Peterborough, in fact. The Liberal Democrats should take an interest in this case--it is another example of criminal corruption.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Then the hon. Gentleman should discuss Westminster.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Minister is perfectly free to mention any council she wants. So far, Labour Members have mostly mentioned one council, which happens to be Conservative. Many dozens are relevant, and we are not keeping a score.

<P>
In Peterborough, the Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Jackson has just been jailed for eight months after pleading guilty to 19 charges of defrauding the Department of Social Security and of fiddling council expenses. He was terribly innovative: apparently, he claimed allowances for 21 community health council meetings that he never attended, claimed cash for a meeting in the city when he was at the Liberal Democrat party conference in Eastbourne, made attendance claims for two different meetings that were held the same time, and inflated his mileage claims by as much as half as much again. When asked by the police to account for such matters, he put them down to administrative errors.

<P>
The examples that I have given so far are of obvious criminal corruption which, in some instances, resulted in criminal proceedings against and jail sentences for the relevant councillors. I move on to a less clear situation, which cannot be described as criminal but which can be perceived as involving an "abuse"--I use the word with inverted commas--of councillors' positions. I shall give examples from Leeds and Brent.

<P>
A few months ago, an Ofsted report in Leeds made some interesting revelations. The Daily Mail reported:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A failing Labour education authority allowed individual councillors to channel thousands of pounds to schools in their own wards...While one Leeds school was given £45,000 to improve facilities last year, others gained nothing, a damning report by Ofsted inspectors revealed...Ofsted found that political interference by councillors had also been a key factor in the city's failure to appoint a director of education for four years, leading to drift and decline in its services to schools. One was finally appointed 15 months ago.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Similar comments were made about Sheffield. Elected members have been heavily involved for many years in the management of education in Leeds, and they were able to influence the provision of additional funds to schools in their wards. That caused the strong perception in the public's mind that there was political interference. Political interference in the schools of electors' children raises serious concerns. [Interruption.] The Minister is muttering again. If she wants to intervene, she is welcome to do so.

<P>
I should like to move on to Brent--we are getting closer to home--which represents another example of what has been perceived as an abuse of councillors' powers. Brent council has decided that one third of its £320 million pension fund is to be managed internally by officers, who are not investment experts.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Against advice--including that of Conservative councillors--the Labour administration invested £250,000 of local authority pension fund money in Owen Oyston's Sunday newspaper--he who is still in jail, and a major Labour benefactor. Shortly afterwards, the newspaper went into liquidation and the £250,000 was lost. Towards the end of the 1980s, the council entrusted £2 million of pension fund money, on an index basis, to a Japanese investment manager, who lost $1 million in six months in a falling market. As if it had not had its fingers burnt sufficiently, the council has also lost £2.5 million by investing in the falling euro. Those councillors set themselves up as investment managers with no competence so to do, and I wonder why they did not fall foul of the predecessors of the Financial Services Authority. Their actions have resulted in a large-scale loss of funds to the council tax payers of that borough.

<P>
My final example is Nottingham county council, which has used the staff pension fund to send councillors abroad on fact-finding trips, to a total value of £400,000. Those trips included a £28,000 visit by four councillors to Hong Kong and Australia and a £36,000 tour of the United States. That smacks of junkets for councillors, and the perception of electors is that they are not doing the jobs for which they were elected.

<P>
The acid test of this part of the Bill--and, to large extent, of the whole Bill--is whether, after it is enacted, examples such as those that I have cited will either be prevented from happening in the first place, or the new structures will intervene at an early stage to ensure that further damage is not done and to deal with the situation before it becomes a criminal matter for the police. The proof its success will lie in whether, in the perception of electors, all local government abuse has been cleaned up, because they will consequently have more enthusiasm for local government, and vote and stand as candidates in greater numbers in local government elections.

<P>
As we proceed, Ministers might like to refer to the examples that I have given in order to clarify how this part of the Bill will succeed in its aims without imposing an enormous amount of addition regulations on perfectly clean councillors or deterring prospective councillors from wanting to stand for public office.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I rise briefly to refer to part III in the context of the stand part debate.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the complexity of the situation. I confess that I find it so, and therefore want to ask the Minister a simple question to check whether my understanding of the arrangements is correct.

<P>
My understanding is that a local authority will establish a standards committee. One of that committee's functions will be to monitor the operation of the authority's code of conduct. Concern about the actions of individuals or of the authority under the code of conduct would be sent to the Standards Board. The board in turn would send the matter to an ethical standards officer, who could then refer it to the local authority's monitoring officer. Once the matter had been dealt with, it would go to the Adjudication Panel, which would establish a case tribunal, possibly on an interim basis, under the supervision of the Council on Tribunals. After that process had been completed, there would a mechanism for an appeal arrangement, which, I confess, I have not fully comprehended. Is that what the Government purpose?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman would refer to facilities already in existence--the ombudsman, the monitoring officer's full role and the internal and external auditors, Could he relate them to the system that he has described'?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No, I cannot. I am as confused as the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr Loughton) chose to raise a litany of cases with the Committee that shed no light on the important subject under consideration. Moreover, he said nothing about where the Conservative party stands. I could go through a similar litany of cases involving Conservative councillors and authorities. I do not intend to do so because there would be no point. However, we cannot let the moment pass without noting that the single most damaging case for local government, which electrified the attention of the nation over many years was that of Westminster, which the hon. Gentleman chose not to mention. That omission speaks volumes.

<P>
The Westminster case illustrates more than any other the Tory party's attitude to such matters and its failure over many years to step in and take action against Lady Porter and that council. Let us be clear--the case did not involve a councillor lining her pocket. That would have been bad and no one would have defended such an action. Rather, it involved gerrymandering which disadvantaged some of the worst-off people in that borough. Such disgraceful conduct showed no care or concern for the many people needing housing in that borough. Lady Porter completely disregarded their needs in her attempt to keep Westminster Tory. We should perhaps not seek to grade misconduct and corruption according to seriousness, but that example must rank among the most serious.

<P>
At least the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham allowed for the fact that the Labour party and Labour group in the examples that he cited--Doncaster, Rotherham and so on--took what action it was possible for them to take. That is in marked contrast to the Tory party's response to what was going on in Westminster and, indeed, the more recent case of Broadlands, which the hon. Gentleman seems again to choose to ignore.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I do not support or wish to cover for the accusations that the Minister is making against Dame Shirley Porter. The case went to court, as I understand it, has gone as far as appeal and she has been cleared.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The case is still under appeal in the House of Lords, so the allegations are still unresolved.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The case may or may not be going forward for appeal, but Dame Shirley Porter has won her case at the Court of Appeal. That is how the matter currently stands.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> My advice is that the Westminster case is still under appeal in the House of Lords and that that is its current status.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not sure whether we should be discussing the case. If it is still under appeal, it probably remains sub judice.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I accept that statement, Mrs. Michle, and I apologise if I have taken the issue too far. However, some of the cases to which the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred, such as the Doncaster case, were in the same category. This is what inevitably happens when we take the route on which the hon. Gentleman started us. None of us supports misconduct or corrupt action by councillors, wherever it comes from. The political knockabout to which the hon. Gentleman resorted did not do justice to the seriousness of the issue. All local councillors who take their job seriously--most of them--would want us to give proper seriousness to these matters.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a number of comments, many of which revealed what was remarked on at the outset of our proceedings--his lack of experience in local government. No doubt we will be able to put him right when the Committee considers the clauses that relate to the issues about which he spoke, but I shall mention one or two of them now. He complained about length of time and cost. He has never worked on a local council, and I do not perceive those issues as difficult for local councils to deal with. The cost of establishing a standards committee will be containable within councils' revenue support grant. In my view, it will not be significant.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the ombudsman and the Standards Board might investigate the same cases, but that is a complete misunderstanding of the different roles and functions of the two bodies. The ombudsman will not judge the behaviour of individual councillors, but consider the action and decisions taken by local authorities. Only the Standards Board will deal with the misconduct of individual councillors. In any case, maladministration is not the same as misconduct--another misunderstanding that might reflect the hon. Gentleman's lack of experience.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about vexatious and politically motivated complaints. Perhaps he was judging everybody by his own standards of behaviour. In my experience--I was on a local council for 12 years--I know that one or two people will make such complaints, although they are usually members of the Conservative party. I do not believe that local councillors will be tempted to subvert the serious intent of their standards committee and the proposals that underlie it by trying to use it in the way that the hon. Gentleman described. However, he made a genuine point, and we will consider it.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about immense change, in respect of which we must consider why we need a different system. One of the important issues that he did not raise was transparency, not only for the councillors on a local authority, but for local people. Justice should not only be done be clearly seen to be done, which can be facilitated by a transparent, open and independent system which allows any allegation to be investigated. There are serious weaknesses in the current conduct framework, which is non-statutory and complex in structure, so it is often difficult for a councillor or member of the public to know where to access the structure to raise an issue. The code is based on numerous modifications made over a long period, which results in great ambiguity and different interpretations of how to use the code. The new code needs to be more tightly and unambiguously drafted.

<P>
How will the new code address some of those shortcomings? I want to reply to the question posed by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). The scenario that he painted with so many stages is certainly possible in the most complex case that might come before the standards committee and the board, but there are also many opportunities for a more straightforward or clear case not to have to go through the process that he outlined. The situation that he described would represent the most exhaustive use of the procedure.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I would hate the Minister to misinterpret my question, because it is important for the Committee to address these important issues. I share her view that we need to deal with any form of misconduct or corruption by councillors, regardless of which party they serve. However, given what she has just said, can she give the Committee some idea of how many times she believes that the Adjudication Panel for England is likely to be required to set up a case tribunal or an interim case tribunal? Clearly, she does not know the precise number, but can she tell us the order of magnitude? What is the number likely to be each year?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I shall not be drawn at this stage to give a number, because that would make us hostage to fortune. At the moment, the number of serious cases is relatively small and declining, so we can expect that the full panoply of the process, leading to the establishment of a tribunal, would be necessary only a few times a year. That is a reasonable prediction on the basis of the current situation and recent trends.

<P>
The new model will set out in legislation a national model code of conduct approved by Parliament and will apply consistent standards to all local authorities. Most provisions in the code will be mandatory, but because of the diversity of local authorities in England, authorities will be able to tailor the model code to meet local circumstances. Codes of conduct will command greater respect if those to whom they apply help to draw them up. That is another important point about the implementation of the proposals. We want to take every opportunity to strengthen among all members of the local authority a sense of ownership of the code of conduct that they adopt. As hon. Members will know, we are inviting national representatives of local government to help us to draw up the national model, instigating ownership at that level, and, with the establishment of a standards committee, we are trying to strengthen ownership by local councils and the local authority of their own code of conduct. In that way, we hope to ensure effective implementation of the code.

<P>
We shall deal with the other points raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham as we discuss the various clauses. Indeed, amendments relating to some of the issues that he raised have been tabled, so I do not intend to begin a debate that will have to be repeated. Most members of the Committee, if not the hon. Gentleman, have served on a local authority, so we know from experience the motivations that bring people to local government. They are of the highest order in almost every case. People give a great deal of service to the local community and their integrity in delivering that service is valued more highly than anything else. People come to the job of councillor in that spirit of honesty, integrity and propriety.

<P>
It is important to note that the majority of councillors very much welcome the Government's initiative in including in part III provisions for a clear, open, transparent but robust ethical framework and a mechanism to ensure that standards of conduct are fully implemented. In tribute to those councillors, I hope that hon. Members will support the clause, whatever their views about the details of the measure, because it is in the interests of local government, local councillors and local people that we move to a new, robust ethical framework that is clear to councillors and local people alike.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Well, that has told me.

<P>
The Under-Secretary must either go on an anger management course or appreciate the fact that Opposition Members query points because that is their job. We are here to scrutinise the Bill. The arrogance of a Minister who says, "I have spent 12 years on a local council and you have spent none, therefore you know nothing about it" is breathtaking. It is a hallmark of the entire Government's approach that they do not want to hear criticisms and they write off anyone who does not have particular experience. I do not need 12 years' experience on a council--I certainly do not need 12 years' experience on the hon. Lady's council--to know what amounts to accountability and fairness and to know about public perception. If the hon. Member for Bath is unclear about the procedures, as many people are, then members of the public will not be clear about them. That is why I raised certain questions and set out my stall before we considered part III. I ask the Minister not to write off what I say on the basis that I am one of only two Committee members who has not worked on a council.

<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that he has lost the plot? If he had presented his case on behalf of the Opposition and on behalf of the whole of local government out of a desire to achieve high standards among all political parties and councillors, he would have been a little fairer and a little less partial in his selection of examples of bad practice, rather than using the issue as a party-political battering ram.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I do not think that I have lost the plot; we have only just started. I cited some high-profile examples. It was a fair hunch that Government Members would raise the only high-profile example that we are not allowed to discuss because it is sub judice, although an appeal has been upheld, but that is just one example from a great range. I chose a selection of three types of abuse, ranging from criminal abuse to incompetence, and I want the Under-Secretary to bear in mind not those particular examples, but those types of examples. If she wants to quote to the Committee the panoply of Conservative examples, we shall consider them in the same context, but so far she has come up with one. I do not expect to receive answers now to all the questions that I have raised.

<P>
The Minister said that she is happy that the cost--my approach to which is apparently a matter of my inexperience of local government--will be containable within the revenue support grant. Many councils are not happy about it. What will be the likely cost to councils? Will extra money or only the existing revenue support grant be provided? I do not need 12 years' experience on a council to know that an additional cost will arise, which will have to come from a budget. Mine is a genuine question. It does not deserve the arrogant abuse that one receives whenever one dares to raise a question, which is what we are here to do. To describe as knockabout some of the serious examples that I have mentioned is inappropriate.

<P>
I had not intended at the outset to linger long over the clause. My plea is that we should examine the issue rationally. All members of the Committee come to take part in scrutiny of the Bill with different experiences. Questions arise from those different experiences, and they will need to be answered satisfactorily if our electors' confidence in local government is to be restored, which is what the Bill is about. Let us stop the abuse and get on with scrutiny of the clause.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I have been goaded into rising to support my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, whose remarks have been deliberately misinterpreted, and the hon. Member for Bath.

<P>
We made it clear early on that we were deeply concerned about the prospect of secrecy under the Bill. Preston was chosen as an example because of the connivance between members and officers. We need to have it made clear that the Under-Secretary is happy that the system that she is setting in train will work. If it does not, it will be difficult to find out some of the shenanigans that may go on in some authorities. I hope that the answer to the question of the hon. Member for Bath about numbers is zero--and for the right reasons, by which I mean the absence of cases of sufficient importance and complexity to warrant going right through the scale. What bothers me is that the answer might be zero because none have been discovered.--[Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> It is all right, Mrs. Michie. The two Ministers from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions obviously understand, having spent a long time in local authorities, and are therefore talking among themselves, because they do not want to hear about the possibility of Prestons throughout the country. The opportunity for secrecy will be compounded by whipping--or if not whipping, patronage--which will in turn be compounded by the fact that councillors can now be paid substantial allowances. I hope that Ministers will take a serious view of the matter in the light of that. The examples were intended for emphasis.

<P>
We all want a clean, clear and effective local government service that serves the public well and does not become corrupt. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Right, everyone in the Room agrees. The Opposition want a clear understanding that Ministers recognise that they have set up an opportunity for secrecy, difficulties and patronage. We want to know that the system under part III will work.

Government amendment No. 356.

<P>
Amendment No. 576, in page 28, line 33, leave out 'representative' and insert 'representatives'.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> These amendments, like the previous group, would clarify the provisions on the model code of conduct and relevant authorities' duties in adopting a code. We want to secure a model code as a baseline on which authorities will work. They will establish their ownership of the code by adding to it what is relevant to them. The model code will involve tackling the relationship between officers and members.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 351, 353 and 356 make it clear that, should the Secretary of State wish, he may invite more than one body to submit proposals for a model code of conduct or for the revision of an existing code. That flexibility is necessary because the code will cover a wide variety of bodies with differing functions and duties. The capacity to respond to development and change in local government is important.

<P>
I draw the Opposition's attention to Government amendment No. 353, which would have the same effect as amendments Nos. 575 and 576. The Opposition amendments seem to be intended to enable the Secretary of State to invite more than one representative of local government to submit proposals on a model code. They would add nothing more to the Bill than our amendment would add.

<P>
Amendment No. 577 would remove the condition enabling the invitation issued by the Secretary of State to contain a requirement that different proposals be drawn up for different authorities or descriptions of authority. I am unconvinced about the need to remove a condition that adds flexibility to the Bill's provisions by enabling the proposals for a model code to take account of specific organisational needs. Circumstances differ from one organisation to another, and even from one local authority to another. The code will cover a variety of organisations, some operating new constitutions under part II and others with limited and specific functions. To remove the provision would limit that flexible approach. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will be persuaded not to press the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Amendments Nos. 575 and 576 deal with a minor matter. It is not immediately apparent why only a single representative should be invited to draw up a model code. The amendments would change "representative" to "representatives".

<P>
Amendment No. 577 deals with a more substantive matter. In its response to the White Paper, the LGA said that questions of probity and ethical conduct should apply equally to all council members. The LGA will be disappointed if separate codes are thought to be necessary. The amendment would remove the provision that allows different codes to be drawn up for different authorities.

<P>
The chief bone of contention is that the Secretary of State may require different codes or different provisions to be drawn up for different authorities or different descriptions of authorities. As the Minister said, the White Paper made clear the Government's intention that each local authority should adapt the model code to suit its decision-making structure. That held out the prospect of the codes of conduct of councils with directly elected mayors differing from the codes of other authorities. However, I accept that it might be necessary for the code of police authorities to differ from the codes of ordinary local authorities. The Government amendments specifically allow the Secretary of State to invite more than one organisation to draw up codes of conduct for different categories of authority.

<P>
In taking note of the concerns expressed by the LGA, the Joint Committee recommended that a national code of conduct should be issued in the form of regulations, that all authorities should adopt it with only relatively minor variations and that the core elements of the code should be referred to in the Bill. The Joint Committee suggested that it would be undesirable for a patchwork of model codes to be in force. There may be merit in the Government asking the Association of Police Authorities to examine the possibility of police authorities having a separate code, but the LGA is still considering how it would respond to such an invitation.

<P>
We shall not press amendment No. 577, largely because of what the Minister said. I may have missed her comments on why the reference to representative is singular rather than plural.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I should like to make a couple of points. First, the Joint Committee recommended that the national code should apply to the conduct of councillors who serve on outside bodies, such as companies to which they have been appointed by the council or in their capacity as school governors. I see that the Minister is getting some in-flight refuelling on that matter, so perhaps she can tell me whether the code will apply. Secondly, in what context will the model code of conduct apply to local council employees? Some 90 per cent. of them are covered by the current code. Why is that not 100 per cent? Will the new code cover every employee rather than just councillors?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman's first point will be discussed when we debate his amendment on this matter. I shall make my arguments then. We intend the model code to apply to councillors whenever they are acting as councillors. That will be part of the code and, as such, does not have to be included in the Bill.

<P>
The current employees' code is voluntary. The Bill will make it statutory. We want a clear code so that employees and members know what is expected of them and are aware of the boundaries of their activity within public office. There is too much of a mishmash of different circumstances and legislation. We want a clear code that is backed up by support and training from the council's standards committee so that all employees and members are clear about what matters. The code will cover all employees and it will be statutory.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I do not disagree at all. We are in favour of the blanket code. However, I was querying why the voluntary code does not cover 100 per cent. of employees. Can the Minister explain why 10 per cent. of employees are not covered? It is astonishing that they are not. Why have some councils chosen not to participate in the voluntary code?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not know what is in the mind of every council. It is for councils to decide whether to operate a voluntary code. We are introducing a statutory code because we do not think that that is satisfactory.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The clause places a duty on each relevant authority to adopt a code of conduct within a specific time scale and provides for a default position in which the mandatory provisions of the model code of conduct will apply should 'councils fail to adopt their own code within that time. The amendments attempt to clarify the provisions on the model code and the duties of relevant authorities in the process of adopting their codes. Amendment No. 359 is the substantive amendment. It imposes a duty on the relevant authorities to pass a resolution either when they are adopting a new code or when they are revising their code of conduct. The other amendments deal mostly with minor points of drafting, and are consequential to amendment No. 359 and to other changes already made to clause 46.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 67 in page 29, line 20, after 'newspapers' insert 'widely'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 366.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The amendment deals with a minor point, and the Minister will probably tell us that the Government amendment addresses it more properly. If the model code of conduct is to mean anything to electors, it must be properly published and circulated, which is why the amendment seeks to add the word "widely" in relation to the circulation of newspapers. The Government amendment requires an authority to publish the notice in its own newspaper, if it has one, and in at least one other newspaper. We are trying to slightly improve on what the Government propose. Unfortunately, the readership of local authority newspapers is not as wide as it might be, so we seek to ensure that an alternative newspaper--the other newspaper to which the Government amendment refers--is at least a proper newspaper with a wide readership, rather than a local freebie sheet.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I do not think that this is a minor point. It is important to ensure that adequate publicity is given to the code of conduct and that it reaches as wide a range of people as possible. It should reach not only residents, but people who run businesses and work in the area. That is why we tabled Government amendment No. 366 in response to the issue raised in another place by Baroness Hamwee. Our proposal embraces amendment No. 67, but ensures wider distribution than it would achieve on its own.

<P>
There are legal difficulties in defining what would conform to the requirement for a publication to be "widely circulated". I can tell the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that the Government amendment intends to ensure that the information placed in the local newspaper--in addition to the authority's own newspaper, if it has one--will be circulated as widely as possible throughout the authority area. In some areas, consideration will have to be given to whether a single newspaper is distributed throughout the area and local authorities will have to make some choices; that will certainly have to happen in my own area. We would encourage authorities not to limit themselves to one additional newspaper, so that everybody has access to information about the code of conduct.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge our intention for the information to be published as widely as possible and therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Strangely, I have sympathy for both my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and the Minister, having struggled with definitions during the previous Administration. Trying to get such provisions to fit is exceptionally difficult because of the variations. My constituency includes two local authorities. There is no local newspaper for sale in some areas and freebies or a mixture of free and bought papers in others. In London, some of the freebies that my hon. Friend mentioned are better than the bought ones. They are circulated and read more widely.

<P>
I understand the drive behind the provision, and do not think that it is successful, but I cannot think of a way to improve it. I expect that local authorities will want to ensure that the code is spread and that there will be no attempt to cover it up. I expect local government to have enough good sense to act properly despite the inadequacy of the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> There is no great disagreement between members of the Committee. The Minister misconstrued my point. I did not say that the point was minor in the sense of the issue being minor. I said that the point of the amendment was minor. As I began by saying, it is of course very important that the model codes of conduct are circulated as widely as possible. I am perfectly happy to take the Minister's comment that the matter has been considered. However, if she cannot define "widely", which we use, I am at a loss to know how it will be easier for her to define "as widely as possible", which is her phrase. It strikes me that the Government will have the same problem. They appear to have taken the problem on board and we look forward to seeing the way in which they resolve it in terms of legalistic definitions. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Yes, these are minor technical amendments. I am grateful for the agreement of the hon. Member for Bath on that point. I have not yet got such agreement from Conservative Members. Amendment No. 364 will enable an authority to make its code of conduct available at a more suitable office and more widely than at just its principal office if that office is inconveniently located.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 506.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> This is the final group of amendments to clarify existing provisions relating to the model code of conduct and to the duties of relevant authorities in the process of adopting a code. We have already considered amendment No. 359, which will impose a duty on relevant authorities to pass a resolution either adopting a new code or revising their existing one. Amendment No. 369 will prevent that duty from being delegated to ensure that, with regard to local authorities, the whole council considers the matter. Amendment No. 506 has the similar aim of preventing the delegation of the consideration of a report from a case tribunal, again requiring consideration by the whole council.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I have a small question. Will the Minister explain and define her meaning of "considered"? A difficulty for many years has been that local authorities have run a guillotine system. Technically, an item of business can go to full council and barely receive consideration because it falls beyond the guillotine. Has the Minister foreseen that problem?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a red herring. The wording of the clause, as amended, will be clear. Our thrust is that councils will take the matter seriously, and it is in their interests to do so. We have tried to ensure that they own the process and the code of conduct that they adopt. I do not think for one moment that councils will put the issue on the agenda and try to force it through by a guillotine. Members will want to demonstrate that they have given it consideration, because that is part of the ownership process.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The amendments relate to the--hopefully few--circumstances in which a relevant authority fails to adopt a code of conduct in the time scale set out in the Bill. In such circumstances, there is provision in the Bill as drafted for the mandatory provisions of the model code to apply by default, but a breach of the code by a member of the authority cannot occur where an authority is in the default position; it can occur only where a code has been adopted or revised. This loophole was identified when the Bill was considered in the other place, and my noble Friends undertook to address it. New subsection (5) in amendment No. 517, which we will consider later, will add a definition whereby a breach of the code can include allegations of misconduct where the default code applies.

<P>
In practice, the amendments in this group are consequential on that later amendment, although the effect of the group as a whole is substantially to replace clause 48. In particular, amendments Nos. 371 and 379 will ensure that references in the clause to breaches of the code of conduct include circumstances in which the model code applies by default. The remaining amendments in this group are minor and consequential.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 40 to 43, which were tabled by the Opposition, propose a right of appeal for a councillor against the obligation to vacate office if he does not make a declaration to observe the code of conduct within two months of being elected, and would also enable the councillor to remain in office pending an appeal. I am not entirely sure what concerns have inspired these amendments. I should therefore like Opposition members of the Committee to speak to them, so that I can respond.

<P>
In the light of the apparent motivation behind the earlier speech of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, I hope that I can reassure him that the Bill includes safeguards that will ensure that the proposed arrangements will not oppress individual councillors or groups of councillors. The general principles that underpin the code of conduct will be subject to extensive consultation, followed by debate under the affirmative resolution procedure in this House and in the other place. The model code of conduct will also be the subject of careful consultation. Indeed, there is provision in clause 45 for the code to be drawn up by local government before approval by Parliament.

<P>
Any councillor who was unwilling to sign up to the product of such a painstaking process needs to examine whether public life is really for him--

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): Or her.

10.30 am

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Or her. If we take the lead from the Conservative party, I am sure that we should use "him" to refer to the councillor.

<P>
Committee members have pointed out that local authorities will be able to add their own provisions to the code. That will have to be consistent with the code and with any guidance that is issued by the Standards Board. Those provisions will, of course, be subject to discussion in authorities before adoption, and members will be able to influence or contribute to the debate at that stage. I am confident that careful drafting of the model code should ensure that politically motivated or otherwise inappropriate local additions to the model by an authority would not be considered to be "consistent with the national model" as required, and therefore open to judicial review.

<P>
The local authority's standards committee must comply with any regulations that are issued by the Secretary of State on size, composition and membership. It is also required to send its terms of reference to the Standards Board, which could also issue guidance to the authority if it felt them to be inappropriate or unfair in any way.

<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham appreciates that we believe that giving individual councillors a right of appeal against such a carefully constructed system would suggest that the system itself was wrong. We need a system that will receive widespread support and cannot be flouted by people who simply do not want to abide by the reasonable codes that people in public office should abide by.

<P>
I hope that amendment No. 371 will be agreed to. The other Government amendments will be made in the appropriate place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 40 to 43, which may give the Minister some fuel.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 are conditional on amendment No. 43. We believe that councillors or co-opted members will not forfeit their office, subject to proposed new subsections (9) to (11), whether they have made a declaration of acceptance of office or are already in office and will remain there pending an appeal.

<P>
The meat of the amendments is in amendment No. 43, which puts the case for individual members and co-opted members to have the right of appeal against the decision that they be required to vacate their seat. That approach is particularly relevant for co-opted members because codes of conduct will inevitably have been drawn up primarily with standard council members --councillors--in mind. Those codes of conduct may inadvertently be framed in such a way that co-opted members are unwilling to sign up to them. However, there may also be exceptional circumstances in which potential councillors and co-opted members, acting in an entirely honourable and ethical way, feel that they would find themselves on the wrong side of a code of conduct and would therefore be unable to sign up to it.

<P>
One standards committee, I gather, which has already been established, has a lord-lieutenant and a bishop on it. Their reasons for becoming involved with local authorities are different from those of the standard local councillor. That is why our primary consideration is to establish what leeway there may be for co-opted councillors. It is important to have co-opted members of an authority because we have agreed that it is important to bring new people on board who are independent minded, with motives other than furthering their own political campaigns or agendas. A code of conduct that could be seen as too rigid for certain special cases would deter people with a lot to offer from joining various council committees. One of the attractions of the Bill is that it will get non-councillors involved in local authorities, bringing in their independence of mind and powers of scrutiny.

<P>
The amendment would allow individual members to make a case for not signing up to a particular code, but it would not be used on the off chance, as it would not permit an unsuccessful appellant subsequently to sign up to the code after all and resume his seat. The amendment would provide a safety valve that would cater only for exceptional circumstances. Will the Minister respond to that?

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have listened to the hon. Gentleman with great care. I cannot imagine a scenario in which a bishop or lord-lieutenant--or a person of that nature--would not want to sign up to a code of conduct that had been agreed nationally through the deliberations of the Local Government Association and Parliament, and then adopted locally. They would think it invidious if we made different rules for them in inviting them to be co-opted to serve either on a scrutiny panel or on a standards committee. They would feel that we were exempting them from the normal way in which the council operated.

<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about ensuring that we enable people who do not want to stand for public office nevertheless to give public service by being a co-opted member. We do not want to do anything to put them off. However, we must consider the integrity of the system and the public confidence in whomsoever is invited by the council to participate in its proceedings. We would be doing the whole programme an enormous disservice by adopting the kind of exemption that the hon. Gentleman suggests.

<P>
I tried to reassure the hon. Gentleman when I moved the Government amendments that this would be a carefully constructed code of conduct. It will ensure that there are clear ways of preventing any unfair aspects, or aspects that gave comfort to political bias, from being added locally. If any individual thought that such activities might occur, we are confident that he or she would be able to challenge it, because we have made the intention of the measure clear, and will continue to do so. The House will continue to do that when it discusses the code through the affirmative resolution procedure.

<P>
I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do. I hope that I can reassure him that his proposal is unnecessary and would undermine the clarity that we are seeking to give to the public about the nature of the code of conduct and its impact on all who act within the council, in whatever capacity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We shall not push this to a vote. This is a genuine query about an exceptional possibility that might arise, and is in no way designed to undermine the code of conduct set out by the Minister. I can reassure her about that.

<P>
The Minister said that she could not see any circumstance in which a bishop, lord-lieutenant or other worthy would not want to sign up to the code of conduct. We do not know that, because we do not know what will be in the code of conduct; we do not know the state of play on it, what it will contain or how much consultation there will be with the LGA and other bodies or which of their comments will be taken on board. The Minister is speaking from a wholly hypothetical position.

<P>
We shall not press the issue, but the Government should take the point on board, because of the threat that, in exceptional circumstances, people who have much to offer to local authorities, for reasons wholly different from those for conventional councillors, will be deterred from doing so. That would be a loss to local government.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman is also speaking from a hypothetical position. There have been occasions on which co-opted members who have not signed up to the voluntary code of conduct have been engaged in indefensible activity with which there were no powers to deal. That has made us particularly concerned to ensure that that does not happen again. Such cases do not relate solely to the code; they raise the issue of the integrity of local government.

<P>
Most people who want to get involved will want the protection of the code. If they have, for example, extensive business interests outside their work for the council, they will be able to make it clear that they will not compromise the standards of the council by using it to get business favours for themselves. I give that as a hypothetical example, and I do not believe that people who will serve on standards committees or scrutiny committees will do that. However, such cases have arisen, and we must ensure that all those who are involved in the work of a council shares a determination that public service is just that. People will then be able to have real confidence in them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We are not seeking to exempt anyone. Our amendment relates purely to the status of co-opted councillors while an appeal is under way. The ultimate decision remains one for the Standards Board to take. There is no question of giving full-term exemption to co-opted councillors who subsequently use their position for unscrupulous purposes and letting them get away with that. That is not what we are saying, and it is slightly disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that we are advocating full-scale exemption from the code of conduct for co-opted members, whether they be the Bishop of Bath and Wells or a local tradesman. That is not our point.

<P>
I shall not press the point any further, but there is a genuine possibility, even if it is--like the code of conduct itself, as the Minister has admitted--hypothetical.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Government side did not notice that that had happened, Mrs. Michie; it is just as well that it did not escape your scrutiny.

<P>
The Minister said that the code of conduct would apply where councillors were acting as councillors. We require a better definition than that to cover cases in which, for example, councillors are school governors. In that capacity, do they act as councillors or as governors who happen to be councillors? Another example is that of councillors who are on community health councils. The Minister will be delighted to know that I have some experience in that respect, having served on one. If she has not done so, perhaps she should shut up and say nothing about the matter--[Interruption.] I do not need an anger management course.

<P>
Councillors can sit on community health councils in their capacity as appointees of the relevant authority or as councillors nominated by voluntary bodies or elected by voluntary groups. Another example is that of economic partnerships involving local councils and local businesses that handle single regeneration budget grant money. There are many examples of such outside bodies. Will the Minister clarify the extent to which councillors who sit on them act in a councillor capacity?

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is important to be clear about this matter, because it potentially involves the indemnification of such people in the event of problems occurring on the body on which they serve in the capacity of council representatives? That matter was debated earlier this week in the Committee that considered the Learning and Skills Bill, and was of great concern to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that important point. The code of conduct is important in terms not only of people behaving themselves, but of whether people have the backing of their councillor status to ensure that they are not taken to the cleaners if they happen to step out of line. I hope that the Minister will address both those points.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I cannot address the point that was raised by the hon. Member for Bath--although I understand its underlying principle--because the amendment concerns the code, not indemnification.

<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. I hate to disappoint the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, but I have served on a community health council, although it was a long time ago. I have also served as a school governor, both as a local councillor and through being nominated in another way. It is the core of the definition that it is perfectly possible for a councillor to be on a school governing body not as a councillor but as an elected parent-governor, for example. That governor would therefore not be representing the council but the parents.

<P>
However, if a member were nominated by the local authority to an outside body, the code of conduct would apply because he or she would be carrying out the functions of a local councillor as if he or she were sitting on a committee within the authority. The model code of conduct will apply in those cases, and we do not believe that any additional provision is needed in the Bill. I hope that that reassurance will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> There are rather a lot of amendments grouped together with different nuances, but the thrust of them all is to secure the perception of integrity and independence of the standards committees, in order for them to work properly as we would all wish. I shall speak first in general terms, and then more specifically to the amendment.

<P>
The provisions in the Bill and the explanatory notes on the membership of the committees are a little unsatisfactory. There would be a potential conflict of interest if members of the executive sat on a standards board that happened to be dealing with breaches of standards in the code of conduct by members of the executive. Many outside bodies have gone so far as to say that we need to safeguard the appearance of independence of the standards committees by having an independent chairman, and an exclusively independent or all non-councillor member standards committee. Alternatively, it has been suggested that only councillors or people co-opted from neighbouring authorities should sit on the standards committee overseeing a council's activities. That happens already to the extent that councillors and council officers might carry out an inspection of another council's activities to ensure some degree of independence.

<P>
The bishop and the good lord-lieutenant, whom I mentioned earlier, sit on the standards committee in Herefordshire. To adopt a slightly different tack, I am sure that they bring much experience to their work, but they are busy people and may be detached for much of the time from the council's work. How can they oversee properly the standards of a council with which they may have little connection? I do not know the personal circumstances of those people, whom I am sure are proving to be wholly satisfactory members of the standards committee. However, what experience would members of their calibre have properly to scrutinise the council for which they are responsible through the standards committee?

<P>
The reprimands that are available to the standards committee appear to be fairly minimal. How do they deal with matters that are referred back to them by the national board? The terminology in that regard is slightly vague. Is the approach overly prescriptive? I gather that in west London an alliance of joint standard committees operates. That is a sensible way to combine talent from local authorities from outside the authority that is being examined. Economies of scale are involved, and people's experience can be brought together. Would that joint arrangement be allowed under the Government's approach? What incentives would independent members have to get involved in standards committees in the first place, especially if they will be subject to the additional regulations that will apply to councillors?

<P>
The amendments are aimed at guaranteeing the independence, and the appearance of independence, of standards committees. Amendments Nos. 68 and 69 would exclude members of the executive from sitting on the standards committee. Obviously, if they are not on that committee, one of them cannot be the chairman or chairwoman of that committee. Amendment No. 44 is contingent on amendments Nos. 68 and 69.

<P>
The amendments provide safeguards against the abuse of standards committees by over-powerful executives. The submission of the Association of Council Secretaries and Solicitors to the Joint Committee asked whether it was

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>appropriate for the member of an executive to be a member of the standards committee. There must be no conflict of interests in the standards committee.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Joint Committee concluded that the committees should be seen to be independent of the executive, whose decisions will in the main be those complained of. It expressly recommended that members of the executive should not sit on the standards committee. Amendment No. 68 will ensure that that is the case.

<P>
For the standards committees to enjoy public respect, they will need to be, and be seen to be, independent of executors. Having members of the executive effectively policing other members of the executive--potentially, their close allies or rivals in a ruling group--is not conducive to the independence that people expect.

<P>
The Government should at least ensure that standards committees are not packed with members of the executive. As the Bill is drafted, it will be possible for a majority of members of a standards committee to be drawn from the authority and the executive. That would be deeply damaging to the public credibility of such a body, and would leave open the door to abuse. Amendment No. 44 would firmly close that door.

<P>
Amendment No. 579 would delete subsection 4(a). Amendment No. 580 relates to non-members and non-officers. In amendment No. 581, we suggest that the majority on the standards committee should be of the independent, non-member, non-officer type of appointment. Amendment No. 570 would ensure that the standards committees were also chaired by an independent member.

<P>
The thrust of the amendments is to strengthen the standards committees. There is a role for standards committees, but it is no good having committees that are packed with the people whom they are supposed to regulate. The Bill leaves it open for authorities to do that and, thus, in my view, abuse the entire principle.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> There is a clear precedent in the cases of the Press Complaints Commission, the Broadcasting Standards Council and other such organisations. Newspaper journalists are judged by their peers, but the chairmen are independent, and local authorities should adopt the same system. If a standards committee is packed with members of the executive and other leading members of the council, there will be a sense that the whole thing is a fix, being carried out behind closed doors.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Absolutely; my hon. Friend makes the point behind the amendments. If the Minister is not minded to accept the amendments and give guarantees of independence, perhaps she could let us know what other similar bodies operate under such strictures. I am not aware of any. We must restore the independence and integrity of such a high-profile area as local government in the perception of the public.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> Perhaps I should issue a health warning. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman, and he may not like what I say. On other occasions, he seems to have confused disagreement with anger; clearly, he has not seen me when I was angry. If he had, he would know the difference.

<P>
There is real confusion in the hon. Gentleman's approach, by which I mean that he seems to say different things in different places. I recall that, during the debate on clause 45, the Opposition spoke about how we should not be prescriptive and should leave it to local authorities to determine the membership of standards committees. These amendments contradict that position.

<P>
There is also a more fundamental confusion between, on the one hand, promoting the code of conduct and overseeing its operation, which is the job of the standards committee, and investigating allegations of conduct that goes against the code, which is the job of the Standards Board. Membership of the standards committees is, none the less, an important issue. To some extent, there are two competing imperatives. I accept that the perception of the integrity--not just the integrity, but the perceived integrity--of the standards committee is an important issue. The other imperative, however, is that the local authority and all its members, regardless of the job that they do, should own the code of conduct and the process by which the code of conduct is established in the routine working practices of every member.

<P>
Our trying to marry those competing imperatives led us to our conclusions about what the Bill should provide in relation to membership. The standards committee is not an investigating committee, so it will not be able to block any written complaints. All such complaints will have to go before the Standards Board, for which monitoring officers will be required. The integrity issue--if not, perhaps, the perceived integrity issue--is therefore partly dealt with by the processes that we are instituting that will govern the relationship between the standards committee and the Standards Board.

<P>
The Bill provides only the minimum necessary criteria on the membership of standards committees in order to try to marry the competing imperatives of perceived integrity and of ownership. That is what distinguishes the standards committees from some of the other bodies, such as the Press Complaints Commission. They have investigatory, as well as promotional and safeguarding, functions. The criteria will prevent a mayor or leader of the executive, under the provisions of part II, from sitting on the standards committee. They will also prevent the committee from being chaired by a member of the executive. They provide for at least one independent member, although it will be open for relevant authorities to have a majority of independent members if they so choose.

<P>
It is important that there are at least two elected members on the standards committee to underline the importance of the council's ownership of the committee. Eliminating councillors from the committee would imply that members cannot be trusted to look after their own council's standards of conduct--but that is not someone else's problem; it has to be owned by the council. Councils must regard the implementation of the code of conduct as a core issue.

<P>
Having said that, we do not envisage that a majority--or even a high number--of executive members will sit on the standards committee. We do not envisage that more than one member of the executive will do so. That is one of the matters that we shall address in secondary legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> Would it be possible for a local authority's standards committee to consist of three people--two members and one independent member?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> A standards committee could consist of three members: up to one member of the executive and another two independent members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> It could have two members of the executive and one independent member. It is possible that two of the most senior executive members of the council could be placed on the committee with an independent person of little status or understanding. In other words, a local authority could stitch up its standards committee to make it totally ineffective. That eventuality should be covered by the Bill.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I have just made it clear that we do not envisage that more than one member of the executive will sit on a standards committee, and that we intend to make that provision in secondary legislation. I assure the hon. Members for Hexham and for East Worthing and Shoreham--who are discussing the matter--that we will make it impossible for more than one member of the executive to sit on the committee.

<P>
Taken as a whole, the provisions provide sufficient safeguards to cover the legitimate issues that Opposition Members have raised, which we have also considered. They also allow for the ownership by the council of the standards committee and its functions to be accepted as an important part of the local authority's work and an important issue for every member, whatever his or her role. I accept that there are arguments against the presence of one executive member on a standards committee, but there are also arguments in favour, and I hope that Opposition Members will accept our judgment on the matter.

<P>
The Opposition's amendments would unnecessarily and unhelpfully restrict the composition of a standards committee, which ought to achieve the best balance between perceived integrity and ownership. Therefore, and in the light of the assurances that I have given, I hope that Opposition Members will be prepared to withdraw them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am only slightly comforted by the Under-Secretary's words, although it is nice to have gotten something out of her at last. She has assured us that only one member of the executive may participate in those committees, and that the matter will be dealt with through secondary regulation, but I see no reason why such a provision should not be included in the Bill. We are dealing with a simple matter--the specifying of a number--and I fail to understand why the Government will not table an appropriate amendment on Report.

<P>
The Under-Secretary criticised us for being overly prescriptive, while wanting at the same time to devolve as much local autonomy as possible. The matter is of such importance that the Government need to establish clear guidelines to secure the absolute integrity of standards committees' independence. We are not talking about council policy but about standards of councils' behaviour. In respect of the financial services industry, for example, this Government's move against self-regulation, or ownership--which is the moderniser's word that the Under-Secretary has used--suggests that they do not consider self-regulation to be out of kilter with their approach in other areas.

<P>
In tabling these amendments, we are trying to establish some clear guarantees that the committee that oversees whether the council is abiding by a satisfactory code of conduct will not consist of a majority of members of the council itself. It is not us who are out of kilter but the Government, who are at odds with their own move against self-regulation in other businesses.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that ownership is not the same as self-regulation? I tried to make it clear that the regulatory body that investigates and adjudicates on complaints will be the Standards Board and not standards committees.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I entirely accept that, although I am not sure what the Under-Secretary's definition of ownership will be. On the basis of her comments--this was one of my initial questions--what is the point of the standards committee? It appears to have insufficient teeth. The centralised Standards Board, which we shall discuss later, will have considerable power. The way in which an individual standards committee and the remit of the Standards Board will interact is unclear, particularly with regard to matters referred back by the Standards Board, and the apparently weak penalties that the standards committee will be able to impose.

<P>
That is another reason why we need cast-iron assurances that standards committees are not mere tokenism. Behind closed doors, there is no guarantee of public access. We must ensure that, in the name of a standards committee, cosy little deals will not be done between a member of the executive, other elected members of the authority and a pal who has been co-opted as a supposedly independent member. That is the issue. As one senior council officer put it to me, the constitution and functions of the standards committees are critical if they are to maintain local government's integrity by preserving high standards of member conduct. Securing public confidence in the operation of such committees is essential, and their independence--real and perceived--is paramount. That is what we are trying to achieve through the amendments.

<P>
Whatever the Government's good intentions, there is the lingering perception that this cosy little clique is designed not to maintain standards but to create the perception that all is okay because the committee says that all is okay. When a committee consists of three people and has just one independent on it, it will not hold much credibility.

<P>
On that basis, we shall push amendment No. 581 to a vote. That amendment would safeguard the principle that the majority of members of a standards committee must be independent. If the amendment were accepted, that would provide significant assurance against the many fears that I outlined. Reluctantly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendments Nos. 387, 389 and 394.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> This group of amendments relates to the establishment and functions of standards committees, and they are intended to clarify some of the Bill's provisions. They deal with the Secretary of State's ability to make effective regulations on the size and composition of standards committees, on appointments to those committees and on the validity of their proceedings.

<P>
In view of the anxieties that Committee members frequently expressed during earlier debates, subsection 6(c) might not be wide enough to encompass public access, publicity of meetings, agendas or records. I hope that the amendments assure Opposition Members--they will link the additional regulatory powers to existing provisions that are made under part V of the Local Goverment Act 1972.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the Minister tell the Committee what might be contained in the secondary legislation to which she has referred? What is the Government's view in respect of public access to the committee's meetings?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We are still discussing those matters with the Local Government Association and others. It is important that a standards committee should be seen to be effectively and sufficiently accountable, to ensure that public confidence is maintained in the ability of a council to handle these issues. We have been anxious to ensure that access to the proceedings of a local authority standards committee is available, unless information is considered exempt--for example, if it concerns an individual or relates to privileged information in the normal way in which such information is classified in a council.

<P>
The adoption of the code should be of interest to everyone. Similarly, I would expect some interest in the consideration of a report from a case panel. However, if a meeting, revolved around allegations of misconduct, as yet unproven, it would be unusual and possibly invidious for those allegations to be publicised at that stage. Indeed, that might give rise to actions for libel or slander if the allegations were subsequently discovered to be unfounded. All in all, we want to ensure as much public access to the workings of the standards committees as possible, subject to the normal provisions relating to that privileged information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the Minister state clearly, so that it is firmly on record, that the Government's intention is that when the secondary legislation is introduced, meetings of the standards committees will be held in public subject to the normal rules that currently apply to exempt business?

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Yes.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 384, in page 31, line 30, leave out 'local' and insert 'relevant'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 386, 388, 390 and 391.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> These amendments are all minor and technical. They deal with the remaining inconsistencies in clauses 49 and 50, including some grammatical inconsistencies. They do not affect the substance of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr Don Foster:</B> Will the Minister briefly explain how the guidance that the Standards Board is to issue will  differ from the regulations to be made by the Secretary of State?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The regulations that the Secretary of State will issue will relate to the standards committees. The guidance that the Standards Board will have the power to issue will concern any matter that it may wish to address as a result of its national overview of the operation of the ethical framework. For example, we shall discuss later a request from monitoring officers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Subsection (6)(a) makes provision for the Secretary of State to make regulations in respect of

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the size and composition of standards committees.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We are also discussing guidance that the Standards Board may issue in relation to their size and composition. I have difficulty in understanding what additional guidance might not be in the regulations.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> It would be guidance that would be issued subsequently to the initial version of the regulations. It would arise from the Standards Board's experience of any issues arising in individual local authorities in relation to their having a standards committee of a particular size, That guidance would be taken into account in any subsequent revision of the regulations issued by the Secretary of State.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.
