you, Mr. Amess. I am sure that I speak on behalf of everyone
when I say that we are delighted to see you in your place for the first
sitting of this important Committee. Your duties will be shared by
Mr. Jimmy Hood, whom I also know to be an experienced
Chairman of such proceedings.</div>
<a name="06101761000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
generally accepted that the Bill is a very important and necessary
piece of legislation. We have built into its proposals the support and
consensus reflected on Second Reading and contained in the welfare
reform Green Paper. The consultation on the Green Paper and the
Government&#146;s response to it will be reflected in our
conversation and debate during the 16 sittings.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div><a name="06101761000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The basis of the Bill is that
too many people have simply been written off as having no worthwhile
contribution to make in our society, despite the fact that nine out of
10 people on incapacity benefits say that they wish for the opportunity
to work. The Bill seeks to give effect to that overwhelming aspiration
of those on incapacity
benefit.</div><a name="06101761000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
to be joined by the Minister with responsibility for disabled people,
the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the
Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire). She has a great deal of
experience on the issues that the Committee will seek to
address.</div><a name="06101761000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thus
far&#151;it may continue, but I do not wish to tempt
fate&#151;there has been a sense of co-operation both inside and
outside the House about the principles and specifics of the
Bill&#146;s proposals. That spirit extended itself to the Programming
Sub-Committee&#146;s
resolution.</div><a name="06101761000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101761000396"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): Can I have a name
check?</div><a name="06101761000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000397"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We will leave that till the end of our
proceedings.</div><a name="06101761000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
the wise counsel and advice of the Whip, the Vice-Chamberlain of Her
Majesty&#146;s Household, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham,
East (Mr. Heppell), the Programming Sub-Committee has agreed
to 16 sittings without knives or guillotines, on the basis that the
Committee will find its own way through our proceedings. If we do not
make the necessary progress, he reserves the right to recall the
Programming Sub-Committee to introduce knives and guillotines, which
all of us would rather do without, judging from the way that we have
progressed thus
far.</div><a name="06101761000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000398"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I welcome you, Mr. Amess, to the
Committee. I look forward to speaking before Mr. Hood later.
I hope that you do not mind that I have adopted the traditional modern
Conservative garb of no
jacket.</div><a name="06101761000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000399"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> No
policies.</div><a name="06101761000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000400"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Minister playfully suggests that we have no
policies. He will soon discover that we
do.</div><a name="06101761000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Minister and the Labour Whip for the amount of time that they have
proposed for discussion of the Bill. We are happy to accept it. In the
current climate, 16 sittings seems a generous allocation. It reflects
the seriousness with which Ministers and the Government take the
subject.</div><a name="06101761000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a big
Bill in two senses: it is long, and it is a big issue. We all agree on
that. The Green Paper, to which we shall refer in our proceedings, gave
a magisterial analysis of the scale of the problem. All politicians,
everyone with limited capabilities and those who support them, such as
lobby groups, agree on some important facts: currently, some 2.7
million people are on incapacity benefit, 1.5 million of whom have been
on it for more than five years. Statistics outlined by Ministers, and
which I also use, show that if a person 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>has been on incapacity benefit for more than two years, they have a
better chance of dying or retiring than of getting another
job.</div> <a name="06101761000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
designed to hit the target of reducing by 1 million the 2.7
million incapacity benefit recipients by 2016. There is a lot of work
before us, which the clauses in the Bill aim to do. Many of us have had
extensive briefings on many issues from outside groups. I am not going
to list them all, but Ministers as well as my hon. Friends have been in
deep discussion with them. I pay tribute to them for the volume and
quality of their briefings, not just on the Bill but on the
consultation findings published by the Government in early summer on
the back of the Green Paper and for their representations before the
Green
Paper.</div><a name="06101761000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
cornucopia of issues needs to be teased out. We have 16 sittings in
Committee. Some people have suggested that we might not need all those
sittings, but let me explain why I think that we will need them. The
nature of the incapacities people now experience is changing. According
to a remarkable statistic&#151;both sides find this
worrying&#151;again in the Green Paper, 40 per cent. of those on
incapacity benefit are on it because they have a mental or behavioural
disorder. In 1995, that figure was 22 per cent. Many think that most
people claim incapacity benefit because of bad-back syndrome&#151;the
classic, and rather lazy, identification&#151;and muscular skeletal
problems. That used to be true, but this year only 19 per cent. claimed
it for that
reason.</div><a name="06101761000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
nature of incapacity or disability is changing, which raises questions
about how we treat not only those with predominantly mental and
behavioural difficulties, but those with physical disabilities, with a
fluctuating condition. That is a massively important issue on all our
radars, and we want a good debate on
it.</div><a name="06101761000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to remind
ourselves that the Bill has a great deal of good in it, which I shall
be making clear. However, a lot of outside groups as well as the
Opposition question whether the successes in the well resourced
pathways to work programmes will be continued. We know that we need to
tease out that issue, no doubt in a clause stand part debate so that we
are in order, and to ask how quickly existing claimants will be
migrated on to the new employment and support allowance, which is the
subject of the Bill.</div>
<a name="06101761000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not mean to be
confrontational&#151;Ministers themselves have flagged up frankly
this issue&#151;but what is the ability of those on the support
component in the Bill to volunteer for work-related activity and how
quickly will they be able to do so? It is neither the
Government&#146;s nor the Opposition&#146;s intention to force
those in the support component to participate in work-related
activities, but if they wish to volunteer, they must be properly
resourced.</div> <a name="06101761000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
issues around the quality of the training of the personal advisers
delivering the allowance and, indeed, the regime that precedes it. Do
they have enough understanding of mental health issues? There are
further issues around the other two targets set out in the Green Paper,
which the Bill is designed to meet. They are noble aims that we
support&#151;returning to the work force 1 million older people and
one third of a million lone parents. We all agree on those things. The
Bill addresses those policy imperatives&#151;they are policy
imperatives for us all.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 6</div><a name="06101761000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, for the record, I
agree with what the Minister just said. He said that the Bill had
built-in consensus and support for its central planks. That is true. He
knows our good intent because we had the option of not voting for the
Bill on Second Reading in July. We did not take that option. We were in
favour of the Bill, and I hope that that spirit of consensus will
continue for these 16 sittings.</div>
<a name="06101761000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">A &#147;but&#148; is
coming, however, which the Minister will respect. The spirit of
consensus does not mean that we can agree with everything in the Bill;
that is not how parliamentary scrutiny works. We want a good airing of
the issues. In that respect I should like to draw attention to the fact
that quite a few clauses are enabling clauses. They refer to
regulations that are to be published where the fine grain, granular
detail will be exposed.</div>
<a name="06101761000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has done his level
best and the civil servants have done a good job in producing much
draft regulation material for the Committee, but two of the three draft
regulations relating to the assessments under clauses 8 to 10 are not
available. That is not the Minister&#146;s fault. We have had a very
grown-up discussion about why they cannot be published. Ministers would
be greatly criticised if they rushed out draft regulations when
everyone knows that they and their officials have been deep in
consultation on the design of the limited capability for work test, the
work-related health assessments and the work-related activity
assessments.</div><a name="06101761000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are
to have a sensible debate about those very important clauses, we will
need some latitude to kick around the issues. The outside world,
disabled people and those with incapacity, the advocates and the groups
who support and advise them will want to know that we are teasing out
the issues at this stage, and are not waiting for the regulations to
appear at some time in the future. It would not go down terribly well
with any of us if we did not have the opportunity to have an extended
debate, notwithstanding that the clause does not include much detail
and the draft regulations are not available for completely
understandable
reasons.</div><a name="06101761000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
minor caveats, I am happy to begin this Committee in a spirit of great
consensus. I would just say parenthetically, as a former Opposition
Whip, that this is probably the first time, certainly in my experience
in the last two years, that the Opposition have not voted down a
programme motion. We agreed the programme motion in the Programming
Sub-Committee and are very grateful to the Government for affording
such
time.</div><a name="06101761000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101761000401"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): It is also a pleasure for me to be serving on this
Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess. I look forward
to our discussions and the guidance that you and Mr. Jimmy
Hood will give. It is a particular pleasure for me as a relatively new
Member, because it is the first time that I have served on a Standing
Committee. I look forward to any guidance or instructions that you
might be able to give
me.</div><a name="06101761000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
and the Conservative spokesman both said, there is a great deal of
consensus around the principles and objectives of the Bill. As I said
on Second Reading, the Liberal Democrats certainly share 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div>in that. There is a strong need and, indeed, a moral imperative to
tackle the problem of the 2.7 million people who are on incapacity
benefit. Many of them wish to work; they would like to have the
opportunity to work but, for a variety of reasons, it is denied them.
Those principles are the driving impetus behind the Bill, and the
Liberal Democrats would like to enter into the debate on them in a
consensual
manner.</div><a name="06101761000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
huge number of people are affected, so the Bill is important for that
reason; it is also important because there is such interest in the
wider community in the Committee&#146;s deliberations and the results
of its discussions. An enormous number of outside bodies&#151;lobby
groups, representative organisations, and so on&#151;take a great
interest in this Bill. I am grateful for the support and briefing that
they have provided me with and I am sure that other Committee members
are,
too.</div><a name="06101761000366"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06101761000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
(Mr. Ruffley) said, broader issues relate directly to
whether the provisions contained in the Bill can be successful, and I
hope that we have a chance to discuss those. In particular, many of the
changes made under the Bill depend for their success on the success of
the pathways to work programme that has been piloted in several areas
and has been proven to be successful for at least some of the groups
for which it provides help. However, I am concerned that, under the
Government&#146;s proposals for rolling out that programme across the
whole country, those people for whom we are talking about changing the
benefit arrangements and increasing the amount of conditionality that
applies will then rely on pathways to work to provide the positive side
of the
equation.</div><a name="06101761000039"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000402"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not wish to interrupt the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s flow, but again in a spirit of consensus, would he
agree that there are issues about sanctioning, for instance, about
which outside bodies and disability groups are concerned? I am sure
that the Minister will want to debate that in a spirit of
co-operation.</div><a name="06101761000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000403"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I think that we could take this spirit of
co-operation and consensus thing too far. However, I agree with the
hon. Gentleman and I hope that the Minister will, too, because there
are important issues involved, including whether the people who
will have sanctions and conditions placed on them will have genuine
access to the support and help that they need.</div>
<a name="06101761000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has rightly been described
by the Government as a something-for-something arrangement. We support
that approach, but we have to ensure that the something that is on
offer to support people back into work&#151;the pathways to work
programme&#151;is rolled out properly. I hope that the Minister will
be able to offer some assurances about the level of funding that will
be available for that package. I am concerned that there is a big
shortfall in the funding that will offer people outside the pilot areas
a &#147;pathways to work lite programme&#148;, which will mean that
the responsibilities that they are being asked to take on under the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div><a name="06101761000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds made the important point that, over
the years, we have seen an increasing proportion of incapacity benefit
claimants claiming for reasons of mental health. One Government
evaluation of the pathways to work programme has suggested that
incapacity benefit was not as effective for people whose first reason
for claiming benefit was mental health. We need to return to that
issue, particularly when we are discussing the personal capability
assessment. We will need to ensure that there are protections and
assurances for the people involved. Likewise, there are important
questions to be asked about how quickly existing claimants will be
migrated on to the new benefit and to what extent both the conditions
and benefits of pathways to work will be available to
them.</div><a name="06101761000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">An important
issue regarding the amendments that we want to discuss is the extent to
which the Government&#146;s approach offers any sense of support to,
or engagement with, employers. This is not just a supply-side issue
about getting people ready for work; it is also about ensuring that
employers are encouraged to keep their side of the
bargain.</div><a name="06101761000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
support the programme motion. The approach that has been
suggested&#151;not having knives, but allowing the Committee to find
its own way&#151;should command support from all Committee members. I
hope that we have a mature and sensible discussion, and I am sure that
that will be so. I dare say that we will find consensus on some issues,
but also that there will be disagreements and I am sure that they will
be discussed on both sides in the constructive spirit that has governed
the Bill&#146;s proceedings so far.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000406"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b><b class="B"> </b>Thank you, Mr. Amess. That must
be some kind of record.</div>
<a name="06101761000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
relates to an important piece of language, on which the Government
should be congratulated, as their approach is to get away from the
notion of incapacity. In the 1990s, invalidity benefit was changed to
incapacity benefit. In those days, which are not that long ago, it was
seen as an advance; but to me, and to most of us in the 21st century,
it seems a rather unfortunate phrase, which is not in tune with the
times.</div><a name="06101761000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question, however, is whether the phrase &#147;limited capability for
work&#148;, which is an improvement, is necessarily the right one. In
the spirit of probing, I wonder whether the word
&#147;restricted&#148; might be better. I do not want to stray into
semantics, nor do I want to take up the Committee&#146;s time, but in
the longer version of the Oxford English dictionary,
&#147;limited&#148; is described
as</div><a name="06101761000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appointed; fixed;
confined within definite
limits&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Restricted&#148;
might therefore be an improvement, as it is described in the same
volume as</div><a name="06101761000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of a person;
not allowed freedom of
movement&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
sense in which, if &#147;restricted&#148; is used, people are being
limited, and not free to move. The reality is that if someone has a
limited capability for work, they are not being written off, because
the Bill makes it clear that if a person has a limited capability for
work and draws the support element of the allowance, it is not the end
of the story. It is explicit in the Bill and in what the Secretary of
State said that there will be movement within the elements of the
allowance.</div>
<a name="06101761000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must be
clear about the language: when I was considering amendments to the
Bill, &#147;limited capability&#148; struck me as being not quite
right. The concept is fine, and the emphasis on capability is
tremendous; I am not talking about what people cannot do, but about
what they can do.</div><a name="06101761000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
drawn inevitably to the other amendments, but I shall not list all of
them for fear of trying your patience, Mr. Amess. There are
attractions in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div>amendments that relate to &#147;labour market disadvantage&#148;,
which I believe the Government will reject, but we need to explore the
issue because it is important. It is not just about mental and physical
conditions, which are mentioned in the amendments, being a limiting
factor, but about labour market disadvantage. In that respect, we need
to reflect on the debate among the many groups outside the House that
are watching this Bill carefully. One thing that my hon. Friends and
I&#151;and Ministers, too&#151;have picked up on is the fact that
there is a demand side in the labour market&#151;which is what the
amendment refers to&#151;and also a supply side. On the supply side,
individuals are getting support. As we have heard, at least 1
million&#151;probably more&#151;out of the 2.7 million want to
work. With the appropriate support, they are getting better and work
ready.</div><a name="06101761000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">What about the
demand side? If the employees are not up for&#151;to put it
colloquially&#151;employing those with limited capability or even
severe disability, it does not matter how well they make themselves,
what training they get, rehabilitation they do or support they get from
Jobcentre Plus or third sector bodies. Therefore, the words
&#147;labour market disadvantage&#148; in the amendment lead me
inexorably, and I hope validly, for the purposes of this clause, to
explore employment attitudes. One can have a limited capability if the
employer does not take on disabled people even though they are work
ready.</div><a name="06101761000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill has
great aims and ambitions and we want to try and ensure that the clauses
work to deliver those policy objectives. However, has enough attention
been given in the clause and elsewhere to encouraging employers to
employ people with disabilities in the workplace? I am not suggesting
for one second that this is an issue that Ministers have not thought
about. They have; I have spoken to them. I know that this is a big
issue. However, there does not yet appear to be enough on that in the
Bill. That is why the &#147;labour market disadvantage&#148;
amendment that we are speaking to is important.</div>
<a name="06101761000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some interesting
statistics that I would like to share with the Committee. In 2005, the
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development took a large sample of
employers drawn from all sectors. One in three employers responded that
they deliberately excluded people with a history of long-term sickness
or incapacity when recruiting staff. On the face of it, we all know
that that looks like straightforward unlawful discrimination that would
be covered in other Acts of Parliament and that deservedly should be
stamped on. However, when it comes to people who have been on
incapacity benefit&#151;and, should it go through, the logic would
apply to the new employment and support allowance&#151;the picture is
more complicated. Rather than being concerned about prospective
employees&#146; health per se, many employers are concerned about the
possibility that long-term claimants may lack up-to-date skills. They
may have been on incapacity benefit for five years or even longer and
lost the habit of working in a socialised work environment. Those were
the findings of the CIPD, and 43 per cent. of the employers surveyed
thought that long-term IB claimants would be less productive at
work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div><a name="06101761000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recruitment conveys risk for any
employer. They have the bottom line to worry about and they
say&#151;we know what the employers&#146; arguments are&#151;that
if the wrong person is hired, it can be costly to the whole enterprise.
However, when we are looking at labour market disadvantage, it is not
good enough in this day and age to say that employers&#146; attitudes
do not matter or that we will just try and exhort them generally. We
know that employers prefer to play safe, but that is not good
enough.</div><a name="06101761000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal
National Institute of the Blind has also done research on this subject
which shows that nine out of 10 employers thought that a blind or
partially sighted person was either difficult or impossible to employ.
It has said that the</div>
<a name="06101761000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;DWP needs to address evidence
highlighted in Report no. 202 &#145;Employers&#146; and service
providers&#146; responses to the Disability Discrimination Act in
2003 and preparation for 2004 changes&#146; highlighting that nine
out of ten employers think blind and partially sighted people are
&#145;difficult&#146; or &#145;impossible&#146; to
employ.&#148;</div><a name="06101761000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Work and Pensions research report No. 139 on
employers&#146; attitudes said that 37 per cent. of employers would
take on people with mental health conditions, whereas 62 per cent.
would take on physically disabled people. A poll commissioned by the
Disability Rights Commission indicated that 25 per cent. of
non-disabled people would not tell their employer if they acquired a
disability or long-term health problem, for fear of
dismissal&#151;partly because of such attitudes, which will restrict
a proper labour market for those with limited
capabilities.</div>
<a name="06101761000367"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06101761000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support those
findings&#151;one goes out there, so one knows that that kind of
thing goes on. Nevertheless, the CBI produced a survey that showed that
84 per cent. of firms now offer rehabilitation schemes to assist staff
to return to work. However, the CBI also acknowledged that 35 per cent.
of employers feel that they need more support from employees&#146;
GPs, and/or want assistance with
costs.</div><a name="06101761000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101761000407"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): I have listened to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments on rehabilitation. I tried to
introduce a ten-minute Bill on that subject. Does he agree that the
Government need to consider people who become disabled through their
work, rather than just considering disabled people in general, and that
they have to legislate for
that?</div><a name="06101761000099"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000408"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. He
and I have been speaking to the same outside groups, and briefings that
I have received from them indicate that they are waiting with great
anticipation for his contribution. I shall not pre-empt the argument
for fear of being out of order and detaining the Committee on this
clause, but we should debate the
point.</div><a name="06101761000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may speak
parenthetically, one of the issues that was flagged up in the Green
Paper was on that point&#151;reform of statutory sick pay and the
issue of early intervention. Intervention at the early stage of a claim
is absolutely right, but quite often the first two or three months of
incapacity is not the first two or three months on incapacity benefit.
Instead, it is the half year that a man or woman may have been on
statutory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div>sick pay&#151;not in the benefits system, not having made a claim, but
at home, ill, still being an employee of the company at which he or she
may have suffered an accident, or having fallen out of regular work.
With the greatest respect to the Government, the Bill does not say
enough about what should happen at that stage of rehabilitation and of
early intervention, before the benefits system kicks in. The Opposition
are looking at it and the current debate will enlighten both our
thinking and everyone&#146;s. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman made
the point and I look forward to his later amendments.</div>

selection, Mr. Chairman, but which would have been in this
group had they been selected. They were on the need to take
employers&#146; attitudes into account over and above mental and
physical health conditions. A communication was sent to me which said
that the amendments that I had tabled along with my hon. Friends the
Members for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) and for Daventry
(Mr. Boswell) were unhelpful, because we were saying that
employers&#146; attitudes and the labour market disadvantage point
need to be taken into account when judging what is limited capability.
That the CBI has described me as unhelpful is a badge of honour that I
wear with pride. Those were the words it used. It said that Her
Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition spokesman on the Bill had put down an
unhelpful amendment.</div>
<a name="06101761000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I am unhelpful, I am glad to
say that I am in good company because amendments in the names of other
Committee members could also be described as unhelpful, and no doubt
many outside bodies which contributed to the amendments might also be
seen as unhelpful. To coin a phrase, we are all in this together. We
need to discuss labour market disadvantage because the demand side of
the equation is tremendously important. That is jargon for,
&#147;Will employers change their attitudes? Will exhortation work?
Must we do more than merely exhort?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000413"></a>John
Penrose:</b> In the hope that I shall not prefigure anything
that the Minister might be about to say, I reassure him that when I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000414"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I think that I have been fairly generous.
We have had a programme motion in which was discussed Second Reading,
and we are now beginning to discuss amendments that have not been
selected. I ask the Committee to return to the amendments that I have
selected.</div><a name="06101761000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000415"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am most grateful, Mr.
Amess.</div><a name="06101761000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the attitude
of employers, to which the group of amendments relates, implicitly if
not expressly, Rethink and the Revolving Doors Agency have stressed
that employers need more information, advice and training on best
practice when employing people, particularly those with mental
illnesses, which, as we have said, is one of the growing causes of
incapacity, and &#147;limited capability&#148;&#151;the phrase
that we want to
change.</div><a name="06101761000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">A poll of
small and medium-sized businesses published in October 2006,
commissioned by the Disability Rights Commission, found that two thirds
of those surveyed had no procedures in place for managing or assisting
staff with mental health problems. I say parenthetically that both the
Government and the Opposition always benefit from the work of the
DRC&#151;its findings are interesting and its surveys
stimulating.</div> <a name="06101761000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
survey indicated also that managers are more reluctant to provide
workplace adjustments for new staff with a mental health condition than
for existing employees with a physical one. When commenting on those
findings, the chairman of the DRC
said:</div><a name="06101761000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We need
to recognise that mental ill health is now operating as a badge of
exclusion from the labour market in the same way that race and gender
once
did.&#148;</div><a name="06101761000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Market&#148;
is the important word there. The amendments make it clear that the
labour market and the employer&#146;s side of the deal are important.
He
continued:</div><a name="06101761000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the Government's welfare reform programme is to succeed it needs to
tackle this lack of confidence among employers about recruiting staff
who have a mental health
condition.&#148;</div><a name="06101761000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
mentioned the CBI already, and pointed out that it called me unhelpful,
I shall make a positive reference to some of the perfectly reasonable
points that it made. Its director of human resources policy said
that,</div> <a name="06101761000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many firms,
particularly the smaller ones, need more guidance and advice on how
they can help
staff&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is of course&#151;we have to be fair&#151;that many small and
medium-sized employers simply do not have the resources required. They
might have the good intention to be disability-facing and sensitive and
to apply best practice to their businesses. However, because of their
size and staff numbers, small businesses quite often do not have anyone
to do human resources work. We must acknowledge that small employers
have resources issues. That does not mean that we can let them ignore
the need and the moral imperative to look more closely at recruiting
those with disabilities, but we understand why it perhaps does not
happen as much as it should in the small business sector.</div>
<a name="06101761000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the concerns expressed
at the time of the Green Paper made the point that I have made: there
is a stigma that employers do not always acknowledge attached to people
of limited capability. I quote Rethink&#146;s response to the Green
Paper:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div><a name="06101761000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This is a clear market
failure which needs to be addressed pro-actively by
Government.&#148;</div><a name="06101761000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister could respond to that at the end of the
debate.</div><a name="06101761000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rethink went
on to
say:</div><a name="06101761000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Successful
anti-stigma campaigns are running in Scotland and New Zealand, with
significantly higher budgets than...work in
England.</div><a name="06101761000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure the Minister
has seen this
representation.</div><a name="06101761000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Scottish campaign has a budget nine times higher per head of the
population than its English equivalent; the New Zealand campaign budget
is 25 times higher...We believe that challenging employment
discrimination forms an important part of work towards Objective IV of
the DWP&#146;s Public Service Agreement target, namely to further
improve the rights of disabled people and remove barriers to their
participation in
society&#148;</div><a name="06101761000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">as well as in
the labour market. The Government&#146;s strategy unit</div>
<a name="06101761000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recommended in 2005 that
employers should lead a campaign on the business benefits of employing
disabled people with input from DWP and
DTI&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a new point
in the argument. It is not just that employers should consider
recruiting and doing more to retain those with limited capabilities; I
have made that point, as have the outside bodies. What about the
business case&#151;the positive, proactive reasons for taking on
those with limited
capability?</div><a name="06101761000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
strategy unit discussed the recommendations and the employer engagement
project. Rethink said to me that it has not heard enough concrete
Government plans on the matter. It
said:</div><a name="06101761000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are specific initiatives that need to be undertaken in relation to
employers.&#148;</div><a name="06101761000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">It gave some
examples that we hope will help that labour market disadvantage to
disappear or to be
reduced:</div><a name="06101761000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Application
forms for employment now often ask whether a person has been detained
under the Mental Health Act. Employers must be discouraged from asking
this question of applicants...Aside from enabling employer-side
discrimination, this practice also deters people with mental
illness&#148;</div><a name="06101761000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">from applying
for such jobs in the first place.</div>
<a name="06101761000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rethink
found:</div><a name="06101761000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;People
with mental health problems have the highest &#145;want to work
rate&#146; but the lowest &#145;in work rate&#146; of any
disability group&#148;</div><a name="06101761000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
cited 2003 Office for National Statistics figures to support that
conclusion.</div><a name="06101761000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is conceivable that people will face continued rejection because of
their health
condition&#148;</div><a name="06101761000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">unless we all
pay more attention to the labour market
disadvantage.</div><a name="06101761000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health has suggested Shift, a five-year
initiative to tackle stigma and discrimination against people with
mental health problems, as an example of a programme into which more
investment might be channelled. Before the Minister, who is a decent
and clever fellow, stands up to ask whether that is a Conservative
party spending commitment, I shall say that it is not. It is just a
question whether that project is properly resourced, and whether part
of his budget might be vired across to support it. I do not know. That
is one for Ministers, but I should like to hear more about
it.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div><a name="06101761000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06101761000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dr. Peter
Kenway, director of the New Policy Institute, pointed out that the
Green Paper did not appear to consider the difficulties employers,
especially small employers, would face in employing those with
fluctuating conditions. I have already referred to the difficulties
that small employers will have. The CBI pointed that out, too. I will
not dwell on the subject of fluctuating conditions now because it will
recur, not necessarily in clause after clause, but it will be a
leitmotif for all of us throughout the Bill.</div>
<a name="06101761000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dr. Kenway said that</div>
<a name="06101761000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if one wants to get employers to
take people on then one has got to look at who is risking what and
whether there is a role for the state in mitigating those risks. That
is particularly acute in the fluctuating health
conditions.&#148;</div> <a name="06101761000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">He pointed
out that the Government and we as a country need to think more closely
about that. I know that that work is being carried out inside the
DWP.</div>
<a name="06101761000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could
touch on the issue of wage subsidies for employers, although I
currently do not favour them. It is interesting to consider whether the
Government should use public expenditure to develop a kind of in-work
benefit, or financial in-work support to encourage those employers I
have described who are not as keen on employing those with disability
as they should
be&#151;</div><a name="06101761000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000416"></a>The

entertaining the Committee but he is now stretching my patience just a
little. He is going rather wide of the amendments I have

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000417"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I accept your stricture, Mr. Amess.
You said that I entertain. I hope that I also inform. That will be for
others to judge. I had, coincidentally, come to the end of my remarks.
I was merely suggesting that, in relation to labour market demand-side
issues, I would not address subsidies from the Government to employers
to encourage them to take on those with limited capabilities. It might
be an issue for others. However, I would not want my remarks on labour
market disadvantage and the nature of limited capability to pass
without flagging up that there is a debate about Government
intervention with wage subsidies. It does not attract me at present. I
am not aware that it attracts the Minister. Nevertheless, it should be
flagged up for the record. That said, I am happy not to go any wider. I
commend amendment No. 52 to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="06101761000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000418"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I would particularly like to speak to
amendments Nos. 183, 1 and 150. I agree with many of the comments of
the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, although I found it instructive
that he seemed to spend more time on the amendments that my hon. Friend
and I tabled on the question of labour market disadvantage than on his
amendment No. 52 which would insert the word
&#147;restricted&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000419"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> That is somewhat churlish as I explained earlier
that a similar amendment was on the amendment paper. I know the hon.
Gentleman looks at these things. I am not saying that he is an anorak,
but he certainly goes through clauses and amendments carefully. He will
see that my hon. Friends and I tabled 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div>an amendment referring to employers&#146; attitudes which, for
whatever reason, in the infinite wisdom of the Chair, was not selected.
As the record shows, we tabled amendments on exactly the point that I
was making.</div>
<a name="06101761000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000420"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, which
perhaps came a moment too soon, as I was about to say how grateful I
was for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s supportive remarks, especially
about the concept of labour market disadvantage.</div>
<a name="06101761000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment that would insert
the term &#147;labour market disadvantage&#148; is fundamentally
about the conceptual basis of the Bill. It would ensure that its
approach is based on the social model of
disability.</div><a name="06101761000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
put this important group of amendments in context. The social model of
disability provides a valuable understanding from which to approach
policy making, particularly as it relates to disabled people. A social
model focuses attention on the barriers that policies must address in
order that disabled people have the same life chances as non-disabled
people. Of course, definitions are necessary. One reason for tabling
the amendments was to stimulate a debate on the issues. We need to
ensure that we have in the Bill a social model of disability that
allows for clear decision making. The amendments, which introduce the
concept of labour market disadvantage, would allow us to do that. By
using different language from the words in the Bill, they would allow
the barriers that people face to be considered from a different
perspective.</div> <a name="06101761000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said, the idea of limited capability
for work is a step on from previous notions of incapacity or, if one
goes back further, invalidity. The Government perhaps had that at the
back of their minds in framing the new language in the Bill, but it
does not go far enough. I would like the Minister when he responds to
explain the term &#147;limited capability for work&#148; and to say
why he believes that it is an improvement on the existing language
relating to the incapacity benefit system.</div>
<a name="06101761000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 52 and the other
amendments in the group proposed the word &#147;restricted&#148;
rather than &#147;limited&#148;. The hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds explained the thinking behind that, and it is a small step
forward, but the amendments and the concept of limited capability for
work still locate the problem with the individual and their impairment
or condition rather than with the broader question of the barriers to
entering the labour market that people face perhaps as a consequence of
their impairment or condition. The issue is the conceptual basis of the
Bill.</div><a name="06101761000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also made the point that the barriers on individuals are
frequently the result of employer attitudes, the principal reason why
someone with a disability or conditional impairment is kept out of the
labour market. I am seeking to introduce the concept of labour market
disadvantage to ensure that the Bill focuses more on the barriers that
people face as a result of the interaction between the individual and
their environment. This is not just about individuals and their
impairment or condition; it is about the barriers that they face as a
result of how society is structured, and the attitudes of other people,
particularly employers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div><a name="06101761000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101761000421"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I am glad to join the
Committee, albeit somewhat belatedly, having risen from my sickbed. I
do not wish in any way to gainsay the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
contribution, or that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds
because I think we are marching along the same lines. However, would
the hon. Gentleman not agree that, while I know what he was driving at,
the concept of labour market disadvantage is a slippery one because, at
any one time, that disadvantage may increase or be diminished beyond
the ability to pick it up? For example, labour market conditions might
change. The disadvantage may be more or less disadvantaging to the
individual at any one time. That is a conceptual difficulty with his
argument.</div><a name="06101761000144"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000422"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. I am glad
to see that the hon. Gentleman has recovered from his sickbed and
welcome him here. The problem with the Bill&#146;s framework is
that&#151;the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was making this
point&#151;it seems to be a supply-side approach that is about
providing support for individuals to get ready for work.</div>
<a name="06101761000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is at least theoretically
possible that, if the pathways to work programme is a success and the
intentions of this Bill are carried through, but nothing is done to
tackle employers&#146; attitudes, the 2.6 million people currently on
incapacity benefit&#151;or a large number of them&#151;who might be
ready to enter work will still face barriers to entering the labour
market as great as the ones they are facing today. It is important that
the definition and concepts that we use in the Bill should not enable
that to happen.</div><a name="06101761000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concept of limited capability for work also runs the risk of limiting
people&#146;s expectations and diverting attention from the barriers
that keep people out of work. A conflicting requirement will be
created. They will need to demonstrate a limited capability to work
through their capacity assessment, which will no doubt be debated later
in the Committee&#146;s proceedings, but also to enter into
discussions&#151;hopefully more positive ones&#151;about their
ability to undertake work-related activity.</div>
<a name="06101761000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The labour
market disadvantage test allows a broader range of factors to be taken
into account, through action planning and work-related activity.
Therefore, putting the concept of labour market disadvantage at the
heart of this Bill would ensure a positive and proactive approach to
improving people&#146;s employment chances. It would allow potential
for identifying and addressing shared labour market disadvantages such
as, for example, a lack of accessible transport or discrimination by
employers in a particular locality. It would allow those broader
strategic issues that are causing labour market disadvantage to people
with disabilities, impairments or serious conditions in a particular
locality to be identified and addressed during the process of action
planning, which is part of the legislation of this Bill. In one part of
the country, for example, there might be employers whose particularly
negative attitudes to disabled people provide a serious labour market
disadvantage to claimants seeking to return to work.</div>
<a name="06101761000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Introducing this concept into
the Bill allows those issues to be identified and discussed and makes
the employment and support allowance more consistent with the general
direction of Government policy for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>disabled people. I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions, the hon. Member for Stirling, will not wish to contradict
the point made, for example, by the Prime Minister in his foreword to
the strategy unit&#146;s report &#147;Improving the life chances
for disabled
people&#148;:</div><a name="06101761000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Barriers
- in attitudes, the design of buildings and policies for example -
still have to be overcome by disabled people, reducing their
opportunities and preventing them from fulfilling their potential. Too
many services are organised to suit providers rather than being
personalised around the needs of disabled
people.&#148;</div><a name="06101761000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
attempting to capture that concept in the amendments in order to
promote the concept of labour market disadvantage. I heard the
Under-Secretary of State make the point from a sedentary position that
this language would make the Bill more consistent with the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 and that&#151;she may wish to intervene to
correct me&#151;those matters relate directly to that Act. The
amendments would partly help to make this Bill more consistent with the
Disability Discrimination Act&#146;s approach, focusing on
impairments not to limit expectations but to identify reasonable
adjustments that stop an impairment being disabling. That is what the
Disability Discrimination Act does. The concept of labour market
disadvantage would introduce the same approach into the Bill, which is
why the point is such an important
one.</div><a name="06101761000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also
make the Bill more consistent with the legislation on working tax
credit, particularly the disability element of working tax credit,
which is based specifically on the concept of disadvantage in getting a
job&#151;a very similar concept to that of labour market
disadvantage. The concept is used as a test of whether someone is
entitled to the disability element of working tax
credit.</div><a name="06101761000369"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06101761000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
idea of limited capability for work is still somewhat behind the
position in other pieces of legislation, so I hope that the Minister
for Employment and Welfare Reform will welcome the amendments in his
response. The Bill must be able to last many years and to stand the
test of time, but it will not be able to do so without a conceptual
basis such as that proposed in the amendments, and in future years
secondary legislation will be limited by the Bill&#146;s outdated
basis. The Prime Minister&#146;s strategy report, &#147;Improving
the life chances of disabled people&#148;, promoted thinking about
the social model of disability, and there is no doubt that that is the
direction in which policy thinking on disabled people is going.
Sticking to the slightly improved but outdated concept of limited
capability for work will limit the ability of future regulations and
amendments to address issues as they should be
addressed.</div><a name="06101761000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume from the Minister&#146;s countenance that the Government will
oppose the amendments, but I encourage him to give further
consideration to the limitations of the concept of limited capability
for work as the conceptual basis for the employment and support
allowance, and to think further about the possibility of introducing
Government amendments, either on Report or later in
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div><a name="06101761000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Daventry
made the point&#151;I think that this is what he was alluding
to&#151;that the concept of labour market disadvantage is a broader
one, which could lead to benefit being widened or to broader issues
being taken into account in a way that the Bill does not envisage.
However, the concept would allow a more positive focus for decisions on
the ESA, and would allow major factors to be taken into account. That
would more accurately reflect the conditions and barriers that current
incapacity benefit recipients face in returning to work. That is my
case on amendments Nos. 183 and
1.</div><a name="06101761000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 150
would insert the
phrase</div><a name="06101761000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;be available for
or actively seek
work&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a probing
amendment that is intended to ensure that the conditions for the ESA
are consistent with those for receiving jobseekers&#146; allowance.
Jobseekers&#146; allowance requires the claimant to be available for
work and actively seeking work. Will the Minister clarify whether the
same dividing line applies for the employment and support allowance?
The Bill does not define &#147;work&#148;, so limited capability
for work is not defined either. The amendment would make it clear that
people eligible for the employment and support allowance would be
judged unable to meet the test for jobseekers&#146; allowance. It
would make clear the dividing line between the two. Will the Minister
clarify the Government&#146;s intentions? The new personal capability
assessment should not be intended to confirm that requiring a person to
work is unreasonable, but to qualify the circumstances in which it is
reasonable to require them to return to
work.</div><a name="06101761000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
relating to labour market disadvantage are sufficiently important that,
subject to the Minister&#146;s response, I shall seek to divide the

amendments?</div><a name="06101761000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000424"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is a very good point of order and the
answer is
yes.</div><a name="06101761000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101761000425"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I do not want to labour
any point so early in the proceedings, but I should like to mention
something, since so much has been said about the labour market already
and because there is a fundamental problem with at least one, if not
all, the amendments&#151;particularly amendment No. 183, which would
replace the term &#147;limited capability&#148; with the concept of
labour market
disadvantage.</div><a name="06101761000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
idea of limited capability focuses our minds on the individual. It is
intended that we work with individuals so we can look at the conditions
that they inhabit and the ones that surround them. It is important to
view &#147;limited capability&#148; as a holistic
concept.</div><a name="06101761000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to labour market disadvantage, I refer the Committee to a piece
of work on older workers that I did when I worked in the then
Department of Employment. The hon. Member for Daventry has already said
that labour market conditions constantly change. I found that when
unemployment was magnificently high a person could be considered old at
30 in Liverpool, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>example, where employment conditions were dreadful, yet they were only
considered old at 50 in Yorkshire and not old at least until 55 in
other parts of the country. That shows the vast range of conditions
that can pertain at any time.</div>
<a name="06101761000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) feels that such
information upholds his argument, but I think that it does the reverse,
because it does not recognise that an individual in any marketplace may
wish, in spite of market conditions, to enter a realm of work in which
they feel that they could be capable. That means that we have to
concentrate on the individual&#146;s capacity for work so we can help
them, rather than consider only market conditions. The prevailing
market conditions will affect more, or fewer, people at different
times.</div><a name="06101761000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000426"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The hon. Lady has been kind enough to mention
what I have already said. May I also declare an interest? In just over
12 months, I shall reach state pension age, so I must fit in the old
category for the labour
market.</div><a name="06101761000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the hon. Lady may have a point about looking at individuals,
particularly in relation to comments made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Bury St. Edmunds on mental health. It is difficult to persuade
employers not to treat the class of people with a mental health
condition as all being potentially dangerous or troublesome. If it is
necessary, they may take proper risk-assessment advice on the
individuals whom it may not be suitable to employ, but they should not
stigmatise all of them as if there were something that ruled them all
out.</div><a name="06101761000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000427"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I
was about to make that point. I do not think that the amendment meets
that requirement. It would be far better to do what is necessary
through considering how the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 can be
properly used and also to work with other parts of the sector, such as
the small business unit, which in my area works closely with employers
on how they can comply with current
legislation.</div><a name="06101761000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
work to be done with employers. I could cite many disappointments with
people who have tried to get into work and felt that they were going to
be supported, only to find that the employers&#151;sometimes big
ones, such as local authorities&#151;failed to provide proper working
conditions. Such things have to be dealt with, but I do not think that
it would be right to use the mechanism suggested in the amendments. It
is far better to use the wording in the Bill, which focuses the mind on
the individual&#146;s conditions, so that we can work with them and
get people on the pathways to work programme and deal with the other
end of the
argument.</div><a name="06101761000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us consider the broader outlook. At a later stage, as a 60-year-old, or
older, former Member of Parliament, I might present myself in the
marketplace but not be the sort of the person that everybody would want
to employ. I would then be able to argue that my capacity for work had
been limited because of the marketplace&#151;I would have a
marketplace disadvantage&#151;but I do not think that that should be
the aim of the Bill. People such as myself can stick up for themselves,
but others cannot 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div>always find a way into work and would not be able to
cite my particular difficulty as theirs. I just think that the
amendment is wrongly worded and does not focus our minds on the right
issue.</div><a name="06101761000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101761000428"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): As this is the
first time that I have spoken to the Committee, I am delighted to
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Amess. I have the honour of
sharing a floor with you, and very often a lift, and I assure you that
the jovial banter that we often share in the lift will not be repeated
in this Committee where all due deference will be shown to you in your
position.</div> <a name="06101761000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
a good discussion this morning and, as so often, the debate over
specific wording reflects a wider concern that all Opposition Committee
members want to address&#151;the question of the extent to which the
Bill deals with employers&#146; prejudices in order to achieve its
objectives of helping many more people to engage in the world of work
who are currently unable to do so because of a
disability.</div><a name="06101761000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey said
correctly that there is a disappointing focus on what is called in the
disability world the &#147;medical model&#148; of disability that
tries to identify a problem as a medical condition. I do not want to
patronise the Government because I know that they are aware of this,
but most disabled people do not want to be defined by their disability.
Therefore, tackling employer prejudice is central to the success of the
Bill.</div> <a name="06101761000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) and I
think that there would be a problem with simply relying on the DDA to
deal with that issue, although I accept that it has the primary role.
It would be difficult to rely entirely on it though because the kind of
prejudice that we are talking about is difficult to trace. Prejudice in
the recruitment of employees is often impossible to prove. An
employer&#146;s recruitment policy might say that they do not
practise any kind of discrimination against disabled people, but in
practice those hidden barriers exist in people&#146;s minds. It is
difficult to deal with
that.</div><a name="06101761000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is an opportunity to address that situation. When speaking to
organisations such as Remploy, which places people in work, it becomes
clear that contact between employers and personal advisers can break
down barriers. That will be rolled out and greatly increased by the
scheme. It is important, therefore, that the Bill understands that an
important role of advisers in the roll-out of pathways is to break down
those barriers. That range of individual contacts is
important.</div><a name="06101761000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we address another question: let us compare the phrase
&#147;limited capability for work&#148; in subsection (3)(a) with
the words &#147;labour market disadvantage&#148; in the Liberal
Democrat spokesman&#146;s amendment. The question is which is likely
to have more claimants. I put it to the Committee that in practise,
under either wording, the number of claimants is likely to be the same.
We are not talking about a different group or number of eligible
people.</div><a name="06101761000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000429"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing
attention to clause 1, line 15 on page 1 of the Bill which
reads:</div><a name="06101761000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
basic conditions are that the
claimant&#151;</div><a name="06101761000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) has limited
capability for work&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div><a name="06101761000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 183 would amend that to
refer to</div><a name="06101761000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;labour market
disadvantage related to physical or mental
condition&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the point that the hon. Gentleman just made about the number of people
affected was correct. The earlier point about the potential for ex-MPs
to be captured by the definition was somewhat beside the
point.</div><a name="06101761000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000430"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful for that response, but I want to say
to the Government that the purpose of the amendments is to make sure
that, as a result of the Bill, the Government give due focus on dealing
with employer attitudes and prejudices. Whether we use a labour market
disadvantage definition, or a restricted capability to work definition,
let us hope that we make so much progress in eradicating discrimination
that the person with a facial disfigurement will have no labour market
disadvantage whatever in 20 years&#146; time. That is our aim. By
going for the labour market disadvantage in due course, it is possible
that fewer people would need the support of the package, because the
Government, when implementing the Bill, would have made sufficient
efforts to deal with employer
prejudices.</div><a name="06101761000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday,
I was at Capability Scotland. It has just carried out a survey showing
that half the unemployed disabled people in Scotland say that they are
unemployed because of discrimination by employers. It is interesting
that the other half say that it is because they are worried about
losing their benefit packages, a matter to which we shall return in
later discussions. We are discussing a huge problem in connection with
employer prejudices. We support the Bill because we regard it not
simply as dealing with the problems of incapacity benefit, but as a
huge opportunity to make the next step forward in inclusion for
disabled
people.</div><a name="06101761000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proper
involvement in the world of work is vital for progress on the
independent living agenda. On that basis, we must think not only about
helping people into the world of work who should work, but helping
people into that world who could work. It is important to deal with the
other side of the coin, which is employers&#146; prejudices and
prejudices of fellow employees. If the Government reject the
amendments, will the Minister please spell out how they propose to deal
with the broader package of ways in which society and attitudes need to
change, as well as the specific issue of how to give individual help to
disabled people who need the package of support offered by the new
employment and support
allowance?</div><a name="06101761000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101761000431"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Wayne David</b> (Caerphilly) (Lab): I have welcomed very much
the tone of our discussion this morning. It has been positive and some
good points have come to the fore. However, I was slightly worried
about the fact that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds had been
described by the CBI as unhelpful. I was even more worried when he
questioned the efficacy of
capitalism.</div><a name="06101761000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000432"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I was not doing that.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div><a name="06101761000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000433"></a>Mr.
David:</b> I note the length of the time that the hon.
Gentleman took to deliver that riposte. The way in which things are
going is clear. He tried to retrieve the situation a little by saying
that the CBI agreed with some of his points. Movement has been far, but
the question is how
far?</div><a name="06101761000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
183 and 1 are important, but I have taken note of the argument of my
hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley. The Bill is focused on
specifics and, although valid points might have been made, there is a
danger of extending it too far. Many good issues have been raised about
the attitudes of employers and the undoubted prejudice that exists
among them, but I honestly do not believe that the Bill is the tool by
which to address such issues. I have no doubt that the Government are
dealing with those matters, so will the Minister explain some of the
ways in which they are dealing with them? I suggest, too, that we must
confront a broader cultural issue. We must not only focus on the Bill,
but take on the perspective to which members of the Committee have
referred. A number of pieces of legislation are being
introduced.</div> <a name="06101761000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is about amendment No. 52, which would omit
&#147;limited&#148; and insert &#147;restricted&#148;. I
brought my Oxford dictionary with me this
morning&#151;</div><a name="06101761000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000434"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> It is not the long
version.</div><a name="06101761000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000435"></a>Mr.
David:</b> Admittedly, it is only the concise version, but it
is the new colour edition. The definition of &#147;restrict&#148;
is given as &#147;confined to certain limits&#148;. Under
&#147;limit&#148; it says &#147;restrict or confine&#148;. In
other words, there is very little difference between the two. I suggest
that in the rest of our discussions we focus on taking the argument
forward and fleshing out some of the good ideas that have already been
mentioned, rather than focusing on the semantic points made in the
debate on the first amendment.</div>
<a name="06101761000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000436"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Thank you for the way in which you have conducted
our proceedings this morning, Mr. Amess. You have allowed a
breadth of arguments to be advanced on some relatively tightly drawn
amendments. I congratulate you on allowing the debate to range on these
matters.</div><a name="06101761000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">After hearing
at the start of the debate that we were seeking consensus, I was
surprised to see that there were no less than 38 amendments to the
first clause. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said that he has
been damned by the CBI as being unhelpful. The Under-Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, said
from a sedentary position, &#147;Leave him to assess what he said
when he was a special adviser at the Treasury,&#148; when
unemployment was at 3 million and all sorts of other things were
happening in the 1990s.</div>
<a name="06101761000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000437"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> As far as my time as special adviser to my right
hon. and learned friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr.
Clarke) is concerned, we gave the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Government a
golden economic legacy of single-digit inflation and interest rates,
the lowest unemployment rates in Europe and record inward investment
and I am hugely proud of that record.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div><a name="06101761000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000438"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I know not to respond in too much detail to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. He missed the fact that incapacity
benefit levels had trebled, that one in three kids lived in
poverty&#151;</div><a name="06101761000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000439"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I was too weak; I should have intervened
immediately. The Minister knows that he has to respond to the
amendment.</div><a name="06101761000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000440"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Mr. Amess, you would be right to
chastise me if I said that one in five kids grew up in a household with
no one in work, so I will not make that point.</div>
<a name="06101761000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall reply to the points
that have been made, in quite a constructive way, on the amendments. At
present, the incapacity benefit legislation uses the concept of
incapacity for work as a key condition of entitlement to the benefit.
Incapacity for work focuses on what people are unable to do; it is a
central weakness of our current culture of benefit, which creates a
negative impression or perception among those who are on the
benefit.</div> <a name="06101761000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
2.7 million people on incapacity benefit, which is a reduction in
recent years. If the trend through the 1980s and the first part of the
1990s had continued, the challenge today would have been to give 4
million people, not 2.7 million, the chance to get back to work. Make
no mistake, that was the trajectory that we inherited and it shows the
scale of what has been achieved thus far. I frankly acknowledge that
not enough has yet been done and that we need to do more to support
people among that 2.7 million, and to get a net reduction of 1 million
people off incapacity benefit over a
decade.</div><a name="06101761000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000441"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I was not going to raise this issue as I did not
want to spoil the general tone of consensus, but on a technical point,
the Minister made the point that the trends at the end of the 1990s
were not very
creditable.</div><a name="06101761000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000442"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b>
Disgraceful.</div><a name="06101761000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000443"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Minister says, &#147;Disgraceful&#148;,
but he is talking about trends. For the record, even if the Bill does
not perform as well as we all hope it will, by 2016&#151;the end of
the target period for reducing the 2.7 million by 1
million&#151;the figure will be 2.36 million anyway. That is
according to a parliamentary answer that the Under-Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions gave me.</div>
<a name="06101761000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State told the
Select Committee at the beginning of March that his aim was to get the
figure down from 2.7 million to 1.7 million. Without any policy change
in the Bill, the Government have already made great progress towards
the target of 1.7 million. It will be 2.36 million anyway, on
the estimates that the hon. Lady published for on-flow and off-flow. We
hope that the 1 million target is hit. We are all behind it, but let us
also recognise that 340,000 of it will be hit anyway by natural
on-flows and off-flows. Those are the Government&#146;s figures and
there is a natural downward trend. I end my intervention on the point
that the Minister raises about trends.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 26</div><a name="06101761000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000444"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> There is an awful lot in what the hon. Gentleman
said. He said that we are seeking over a decade to reduce the number of
people on incapacity benefit by 1 million. Some say that target is not
achievable. I simply offer the observation that if the previous
Government could increase it by 1 million over a decade, we can
decrease it over the same period.
</div><a name="06101761000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, there has
been remarkable recent improvement, but not far enough. Part of it is
because of the labour market interventions and part of it is through
the new deal and pathways. What if we settle simply for what has been
achieved thus far? As the hon. Gentleman mentioned in his reasonable
introductory remarks, the growing trend in fluctuating mental health
conditions is a major contributory factor for people now coming on to
incapacity benefit. If we do not intervene and offer support to those
folk, these figures will grow again, because of the 40 per cent. coming
on with a fluctuating mental health condition and the change in the
gender profile of people coming on to incapacity benefit. Previously,
we understood it to be part of an industrial legacy from some of the
traditional heavy industrial areas of the United Kingdom. But that
pattern has changed over
time.</div><a name="06101761000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to the
point raised specifically in the amendment, with employment and support
allowance we want to move away from the creation of a negative
perception of incapacity. We want to move away from labelling anyone as
incapable. We want to move towards looking at what people can do, as
well as what they cannot do, given their illness or disability. We also
want to assess entitlement to the benefit in a neutral way, avoiding
writing people off because they have demonstrated that there are things
they cannot do.</div>
<a name="06101761000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Demonstrating &#147;limited
capability for work&#148; is a fundamental condition of entitlement
to the new employment and support allowance. By using &#147;limited
capability for work&#148;, we are making it clear that we accept that
customers, citizens and clients have identifiable and measurable
limitations on their ability to carry out various activities. Having
identified the extent of those limitations, we acknowledge that at a
certain level of limitation, it is unreasonable to require these people
to work, or to undertake work-related activity, depending on the
outcome of the reformed personal capability
allowance.</div><a name="06101761000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the comments of the hon. Member for Inverness, Badenoch and
Strathspey&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147; And
Nairn.&#148;] Of course, having been to Nairn I know what an
important omission that would be. I can confirm that this is not
jobseeker&#146;s allowance by another name. No one will be
sanctioned, encouraged or told to find work. It is about supporting
people to have the opportunity to build their confidence, regain their
skills and undertake work-related activity if that is appropriate. The
benefit for people who need to be actively seeking employment is
jobseeker&#146;s allowance and will remain
so.</div><a name="06101761000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06101761000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process
of demonstrating limited capability for work recognises an entitlement
to the support provided by the ESA but avoids labelling people as
incapable or writing off their ability to work if future help and
support are provided to get them closer to the labour market.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 27</div><a name="06101761000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
identifying the most appropriate way of expressing the concept behind
entitlement to ESA, we considered the various principles that we needed
to incorporate in order to find the right way to distil the concept
into wording. The words &#147;limited capability for work&#148;
reflect that extensive consideration and discussion. We are satisfied
that the word &#147;limited&#148; reflects most accurately the
principles we want to capture for employment and support allowance. In
particular, we observe that &#147;limited&#148; is a neutral phrase
and simply states that on a spectrum of ability to carry out an
activity, there is an identifiable point at which a person finds it
more difficult to carry out that activity. It does not label someone as
incapable of carrying out that activity, nor does it imply that the
difficulty is permanent.</div>
<a name="06101761000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000445"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does the Minister not accept that one of the things
that can limit people&#146;s capability to work is the attitude of
other people, particularly
employers?</div><a name="06101761000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000446"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. It is not just the
attitude of employers but of fellow employees, people on the bus on the
way to work, the person they buy a newspaper from in the
newsagent&#146;s on the way, neighbours and people who walk by in the
street. Of course society&#146;s attitudes impact the rehabilitation
and confidence of people with a disability, particularly those with a
fluctuating mental health condition, as well as their self-perception
and ability to enter the labour market and play a wider role in
society. I shall make a few comments about that. The hon. Member for
Bury St. Edmunds asked about employer
engagement.</div><a name="06101761000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000447"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Minister makes a point about decision
making through the PCA. Does he not accept that the concept in
amendment No. 183&#151;labour market disadvantage related to physical
or mental condition&#151;captures that broader point but would still

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000448"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall come to that in a moment, once I deal with
the point raised by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. He made a
quite well-informed speech and raised a number of important
issues.</div><a name="06101761000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000449"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000450"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Well, I am not sure I will become used to it. The
hon. Gentleman made an informed speech and raised a number of genuinely
important points relating to employers&#146; attitudes. However, what
he did&#151;it is a trend among Opposition Front-Bench spokespeople
at the moment&#151;was to raise a concern and offer no prognosis:
&#147;I share this concern; here is something that needs to be
addressed&#148;, full
stop.</div><a name="06101761000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000451"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Is not tabling amendments a practical way of showing
a prognosis or making suggestions to deal with the
issues?</div><a name="06101761000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000452"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds mentioned
rehabilitation leave and said, &#147;Let&#146;s have a debate about
that,&#148; without offering a view on whether the Conservatives
support it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 28</div><a name="06101761000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000453"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I said that I hoped that we would have a debate,
that the Conservatives would be expressing our views on that and all
the resource implications and that we must have a grown-up debate about
it later in Committee. I do not want the Minister to leave people with
the impression that we will not make our position clear when the
clauses relating to rehabilitation leave are
debated.</div><a name="06101761000215"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000454"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is very helpful, but the hon. Gentleman also
made observations about statutory sick pay, anti-stigma campaigns and a
series of other issues without offering a specific
prognosis.</div><a name="06101761000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000455"></a>Mr.

although he may say that it is a trend for Opposition politicians to
talk about a problem without offering a prognosis, it has also become a
trend for Ministers to spend most of their speeches talking about
Conservative policies rather than addressing their own, which people
are interested to
hear.</div><a name="06101761000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000456"></a>Mr.

<a name="06101761000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000458"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I wish to make some progress. To be fair, the hon.
Gentleman opposed one policy, but it was the one policy that we were in
favour of. That policy is about supporting people financially to make
the transition into work more effective and extending the
return-to-work credits for a full year. Of course, that measure will be
means-tested for those going into the lowest-paid work, but it will
encourage the transition into work and genuinely make work pay for
people who have been out of work for prolonged periods on incapacity
benefit or on employment and support allowance. We are committed to the
concept and the specifics of committing public funds to support the
alleviation of in-work poverty for those coming off incapacity benefit
and the employment and support
allowance.</div><a name="06101761000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Engagement
with employers is essential, because in the main the Government do not
create jobs. Most jobs are created in the private sector. That is the
underpinning philosophy that we have to consider in our approach to the
Bill. Additionally, we also have to acknowledge the important fact that
the public sector&#151;government, the health service, and other
public agencies&#151;is also an employer. It would be wrong, looking
towards 2008, if we seek to compel private sector businesses to do
something that we do not already do ourselves. That is an important
challenge for public sector
employers.</div><a name="06101761000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000459"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I just could not believe my ears when the
Minister of State asserted that the Government were committed to
increasing jobs in the private sector, which I concede is so, but
appeared not to be interested in promoting jobs in the public sector.
The number of people directly employed by the public sector has
increased by some 300,000 since 1997. Is he repudiating those past
moves or is he now saying that the Government have learned from them
and will not repeat them?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 29</div><a name="06101761000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000460"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The figures show that there are almost 29 million
people in employment in this country, which is a record under any
Government, and is 2.5 million more than in 1997. Of course, there has
been an increase in the public sector, but that is dwarfed by the
increase in the number of people now in employment outside the public
sector. I know the hon. Gentleman to be a fair man, and I think that he
would acknowledge
that.</div><a name="06101761000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000461"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Minister makes an important point about the
need for Departments and public sector bodies to play a role fairly in
employing people currently on incapacity benefit and disabled people.
Does he acknowledge that the Government have a great deal more to do in
this area? I draw his attention to a written answer to me from the
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for
Stirling, which shows that the proportion of staff in the Department
for Work and Pensions who are defined as disabled has fallen from 5.99
per cent. to 5.26 per cent. over a six-year period. Is that not an
indication of how far the Government have to go to ensure that their
own house is in
order?</div><a name="06101761000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000462"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, which
I had already made, which is that the public sector, including
government, public agencies, non-departmental and other public
bodies&#151;all sorts of public sector organisations&#151;also have
to see what more they can do to support the Government&#146;s agenda
and the wider agenda in respect of supporting people to come off
employment and support allowance and into active employment by 2008.
The Government should not encourage others to do what we are not
willing to do ourselves by
2008.</div><a name="06101761000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The details of
our relationship and conversation with employers, and what more we can
do, are set out in our health, work and well-being strategy, which has
been published. We should be supporting people while they get into
work. As we know and as hon. Members have already said, people journey
from being active in the labour market, through a period of depression,
illness, intermittent or long-term absence, to statutory sick pay and
everything else that goes with that. We have to be a lot more proactive
with employers. Many employers are comfortable with and proactive on
this agenda, but the last point of intervention in the welfare system
and working with employers should be when someone reports for benefit.
Currently, that is the first point of
intervention.</div><a name="06101761000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a huge amount of work to do with employers. We are discussing with
employers in great detail the most effective way to improve support at
work, including occupational therapies and removing stigma in the
workplace among employers and employees.</div>
<a name="06101761000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have options for encouraging
a change in attitude, although there have been changes
already&#151;we all acknowledge that there have been improvements
over recent years. There has been a 10 per cent. improvement in the
employment rate of those with declared disabilities, but that is not
enough; it is an improvement, but we must go further.</div>
<a name="06101761000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The best
people to encourage employers are not the Government, but other
employers with positive experiences of employing someone with a
disability and of those people&#146;s sheer
determination. That is a more effective 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div>way in which to achieve success on that agenda, and we are discussing
with major employers the most effective way in which to do that. We
want an employer-led publicity campaign on best practice based on their
own experiences. Some employers said that to be frank they felt they
had taken a slight risk&#151;their words, not mine&#151;but that
they were glad that they had. Allowing them to share that experience
with others is a more effective approach than leaving the Government to
do it by
themselves.</div><a name="06101761000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000463"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does the Minister share my concern that some of the
employers who have shown best practice in that area, such as BT, Asda
and Royal Mail, are quite open in saying that what drove them to
develop a more progressive policy towards employing disabled people
were labour market shortages and that their inability to fill places in
their own work force with non-disabled people led them to look at the
pool of disabled people? When they did that, they found that disabled
people are often more loyal employees, and more profitable to employ.
In particular, BT found that it saved a huge amount in recruitment
costs.</div><a name="06101761000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a labour
market where unemployment is rising and with the prospect of many more
people coming to the UK from the EU accession countries, is the
Minister concerned that that engine for promoting the employment of
disabled people might no longer
exist?</div><a name="06101761000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000464"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Various employers across the country have employed
people from all sorts of backgrounds and with fluctuating mental and
physical health for reasons important to their local labour market,
values, market strategies and the way in which they run their
businesses. The hon. Gentleman mentioned a few, but there are many
others. There is a good number of them&#151;I shall not name check
any of them now because it would be unfair not to name check them all.
However, at a later date, if time allows&#151;I know that we have
only 16 sittings&#151;perhaps the Committee will allow me to go
through all those that we engage with on a regular
basis.</div><a name="06101761000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, there are pressures, such as the skills base. I am not talking
just about the skills gap in constituencies in south Wales, central
Scotland, the north-east and north-west&#151;it is significant in
some of those places&#151;where people, predominantly men, are out of
work for prolonged periods because of the decline in traditional
industries. In the world of information technology, the pace of change
is so quick that if some one is out of work for three, six or nine
months, or a year, their skills become stale and their confidence is
knocked. The skills base and the individual skills of everyone on
incapacity benefit and the employment and support allowance are
important factors in employability. That is why Sandy Leach&#146;s
skills review is
important.</div><a name="06101761000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall make briefly another point about wider engagement. The work of
general practitioners and other health professionals is important. As
we know, for too long, in many cases, GPs have prescribed pills,
tablets and medication when condition management and part-time or
voluntary work might have been more appropriate. That default
position&#151;time off work being considered the best solution in
such circumstances&#151;is becoming increasingly a thing of the past.
However, we need to go further to ensure that GPs are engaged in that
issue.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div><a name="06101761000372"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="06101761000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to the points on labour market disadvantage made by the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. He is right: we
do not intend to accept his amendments, and I shall explain why. There
is a superficial attraction to them, and the hon. Gentleman put the
case for them thoughtfully. However, they would undermine two key
principles behind the employment and support allowance: first that it
is based objectively on functional limitations assessed through the
PCA, and secondly that it is defined nationally and consistently. As
the hon. Gentleman said, and as interventions made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Colne Valley and others have shown, people are
disadvantaged in the labour market by a wide range of factors. In
introducing the new benefit we are aiming for national consistency
based on an objective assessment of functional
limitations.</div><a name="06101761000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Skills
have an impact on labour market disadvantage, as do personal
experience, transport and national employment rates. To have different
entitlements based on different transport conditions in different
towns, or even within the same town or the same street, or based on
labour markets in different nations or cities of the United Kingdom or
within cities, would lead to enormous inconsistency and uncertainty.
Even if such observation and measurement were desirable&#151;I do not
agree with the assessment that it is&#151;it would be hopelessly
complicated and unworkable.</div>
<a name="06101761000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Labour market
disadvantage is caused by a myriad ever-changing circumstances, such as
local redundancies or a change to a local bus route. There can be so
many such circumstances that to set in statute provisions based on that
continually fluctuating labour market would remove the consistency that
many on employment support allowance would value. It would also create
a design challenge that would be undeliverable: a benefit entitlement
changing from year to year, month to month, week to week or even day to
day, based on happenings in a person&#146;s locality. It would
undermine the principles of the
ESA.</div><a name="06101761000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000465"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I am listening carefully to my hon. Friend.
Does he agree that we need to guard against a counsel of despair and
the idea that there is nothing that an individual can do to change
their circumstances, because market conditions are such that they can
never enter work? Instead of looking at what they can do, such a person
might always think, because of market disadvantage, &#147;There is no
hope for me.&#148; Such a counsel of despair is a situation that I do
not
want.</div><a name="06101761000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000466"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend is typically accurate. We are
moving away from negative labelling, and we have discussed whether we
are going far enough in emphasising the positive nature of what people
can contribute. Either as constituency Members of Parliament or in
preparation for the Bill, we have all met people and listened to their
work aspirations. To reintroduce a test of disadvantage based on
negativity, on top of everything else in the Bill, would be entirely
wrong even if it were practically
achievable.</div><a name="06101761000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000467"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Is not the Minister contradicting himself? Earlier,
in response to my intervention, he agreed that limited capability for
work could include limitations by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div>factors such as employers&#146; attitudes. Those factors vary between
areas of the country and types of employment, so there are inevitably
variations in capability for work. If the phrase &#147;limited
capability for work&#148; can include the attitudes of others, as the
Minister said to me earlier, is that not the same variable that the
Liberal Democrat amendment
covers?</div><a name="06101761000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000468"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Not at all, and I would be interested to hear from
any Opposition Member who believes that the suggestion is workable,
even if it is desirable. Limited capability for work will be determined
through the renewed and modernised PCA and the work-focused
health-related assessment. We want that to be the neutral and objective
process for gaining entitlement to ESA in
future.</div><a name="06101761000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
there are wider circumstances that affect people&#146;s ability to
enter the labour market. However, for the legislation to say that that
labour market disadvantage&#151;with all the different factors that
feed into it&#151;should accompany the PCA as a way of assessing
benefit entitlement would be unworkable and would reintroduce
negativity. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey did not even attempt to explain how it would work in
practice. I hope that he will not press his amendments, but if he is
minded to do so, I shall encourage my hon. Friends to oppose them on
the basis that they are unnecessary and entirely unworkable in
practice, and that they would constitute a return to
negativity.</div><a name="06101761000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000469"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> We have had an interesting debate, Mr.
Chairman, and you have been very generous in allowing Opposition
Members to range widely, so I shall not take up more time. However, the
Opposition may wish to press the amendments in my name&#151;amendment
No. 52 and the related amendments Nos. 205 and 206&#151;to a vote. I
understand the arguments that the Minister has evinced on why he does
not wish to accept them. Nevertheless, we may wish to press the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000482"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr.
Amess. I have been in several Committees that you have chaired and I
know that you are always more than fair to those of us who sit on the
Back
Benches.</div><a name="06101761000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am looking for clarification from the Minister on clause 1(3)(e), which
is associated with paragraph 5 of schedule 3 and concerns the effect of
income-related allowances on the disability premium. I seek
clarification as to how claimants of the ESA who qualify for the
disability premium of income support by other routes will be able to
receive the premium during the assessment phase. I also seek
clarification on how sick or disabled claimants who claim benefit on
the basis of a status other than being incapable of work&#151;for
example, lone parents or carers&#151;will continue to be able to
receive the disability premium in income support without having to
claim ESA.</div><a name="06101761000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The terms
of clause 1(3)(e) and paragraph 5 of schedule 3 would seem to set up a
strict demarcation between those entitled to income support and those
entitled to the ESA. If that is right, it suggests that the person will
no longer be able to qualify for the disability premium in her or his
income support on account of their having a limited capability for
work, as it would seem that the determination of that issue lies
exclusively within the ESA, and so the determination of whether a
person has such a limited capability to work will arise only if she or
he makes a claim for
ESA.</div><a name="06101761000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, a
significant number of people qualify for income support by a route
other than their capability for work, such as carers and lone parents.
They are also incapable of work&#151;or, in the ESA language, will
have limited capability for work&#151;and so qualify for the
disability premium in their income support. Under clause 1(3)(e) and
paragraph 5 of schedule 3, it is unclear how such a person will access
the disability premium. If the answer is that the person can access the
disability premium only by claiming the ESA and being found to have a
limited capability for work, those lone parents and carers would have
to make themselves subject to the conditionality regime under the ESA,
which I understand is not the intention.</div>
<a name="06101761000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other hand, if it is
intended that lone parents or carers who also have a limited capability
for work will be able to qualify for the disability premium in their
income support, we are unclear as to how clause 1(3)(e) will enable
that to be achieved. The disability premium is an important
contribution towards meeting the cost of disability. The proposal in
the Green Paper is to incorporate it into the main phase of the ESA,
but it is unclear where that leaves the claimants referred to above.
The high levels of poverty among disabled persons indicate that benefit
levels are inadequate at present. Any restriction on the availability
of the disability premium can only worsen that
situation.</div><a name="06101761000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000483"></a>Mr.

welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Amess? It is already clear
that we will enjoy the process of discussing a Bill that enjoys a high
degree of consensus in all parts of the Room, but which also contains
areas of detail that need exploration.</div>

of Ambiguity&#148; and, for the avoidance of doubt&#151;as the
lawyers, of which I am not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div>one, would say&#151;I should point out that I am on the Front Bench
for the purposes of anything that I say, although I am on the Back
Bench geographically, which is a matter of convenience and might also
have something to do with the temporary avoidance of
contagion.</div><a name="06101761000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
add some remarks to the admirable points that my colleagues have made.
The first is to emphasise the cardinal importance of employer
engagement. Indeed, the Minister has spoken about that issue, and there
is no real contention between us. However, we all need to remember that
the proposals will not work substantially unless somebody is prepared
to employ the people concerned. If we believe, as many of us do
passionately, that there is a strong business case for the involvement
of disabled people&#151;they are beneficial to business, being a
profit centre, not a cost centre, if I may put it that way&#151;it is
important to persuade employers of that case.</div>
<a name="06101761000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the main ways in which
the Government can do that directly is through their own activities in
the public sector. It is fair to say that those have been patchy, and
as the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, who
speaks for the Liberal Democrats, reminded us, there are some rather
disturbing figures. Indeed, I tabled a question some years ago asking
which Departments were members of the admirable Employers Forum on
Disability. We found that a number, including the Minister&#146;s own
Department, were, that others were not, and that one or two clearly did
not know whether they were or not. I make the serious point, however,
that the public sector can properly give a lead on this issue, although
I would not like it to be seen as detracting from the importance of
involving small and medium-sized enterprises as well. Special
considerations could conceivably apply, particularly in relation to
mental ill health, and they must be discussed in a sensible and
balanced way. I therefore want to hammer home the importance of
employer engagement at all points in this Bill and to make the point
that engagement is good for employers, claimants and the national
interest.</div><a name="06101761000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06101761000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those who
broadly support the Bill should sometimes stand back from it, and my
second point relates to the great importance of communication. On
revisiting the clause, it occurred to me that the average claimant is
unlikely to find this benefit particularly easy to understand. I make
no cheap trick about that, because the clause is drafted in legal form,
as it must be; indeed, it is rather better drafted than many of the
bits of legislation that the Government serve up to Committees, so I
have no problem in that regard. However, this is a multiple benefit,
with an income-related element and a contributory element. It will be
paid at different rates in the holding period, and there will also be
the issue of whether there is an employment allowance or a support
allowance, so matters will be extremely complicated. In some
cases&#151;I will speak to them when we reach a later clause on
advance payments&#151;people might receive an award under a set of
conditions that does not apply until they reach a qualifying date, so
there might be further scope for confusion there.</div>
<a name="06101761000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that I am
saying to the Minister, in all seriousness, is that if we need
algorithms and diagrams to explain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>more or less what is going on&#151;and I am pleased to see them,
because I always like explanatory clauses&#151;how much more will the
average claimant need? I do not say for a moment that the Department
and its officers are not committed to this process, but I would very
much welcome it if the Minister spent a moment or two at least giving
the Committee the assurance that the issue will be actively handled and
that every effort will be made to improve the way in which matters are
communicated to people&#151;perhaps using colour-coding or whatever
other variants and modern techniques there are. We need to
remember&#151;we will need to return to this throughout the
Committee&#151;that many of the people we are talking about are
vulnerable and possibly demotivated and that they have not seen what
they could do. We are trying to emphasise their potential, and we need
to make a positive case at all stages for encouraging them to achieve
what they are capable of. Frankly&#151;I know that this is a
throwaway, and we all do this ourselves&#151;we do not want to add
the need to grumble about a load of paperwork to the other problems
that people face when trying to obtain entry to employment.</div>
<a name="06101761000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I saw the Minister nodding
through that, but I thought that somebody needed to say it. I feel very
strongly that that approach should inform everything that we do in this
Committee and that it should inform not only what the rules are, but
how they are explained to people in a way that is helpful to them and
which in no way diminishes their enthusiasm for returning to the labour
market.</div>
<a name="06101761000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000484"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I want to point to three areas in which there is a
lack of clarity and I should be grateful if the Minister would address
them.</div> <a name="06101761000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we had a
good discussion about the importance of involving employers in the
process. The Minister&#146;s view was that the best people to
persuade employers are other employers, but like other Opposition
Members, I was thinking of something broader than just a marketing
campaign by one group of employers to another. We are really talking
about a fundamental change in employers&#146; attitudes. I suggest to
the Minister that the best way to get that is to recognise that the
Government are the largest single employer. Given that 1.3 million
people are employed in the national health service alone, there is a
huge opportunity to transform attitudes to employing disabled people by
improving the practice of Government. I do not just want Government to
say that they do not want to impose on the private sector and employers
what they are not prepared to do themselves. They should say that they
want the Government sector to blaze a trail with its far-sighted
attitudes to the employment of disabled
people.</div><a name="06101761000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000485"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I strongly endorse my hon. Friend&#146;s
remarks. Does he not agree that it would be helpful to involve Members
of Parliament from all parties in local activities in this area, as
Government sometimes do? I am going to see a pathways to work project
in Derby on Friday, and there is a wonderful opportunity to show
engagement by using people on the projects and by being seen as a
beacon for other employers in that regard.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div><a name="06101761000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000486"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I am sure
that the Minister has had similar feedback, but advisers often say to
us that, in respect of employment, it is harder to place people in the
public sector than in the private sector. That is not meant as a swipe
at the Government in any way. The reality is that the public sector
often has the best policies on paper for the recruitment of disabled
people, but in practice their implementation can be bureaucratic,
whereas the private sector&#146;s policies are often not as good on
paper, but managers are willing to be flexible when faced with a
situation of employing a particular disabled person. The Government
could do much by leading by example, and I would welcome the Minister
saying that he sees the Government playing a positive role by
transforming their policies on the employment of disabled
people.</div> <a name="06101761000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
confusion about whether the Government accept the validity of the
social model as opposed to the medical model. The Minister said that he
accepted that people&#146;s capability for work can be limited by the
attitudes of others but, at another point in the debate, he said that
he wanted the test to be purely objective and that he therefore would
not want it to take into account the attitudes or prejudices of others.
We need more clarity.</div>
<a name="06101761000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister inform me
about something else? I do not understand subsection (3)(e), which says
that the basic conditions include that the claimant</div>
<a name="06101761000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is not entitled to income
support&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that one is entitled to it if one is: a lone parent; registered sick or
disabled; a student and either a lone parent or disabled; or one is
caring for someone who is sick and elderly and one does not have a
certain threshold of savings. Some disabled groups have told me that,
on the face of it, the provision would seem to exclude many disabled
people from being eligible for ESA because they fall into the
categories of being lone parents or carers who have income below the
thresholds that are required. I would be grateful if the Minister would
clarify that point. I am sure that he does not intend to exclude large
numbers of people by the wording, but it would seem to do
that.</div>
<a name="06101761000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000487"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I associate myself with the remarks made by the
hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson). He made points
about probing the potentially complex interactions between ESA and
other benefits, particularly as they relate to lone parents, carers and
so on. That is an important issue, and I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s clarification of the intentions.</div>
<a name="06101761000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some broader issues about the
complexity of this benefit need to be drawn out a little. In the Green
Paper, the Government made it clear that they thought that there was a
possibility of further simplification of this aspect of the benefits
system in future, in particular by an idea that I think well worthy of
a further debate in relation to where we go next after this: moving to
some sort of single working age benefit to create a much greater degree
of simplicity in the benefits system. The Green Paper suggested that
that idea might be considered. I should be grateful if the Minister
could enlighten us whether the Government wish to look at that. I hate
to prejudge matters, but if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div>the Bill were passed, is that a direction in which he believes that
policy could go
next?</div><a name="06101761000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Short-term
issues are also involved in the complexity of the system that remains
under the Bill, as the hon. Member for Daventry said when he referred
to graphs, charts and the explanatory notes. Explaining to current
benefit recipients how the new benefit will work and how it will differ
from the existing benefit will be complicated, not least because it is
now the Government&#146;s intention, when the new system is in place,
to migrate all existing claimants to the new benefit. Will the Minister
provide a little more enlightenment about how the Government intend to
go about migrating all existing claimants to the new benefit? What does
he regard as the timetable for such a process? What process of
education and information does he envisage being
undertaken?</div><a name="06101761000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000488"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not wish to assume the post of the Minister
for Employment and Welfare Reform. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;Not yet.&#148;] I heard what my hon.
Friends said from a sedentary position, but I shall not be tempted down
that route. I say to the hon. Gentleman that we know the answer. My
understanding is that, because the new ESA is resource intensive
compared with incapacity benefit, any existing claimant on incapacity
benefit who was to be migrated to ESA would, to put it bluntly in
Treasury terms, cost a lot of money to resource. The Secretary of State
has made it clear that it is &#147;as resources allow&#148;, which
is Treasury speak for &#147;Gordon Brown has not told us what we have
got for next year&#146;s
Budget&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000489"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am sure that the Minister will not
necessarily wish to prejudge the result of the comprehensive spending
review, although any commitments that he can make not only in that
area, but in relation to my earlier point about the long-term funding
for the pathways to work programme will be welcome. It is essential in
making the process
work.</div><a name="06101761000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000490"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Just for the record, will the hon. Gentleman
concede that the Department for Work and Pensions has anticipated and,
indeed, reached an agreement with the Treasury on its forward programme
of spending ahead of major announcements next year? Frankly, the
prospects for pushing the boat out for such a benefit&#151;admirable
as it may be&#151;do not look good from those
figures.</div><a name="06101761000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000491"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made my point. One of my
biggest worries remains the fact that, as far as I know, &#163;360
million has been allocated to the roll-out of pathways to work and
other changes under the Bill. That is grossly insufficient to meet the
needs of incapacity benefit claimants to have the chance to access the
support and help that might be needed to assist them to overcome their
labour market disadvantage. I shall continue to use that term, despite
the result of the Division earlier. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten
the Committee on those
points.</div><a name="06101761000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employer
attitudes relate to our debate. I commend to the Minister the work of
the Employers Forum on Disability to promote a disability audit within
employers. I hope that he will support and encourage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 38</div>it. It highlights employers in the public and private sector who can be
role models and explains to other employers the substantial benefits of
employing disabled
people.</div><a name="06101761000291"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000492"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> On that note, no doubt the hon. Gentleman will have
heard yesterday&#146;s announcement that the Conservative party has
asked Scope to undertake an audit of the party&#146;s employment
procedures in respect of disability. Scope is also in discussions with
the Liberal Democrats about carrying out a similar audit for that
party. However, it has not yet heard back from the Labour party about
whether it will be willing to have an audit undertaken of its
practices. Perhaps the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey will ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that
the Labour party could set an
example.</div><a name="06101761000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000493"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I do not wish to try your patience,
Mr. Amess, too much on the issue, but I noted that
announcement yesterday. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that I
announced a month ago that the Liberal Democrats had reached a similar
agreement with Scope to carry out an audit of our candidate selection
procedures. I was pleased to see the Conservative party follow suit,
and I hope that the Minister will use his good offices to ensure that
the Labour party does likewise. Encouraging the participation of
disabled people in public life is as much a part of the philosophy
behind the Bill as many of the other points that we debated
earlier.</div>
<a name="06101761000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">One change
that could be made to promote the better engagement of employers with
this issue is the introduction of rehabilitation leave, which the hon.
Member for Glasgow, North-West has proposed in a Bill. The Liberal
Democrats will be more than happy to support his proposal when it is
debated in this Committee.</div>
<a name="06101761000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000494"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> As is the case in Committee, some very talented
officials have drafted an excellent speaking note. With your
permission, however, Mr. Amess, I will answer some of the
specific points rather than simply repeat the note. For the record, it
explains the structure of clause 1. By reading the clause, hon. Members
will read what is in my speaking note, anyway, but if they wish me to
place a copy of it in the Library or to read it anyway, I will be happy
to do so.</div> <a name="06101761000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
known my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West for many years.
I would like to thank him for giving me advance notice of his detailed
question, but he did not, so I cannot. I reassure him that my answer
will be shorter than his question, and I encourage him to look at the
draft regulations and the supporting material, including page 4 on the
new structure of the benefit, which the Department published earlier
this month. It was sent to everyone on the day of their selection to
the Committee.</div>
<a name="06101761000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Basically, we
are restructuring the architecture of the benefits. There will be an
assessment phase, and then a basic allowance on top of which there will
be two separate levels. The first will be paid to those with
work-related activity, expectations and conditionality; and any higher
amount will be paid to more severely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div>disabled people for whom there is no requirement to
undertake any conditionality or work-focused interviews. Additionally,
all the benefit levels that 2.7 million people currently enjoy will be
protected during their transferral to the employment support
allowance.</div> <a name="06101761000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend asked specifically about lone parents. When the ESA is
introduced, they can make their own choice. If they claim income
support because they are a lone parent, they can stay on it and keep
the disability premium. Alternatively, they can claim ESA because they
are sick and disabled, and obtain the new structure and support. I hope
that that clarifies the point for him.</div>
<a name="06101761000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000495"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Will the Minister explain that point, because the
Bill seems to say the precise opposite? Subsection (3)
says:</div><a name="06101761000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
basic conditions are that the
claimant...</div><a name="06101761000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">(e) is not
entitled to income support&#148;.</div>
<a name="06101761000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does not that mean that the lone parent
of whom he talks would not have that
choice?</div>
<a name="06101761000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000496"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman misunderstood me.
The provision is based on the principle that someone cannot access two
contributory benefits at once. We would not pay it, and they would not
be entitled to employment support allowance if in receipt
of&#151;</div><a name="06101761000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000497"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The Bill does not say &#147;in receipt of&#148;;
it says &#147;entitled
to&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000498"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That person would not be entitled to ESA, based on
the condition set out in subsection (3)(e), which is on entitlement to
income support. The individual will choose, based on the explanation
that I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow,
North-West.</div>
<a name="06101761000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000499"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> For the sake of clarity, the clause says that
the individual</div> <a name="06101761000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is not
entitled to income
support&#148;.</div><a name="06101761000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has just described a circumstance in which the individual would be
entitled to income support and ESA and would have the right to choose
between them. The Bill would specifically prohibit that circumstance by
making not having entitlement a condition. If the Minister is saying
that subsection (3)(e) should read, &#147;is not claiming income
support&#148;, that is quite different from what the Bill
says.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000502"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I feel that it will be a similar point so I will
give
way.</div><a name="06101761000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000503"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. As
I understood it, he effectively said that there would be a no-detriment
provision whereby if somebody chose&#151;and Ministers are nodding at
that&#151;to maintain their existing patterns of benefit because they
were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div>more advantageous or they preferred to do so, they would be permitted to
do so.</div> <a name="06101761000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern
relates to schedule 4. In paragraph 6, regulations make provision for
converting existing awards into awards of ESA. Now if they can do that,
will the Minister give the assurance that nobody will be required so to
convert if it would be to their loss, even if the conversion period
would be compulsory and that there would therefore have to be special
provision under the new
ESA?</div><a name="06101761000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000504"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> To return to the point about clause 1(3)(e),
entitlement specifically means receiving rather than someone having
some type of underlying entitlement. I hope that that clarifies the
point for the hon. Gentleman. In terms of additional points raised by
the hon. Member for
Daventry&#151;</div><a name="06101761000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000505"></a>Mr.
Hunt</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="06101761000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000506"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I would like to make some progress on this point.
In terms of ensuring that there is a greater understanding of the new
benefit architecture and the means of entitlement to it particularly by
those with different circumstances and fluctuating mental and other
health conditions, the first work-focused interview, regardless of
whether pathways to work is rolled out through the public or private
and voluntary sectors&#151;and as we have said publicly, our future
roll-out would be based in the private and voluntary
sectors&#151;will be done through Jobcentre Plus. It is at that point
that the explanation of the different benefit opportunities will take
place.</div><a name="06101761000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of the
new benefit entitlements&#151;whether it is ESA, JSA or another
benefit that might be available to the individual&#151;advice will be
given on a face-to-face basis in the first work-focused interview with
Jobcentre Plus staff, regardless of whether the pathway area is in the
private, voluntary or public sector.</div>
<a name="06101761000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Daventry
also raised the point about engagement with pathways. For all types of
reasons, it is important that there is local engagement between Members
of Parliament and those who are providing pathways at a local level,
even if it is to emphasise the cross-party nature of support for the
roll-out of pathways. Although there was not cross-party support for
the money that made pathways possible&#151;with many people on this
Committee voting against it&#151;the cross-party consensus is that
pathways is now the right way to go.</div>
<a name="06101761000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the most recent roll-out of
Jobcentre Plus-based pathways, I have asked Jobcentre Plus district and
local managers to make contact with local Members of Parliament,
regardless of which party, so that there can be conversation at a local
level about the ways in which support can be provided to hon.
Members&#146; constituents. I will ensure that that takes place
because it is important that it does so.</div>
<a name="06101761000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
additional points raised by the hon. Member for South-West Surrey, it
is important&#151;although he says that this is not the only piece of
legislation&#151;to emphasise the sheer change and nature of the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995. There are 7 million employees and 1
million employers who can help drive change and as my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary has said, all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 41</div>public authorities have to undertake the disability equality duty review
by December of this year. Although the review is not exclusively about
employment, it will focus on it. It makes an important point regarding
the local implementation of enlightened and progressive national
policies in the public sector. We have to make sure that that is
happening in as many interactions as possible in the public sector in
terms of our worthy goals and progressive policies.</div>
<a name="06101761000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the hon. Gentleman was
being unduly kind&#151;perhaps in the good-cop bad-cop arrangement
that he has with his hon. Friend the Member for Bury St.
Edmunds&#151;</div><a name="06101761000318"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000508"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000509"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It is the new Tories; they are both good
cops.</div><a name="06101761000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000510"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend offers an honest assessment, but I
will leave it
there.</div><a name="06101761000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been pretty fair criticism of the public sector for what does not
happen at the moment, and an implicit suggestion that the position is
much stronger in the private sector. Last week, I met some major
national companies to talk about our agenda, and they admitted to
having structural weaknesses in how they implement the policies. I am
not criticising them but making an observation which they themselves
offered about their inability, on occasion, to have that face-to-face
intervention at the point of sifting job applications, at job
interviews, or in relation to supporting employees at work. They are
looking for ways to ensure that their well intentioned and progressive
national policies can be rooted in as many interactions in local
branches and outlets across the United Kingdom. This issue presents
challenges in both the public and private sectors.</div>
<a name="06101761000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move to the
points raised by the hon. Member for Inverness&#151;I hope that he
accepts that title for the rest of the Committee and does not take it
as an insult to anywhere else. I am looking forward to an official
visit to his constituency soon, and am glad that he invited me to
visit, so I know that he will not take it as an insult if I refer to
his constituency simply as &#147;Inverness&#148;.</div>
<a name="06101761000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are still committed to a
single working age benefit; that is one of our goals with
simplification. The Bill simplifies matters in an important way,
despite the reasonable point made by the hon. Member for Daventry about
ensuring that there is no complication as agreed on understanding among
customers and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 42</div>claimants about the new architecture. We are replacing incapacity
benefit and income support that is allocated on the basis of disability
with ESA. That is an important change to the way in which benefits are
structured. I reiterate that we are committed in the long term to a
single working age
benefit.</div><a name="06101761000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000511"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I apologise to the Minister for going back to his
earlier comments, but I just looked at the clock and wanted to make
some comments now. I welcome his comments about the single working age
benefit, but we have not quite resolved the matter of subsection (3)(e)
and the difference between people who are entitled to income support
and people who are claiming income support. Will he undertake that his
officials will reconsider the wording of that measure before the Bill
makes further progress through the House, because disability groups are
concerned that it seems to exclude a number of people from entitlement
to
ESA?</div><a name="06101761000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101761000512"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I will, of course, return to the point that the
hon. Gentleman reasonably raises. I also want to deal with the issue of
employer engagement, which has been raised again by hon. Members. We
work in close co-operation with the Disability Employment Advisory
Committee, which offers a fantastic, frank analysis of some of the
emerging challenges with the agenda in a way that improves the quality
of our work on disability and how we offer support to people entering
the workplace.</div> <a name="06101761000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Inverness asked about migration, which is important as
it concerns 2.7 million people, although if current trends continue
that number will be marginally lower in 2008-09. He probed our better
intentions about migration. Of course, this issue is partly affected by
resources and their availability, but our genuine intention, which is
based on the current analysis of IB, is that those who are most recent
to the benefit should be those most likely to have the opportunity to
get back to work. As the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said, thus
confirming what the Government suggested, someone who is on incapacity
benefit for two years or longer is more likely to die, retire or never
work again. We have used that analysis for a migration strategy and
looked for ways in which to migrate the newest IB claimants on to the
new ESA.</div><a name="06101761000328"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
