<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Before we suspended, I was dealing with the Financial Secretary's sleight of hand in suggesting that all these things would be done by agreement. I think that I demonstrated to the Committee's satisfaction that although there is an initial approach towards agreement, if there is no agreement, the commissioners simply impose a decision.
<P>
Without reiterating my earlier remarks, I remind the Committee that paragraph 24 of the explanatory note says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Inland Revenue will have power to secure extended access''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Furthermore, paragraph 25 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If no agreement can be reached and a Special Commissioner considers it just and reasonable to require the proposed change to be made, he or she may make a direction accordingly''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not agreement--it is imposition by the Financial Secretary's special commissioner. Let us forget any idea that there has to be agreement between the Revenue and the owner of the works of art. In the end, the Financial Secretary sends in her commissioners. In the end, her uniformed commissioners can march in and impose--[Hon. Members: ``A dawn raid''.] Labour Members suggest that there will be dawn raids, but I suggest that they would take place somewhat later in the day.
<P>
It is equally untrue that the provisions have the consent of the arts and heritage world. Indeed, before we broke I drew attention to a memorandum that was submitted by the Museums and Galleries Commission and signed by Penelope, the Viscountess Cobham. Doubtless with the assistance of a former Minister responsible for the arts, and after consulting a range of other bodies--I shall not read out all their names--she drew up a list of substantial objections to the proposal. The Viscountess is concerned about the retention of appointment viewing--a system that served us reasonably well for 20 years, as I hope the Financial Secretary would agree--not in perpetuity, but in exceptional cases.
<P>
I want to put four categories to the Financial Secretary and ask whether she has considered any exceptional cases under them. Perhaps the Paymaster General will be replying--
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, it is me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> It is the Financial Secretary.
<P>
There are four specific categories. First there are those objects that are too fragile to allow more general access to them. Secondly, there are those objects that carry a very high security risk--you will recall, Mrs. Dunwoody, that in the long years in which this tax exemption has been debated there has also been debate about whether it is a burglar's charter to allow photographs of the objects to appear and to let the public see them in particular homes. Thirdly, the object may be housed in a building that it is impractical to open to the general public, due to the size of the building or its location. Fourthly, objects loaned for a minimum number of days to buildings that are already open to the general public should also be covered by the new restrictions imposed by the Bill.
<P>
We shall discuss the nature of public access and the arrangements to be made and so on when we debate amendments to the schedule. But first we should hear from the Financial Secretary whether she will answer the charge that this is not something to be done by agreement and that her special commissioners would be tramping through the salons of houses. Is the hon. Lady prepared to accept that in a limited number of exceptional cases there cannot be automatic and general public access?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman knew that the special commissioners are independent of Ministers. To my knowledge, they do not wear uniforms and they do not stamp through people's houses or salons. The suggestion is indicative of the almost deliberate way in which hon. Gentlemen are misinterpreting the proposals. I put on record my confidence in the special commissioners to continue to adjudicate and to defend their independent role.
<P>
When there is no agreement, it is true that the special commissioners will have to decide on the Revenue's proposals on a just and reasonable basis. If the commissioners decide that the proposal should be made, the decision would not come into effect for at least 60 days. However, the commissioners could decide that the proposals from the Revenue on public access in certain cases--I cannot think of any off hand, but they would be able to do so--would enable them to decide on a just and reasonable basis that what the Revenue proposed was not reasonable access and therefore would rule against the Revenue. The idea that line 1 of attack is for the Revenue to say, ``We must have public access'' and line 2 is that the special commissioners come in and support whatever the Inland Revenue says is not something that happens on a regular basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall finish my point first. The proposals are clear. If the hon. Member for Cotswold and other hon. Members want us to consider the role of special commissioners with regard to the Inland Revenue, that is a different proposition, which goes much wider than the amendment. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will explain why we should not allow public access to the assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am not going to explain anything. I am asking the Minister to explain. Will she help the special commissioners in their task by making it clear to them what the Inland Revenue intend and in that respect will she publish guidance and, if so, when will it be published?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The Inland Revenue intends to ensure reasonable public access to the assets. The commissioners will be made fully aware of the decisions taken by the Inland Revenue and why it came to its conclusions when it decided what was just and reasonable.
<P>
The other issues raised in the debate have covered matters that refer back to a previous clause. Members were scurrilous in trying to rewrite the Hansard report of the debate on clause 56.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Clause 39.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman corrects me--it is Clause 56. It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman can remember the clause but not what was said. I refer him to column 314 of the Official Report of our sitting on 19 May, in which my hon. Friend made it clear that he would review the correspondence to discover the position with regard to the suggestions made by the hon. Member for Witney without commitment. The Historic Houses Association newsletter complimented the Government and particularly the Inland Revenue on the consultation that took place on several issues. I will not embarrass the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, but I will send him a copy. It is clear that the points that he tried to make were totally unfounded and a way of padding out the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> In order that we are precise for the record, I have it on authority--yet again, this was confirmed only five minutes ago--that the Historic Houses Association has not been given the meeting and has not been invited to consultations. It is outrageous for the Financial Secretary to impugn the reputation of Opposition Members by making the suggestion she did when she must know full well that the Historic Houses Association has been offered no meeting.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is using earplugs so that he cannot hear what I am saying, so I will say it a little louder. The record shows that my right hon. Friend said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I will review the correspondence to which the hon. Member for Whitney referred. I have spoken to the Financial Secretary and we will look at it together''.--Official Report, Standing Committee E, 19 May 1998; c. 314.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In column 315, he went on to say that he trusted that ``that gesture, without commitment'' would be clearly understood. That is a matter of record. I do not need to impugn the hon. Gentleman, nor would I. I am sure that he would not seek to mislead the Committee. We are doing precisely what we said we would do.
<P>
Finally, Opposition Members spoke about by-appointment-system-only assisted tourism. Perhaps they could explain in the concluding remarks of this debate how a visitor who is in this country for only two weeks could manage access on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Financial Secretary has conceded our first point. At first, she suggested that everything could be done by agreement, but she has now confessed that it will not be. If there is no agreement in the end, the special commissioners will decide--that is not agreement.
<P>
<B>Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): They will decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that they will decide--I think that that is the first time that he has spoken in the Committee in eight weeks, and we welcome that. The point is that the matter is not being dealt with by agreement and that the special commissioners decide. We are not talking about an agreement between those who have the objects and the Revenue. Under the Bill, if there is no agreement in the end, the special commissioners decide. That is unilateral. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has got that because the Financial Secretary, when she first spoke, tried to suggest that everything would be done by agreement. That is nonsense, as she has conceded. We have won that point.
<P>
On the second issue, I asked whether the Financial Secretary would reply to the criticism that had been made by all the bodies in the field, as it were, which had been called together by the Museums and Galleries Commission. It related to exceptional cases where there was a high security risk or where objects were too fragile, happened to be in a building to which it was difficult to grant public access, or were already out on loan for a minimum number of days to a public gallery. The Financial Secretary has not yet answered that point, although perhaps that is inadvertent. I now give her the opportunity to do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is incumbent on me to make one or two remarks about the arrangements, as the hon. Lady suggested. Nobody wants to impugn the reputation or ability of the special commissioners. They probably know a great deal about matters of art because they are appointed by the Lord Chancellor, who has particular expertise in matters relating to historical wallpapers. Interestingly, the reality of the matter is not denied by the Financial Secretary. The legislation will have a retrospective effect. The new provisions for varying public access arrangements apply when an undertaking for public access in relation to heritage property has been given after 12 March 1975. Under the proposals, the Revenue may at any time propose a variation of the original undertaking. If the owner does not agree within six months, it may apply a special commissioner to inspect the item.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper </B>(Pontefract and Castleford): Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that owners should be able to continue to provide pathetic access to their assets simply because they have provided such access in the past?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention. [Interruption.] If it is possible for hon. Members to contain themselves for a moment and listen, they may glean a sensible answer to her intervention.
<P>
The Opposition are addressing the fact that a contract has been made. The proposed provisions would change the terms of the contract. The hon. Lady referred to pathetic access, as she described it. As the Committee will consider under the next set of amendments, it is not considered pathetic by the National Trust. The hon. Lady may be impugning the reputation of the National Trust, and she may believe that it is able to provide only pathetic access.
<P>
The amendments seek ultimately to address the power of the special commissioner appointed by the Lord Chancellor. That commissioner can, at the end of the day, only work within the law. The Bill will significantly change the undertakings and the contract between the individual and the Inland Revenue. As a consequence, if the special commissioner believes that the Revenue's proposals are just and reasonable--the Committee is considering the provision that will define those terms--he may direct the proposed variation. He would say thereby that the item would have to be sold in not less than 60 days from the date of his direction for the individual to realise the money for the tax liability.
<P>
That is the Opposition's concern. The provisions will operate retrospectively and force a number of sales of items that are currently available and accessible to the public. As a point of principle, it must go on record that the proposed legislation is retrospective. It undermines the principle of a contract between the individual and the Inland Revenue.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> There is an important general point to be made about clause 140, which will restrict the availability of public access to works of art. The Government could have chosen a better and easier route than changing the law under clause 140 and introducing the restrictions of schedule 25. They could have sought to promote better access to such works of art through the internet. That would have allowed any member of the public to have turned a work of art in any dimension--to have examined its shape, construction and details. The internet would have allowed them, subject to the laws of copyright, to print out copies. It would not have introduced the problems of security that the Government now face under the clause and the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> In a moment. The internet would not have opened the Government up to the various charges of damage and of countering the principles of conservation. It would have involved them in much lower costs than they proposed. I received a letter from the project manager of the information technology project at De Montfort university entitled ``Heritage on the Web''. The point of that project is that it is sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry by way of a huge grant under the multimedia demonstration programme which shows how the public can have greater access to those objects which for various reasons of security, conservation and access cannot constantly be made available to the public. We see here, in a single clause, two Departments at war with each other. The Treasury says that things must be made more restrictive--that the flat-footed special commissioners must tramp through the salons, in their usual Plod-like way, renegotiating agreements that have been made years ago. On the other hand, we have a Department--perhaps a Department to which the Paymaster General aspires--that wants to modernise Britain. That Department says that the public should have access, and that the easiest way of doing that is through the internet. It is making several hundreds of thousands of pounds available in grant aid to show how the clause is completely archaic and redundant. One half of the Department is showing the way forward. The other half--the Inland Revenue, aided and abetted by Treasury Ministers who probably have not read the proposals that have been put before us--says that we must send the special commissioners tramping through the salons yet again to view the Canalettos.
<P>
Is not it time, before we send clause 140 on its way, to modernise the process? If the public want to see a particular work of art, we now have the internet--which owes its success to the free-market Government promoted by my hon. Friends and to its espousal by the Americans and the British--which allows people to see any work of art in the round.
<P>
So it is logical that we should put aside the old-fashioned visitation by the special commissioners. We must wise up: who knows, perhaps we should adopt the concept of cool heritage? People who want to see works of art kept in lieu should be allowed to do so in a thoroughly modern fashion, without special commissioners tramping all over the place, and without the agreements that eventually are imposed.
<P>
I cite in evidence Mr. Michael Hiley, the project manager of Heritage in the Web, a project sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry that modernises the whole process and makes the clause redundant. I assume that the Financial Secretary, who has considerable grace, will withdraw this archaic clause and leave the matter to the worldwide web.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): The hon. Member for Sevenoaks seems to be one oak short of seven. He argued that the public have access to works of art, but then said that such access should be granted only if that work is not fragile, poses no security problems, or if access is practical. His contention was a pathetic facade.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman went on to suggest that people should have access only via the internet. A moment earlier, Conservative Members were saying that the great threat to our heritage was the sale of works of art abroad. However, if we could access them on the internet they could physically be anywhere. The notion is ridiculous.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee, but I had to make those points. I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will tell the Committee whether she knows about any problems that may have arisen. That could be of interest to the Committee, as the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) has some history of obstructing access to his works of art. I should be interested to hear more about that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that we should avoid attacking hon. Members who are not present and who, presumably, have not been given notice.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I do not--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that it is getting late and we have been here a long time, but this is the Finance Bill. Even if the blood sugar is getting low, hon. Members should try and pretend that they are all adults.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was going to speculate about what is in the water being drunk by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks, as I think that it might be different from mine. I cannot believe I heard him say that we do not need to worry about public access because we can put it all on the internet. That cuts across the Opposition's arguments on the importance of public access to assets.
<P>
It is important that the Government ensure that the use of the internet enhances the public's access to assets. We should not replace or substitute it. I assure the hon. Member for Sevenoaks that the Government consider interesting ways to develop the internet and access for members of the public, but substituting real access for access on the internet for those items is not something that we would pursue.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is worth reflecting on the significance of the Victoria and Albert register because it is a very important part of our national heritage. It lists 20,000 objects ranging from paintings by Millais to the gloves that King Charles I wore at his execution. It is an extraordinary register, not least because the items are cared for by private individuals.
<P>
In remembering the importance of the register, it is also worth remembering the importance that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport attaches to it. Unfortunately, that view is not held by the Treasury, which tonight has demonstrated its complete disregard for our national heritage. It is prepared to drive a coach and horses through anything that could remotely be connected with our past in favour of drumming up yet more funds to pay for a dome in Greenwich.
<P>
The Treasury has formulated the most ludicrous definition for items that are to be placed on the exemption list. The definition of pre-eminence is unworkable if the list is to have any regard for keeping a significant body of items on the V and A list. If the Government intend to decimate our heritage, this is one of the most effective ways in which they could proceed. In that, they resemble former Labour Governments who paid no regard to our cultural heritage. They precipitated the destruction of some of the finest architectural houses in the country and have only recently concluded that perhaps those houses do matter, as the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport made clear in a speech to the Historic Houses Association last year.
<P>
But it seems that the Government have learnt nothing from the debate that we had a few weeks ago on clause 39.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman widens the debate beyond what is a narrow amendment--it merely states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``leave out `pre-eminent' and insert `eminent'''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
there will be no clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am happy to widen the debate, Mrs. Dunwoody, if that is your direction.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I gave up directing Members of Parliament some time ago. I am simply making the point that this is a narrow amendment. I trust that he will bear that in mind--unless, of course, he wants the Chair to bear in mind his attitude when we come to the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As long as it is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Absolutely clear. It was clear before the Government came to power that they were prepared to set about the destruction of our national heritage, and to some extent we should not be surprised that the Bill contains such proposals. The Bill's definition of ``pre-eminent'' is entirely unsatisfactory, probably because it reflects the Government's predisposition to pay no regard whatsoever to the preservation of our national heritage. The Bill says that in order to be eligible, property must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``pre-eminent for its national, scientific, historic or artistic interest'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or it must be part of a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``collection or group of relevant objects which, taken as a whole, appears. . .to be pre-eminent''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
on the same grounds.
<P>
The schedule contains no guidance about what is meant by ``pre-eminent'' except in paragraph (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in determining. . .whether an object. . .is pre-eminent, regard shall be had to any significant association of the object, collection or group with a particular place.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That wording more or less entirely tracks the wording of section 240 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, which deals with property that is eligible for acceptance in satisfaction of tax. The Government are on the make and they have examined previous legislation, which has helped them to extract large amounts of money. As the Financial Secretary said earlier this evening, the Government justify their approach by the fact that they believe that all the items on the V and A list are available only by ``pathetic access''.
<P>
The consequence of the Government's proposal is that the great majority of heritage objects will become taxable, except when exemption is available by reason of that historical association under section 31(1)(e) of the 1984 Act. The supplementary documentation tried to explain that the proposal was revenue neutral, but in reality it will grossly denude the V and A list--assuming that it remains in existence, about which there is some doubt. The Revenue will in effect have a way to raise money.
<P>
Few estates in this country will be able to pay the tax without selling objects, which means that many crucial houses will be denuded. What will be left when that happens?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not having a clause stand part debate. We are discussing an amendment that would remove ``pre-eminent'' from the Bill and insert ``eminent''. Its terms are precise and narrow, it was tabled in the hon. Gentleman's name and I assume that he will discuss it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> With enormous respect, Mrs. Dunwoody, my argument is based on considerable consultation with various bodies up and down the country which have--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has not listened to what I said. This is not a clause stand part debate, and we cannot have a debate that is wider than the amendment. He chose to table an extremely narrow amendment, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``leave out `pre-eminent' and insert `eminent'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clear and I hope that he will discuss it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The reason for my explanation is that I want to justify why the word ``eminent'' should be substituted for the word ``pre-eminent''. That substitution is needed because the Bill fails to establish what ``pre-eminent'' means, except as it had been defined in the paragraphs to which I referred earlier. I therefore laboured to explain why it is crucial to delete the word ``pre-eminent'' and replace it with ``eminent''. If that change is not made, it will lead to the destruction of our national heritage. It is necessary to make that plea in this Committee as it has fallen on entirely deaf ears at the Treasury. The Treasury has singularly failed to consult publicly on this matter, as it did on one estate election. The Committee is a court of last resort and must try to make the government address the consequences of the Bill for national heritage.
<P>
For an object to qualify, it is not enough for it to be of the same period as the building. The definition in the Bill relating to ``pre-eminent'' requires the object to have a direct and close association to a particular building. By that definition of ``pre-eminent'', the object must make a significant contribution, individually or as part of the collection, to the appreciation of that building. The problem arising from that definition is that exemption under section 31 will not be given if the building is not of outstanding importance. That shows the absurdity of the defintion: if the object is significant but the building is not, taxation will be attracted.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary tell us what will happen to an important collection in a house of no great importance? Will it lose its ability to attract conditional exemption--yes or no? I am sure that she knows the answer, which her officials in the Inland Revenue have singularly failed to give to all those bodies that have sought it. I am sure that she will be able to give a clear definition tonight.
<P>
What will happen when houses have fallen apart, become effectively derelict and been rebuilt, as a result of which they are sold? If they are rebuilt and repaired by new owners, and the so-called ``pre-eminent'' objects are put back in situ, it is not clear from the definition in relation to ``pre-eminent''--or ``eminent'' as proposed in the amendment--whether those objects will be exempt. Those objects might have been removed from the house, sold and brought back to the house by a new owner. Will they be exempt in future? None of the consulted bodies has been able to get an answer to that question. Will the Minister give a definitive answer--yes or no?
<P>
What will happen to houses, the contents of which have been removed? For example, a number of large country houses had associated houses--
<P>
<B>Madam Speaker:</B> Order. the hon. Gentleman is broadening the debate again. He tabled the amendment, which is narrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful, as ever, for your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. I do not dispute that guidance, but I am expressing the concerns of bodies that are worried about the definition of ``pre-eminent'' and ``eminent''. The Bill does not make clear what ``pre-eminent'' means and how it will work as a definition. Amendments Nos. 216 to 218 therefore propose that the word ``pre-eminent'' should be substituted with the word ``eminent'' in three places. The application of the existing definition will lead to destruction; the Committee must be satisfied that it understands the consequences of that. If the objects are not ``pre-eminent'', will they, by definition, not be subject to an export restriction? In other words, an export committee, which would operate under the terms of the Waverley committee, would determine whether objects could be exported as pre-eminent objects. Very few objects fall into that category. If most objects in a group--perhaps 19,000 out of 20,000--were defined as not being pre-eminent, the export committee could not stop them leaving the country. The Bill would therefore denude our national heritage.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Maybe the Financial Secretary does not give a fig for our national heritage. However, there is no doubt that had any of those bodies been given the opportunity to represent themselves properly to the Treasury before the legislation came to Committee, they would have been able--perhaps more skilfully--to explain to the Financial Secretary what devastation the legislation would cause.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman confuses two qualifications: I do not know whether he is doing that deliberately, to prolong the debate, or whether he genuinely misunderstands. An object must be pre-eminent or associated with a historical building; it does not have to be both. If the collection is pre-eminent in its own right, it should qualify. If it is not, its connection with a building may allow it to qualify as pre-eminent.
<P>
The amendment is narrow. Having said that the Bill gives no proper definition of ``pre-eminent'', the hon. Gentleman seeks to substitute that with the word ``eminent'', without giving any explanation of the term. He painted the most hideous picture of the destruction of national heritage assets and of public access to them--a picture that beggars belief. The hon. Gentleman should calm down. That is not what is happening. The Museums and Galleries Commission has published guidance notes on pre-eminent objects, in which the term is defined, and advises the Secretary of State for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport on the pre-eminent quality tests used for acceptance of heritage assets in satisfaction of tax. The idea that the term has been picked out of nowhere, with the aim of destroying such assets, is nonsense. It is designed to protect them and to balance public access to them where tax exemptions have been given.
<P>
The change mirrors the definition used in section 230 of the Inheritance Act 1984 for acceptance in lieu of tax. I am advised that that definition has been around for a considerable period--50 years. The qualification on pre-eminence has published guidance, is clear and is designed to assist the preservation of our heritage; balanced with the previous schedule, the schedule aims to guarantee public access under reasonable circumstances. It does no more than that. It is not part of an Armageddon; it is concerned with liberation of and access to that heritage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Can we be clear about this? The hon. Lady has sought, reasonably, to stress that the schedule is a balance between the eminence of a work of art and its acceptance in fiscal terms in lieu. The point the Opposition are driving at is the key change in the schedule from the use of the word ``eminent'' to the use of the word ``pre-eminent''. Of course we accept that there are eminent works of art, but we need to establish the difference between eminent and pre-eminent works of art. I may have been wasting my time, but I studied Latin from the age of 7 until I was fortunate enough to acquire a degree in the subject about 15 years later. After those years of study, I understand what eminent works of art are; I do not understand what pre-eminent works of art are. If the Financial Secretary can elucidate that, she would assist all members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Ms Primarolo, on the Latin derivation of ``eminent''.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have answered the question. The hon. Gentleman can read the guidance--it has been around for a long time--which clearly defines the term. It is not my fault that the hon. Gentleman cannot understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. Lady has, on behalf of the Government, introduced into tax legislation the new definition of ``pre-eminent''. She now tells the Committee that she is unwilling, unable--or simply cannot be bothered--to define it. It is an important matter, which is not covered by the explanatory notes to the schedule, and it is incumbent on the Financial Secretary to address it.
<P>
I am sure, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you have in your own collection--the Dunwoody collection--pictures, sculptures and so on that are eminent; if, however, you were suddently told that some of your oil paintings, watercolours, sculptures and other objects d'art were, by virtue of the legislation, ``pre-eminent'', you would be one of the first in the Committee to ask where the difference lay. I did not start the argument. The Financial Secretary introduced the term. Originally, the term used was ``eminent''; now, she is saying that the tax exemption will apply only to ``pre-eminent'' works of art. I have some news for the Financial Secretary. She is confusing--as did my fellow Scotsman, John Logie Baird, who pioneered the television--a little Greek with a little Latin.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are allowed in the House to use English, occasionally Welsh and occasionally Norman French. The debate, fascinating though it is, is therefore not in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The term is new: under previous tax legislation, qualifying works of art had to be eminent. The Bill requires them to be pre-eminent. It is not for me to define that difference, but for the Financial Secretary. What is pre-eminent rather than eminent? By what number does she expect the list of qualifying items to reduce?
<P>
The obvious effect of the clause is that the tax exemption will reduce. By changing the definition from eminent to pre-eminent, the Government are trying to save money and reduce the cost of the exemption.
<P>
The Financial Secretary cannot brush that aside. What is the difference between an eminent work of art and a pre-eminent work of art? That is the definition introduced by the Bill, and it is up to her to justify it.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The Opposition attempted to introduce a new definition of ``eminent''. They must explain the difference. The word ``eminent'' does not appear in current legislation, nor in our proposals. As I have said, the word ``pre-eminent'' appears in existing legislation, and is defined in the guide notes. Conservative Members are confused: they need to tell the Committee the definition of ``eminent'', because we have told them what is understood by ``pre-eminent''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is a disgrace that the Financial Secretary wishes the Committee to agree to these proposals--I assume that she will not accept the amendment substituting ``eminent'' for ``pre-eminent''--yet she has not been able to say what the definition of ``pre-eminent'' will do in practice. It is a scandal because of the potential impact on our national heritage.
<P>
I shall give one illustration. Recently, Sotheby's was asked to look at the V and A list, and a random sample of 300 items was examined. Although the Financial Secretary could not provide a definition of ``pre-eminent'', that was the qualification guiding the Sotheby's inspection. The result was that only five of the 300 items met the requirement.
<P>
The clause will wreak havoc on our national heritage. It is a disgrace and a scandal that the Financial Secretary can push the proposal through while having no idea about the impact that it will have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Perhaps I can assist the Committee. In paragraph 20 of her explanatory notes to this schedule, the Financial Secretary offered a test of the word ``pre-eminent''. It was curious that she could not find it a few minutes ago when she struggled to reply to the debate. That paragraph states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The test will be whether the relevant item or collection will constitute a pre-eminent addition to a national, local authority, university or independent museum''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a reasonably satisfactory definition of the word ``pre-eminent''. The Financial Secretary now contends that she did not know where the word came from. She has defined it in her Department's explanatory notes on the clause, and has singularly failed to explain how the word differs from the previous test of eminence.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Financial Secretary owes it to the Committee to have one more try at explaining why she is introducing a different definition. I hesitate to say this, but unless she able do that, we may have to prolong this debate. If there is a misunderstanding, I am sure that she can clear it up. Is she standing by the definition of pre-eminence in paragraph 20 of her explanatory notes?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 102, in page 366, line 45, at end insert ``or British person''.
<P>
The Financial Secretary could have dealt with the Opposition's queries easily, had she referred to paragraph 4 of the schedule, which contains a definition of pre-eminence. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether an object or a collection or group of objects is pre-eminent, regard shall be had to any significant association of the object . . . with a particular place''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is helpful, but we are not going backwards. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to amendment No. 102.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The point is pertinent to my amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not pertinent if we go backwards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall be guided by your ruling, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Paragraph 4 of the schedule provides a definition of the phrases ``national interest'' and ``relevant object'' for the purposes of whether a particular asset can fall within an exemption. The amendment focuses on the definition of relevant object. Paragraph 4 regards such an object as pre-eminent if it has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any significant association . . . with a particular place''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would add the words ``or British person'' after the word ``place''. Many important objects are pre-eminent not because they are associated with a particular house or a county such as West Sussex or Dorset, but because they are associated with an eminent figure such as Churchill, Lady Thatcher, William Blake or Thomas Hardy. The amendment would therefore tidy up the Bill and ensure that pre-eminence arising from an object's association with a famous historic or literary figure is covered by the definition of pre-eminent in paragraph 4.
<P>
Now that I have pointed out to the Financial Secretary where the definition exists, I hope that she will accept the amendment, which would improve the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Amendment No. 102 is not necessary. The definition already allows the significant association of an object or a collection with a particular person, whether British or otherwise, to be taken into account when deciding whether it meets the required test, which I explained in response to the previous amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am sorry, but the Financial Secretary is becoming a little demob happy. She could explain to the Committee exactly which provision makes the addition of the words ``or British person'' otiose.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The arrangements are that a British person or otherwise is accepted and that is therefore how the clause is interpreted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Does that mean that a British person is included in the definition of national interest in line 35?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have answered that question. The hon. Gentleman can have fun and games all night, but when Conservative Members scrutinise today's debate in Hansard on Thursday, they will see that my answer was ``whether British or otherwise''--that includes a British person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We expect a reasonable answer from the Financial Secretary or from any Minister responding to amendments. It is, however, for my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to decide how he wants to dispose of the amendment. I asked the hon. Lady specifically whether the words ``national interest'' in line 35 encompassed a British person. Is that her understanding of the provision, or not?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman want to persist with the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes. I am concerned about the Financial Secretary's answer. She says that the phrase ``national interest'' covers the point raised in amendment No. 102, but paragraph 4(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```national interest' includes interest within any part of the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not refer to any people, British or otherwise. I fail to see how it can already be included in the definition in the schedule--I simply cannot find it. I suggest that the Financial Secretary should accept my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary explained the matter clearly. If Conservative Members read lines 43 to 45, to which my hon. Friend referred, they would see that the provision refers to matters to which regard can be had, but that it is not exclusive. The hon. Member for Witney made the same point, but I did not intervene then.
<P>
Frankly, Conservative Members do not read the Bill. The matter has been explained clearly. If the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton persists, his amendment will fall, deservedly.
<P>
<B> Mr. Gibb:</B> In answer to the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), under our legal system judges and courts look at the words in the statute book. The Bill clearly states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```regard shall be had to any significant association of the object . . . with a particular place.'''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That cannot be interpreted to mean a person--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot have sedentary interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> There is no reference in the schedule to ``person''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying to the Financial Secretary, ``Yes, we have one test: give us some more guidance?''
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Member for Dudley, North says that the schedule is merely indicative and is not an exhaustive definition of ``pre-eminent''. However, it gives guidance to the courts as to how that phrase will be interpreted. It narrows the interpretation. No judge, on reading the schedule, would take an object or work of art that is associated solely with a British person--for example, a cigar that belonged to Churchill or a handbag that belonged to Lady Thatcher--to be pre-eminent. I shall therefore press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 366, line 45, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5A) Where an object has previously been exempted for the purposes of estate duty, capital transfer tax, inheritance tax or capital gains tax on the basis of a test less stingent than that substituted in section 31(1)(a) and (aa) by the Finance Act 1998 and fails to qualify under the criteria so substituted, then no chargeable event shall be deemed to arise following the actual or implied refusal of exemption for such object hereunder either under section 32 hereof or for the purposes of estate duty or capital gains tax.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The change in the quality of the objects that qualify for the exemptions will mean that many items that are currently exempted from what was estate duty will not qualify for re-exemption on next death.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): The hon. Gentleman said that judges look carefully at the words that are in the statute book. I am worried about the sloppy drafting of Conservative Members' amendments, and I have noticed that amendment No. 103 contains no less than three spelling mistakes, which makes it almost unintelligible. Can the hon. Gentleman explain that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendment that I tabled did not contain any typos. I look forward to seeing a single amendment that has been drafted by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Many items that are currently exempt from estate duty will not qualify for re-exemption on next death. Estate duty and estate duty charge will still apply, when triggered by a sale, and the inheritance that is payable on the next death will merely be credited against them. It is to avoid that injustice that I have tabled amendment No. 103.
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Amendment No. 103 suggests that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands the provisions on chargeable events. Denial of conditional exemption on a transfer or disposal of an already exempt asset does not, by itself, give rise to a chargeable event in respect of the existing exemption, nor is it deemed to give rise to such an event.
<P>
It is the transfer or the disposal that constitutes a chargeable event. If a fresh exemption can be, and is, claimed, the grant of exemption may not only defer any tax on the transaction itself, but also prevent the transfer being a chargeable event in respect of the earlier exemption. But that is not what the amendment is about. We are keeping the facility that allows an existing exemption to be retained simply by giving the appropriate replacement undertakings. It does not involve the new pre-eminent quality test for chattels. There is no reason for the amendment, and I ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for that full explanation of the clause, in view of which I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 367, line 7, after ``made'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless the Special Commissioner believes that access by prior appointment is appropriate.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am enjoying these proceedings, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Are not we all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am glad that it gives you such pleasure, Mrs. Dunwoody. I hope that we shall be detained at your pleasure for a considerable time this evening.
<P>
The amendment was tabled because the changes proposed in the schedule will harm the national heritage. In principle, the amendment seeks the Government's flexibility in giving powers to the special commissioners enabling objects to remain exempt if a special commissioner is satisfied that that is appropriate.
<P>
The Historic Houses Association sought guidance from the Inland Revenue about the powers of the special commissioners. Unfortunately, the Inland Revenue was unable to supply the answers. The guidelines are not clear; it is extraordinary that the Committee can accept proposals for special commissioners to be asked to administer a measure, in uniform or not, when they do not know what they are doing because they, too, are in the dark. It is extremely worrying that we are being asked to accept measures without it being clear how they will operate.
<P>
We do know, however, that the current arrangements, which the amendment would allow to continue, will affect four areas, the first being fragile objects--for example, manuscripts, textiles, works on paper, archives and so on. It is crucial that they are available only by appointment, not least because, as the Financial Secretary would appreciate if she had any genuine understanding of such objects, they are light sensitive and it is not possible to have them on permanent display. That is exactly the sort of thing that a special commissioner would negotiate to secure availability by prior appointment. If such documents were not available only by prior appointment, they would be damaged.
<P>
One document that immediately springs to mind is a mediaeval manuscript at Elton hall. The document is particularly light sensitive and valuable and because of the ludicrous proposals in the Bill and the ludicrously rigid criteria, the owner has decided that he will probably sell the manuscript. The consequence will be that something to which the public now have access by prior appointment will no longer be available to the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> A whole range of documents might be affected by the legislation. Perhaps my hon. Friend has considered the original text of the Labour manifesto, which is equally light sensitive and might well disappear if it is not fully archived soon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for that intervention because for most of middle England the Labour manifesto is disappearing before their eyes.
<P>
	We must consider not only light sensitive objects but those which may be particularly fragile and therefore not easily available to public view. I am sorry to see that the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), who earlier this evening referrred to pathetic access, is no longer in her place, which shows what pathetic access she wishes to give her constituents in terms of representing them in the Committee. Fragile objects may not be accessible every day because they must be protected, but the Bill shows no regard for that sensitivity.
<P>
Some houses are open by prior appointment and the objects in them are avialable to view by prior appointment. That satisfactory arrangment ensures that those houses are open; they are not open for a specific six months of the year, but the owners are happy to open them if groups of people apply. Women's Institute groups, for example, visit such houses. If the Financial Secretary gets around to producing the rigid guidelines and decides that some houses will have to open for a specific number of days, they may be open on fewer days than currently.
<P>
There are other crucial implications. There is a 70-year-old lady in Barnes who lives in a modest two-up, two-down house--not the sort of house in which new Labour Members live these days. She is of modest means and had the good fortune to inherit an 18th century lavatory. The contents had long been removed, but is was a copy of Nelson's toilet cabinet on the Victory. It is a wonderful object; she was very grateful to inherit it and she is proud to leave it to the National Trust. That lady lives on her own and is 70 years old--[Interruption.] Labour Members might like to take note of what I am about to say. That lady is genuinely proud of the object she inherited and it matters to her. It may not matter to Labour hon. Members, but it matters to her because it is a family heirloom. It is exempted because it is on the V and A list. It can be seen by those who want to see it, but she is not able to open her house to the public. She does not have a curator to look after the house. The object would have been left to the National Trust, but the trust has now learnt that if the Bill is enacted, the owner will sell the object.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> We have so far dealt with one object. There are 20,000 of them on the list and I have information on large numbers of them which I am sure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, will enjoy hearing about. The night is ahead of us, and we should bear in mind the impact of the proposals on those objects.
<P>
Having dealt with the difficulties of one lady in Barnes and with the reason the sale of this object will be forced, the second relevant aspect of access is the way in which the proposal puts the onus on individuals to provide such access, without defining in the Bill how that will work.
<P>
There are obvious attractions for the Treasury in making it extremely difficult for objects to qualify for exemption. That is clearly at the root of the schedule and is the reason for our pursuing the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the National Audit Office looked at the cost of the scheme, and realised that it had led to a reduction of &#163;1 billion in inheritance tax over 10 years. That is why the Government have imposed these draconian rules on access. We believe that the special commissioner should be allowed, on behalf of those who are interested in our national heritage, to reinstate the importance of prior appointment.
<P>
In opposition, Labour said that the scheme was a loophole for the rich and suggested that in Government they would change the rules. That is what they have done. Access has until now been available for all the public. Unless the Government accept the amendment, the schedule will remove access by forcing the sale of these objects.
<P>
The irony is that once again Ministers have taken a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks made the sensible suggestion that methods such as improving the internet could have been applied here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Does the hon. Gentleman understand that less than 25 per cent. of the British population has access to the internet and that, although it is a useful tool, it will not do what he suggests?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, and a few years ago less than 1 per cent. of the people had access to the internet. Its accessibility to the public is growing, and its use in schools and libraries and so on makes it an important tool of research. While I accept the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's intervention I am confident that in the next few years it will be widely available, especially in schools and libraries, for the benefit of those who do not have access to it at home.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is an interesting point but the amendment relates to the special commissioner believing that access by prior appointment may be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I am sure that the special commissioner will have access to the internet.
<P>
Our amendment stems from representations made by the National Trust, an organisation well known for encouraging access to historic properties and historic and important objects. I am representing its views. I hope that the Financial Secretary will not treat the National Trust with the contempt with which she has treated members of the Committee this evening but will address our questions and give us satisfactory answers.
<P>
The National Trust is especially worried about the impact of conditional exemption changes and is particularly keen for the special commissioner to be given the powers proposed in the amendment. The trust cautions against rigidly applying regulations which may encourage
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the disposal of currently exempt items of national importance in private hands.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The trust urges that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``long-term health of our national heritage must be of paramount importance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will be interesting to hear whether the Financial Secretary has anything to say on the subject tonight; indeed, it would be interesting to know whether she even considers the National Trust worthy of consultation. The National Trust is clearly concerned that, in a number of cases, items that are currently exempt, and which would have become part of public collections, will now come on to the open market. That will happen because the clause will force those who cannot meet the new criteria to sell.
<P>
The National Trust has raised the crucial point that 23 of its 50 historic houses continue to have resident former owners. They live in private apartments that--unlike the houses themselves--are currently closed to the public. The flats contain original contents from the houses. The National Trust maintains that, if such items remain in place, they will almost certainly become the trust's property on the death of a former owner. However, if the provision forces the sale of such items, they will be lost to the nation for good.
<P>
The Financial Secretary needs to answer two crucial questions. First, if a museum cannot display a currently exempt object that has been loaned to it, will the person who none the less loaned the object be subject to the new provision? Secondly, what will happen about works on paper, which are sensitive to light and cannot therefore be displayed permanently? If they are stored, will they be exempt?
<P>
Those are crucial questions to which the National Trust, the Museums and Galleries Commission and the Historic Houses Association have yet to receive an answer. The Financial Secretary should be aware that her reply will be examined tomorrow by those bodies and by those whom they represent. She should therefore clarify the matter tonight with yes or no answers, so that the provision's implications are made crystal clear. She should also clarify why the amendment should be accepted or not proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Or not proposed? I thought that the hon. Gentleman was moving the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Yes, I am.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney, which is by nature permissive. It is common sense to grant discretionary powers to the special commissioner where special limited access arrangements clearly need to be made.
<P>
During the debate on clause 140 I asked the Financial Secretary whether she would prefer the disposal of an item through limited public access or no public access, where those were the only practical choices. She did not answer then; I wonder whether she might do so now.
<P>
How many complaints have the Government received about access by appointment to such items? I have a sneaking suspicion that the Government have brewed up their own storm in a tea cup. I doubt that hordes of people have clamoured for access to No. 123 Acacia avenue to see the Nelsonian loo to which my hon. Friend the Member for Witney referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. The Government should provide figures on who those who are demanding this change. Indeed, if they cannot deal with the house in Acacia Avenue, perhaps they can deal with the number of people clamouring to see the wallpaper in the loo in the Lord Chancellor's apartments. 
<P>
I should like to pose in the somewhat unusual role of intermediary between my hon. Friend the Member for Witney and the Financial Secretary, as some practical alternatives are available. My hon. Friend's proposal is the only realistic alternative if the Financial Secretary persists with the absolute wording in line 7. However, some other questions are worth asking. For example, what is the position of an object of art loaned to a museum or gallery? What if it is loaned to some other public venue for public view, such as a city council or town hall? What if it is on display in a house that is already open to the public?
<P>
What would happen if it were inside a house that was occasionally open to the public, such as at weekends in spring or autumn? What would happen if that object of art were already available to visiting educational groups? What would happen if it were a manuscript deposited in an archive? We need not trouble ourselves with whether the document involved was the Lindisfarne manuscript or the Labour party manifesto. What would happen if arrangements already existed, before the clause was drafted, for the object to be part of a touring exhibition?
<P>
I have posed seven reasonable questions that offer alternatives to the absolute position presented in the Bill and to the proposal--which I fully understand--of my hon. Friend the Member for Witney. If the Financial Secretary has not grasped those alternatives, I shall rehearse them briefly.
<P>
An object of art may be loaned to a museum or gallery; it may be loaned in other circumstances to some other public venue; it may be in a house that is open to the public; it may be in a house that is open at certain weekends during the year; it may be in an establishment visited by educational groups; it may be deposited in an archive, or it may be part of a touring exhibition. I urge the Financial Secretary, if she is to resist the amendments tabled by Conservative Back Benchers and mollify interested parties outside the Committee, to show that there is some latitude or flexibility regarding objects that are already made available by their owners in the various ways that I have described.
<P>
It might come as a shock to my hon. Friend when I say that there should be some common ground between the absolute position of the Bill and the amendment. The Financial Secretary could do herself a service--in a way that both she and the Economic Secretary have in the past--if she were to show that she is prepared to consider existing examples of different practical and public access that at present are not allowed by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Amendment No. 219 would give the special commissioners access only by appointment, as they think fit in particular circumstances. I shall explain why I shall ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
	First, the Bill will not abolish the access by appointment system. The Government are abolishing the current facility for giving access only by prior appointment, because it is, unfortunately, open to abuse and has been much criticised. I should tell the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that two full programmes in which the public participated were run on Channel 4, giving exact examples of how public access was denied. Nobody could obtain public access on the appointment-only system. Following that programme, Channel 4 ran a site on the internet encouraging viewers to log their complaints, which they did.
<P>
<H5>12.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many people have written to me as the relevant Minister, and many have written through their Members of Parliament. Early-day motions on the subject have been tabled and Adjournment debates on it have also been held. Unfortunately, the appointment-only system is not providing for access by the public: letting it continue at the special commissioner's discretion, as the amendment proposes, could only undermine public confidence in the system.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks should meet me on the issue and on the Government's proposals. We are seeking to restore public confidence in a system that has allowed the problem to continue. The suggestions made by Opposition Members are outrageous. It should be possible in appropriate circumstances to ensure that the preservation needs of the asset in question are protected.
<P>
A point was made about security. The provision of public access, whether on the old or new system, raises issues of security. Security will continue to be part of reasonable public access. Owners who take the benefit of the tax exemption and accept it on the basis that they will allow public access cannot cherry-pick their obligations. As I said, the facility for giving access only by prior appointment is open to abuse.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney spoke about delicate items and about ensuring that access was reasonable. He gave a number of examples about what would be considered reasonable, fortunately not all of which were on the register--he saved the Committee that. That consideration is exactly what would have to be taken into account. I well understand, as does every member of the Committee, the need to preserve especially delicate items. Preservation has to be balanced against reasonable access, however, and would be part of the negotiations with owners about access arrangements. The heritage agencies will advise the Inland Revenue on the matter. The Opposition have made many comments about the Inland Revenue and about special commissioners. One minute they want to attack the commissioners, and the next they say that they want them to be guardians. The heritage agencies will advise the Inland Revenue, and they will take all relevant considerations into account.
<P>
What constitutes reasonable access depends on the nature of the asset and on its preservation needs. There is no problem with that. The owner's personal circumstances--the size of the house, for instance--are not relevant in that circumstance. However, providing reasonable public access would be relevant.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's final point was about an item being loaned to a public collection. In such circumstances, it would be open to access and would therefore fall within the new rules as complying with public access requirements. Thus, that would be reasonable.
<P>
The measure will ensure that abuse is stopped and that public access is provided under reasonable circumstances. When deciding that, the other important issues with regard to the asset are balanced in the equation. It is an entirely reasonable measure and I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment as unnecessary and unreasonable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I think that the Financial Secretary is trying to assist the Committee. I am sure that some of what she said will be studied outside the Committee and may, indeed, be helpful.
<P>
The hon. Lady talked about balance. Line 6 contains the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonable access to the public'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so the measure is already balanced--some might say that it was biased towards the public.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is their money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The hon. Lady says, quite reasonably, that it is their money. She may want it to be biased towards the public, but it is not unreasonable to ask her to assure those who are affected by the provision that their security and the conservation of the various objects are also being taken into account. We want to ensure that access should at all times be reasonable, not just for the public but for those who conserve and secure the objects. The difference between us on the amendments may be a little narrower than the Financial Secretary makes out.
<P>
I would advise my hon. Friend the Member for Witney that if we can make some progress on security and conservation, perhaps we could not press our point about the size of the house. If the Financial Secretary could satisfy us on security and conservation in relation to reasonable access to the public, the size of the house would not bother us so much. If we could get some ground from her on the first point, we would be less worried about the second.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that in the end, it will be a process of negotiation. I understand why she said that--there is a negotiation process to start with. There is negotiation with the special commissioners and indeed, there is a process of appeal. In the end, however, as the hon. Lady will understand, the Revenue can get its way. However independent the special commissioners are, in the end they can make the decision. Conservative Members worry that special commissioners will make decisions on a future series of objects of art--I shall not return to what was said on the previous amendment and the range of undertakings that will already be given.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary examine--although perhaps she will not be able to do it tonight--whether there is any scope for publishing a draft code or some kind of highway code for the special commissioners and those who own historic houses or objects of art, before the matter is set into statute. Both sides would then know where they were. Conservative Members are trying to represent the genuine concerns of those who hold these objects. Although it is for my hon. Friend the Member for Witney to decide what to do with the amendment, there may well be a way of addressing those concerns. Perhaps the Financial Secretary could suggest some form of highway code, so that those who hold these objects need not be panicked into thinking that whatever negotiations may take place, in the end the special commissioners will simply decide that there can be some intermediate grant. Leaving aside the size of the house, those are the points that I wish to put to the Financial Secretary.
<P>
	The schedule has been drafted in such a way that public access has to be reasonable. I understand that--my hon. Friend said that there were abuses of the previous system. I do not know about that, but I accept that it is so. Access to the public should be made more reasonable, although we must also bear in mind the security and conservation of the objects. The schedule is weighted, if only slightly, towards the greater access that the Chancellor wants. Will the Financial Secretary reassure my hon. Friend and I about the way in which the special commissioners will approach at least the existing undertakings? We may end tonight's sitting on common ground--who knows?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for Witney wish to persist with the amendment?

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 369, leave out lines 12 to 22 and insert--

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2) Either the Board or the person bound by the undertaking may make a proposal in writing to the other for the variation of the undertaking. If the parties shall not have agreed such proposal (with or without variations) after six months, an appeal to a Special Commissioner shall be deemed to have been made under section 46B of the Taxes Management Act 1970. If the Commissioner considers that it is just and reasonable, in all the circumstances, that the existing undertaking be varied, he may direct that the proposed variation be deemed to have been made by the parties with such amendments to it (if any) as he shall consider to be appropriate in the particular circumstances.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 93, in page 369, leave out lines 34 to 44 and insert--
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments concern schedule 25(8). The role of the special commissioner is still unclear. The Financial Secretary says that the commissioner will decide on the Inland Revenue's proposals on a just and reasonable basis. However, it is possible that after, say, six months the Revenue will simply send in the correspondence and ask for the original proposal to be rubber stamped by the commissioner. It is unclear how much scope the special commissioner has for rejecting a proposal that has been put forward by the Inland Revenue. The amendments would ensure that there has to be a hearing that gives the special commissioner the option of amending the proposal that has been put before him by the Inland Revenue. The amendment would improve the Bill and make it fairer and I hope that the Financial Secretary will accept it.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As I explained earlier, the negotiations will take place between the owner and the agency to establish public access. I shall not repeat the reasons for the schedule although I could do so because they are relevant to our debate on the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Guidelines will be published as soon as possible after Royal Assent to explain and qualify what I have said in Committee. The special commissioners will have no power to vary a recommendation; they will either agree the Revenue's recommendation or reject it on a just and reasonable basis. That is fair, and consistent with the way in which we have dealt with the clause. Given the owners' apparent, and the Government's definite, reasonableness in seeking the same objective--public access to the assets--there is no reason for the amendment. I therefore ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If the commissioners are to exercise their jurisdiction on a just and reasonable basis, there should be a hearing at which the taxpayers could put their side of the case. The commissioners should not just adjudicate on the Inland Revenue's proposal. However, as the issue has been aired, and in view of the Financial Secretary's reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Twenty-fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I rise only because I thought, given the speed with which we are moving through our proceedings, that the Financial Secretary was tempted to reply to the penultimate debate. I pressed her slightly about the balance of the schedule and the extent to which the special commissioners would use their judgment. She explained, helpfully, that the special commissioners would have no power to amend. In the end, they must either enforce the Revenue's judgment or disapply it.
<P>
I asked the Financial Secretary whether she would consider codification to help the owners of the objects. I asked, too, whether she considered that the balance--reasonable access to the public--was right. I asked for further assurance that ``reasonable'' could also be interpreted as reasonable to the owners of the objects of art, especially in respect of security and conservation. We hope to consider such general matters in our debate on the schedule.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The schedule strikes a reasonable balance. Owners apply for an exemption from tax on the basis that they provide reasonable access to members of the public. The schedule will prevent abuse and ensure the smooth running of the process of reasonable access in a fashion that is acceptable both to taxpayers and to owners. If it is not acceptable to the owners, they do not need to accept the exemption.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 25 agreed to.
<P>
Clauses 141 to 143 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 133, line 37, leave out `and' and insert `or'.
<P>
Under the amenement the exemption would apply if any single condition in paragraph 4(2)(a), (b) or (c) was met, instead of all three conditions having to be met. For example, condition (b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the premium attributable to the cover against travel risks does not exceed 10 per cent. of the total premium payable under the contract''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would make it easier for the public to accept the provision. It is a reasonable amendment and I hope that the Financial Secretary will accept it.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): I am due to reply and am much encouraged to be called to action at this stage in our proceedings this morning. As is so often the case with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I regret that I cannot accept his amendment because it is technically defective. The higher rate of insurance premium tax is to be extended to all travel insurance because the future market for travel insurance is likely to be more competitive and the restriction of the higher rate to insurance sold through the travel trade could lead to market distortion.
<P>
The purpose of the measure is that with a changing travel insurance market all travel insurance should compete on an even playing field. The amendment would provide some travel insurance sold as part of a mixed policy with a competitive advantage, which would destroy the purpose of the provision. The amendment would have the effect of imputing a further ``or'' at the end of paragraph 4(2)(a), which would render it meaningless. A subsequent Government amendment will deal with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In view of that reasonable response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 186, in page 134, line 24, after `exposed', insert `by reason of travel'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Hon. Members will realise that amendment No. 243 addresses a fine point in the clause and replaces the definition of travel risks in subsection (2). The revised definition ensures that the clause will have an impact only on its intended target--travel insurance. In post-Budget discussions with Customs and Excise, representative of the insurance industry expressed concern that retention of the existing legal definition of travel risks could result in the higher rate catching non-travel insurance policies--for example, personal accident insurance--which is not our intention.
<P>
The new definition, which reflects the typical scope of an annual travel insurance policy, has the support of the insurance industry which believes that it addresses its concerns. With the industry's backing, I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Paymaster General has performed the Committee a service by reading out the explanatory note. He has not, however, explained why he has decided to introduce a revised definition of travel risks. What was the reason for the original definition of travel risks? Why did he have to wait for representations from the insurance industry to get the clause right? Was he trying to get away with the narrower definition of travel risks that was originally set out in clause 144, or was there some inadvertent drafting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The hon. Member for Sevenoaks is never satisfied. He hates it when we consult and talk to people because he knows that this Government listen in a way that the Conservative Government did not, which is why they were kicked out of office so unceremoniously in May last year. Of course we listen, and we have rectified the problem. I would have thought that even the hon. Gentleman would accept that with acclamation.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 134, line 32, leave out ``1st August 1998'' and insert ``1st January 1999''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 188, in page 134, line 43, leave out `1st August 1998' and insert `1st January 1999'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendment would introduce the measure on 1 January 1999. When the higher rate of insurance premium tax of 17.5 per cent. was introduced, it was seen as an anti-avoidance measure. to avoid tax, companies would attach to a product--such as travel insurance or electrical goods--an insurance element which attracted a lower rate of VAT. They were able to shift some of the profit on an electrical good or a package holiday to the insurance policy, which was usually compulsory, especially in the case of car hire contracts. That element of insurance attracted a lower rate of VAT than the product itself. The higher rate of insurance premium tax was introduced to deal with that avoidance measure.
<P>
The Association of British Insurers represents 450 insurance companies which account for 96 per cent. of all insurance written by companies in the UK. It is deeply opposed to the clause and would like the amendments to be accepted. The association believes that a better solution would be for all travel insurance to be taxed at the 4 per cent. standard rate of insurance premium tax. I urge the Paymaster General to accept the amendments which I believe are reasonable. As I understand it, they attract the backing of the industry and will improve the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The proposed change would delay the measure, which would be unhelpful and is unnecessary. The timing of the change fully meets industry agreements. The amendments are flawed because what they propose would be costly to the insurance industry. The extension of the higher rate to all travel insurance is designed to reflect the likely future competitive nature of the travel insurance market and to prevent distortions by the selective application of the higher rate. To delay the implementation further would be against the spirit of the measure. I rest our case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The industry will be disappointed with the Paymaster General's response. However, in view of the time, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The industry is concerned about the clause. Evidence suggests that the differential margins on the proudcts that are sold by tour operators or travel agents were due not to VAT avoidance schemes but to tour operators' marketing methods. The tour operators' margins scheme, which is used by tour operators and travel agents in relation to VAT, is normally based on the undiscounted price of a holiday--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As it is now 1 am, I will suspend the Committee for half an hour.
<P>
<H5>1 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>1.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clause 144 will extend the higher rate of insurance premium tax to all travel insurance, which can be provided with a product, such as a package holiday, or it can be sold directly.
<P>
The Association of British Insurers opposes the clause, which is intended to deal with the link between the higher rate of insurance premium tax and VAT avoidance. If the clause is intended to clamp down on VAT avoidance, what is the purpose of extending it--and the higher rate of IPT--to the direct provision of travel insurance by insurers or independent insurance brokers to the insured person?
<P>
The reason for introducing the higher rate of IPT in, I believe, the Finance Act 1994 was to prevent a company from shifting profit and value from its core product, which carries the full rate of VAT, into some form of--albeit genuine--insurance cover that is attached to that product. The company would make that shift in the full knowledge that the attached product would attract IPT only at the 4 per cent. rate. The Government want to deal with that perceived avoidance, which is why the clause contains anti-avoidance provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> We are dealing with an unfortunate but dangerous precedent. Given my hon. Friend's extensive knowledge, what precedents might the proposal set and what implications might it contain?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that Mr. Gibb's remarks will relate to the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The proposal contains some dangers and it will raise the cost of travel insurance. As I shall explain later, it may have implications for travellers who do not take out travel insurance when they go abroad on holiday. They could suffer serious consequences if, for example, they went skiing and broke a leg in a jurisdiction that is not within the EU and which is not covered by our reciprocal national health service arrangements. They would face steep medical bills or they might skip medical treatment and suffer serious consequences in the long run.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point about travel insurance for dangerous sports. No doubt you are a fine skier yourself, Mrs. Dunwoody, and you will be aware of the enormous costs that are involved in an accident on the piste--or even off piste. Expensive helicopters might be involved or the blood wagon might have to come and rescue you and take you to an expensive hospital in Switzerland--if that is where your favourite resorts are.
<P>
The clause will deter people from taking out holiday insurance, which it is prudent to take out. Surely the Government do not want to discourage people from being prudent in their insurance arrangements. As we saw in our debates on previous clauses, the Government have attempted to discourage people from being prudent with their savings. Does my hon. Friend think that the Government are trying to discourage people from taking out proper medical insurance?

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief. I have not sought to restrict the debate, If members of the Committee feel that they have not already made enough speeches today and want to catch my eye to make further speeches, I shall endeavour to notice them. Mr. Gibb, your were speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. We hear much rhetoric from the Government about their desire to create a more self-sufficient society in which people take out insurance for travel, old age and medical health. In previous Finance Bills the Government sought to remove tax relief for medical insurance, and the clause contains another proposal that counters their rhetoric about wanting people to be self-sufficient. We are becoming an aging society in which it will be increasingly difficult for the state to provide for all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I listen to my hon. Friend with extreme interest. What evidence does he believe Customs might have provided? Might it have conclusive contradictory evidence?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. When I said that interventions should be brief, I meant it. I hope that hon. Members will not abuse the Committee. It is up to Members to allow other Members to intervene on their speeches, but those interventions must be short and to the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful, again, to my hon. Friend. He raises a good point, which I hope that I would have made. Whenever the Government take action against what they regard as tax avoidance by industry or individuals, they are beholden to provide examples of, and the estimated cost of, that avoidance. All anti-avoidance provisions should include a cost benefit analysis of the cost to UK plc of leaving the loophole open and the cost of closing it in terms of compliance and the extra burdens imposed on industry. When the Paymaster General winds up the debate, I hope that he will provide an estimate of the tax that Customs and Excise and the Treasury believe is being siphoned out of the Treasury and the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I want to make a brief but definitive point. I tried to intervene on the point being made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about national insurance relief, which is a good parallel. As he will know--his constituency adjoins mine--my constituency has the highest number of people with private medical insurance. He will be aware that, since the cancellation of national insurance relief last year, more than 100,000 people have not renewed their private medical insurance. I would argue that the same will apply to travel insurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. We should remember that travel insurance is not taken out only for holidays abroad. My constituency, Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, is a travel destination for many people in the United Kingdom. If people fail to take out travel insurance when they come to Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, they will become dependent on our local hospitals--Bognor Regis War Memorial hospital and Littlehampton hospital--both of which have recently been subject to bed closures. The point has been continually made to the health service that there is an influx of tourists, who are dependent on using those hospitals for minor injuries suffered--children falling over, for instance--in the summer season.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> My hon. Friend introduces an argument that had not previously occurred to me--there is a risk, which I had not previously assessed, in not going to Bognor for a holiday. Is he not aware that the clause would be more likely to drive people away from booking that particular holiday, as they would be less likely to accept an insurance contract offered by the same firm that is offering the holiday?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Dispensations do not apply to the Front Benches any more than to the Back Benches. I hope that interventions will be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. There is a risk of people not taking out travel insurance. If they come to Bognor Regis--as I hope they will--but are not covered by travel insurance they will add to the burdon on health services there. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was about to say in his intervention that the abolition of tax relief on medical insurance premiums--
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will clarify what he said because we may have missed something. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham told the Committee that 100,000 people in his constituency who had private health insurance have lost it. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, tells us that visitors to Bognor Regis who do not have health insurance will be a burden on the health service and will face problems. Will he explain further?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is always assumed that people who take out travel insurance intend to travel abroad and insure against accident or illness when abroad. The clause relates to travel insurance, especially that sold as part of a holiday package. But it should not be forgotten that holidays are spent in Britain. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and I represent United Kingdom holiday resorts. Many people with limited incomes come to Bognor Regis because we provide good holidays at limited cost. If people visit such resorts but are not insured because the clause increases the cost of travel insurance beyond the reach of many of them--thereby causing them to miss out on a package holiday that incorporates travel insurance--and they or their children have an accident, or become ill, they will automatically become dependent on health services in Bognor Regis, which are already stretched by its resident population.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will my hon. Friend comment on the probability that travel insurance will cover a broader spectrum of problems than health or medical matters? Might it not also cover cancelled travel arrangements, or baggage that is lost or stolen during travel?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. All those elements of risk add to the cost of holidays. We must not forget how greatly the United Kingdom economy benefits from its tourist industry or how much it benefits from overseas travel.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This debate is not about the tourist industry, nor is it--interesting though the place is--a travelogue for Bognor. It is about travel insurance premium tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall try to keep on the strait and narrow. My point was that an increase in the cost of travel insurance will have an impact on the UK economy and that in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton it will affect health services needed by the resident population. It is important that people who travel take out insurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the majority of people who travel to Bogor Regis take out travel insurance, which also covers private medical insurance? Most people who suffered an accident in Bognor, or became ill there, would as a matter of course refer to their private medical insurance rather than use the hospital. In fact, it would be abnormal to use a hospital in such circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Many people take travel insurance because it comes automatically with the holiday. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, it covers not only medical problems but such things as having to cancel a holiday because of a sick child at home, or losing luggage in transit. All such risks are covered by holiday insurance, which is why people buy it, even when travelling in the UK. By increasing the cost of that travel insurance the clause will make holidays in Bognor Regis more expensive and will therefore damage our infrastructure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend has elaborated on a very important point, and has given yet another pertinent example. I should emphasise the merits of Worthing, which is just along the south coast from Bognor Regis, without detailing its wonderful sights.
<P>
<H5>1.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming rail strike will bring great misery to holidaymakers travelling to the south coast. Holiday and travel insurance will be required to cover just such an eventuality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The risks that attach to such insurance are not confined to those mentioned by my hon. Friend. All kinds of risks--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we are to hear rather more of the hon. Gentleman's views on the clause's actual content. We would all benefit by hearing from Mr. Gibb.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Before I continue I shall give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hope that my intervention will prove useful.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has raised an important point. Rail travel inthe UK is not subject to VAT. Why should tax of any form therefore be charged on insurance premiums that relate to such travel?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As usual my hon. Friend makes a pertinent point, which goes to the root of the clause. The clause is supposed to deal with anti-avoidance. However, as he points out there is no avoidance because shifting value to an insurance premium would attract 4 per cent. insurance premium tax, whereas the product itself would attract zero per cent. VAT. In such circumstances, what would be the point of avoidance?
<P>
As I have said, the clause will also extend the higher rate of insurance premium tax to insurance policies that are sold directly to the insured person, and which are unconnected with any other product. As with the example provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, no avoidance exists in such circumstances. There is no avoidance here because there is no product that formerly attracted a higher rate of indirect tax, from which value has been shifted to the insurance in order to attract a lower rate of indirect tax on the product as a whole. Value shifting is not possible in such circumstances because the independent insurance brokers do not sell valuable goods or services with the insurance.
<P>
It is therefore unreasonable to dismiss, as the Paymaster General no doubt will, such injustice to innocent taxpayers as collateral damage that is well worth the price. If the Government were to come up with a more targeted method of dealing with avoidance, such damage could be stopped. It may seriously affect the UK economy, which relies heavily on a successful insurance industry. Invisibles boost our balance of trade enormously. We should not introduce clauses such as clause 144, which will damage one of the most successful parts of our economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of the court case involving Regina v. Customs and Excise Commissioners, ex parte Lunn Poly Ltd? The European Union maintained that the differential between travel insurance and travel insurance sold by insurers could amount to a state aid. Could it be that the Government need to enact the clause at the behest of the European Union?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. I was intending shortly to deal with the European Union aspect of the clause. As a result of the clause, we will have the highest rate of premium tax applying to travel insurance in Europe. For example, the rate of insurance premium tax applicable in France is 9 per cent. compared with the 17&#183;5 per cent.--almost double the rate--that will be introduced by the clause. In Belgium, the rate of premium tax is 9&#183;25 per cent.; in Luxembourg, it is 4 per cent.; in the Netherlands, it is 7 per cent.; and in Greece it is 10 per cent. The only country in the European Union that comes close to our 17&#183;5 per cent. insurance premium tax rate is Germany which has a rate of 15 per cent. That is still lower than our rate.
<P>
<B>Mr Loughton:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend mentioned the European angle because it is important. Can he explain--I am damn sure that the Government will have trouble--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Language.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I am exceptionally sure that the Government will have a problem explaining why they have produced the highest level of tax in the European Union when, because of the divergence of tax rates, there is no pressure for harmonisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. The Government and the Financial Secretary, who is not in her place but who is chairman of the European Union code of conduct on tax harmonisation, are always telling us how imperative it is for tax harmonisation to occur in Europe if we are to have a successful single market. You shake your head--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have not shaken my head.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody, but the hon. Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson), shook his head. His Government have signed the European Union code of conduct on harmful tax competition. It specifically says that they will seek to harmonise taxes in Europe.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Members must not pass between the Member who is on his feet and the Chairman. I hope that that elementary piece of procedure will stick in Members' minds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Government have signed the codes of conduct. They have surreptitiously dropped the words ``business tax'' from speeches made in Europe and there does not seem to be any determination to use the veto in the European Commission's attempts to harmonise tax. If it is their aim to harmonise taxes, why are they introducing a wider disparity between insurance premium tax in the EU?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could tell us what the rate of insurance premium tax was before the previous Government introduced it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> And I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would confine himself to the content of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause will damage British tourism and the insurance industry. It is opposed by the Association of British Insurers, which represents 96 per cent. of all insurance written by companies in the UK. I urge the Government to think again about introducing the measure. It goes beyond anti-avoidance and will damage the industries that made this country as prosperous as it was under the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> May I deal first with the matter of Lunn Poly's judicial review? Two separate issues are involved. The clause is forward looking because it anticipates likely changes in the travel insurance market. The judicial review considered the legality of the existing measure. The decision of the High Court is subject to an appeal by the commissioners of Customs and Excise. The case is therefore sub judice and it would be improper for me to comment on the arguments relating to that case.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I can say that the measure removes the differential rates of tax applicable to travel insurance which the High Court found to amount to an unlawful state aid to those insurers who were liable to the 4 per cent. rate. I cannot elaborate further; I am sure that Opposition Members will readily appreciate why and will not try to press me at this advanced stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment. I will make some progress as it is getting quite late. [Hon. Members: ``No.''] We shall adjust ourselves to any time of day that Opposition Members wish. Some of my hon. Friends have pointed out that we are discussing a measure introduced by the Conservative Government, who clearly saw the problem of shifting value. The resulting distortion was the precise reason for the introduction of the measure, and by levelling up we are rectifying the situation.
<P>
	As far as we are aware, no evidence exists of an increase in uninsured travellers due to IPT, contrary to what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said. The parallel that he drew may appear attractive, but in reality there has been no movement away from travel insurance. The survey sponsored by the Association of British Travel Agents showed that most travellers were not even aware of the existence of IPT. Most travellers still choose to buy their insurance from travel agents, even if it is more expensive. It is not a highly price-sensitive commodity and the measure would add only &#163;2 to the average cost of insurance. When taken in the context of a tour operator's package holiday, that is a relatively small percentage of the overall cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for confirming that under article 92.1, this matter may be an illegal state aid as defined by the European Union. Will he tell the Committee whether the Government have notified--or will notify--the Commission of that in accordance with article 93.3 and whether clearance and exemption as a state aid will be sought?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I have covered that adequately already. I cannot be drawn on that matter, which is sub judice, in this sitting of the Committee. No doubt we will be able to return to the issue as the legal situation becomes clearer.
<P>
I was saying, in recognition of some of the arguments of Opposition Members during this brief clause stand part debate, that ours is one of the higher rates in Europe. Germany has a 15 per cent. rate, which is not far short of ours, and Finland has a 22 per cent. rate.
<P>
As for the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, 80 per cent. of holidays are in the EEC and are therefore subject to VAT. It would be far too administratively difficult to separate out the zero rate for travel, which would apply to non-EEC holidays.
<P>
The measure is intended to get rid of the distortion and to avoid the tendency towards value shifting, which the Conservative Government rightly decided to address. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 144, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clause 145 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Provisional collection of landfill tax</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>2 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is an innocuous-looking clause, and the explanation of it takes up only one page of the notes on clauses. Finance Bill Committees should always be alert to a clause that looks innocuous, as it usually contains something that is detrimental to the public good.
<P>
On the face of it, the clause is drafted to make the collection of taxes easier and quicker and to avoid detailed scrutiny by future Finance Bill Committees.
<P>
Landfill tax is being changed in relation to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 so that the charge can be levied on Budget day, which means that the Government will not have to wait until Royal Assent. Landfill tax will be brought into line with other taxes, including VAT and Customs and Excise duties.
<P>
It just so happens that I was the Minister responsible for bringing in the landfill tax in the first place. When the proposal was introduced, the Finance Bill Committee debated it at considerable length, but I decided not to make the proposal subject to the 1968 Act.
<P>
It may help the Committee if I outline the reasons for my decision. The story starts with a meeting between Ministers from the Treasury and Ministers from what was then the Department of the Environment, which was headed--
