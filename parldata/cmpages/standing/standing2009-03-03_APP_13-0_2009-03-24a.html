<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000451"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b><b class="B"> </b>Good morning, Mrs. Humble.
Amendment 346 requires that the chief executive of the Skills Funding
Agency, in securing suitable education and training provision for
persons subject to adult detention, but aged under 19-years-old, has
regard to the desirability of the core curriculum and additional
entitlements being satisfied for those who have elected for
them.</div><a name="09032433000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
change also results in consequential amendment 347, which provides for
the definition of core entitlement and additional entitlement under
clause 92 to be read alongside proposed new sections 17B to 17D of the
Education Act 1996 to be inserted under clause 44. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>The size and infrastructure of many custodial establishments
make it unfeasible for them to offer the full diploma entitlement in
custody. We are not expecting any one school or college to deliver the
full entitlement in the community and it is not practical to expect
custodial establishments to be able to deliver that either. Most young
adult offenders&#151;those aged over 18 but under 19 years
old&#151;are in adult custody for a short time so it will usually not
be practical to study a full diploma course, for
example.</div><a name="09032433000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
core and additional entitlements are designed to be flexible, and we
want to ensure that offenders in custody can receive learning as
closely aligned as practicable with that available in the mainstream
sector. For that reason, the amendment would require the chief
executive of the Skills Funding Agency to have regard to the
desirability of the core and additional entitlements being
satisfied.</div>
<a name="09032433000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032433000452"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): The
Minister will be aware that the chief executive of the Learning and
Skills Council resigned yesterday. Should the chief executive of the
Skills Funding Agency resign, to whom would that responsibility
pass?</div><a name="09032433000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000453"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Let me be clear about the question. Should the
chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency resign, to whom would the
responsibilities of the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency
pass?</div><a name="09032433000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000454"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b><b class="B"> </b>In what regard is the Minister thinking
about?</div>
<a name="09032433000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000455"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am assuming that such a position would be the
same as in any other regard, in that the responsibilities would lie in
the first instance with the permanent secretary as the accounting
officer, who would then, I assume, immediately appoint an acting
replacement, as happened yesterday with the chief executive of the
Learning and Skills
Council.</div><a name="09032433000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that members of the Committee agree that the amendments are
necessary to align the education and training in adult detention as far
as practicable with that available in juvenile custody and the
mainstream
sector.</div><a name="09032433000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000456"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> What a pleasure to see you back in the Chair,
Mrs. Humble, after our deliberations last week in your
absence. We look forward to making the same steady, considered
progress, without hyperbole or unnecessary delay. Under the amendments,
the Skills Funding Agency must ensure the provision of core and
additional entitlements for those under 19 years old in adult
detention. It is clear that clause 92 moves the provision of education
of those in detention from the Learning and Skills Council to the
Skills Funding Agency, hence my earlier intervention. I wanted to
establish whether the same protocols would apply with the SFA that we
could reasonably expect of the LSC in respect of accountability and
responsibility. Given the crisis that led to the resignation of the
chief executive of the LSC yesterday, that question is
pertinent.</div><a name="09032433000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to probe the position of OLASS, the offender learning and skills
service, which would previously have looked after the younger people in
adult detention, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div>to determine whether the amendment ensures that young offenders can
progress beyond level 2 in the core and additional
entitlements.</div><a name="09032433000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth reminding the Committee that OLASS was established only in
2005 and is therefore at a relatively early stage of its development.
The Prisoners&#146; Education Trust has indicated that it is moving
in the right direction and that, in the new contracting round for
learning and skills providers that is currently under way, OLASS
intends to address many of the weaknesses identified in its first three
years of work. When I speak of weaknesses, I am alluding to the
National Audit Office report, &#147;Meeting Needs? The Offender
Learning and Skills Service&#148; and the Public Accounts Committee
report of Session 47 with the same title. Can the Minister indicate
whether OLASS will become part of the SFA and whether the SFA has the
ability to carry on the work that OLASS has been
doing?</div><a name="09032433000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
though a significant proportion of prisoners lack even basic
qualifications, and it is understandable that priority is given to
enabling that group to reach level 1 and, if possible, level 2, can the
Minister indicate whether there is to be any level 3 provision for
those in adult detention who may already have level 2 qualifications,
or indeed who may have acquired those during the education they
received while detained?</div>
<a name="09032433000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
could the Minister indicate what the provision in relation to core and
additional provision will consist of, and whether there will be funding
for those who may wish to engage in distance learning on the core and
additional
entitlement?</div><a name="09032433000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
in relation to persons subject to adult detention, clause 92 states
that the chief executive of skills funding must</div>
<a name="09032433000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;act with a view
to encouraging diversity of education and training available to
individuals...increasing opportunities for individuals to exercise
choice&#148;</div><a name="09032433000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="09032433000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
regard to the desirability of
enabling&#148;</div><a name="09032433000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">offenders</div><a name="09032433000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
continue programmes of education or training which they have
begun&#148;.</div><a name="09032433000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">OLASS
is working hard&#151;particularly after the comments made in the two
independent studies that I mentioned from the National Audit Office and
the Public Accounts Committee&#151;to provide and develop its
services. Nevertheless, there are gaps. Does the Minister believe that
funding core and additional provisions will fill the
gaps?</div><a name="09032433000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a final question. I am sure that the Minister will want to say in
his comprehensive concluding remarks something about those with
learning difficulties, particularly language difficulties. We talked
about that earlier in relation to other aspects of the Bill. It is
highly relevant to the clause and the Government
amendments.</div><a name="09032433000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000457"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The hon. Gentleman began by saying that he hoped we
would continue to make steady progress today. There is an
interpretation on this side of the Committee that we have not quite
been making the speedy progress required if we are to have an even
consideration of matters in the considerable time that has been
allocated to us. I hope that, while keeping the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div>progress steady and the consideration thorough, the hon. Gentleman will
join me in perhaps upping the pace and cracking on a bit more
smartly.</div><a name="09032433000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032433000458"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I find
those comments fairly concerning. Does the Minister not want a question
put to him during deliberations on a Government amendment?
Mrs. Humble, there are more than 200 Government
amendments&#151;pushing on 300&#151;to a 256-clause Bill. For the
Minister to complain when Opposition Members question amendments that
have been tabled since Second Reading is
unwarranted.</div><a name="09032433000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000459"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am not complaining about being questioned. I am
simply reminding the hon. Gentleman who was congratulating us on making
steady progress that we have actually been going more slowly. We have
spent 53 minutes out of 20 hours of debate on Government amendments.
They are technical amendments. We have already spent nine minutes of
our two and a half hours this morning debating Government amendments. I
shall attempt to deal with all the questions that the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings has mentioned as quickly and efficiently
as I
can.</div><a name="09032433000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
core and additional entitlements are designed to offer flexible
learning and accreditation. We are looking at how adult offenders might
be able to study for some components that can then contribute to a full
diploma while they are in custody.</div>
<a name="09032433000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, the Offender Learning and Skills
Service will continue and it will sit inside the Skills Funding Agency.
He mentioned some of the issues that were raised in the reports from
the PAC and the NAO. We are addressing those and have published our
replies in detail. To answer his question about level 3 provision,
there will be such provision in the same kind of circumstances that
will apply according to the same criteria applied outside. There may be
e-learning for diplomas, and we are exploring its possible
applicability to custodial establishments. As for learning
difficulties, the LSC is developing a comprehensive tool to asses
learning difficulties for offenders and we hope that it will be in
place by 1 August. It will allow OLASS to improve the
service and address even better the needs of those
learners.</div>
<a name="09032433000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000460"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The only point that the hon. Gentleman did not
cover in that pithy and appropriately concise summary was the issue
about those whom the Government wish to engage in distance learning on
core and additional entitlement. I should like to add to that the
continuation of people&#146;s learning once released. One of the big
complaints that PAC and others made related to the issue of continuity,
in the sense that they began things that they had finished rather than
restarting training and education. That is critical because of the
impact that the acquisition of education and skills has in preventing
recidivism.</div><a name="09032433000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000461"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s kind
words about my conciseness and I am glad that we seem to have reached
more of a consensus about that matter. I had intended to answer more
clearly the question about e-learning. The current plan has provision
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div>e-learning and distance learning and there are pilots in train now to
examine how more can be done with that within the confines of the
security and restriction requirements of being in detention. However,
the hon. Gentleman is quite right that we need to do more to join up
the prison learning experience with the after-prison learning
experience.</div><a name="09032433000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

morning, Mrs., Humble, and welcome back to the Chair. Clause
93 deals with the duty placed on the chief executive of Skills Funding
to provide proper facilities for certain adults who lack basic skills
so that that they can acquire those skills. This is a straightforward
amendment, so I shall rise to the Minister&#146;s challenge by not
speaking to it for too long. As drafted, the clause states that the
duty to be placed on the chief executive of Skills Funding is to
provide educational and vocational training to adults who lack certain
basic skills. However, it does not explicitly include apprenticeships
as one of those proper vocational training courses. In our debates on
earlier clauses, we were keen to seek assurances from the Ministers
that the apprenticeship option would be included in guidance
and advice; for instance, apprenticeships should be explicitly
mentioned to young people starting off on their training journey, and
they should be included in the suite of training courses available to
people whether they are young or, as in this part of the Bill, over
19.</div>
<a name="09032433000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment is to expand the definition of education and
vocational training explicitly to include an
apprenticeship&#151;presumably a level 2  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div>apprenticeship&#151;to meet the basic skills requirements envisaged by
the clause. We are having this discussion in a terrible recession and
economic downturn. Members on both sides of the Committee have all made
speeches in various debates saying that this is the time to encourage
adults to skill and reskill throughout their working lives. The clause
is directed at adults who lack basic skills. One purpose of the Bill is
to enable people to acquire an apprenticeship at level 2, and I would
like an assurance from the Minister that the clause opens up the
opportunity for an adult, aged over 19, to commence a level 2
apprenticeship.</div>

93 enables adults who do not have any qualifications or who have
learning difficulties to qualify for a specified qualification in
literacy and numeracy, or a level 2 vocational qualification. The
amendment proposes that the entitlement should extend to
apprenticeships, and that is welcome. It is absolutely essential that
apprenticeships are built in to assumptions about what people might
learn in those circumstances. Apprenticeships must be as available and
as inclusive as possible and that is what the amendment strives to
achieve. However, there are some problems with the amendment and the
hon. Gentleman might want to deal with them.</div>
<a name="09032433000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, subsection (3)(b)
specifically relates to people with no certificate of literacy or
numeracy and no level 2 vocational qualification. While we support the
inclusivity of apprenticeships, it is clear that there are
apprenticeships in certain sectors that require basic standards of
numeracy and literacy and that is not necessarily guaranteed by the
amendment. Has the hon. Gentleman thought about how that might affect
apprenticeships in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics
sector?</div> <a name="09032433000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
amendment centralises authority to some degree and, despite its
laudable objectives, unless we are very careful, it will increase
bureaucracy and regulation, which Conservative Members wish to cast
aside. That is an issue that sector skills councils must consider and
on which they must develop policies in consultation with employers and
learning providers. Sector skills councils should be required to make
apprenticeships as inclusive as possible, but we would all accept that
not all apprenticeships suit all kinds of people and are, by their
nature, tailored by circumstances, aptitudes and the existing skills of
learners.</div>
<a name="09032433000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both Skill
and ALLFIE&#151;the alliance for inclusive education&#151;expressed
similar concerns about access to apprenticeships for disabled learners,
which is why I raised the issue in our earlier debate this morning.
Those groups state that the requirement for level 2
qualifications</div><a name="09032433000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
disadvantage some disabled learners who may have very relevant
experience but may struggle to gain the require
qualifications.&#148;.</div>
<a name="09032433000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">They also recommend
that eligibility should not be</div>
<a name="09032433000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;limited to
qualifications, but that a portfolio of evidence is
considered.&#148;.</div><a name="09032433000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a route that should be looked at by Government, in conjunction with
sector skills councils, and I would welcome the Minister&#146;s
comments when he replies to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Bristol, West.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div><a name="09032433000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000464"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman go over the previous point
again? I did not quite understand what he was
asking.</div><a name="09032433000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000465"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Organisations that represent disabled people argue
that many of those for whom they speak do not fit the profile of the
typical learner. They may not have achieved the same levels or
qualifications in training or education as others, but they may have
lots of useful experience. They therefore suggest that a portfolio of
evidence of their experience and competence could be used as a
springboard&#151;a trigger&#151;for further training and education.
Will the Minister say something about that? I have suggested that SSCs
might like to consider that idea to increase inclusivity. We must think
more laterally if we want to increase the inclusivity of
apprenticeships. These are probing remarks, but it is worth raising
these issues at this stage because they are interesting and highly
relevant. Although we support the sentiment behind the amendment, the
measure itself carries the risk that it would compromise flexibility. I
know that that is not the intention, but I hope that the hon. Member
for Bristol, West understands the spirit in which I make these
remarks.</div><a name="09032433000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000466"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I agree with the sentiments behind the remarks of
the hon. Members for South Holland and The Deepings and for Bristol,
West. I understand where the hon. Member for Bristol, West is coming
from with his amendment. We all want adults to have the opportunity to
start and complete apprenticeships. An apprenticeship is an excellent
route for adults who want to improve their skills and employability,
which is why we have extended financial support to employers for
apprentices over the age of 25 and why the number of apprenticeship
starts in that group went up from just 300 in the previous year to
27,000 last
year.</div><a name="09032433000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
93 puts a duty on the chief executive of Skills Funding to ensure that
adults who have very few skills, who need help with numeracy and
literacy or who do not have a full level 2 can access the relevant
courses. Clause 94 will ensure that those learners and 19 to
25-year-olds taking their first level 3 will not have to pay full
tuition fees. Ultimately, this is a straightforward choice about
priorities. Our priority is improving the life chances of those with
very few skills, which puts them at a great
disadvantage.</div><a name="09032433000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
117 would extend that duty to all adults who want to do an
apprenticeship. All the training costs of an adult apprenticeship would
be met from the public purse. As the hon. Member for Bristol, West
knows, employers are currently required to meet at least half the
training costs of apprentices who are over 18 in recognition
of the principle of shared responsibility between employers, learners
and the Government. Employers are asked to contribute most when they
stand to see the greatest returns. That is a long-standing policy
endorsed by Lord Leitch. I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that
funding for apprenticeships is dealt with in clause 92 and that adults
are dealt with separately with the 50 per cent.
funding.</div><a name="09032433000389"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings suggested a portfolio of
evidence for disabled learners who wish to do apprenticeships.
Eligibility for apprenticeships is ultimately a matter for the
framework provider. We are working with Skill and others to find 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>alternative routes into apprenticeships. I do not think that these
matters should be included in the Bill, but I am sympathetic to the
concerns that he raises.</div>
<a name="09032433000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000467"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Those matters would, I presume, be included in
guidance. If we are going to be clear in that guidance about the
various routes into training and education, which are highly pertinent
to the Bill, it should touch upon such things. While the Minister is
speaking, he might like to say something about the discrepancy that has
come to light between the number of apprenticeship completion
certificates that are issued and the announced number of
completions.</div><a name="09032433000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000468"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman for certain
whether we will refer specifically to the matter in guidance.
Certainly, we will continue to look at it
sympathetically.</div><a name="09032433000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000469"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I take that in good
faith.</div><a name="09032433000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000470"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Good. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
good faith, and all I can do is give him assurance. The other matter
was brought to our attention only yesterday and we are looking at it as
a matter of urgency, on which basis I hope the hon. Member for Bristol,
West will be minded to withdraw the amendment. I sympathise with the
spirit of the amendment, but, practically, I do not think it would do
what he intends.</div>
<a name="09032433000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000471"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> First, the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings talked about not placing formal qualification barriers before
adults with learning difficulties when it comes to entering
apprenticeships or other schemes of vocational training. We have made
those points several times, especially my hon. Friend the Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole, who made them in relation to clauses that
we discussed earlier. Given that we still have much ground to cover, I
will be brief, and not go over the same things again. It is common
ground. I, too, have met ALLFIE to discuss its concerns, which we have
raised in Committee on its behalf.</div>
<a name="09032433000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome what the Minister has just said and what he said in relation to
previous clauses. He understands why we tabled the amendment, which
would make it clear that apprenticeships would be contemplated for
adults who lack basic skills. We have spoken many times about the
advice and support that would be given to young people and adults to
ensure that they understand all the training opportunities that are
available to them. The purpose of the amendment was not necessarily to
force a discussion on the funding of adult apprenticeships. The
Minister knows that the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party and,
indeed, the Conservative party, disagree about that, and we will
discuss it
shortly.</div><a name="09032433000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000474"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The schedule sets out a range of definitions of
levels of qualification for clauses 93 and 94. In other words, it
defines the learning aims for qualifying students over the age of 19,
and the qualifications for which the chief executive of Skills Funding
has to provide education. It defines level 2 as</div>

amendment 201, we are seeking to include the international general
certificate of secondary education in the definition of level 2, and in
amendment 202, we are seeking to include the Cambridge pre-U in the
definition of level 3.</div>
<a name="09032433000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The pre-U was
recognised by Ofqual last year, and in April it was approved for
funding. It is meant to mark a return to the traditional A-level,
before it is divided into modules with assessment along the way. It
takes a linear approach&#151;exams are taken only at the end of the
two-year course&#151;the principle being to give teachers the freedom
to teach without interruption from continual exams and retakes. Kevin
Stannard of Cambridge International Examinations said:</div>
<a name="09032433000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
idea is to give back schools and teachers control over the
curriculum&#151;it liberates the school and teachers, and gives them
more power over the way that they
teach&#148;.</div><a name="09032433000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
assistant head at Charterhouse school
said:</div><a name="09032433000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Pre-U courses are meatier than A-levels. We were concerned that the
course content of A-levels has been nibbled

am</div><a name="09032433000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
IGCSE seems to have taken a little longer, despite 30,000 pupils in
independent schools sitting the IGCSE last year and the qualification
being hugely popular overseas. In February, Ofqual announced that it
was accrediting 15 of the IGCSEs provided by Cambridge Assessment,
including art and design, English language, English literature, French,
geography, history, maths, physics, chemistry and biology, but they are
not yet approved by the Government for funding. In effect, despite
being accredited by Ofqual, the IGCSEs are not yet available in the
state sector. The power to award funding rests with the Secretary of
State, after taking advice from the Joint Advisory Committee for
Qualifications Approval&#151;JACQA. That committee only meets termly.
I would be grateful if the Minister could tell the Committee when JACQA
will meet to discuss approval for the funding of the IGCSE.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 504</div><a name="09032433000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
commentators are confident that JACQA will approve the 15 IGCSEs. The
real worry concerns the Secretary of State and the Minister for Schools
and Learners. In a speech to the annual conference of the Association
of School and College Leaders on Friday 13 March, the Secretary of
State dismissed the IGCSE as a &#147;marketing strategy&#148; by
the independent sector, and the Minister for Schools and Learners is
grasping at straws when he criticises the content of the IGCSE, which
is a cloak for his opposition to the return of rigour to our exam
system.</div><a name="09032433000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the Minister for Schools and Learners claimed that the IGCSE
would create a two-tier exam system. That is not true. We already have
a two-tier system, with the independent sector flocking to the exam,
but the state sector having its freedom to adopt the exam blocked. The
IGSCE is not like the O-level. The IGCSE, just like the GCSE, is an
all-ability exam, but one that has not been damaged by the changes
implemented over the past 10 years by the Government and the
QCA.</div><a name="09032433000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister also argued that the IGCSE in English literature does not
require the study of a Shakespeare play. True, it does not require
that, but it is an option, and one that the vast majority of schools
that use the IGCSE take up. As Shakespeare is a requirement of the
national curriculum, every school in the state sector that adopts the
IGCSE in English literature would have to choose that requirement. It
is disingenuous of the Minister to use that as a reason for not
approving the
IGCSE.</div><a name="09032433000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister argued that the IGCSE in maths does not have a non-calculator
paper. That is also true, but that is because the IGCSE in maths is a
test of maths and not of arithmetic, which is as it should be. In fact,
paper 4 of the mathematics IGCSE tests the application of real maths
skills to non-familiar situations. If one can do part 4, it means one
can do a non-calculator
paper.</div><a name="09032433000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
on the issue of the oral exam in the modern French language IGCSE, the
Minister is, once again, wrong. There are oral exams in the upper and
lower-tier language IGCSEs for languages new to a student. Anyone
studying the French IGCSE who is not already fluent in the language,
either as a first or second language, takes an oral exam as part of the
qualification. The only IGCSEs in modern languages that do not have an
oral exam are what are termed &#147;first&#148; and
&#147;second&#148; language IGCSEs&#151;there is no oral in such
exams because a certain level of familiarity is assumed, just as there
is no oral exam in GCSE English language, because exam-takers are
usually native English
speakers.</div><a name="09032433000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be aware that it is a Conservative policy to allow all
secondary schools in the state sector to adopt the IGCSE if they wish,
and for that to be funded in the same way that GCSEs are. We want to
close the attainment gap between the wealthiest and the poorest in our
country, as that gap that is widening to unacceptable levels. It is not
right that the independent sector, which educates just 15 per cent. of
sixth-form students, delivers more students with three grade As at
A-level than all the comprehensive schools put together. It is
unacceptable that one in five pupils, and half of those who qualify for
free school meals, do not achieve a single GCSE above a grade D. I
await the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I congratulate
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on his clear
exposition. Liberal Democrat Members agree with the principles of what
has been said, because it is important that if a truly independent
Ofqual approves a qualification, the choice to take it up should be at
school&#151;not Secretary of State&#151;level. As an aside, we had
a ridiculous situation locally when an independent school featured low
down the league tables published by the local paper and the head

Simon:</b> I also congratulate the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton on having made his case with his customary
eloquence, erudition and assiduity. He has put his points on the
record, where they will remain for ever. However, he knows&#151;the
hon. Lady gently pointed out to him&#151;that it is with some
ingenuity that he has managed to insert his case at this point in the
proceedings. We use the GCSE as a demonstration measure because it is
readily and widely understandable. We are not even talking about GCSEs
here, but about vocational qualifications. Paragraph 6 of schedule 5
provides a generic description of level 2 qualifications, giving five
good GCSEs as the example, and amendment 201 inserts the IGCSE into
that description. We use GCSEs as the benchmark simply because they
provide a generally recognised measure of this level of attainment,
which is easily and widely understood by potential learners. It would
not add anything to the general public&#146;s understanding of the
meaning of level 2 to insert the IGCSE, and the same argument holds for
level 3 qualifications, A-levels and the Cambridge pre-U. I
congratulate hon. Members on making their points so eloquently.
However, these matters are not for me but for the Minister for Schools
and Learners. They are not connected with these particular provisions,
and on that basis I humbly beg that the hon. Gentleman withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000477"></a>Mr.

hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and I accept that this is
not the right part of the proceedings in which to debate these issues.
As the hon. Lady said, there is an important principle here about the
independence of Ofqual, which we will come to later. This was an
opportunity to raise the matter, and we ought to return to it on
Report, when a new clause could be tabled, explicitly setting out this
point of principle about the independence of Ofqual and whether the
ultimate decision about choosing qualifications should rest with the
Secretary of State or schools. I agree that it should be up to schools
to decide on the use of a qualification, once Ofqual has approved or
accredited it. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<a name="09032433000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000478"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I have just one question. The clause sets out the
chief executive&#146;s general duty to encourage participation by
employers in education and training for people aged 19 or over and
others in adult detention. With the office of the chief executive being
located in the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, what
methods would the Minister expect to use to encourage participation and
how does that clash with the position of the SFA, which carries out no
actual delivery of
service?</div><a name="09032433000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000479"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I meant to intervene before the hon. Gentleman sat
down to ask him whether he could go through that more slowly and
clearly.</div><a name="09032433000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000480"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am trying to make progress so I am speeding up my
delivery; I do not mean to confuse the Minister. First, the essence of
my question is, how would the CEO&#146;s office be expected to
encourage participation? By what means would the duty to encourage
participation set out in clause 96 happen? Would there be guidance to
support it? What would be the methodology? The Government must have
looked at that. Secondly, how does that work with the SFA&#146;s
status and role, given that it does not actually deliver the
service?</div><a name="09032433000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000481"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
clarification and apologise for briefly slowing him down. The answer is
that the SFA would increase participation through all that it does. The
structure of the SFA is designed to raise participation: through Train
to Gain, which is currently successful in raising participation for
people at work; through the Adult Advancement and Careers Service and
skills accounts; and through the National Apprenticeship Service and
the National Employer Service. All these gateways of the Skills Funding
Agency are specifically and explicitly designed to drive demand and
raise participation and quality in the skills system. It is through
them that we expect the chief executive to discharge those
duties.</div><a name="09032433000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000482"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I do not want to put words into the
Minister&#146;s mouth, but I would hope that in that endeavour they
will draw on some of the best practice currently abroad, which suggests
a lateral approach because of many of these people&#146;s previous
experience of education. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column507" />Column number: 507</div>I have spoken to people involved in this field. There are any number of
good projects that deal with people who are detained and they employ a
range of methods that I hope would form part of the approach. It is
fine to talk about the standard methodology, and the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s answer was rather generic. What are the plans to
take advantage of existing good practice that is particular to this
field?</div><a name="09032433000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000483"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> To be clear, the clause as drafted refers to all
adults in the entire skills system&#151;</div>
<a name="09032433000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000484"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Including those in
detention?</div><a name="09032433000415"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09032433000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000485"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Yes. My generic answer was about all adults. If the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is specifically on the new themes
associated with offenders and offender learning, I can tell him that we
recently published a hefty response to the PAC and NAO reports in
precisely that area; I assume that he has read them. I do not think
that this is the right time to go into that in great detail, nor do I
think that it belongs on the face of the Bill. The underlying
principle, to the extent to which the legislation refers to adults in
detention, is that as far as possible&#151;it will not always be
perfectly possible&#151;all the opportunities and facilities offered
to the population at large should be offered to those in detention, and
that includes extending to them those facilities that particularly
address their needs, such as embedding skills for life training and
learning into vocational training in construction skills, for example,
in offender
institutions.</div><a name="09032433000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000486"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Let us try a little role play. If I were the
Minister and he were the shadow Minister, would he be comfortable with
my saying, &#147;Given the PAC and NAO reports and our response to
them, we will reinforce what we concluded in that response in the
methodology we now employ to deal with those in detention, drawing on
best practice and using the methods that are necessary to re-engage
those people in education and
training&#148;?</div><a name="09032433000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000487"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> If I were the
Minister&#151;</div><a name="09032433000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000488"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> You are the Minister.</div>
<a name="09032433000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000489"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am not comfortable pretending to be the shadow
Minister. I do not disagree with any of that, but I am not sure that it
takes us terribly far. It is not something to be dealt with today or in
the Bill, and it is not really a matter for guidance. I broadly support
what the hon. Gentleman says, and on that basis I would be grateful if
we could perhaps move
on.</div><a name="09032433000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000490"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I have a brief question and point of clarification
for the Minister. I am concerned about young offenders aged just 19 who
do not have special needs or learning difficulties but who nevertheless
need a lot of support from their home authority. How will the clause
tie in with the need for support from home authorities, which we have
emphasised so strongly, for under-19s, given that there will be some
young people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 508</div>on the cusp, probably quite immature for their age, who might need a
double level of support? Will the Minister address that
concern?</div><a name="09032433000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000491"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The main point to note about offenders aged 18 in
adult custody, with regard to learning, is that if they were in the
non-custodial skills or education systems they would still be treated
as youths, but once they enter the custodial system at 18 they become
adults. However, that is not to say that there should not be a role for
overlapping follow-through from their home authority. I cannot tell the
hon. Lady off the top of my head exactly what role there is, but I will
certainly look into
it.</div><a name="09032433000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000492"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I beg to move amendment 3, in
clause 97, page 58, line 30, leave
out &#145;may&#146; and insert
&#145;must&#146;.</div><a name="09032433000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said to me that
it would not be a Bill Committee if we did not have what appears to be
such a simple amendment&#151;to substitute &#147;must&#148; for
&#147;may&#148;. She is a veteran of these Committees, so she must
be right. Of course, often simply changing one word for another has far
reaching consequences. This amendment is not quite as innocent as it
may seem at first reading.</div>
<a name="09032433000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment is to probe the Government&#146;s intentions for
funding the ambitions behind the Bill&#151;to encourage more people
to enter an apprenticeship&#151;and the ambitions of the individuals
themselves. As has been referred to many times, on the back of the
Leitch report the Government wish to construct a demand-led skills
system that responds to the choices and needs of employers and
individuals. This section of the Bill looks at the choices and needs of
those aged over 19. The amendment is intended to provoke discussion and
a response from the Minister about the Government&#146;s intentions
for funding the choices of over-19s.</div>
<a name="09032433000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we build
on the earlier clauses and the Bill is a success, what happens next? A
young person has received adequate advice and guidance and has
successfully concluded a level 2 apprenticeship by 18 or 19. Then what?
They will want to continue in employment and may want to study in
higher education, but the funding regime for them and their employer is
not as favourable as it was when they were 16 and 18. If the Bill and
the Education and Skills Act 2008, which will raise the leaving age in
2013 to 17 and in 2015 to 18, are successful and many more people stay
on in compulsory education and training until 18, not just because they
have to but because they have achieved level 2 qualifications and want
to do level 3, how will their choices at that juncture in their lives
be met?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div><a name="09032433000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">When an adult
turns 19, the funding arrangements for them and for an employer place a
barrier to progression to a level 3 apprenticeship or another
vocational course. The contribution from the current Learning and
Skills Council is usually only half of that available to a young person
going for a level 2 apprenticeship. It is the position of my party and
of the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings that to get more
employers to offer apprenticeship places to adults, particularly
advanced apprenticeships at level 3, further funding should be made
available to incentivise employers to provide those places. We have
identified broadly the same pot of money as the Train to Gain
programme, which will have more than &#163;1 billion of resources
available to it by 2011.</div>
<a name="09032433000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment, simple as it may seem, is to get an idea from the
Government of what will happen in the funding regime if the Bill and
the building block of the Education and Skills Act 2008 are a success.
How are the aspirations of, and the demands from individuals and
employers, going to be
met?</div><a name="09032433000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000493"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The amendment is important because it sheds light
on a large issue at the heart of the Bill and on the difference between
the Government&#146;s approach and the shared approach of the
Opposition. As the hon. Gentleman elegantly put it, it is about the
nature of the funding regime that will ensue as a result of these
changes. It is not terribly clear what that regime will be. The Bill
establishes a complex structure. It has been described as obscure,
opaque and obtuse, which reflects some of the concerns expressed by
various expert witnesses during the evidence sessions. The amendment is
helpful because it highlights the rather worrying status of the Skills
Funding Agency&#146;s chief executive officer, particularly in terms
of the power that the agency will
wield.</div><a name="09032433000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
many representatives of the further education sector have raised
concerns about that. For example, Graham Moore of the 157 Group told us
during an evidence session that if the
FSA</div><a name="09032433000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
going to be an interventionist structure&#151;and it looks like
one&#151;I do not think it appropriate that it is run from within the
Department. If it is going to operate, I would be happier to see it
with a board, being accountable to the sector and the providers. So,
the structure of the SFA is a missed opportunity, and I would like to
see much more power and action at local level, between local
authorities, providers, employers groups and so on, which is where the
difference has to be
made.&#148;</div><a name="09032433000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman has said, that would be more in tune with the
demand-led system recommended by Lord Leitch, to which the Government
at least pay lip service. It is hard to see how the mantra of a
demand-led system fits with the structure that the Bill will establish.
It is important that the issue is raised now, because in its current
form, the SFA lacks accountability to those it purports to serve and is
extremely complex in the delivery of its
functions.</div><a name="09032433000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Moore also
said:</div><a name="09032433000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
you look at the complexity behind that single voice from the SFA, you
will see that it is about its funding methodology and its rules and
regulations on what you can and cannot do. You are not actually saying,
&#145;We want to make a difference. These are the issues in your
community, and the employers say this and the local authorities say
that.&#146; You try to come to an agreement on how to address the
Government&#146;s priorities in your local area, and I stress that
that is where the difference needs to be made, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>not on a national level.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee, </i>3 March 2009; c. 29-31, Q77 and
85.]</div><a name="09032433000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went
on to say that the system needs to be &#147;relatively simple,
unbureaucratic&#148;, and so on. Furthermore, he was not certain that
a body with 1,800 people was likely to deliver that clarity, simplicity
and
responsiveness.</div><a name="09032433000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister uses this opportunity to say something about
those concerns, because they are being expressed not only by Opposition
parties, but by many of the people whom the Bill will directly affect,
particularly in terms of the FSA&#146;s
powers.</div><a name="09032433000162"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000494"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b><b class="B"> </b>I will speak to the amendment before
responding to some of the points made by hon.
Members.</div><a name="09032433000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
3 would require the chief executive of Skills Funding to secure the
provision of financial resources to the persons listed in clause 97(1),
thereby removing the chief executive&#146;s discretion to decide how
the financial resources will be allocated. Clause 80 provides a power
for the chief executive to secure apprenticeship places for 16 to
18-year-olds and for people aged over 19 but under 25 who are subject
to a learning difficulty assessment. Furthermore, clause 83 imposes an
obligation on the chief executive to exercise that power in order to
secure sufficient apprenticeship places for everyone who wants
one.</div><a name="09032433000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would have some unintended consequences; for example, it
would require the chief executive to fund all those providing, or
proposing to provide, goods or services in connection with the
provision by others of education or training that falls within the
chief executive&#146;s remit, irrespective of the quality of such
goods or services. I am sure that that is not the intention of the hon.
Member for Bristol, West; he would rather, as he has said, raise the
more general question of the funding of adult apprenticeships, and ask
what deductions or inferences can be drawn from the Bill and the
structures in it about the future funding of adult apprenticeships in
particular and apprenticeships as a whole.</div>
<a name="09032433000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
wrong to believe that we are trying to send coded signals of any kind
about any intention to change or reshape the future priorities or
direction of the apprenticeships system. We fund them as we fund them
now&#151;very successfully, and increasingly so year on year. Last
year, at every level and age group, there was an increase and
improvement from the year before&#151;indeed, to a record level. That
is what we intend to continue
doing.</div><a name="09032433000416"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09032433000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bristol, West mentioned his party&#146;s and the
Conservative party&#146;s plan to cut Train to Gain. We think that is
a mistake, because it is an increasingly successful programme that has
high satisfaction rates. In two years&#146; time, there will be 1
million people learning in the workplace, with work-relevant, high
quality learning. A programme that seeks to make progress by cutting
Train to Gain is a mistake for him and for the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings.</div>
<a name="09032433000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The questions
of the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings were more general
still, about the funding formula and funding flow. The SFA will
allocate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>funds according to the purchasing decisions of employers and
individuals, expressed through Train to Gain and skills accounts. The
rates that colleges receive will be based on a national funding
formula, which will reflect delivery costs. That fundamentally is why
it is not just rhetorically, but actually, demand led. We will also
move to a system of accrediting providers who receive public funding,
for overseeing which the SFA will be responsible. Accredited colleges
and providers will be given an overall funding envelope based on track
record, within which they&#151;the providers&#151;will have the
freedom to respond to local employer and individual demand. They will
not be constrained by detailed plans and frequent oversight by the SFA,
as they have been by the
LSC.</div><a name="09032433000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000495"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> As I understood it, the intervention powers of the
LSC will be transferred to the SFA.</div>
<a name="09032433000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000496"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> We are not talking about the intervention powers,
but about the delivery model&#151;not that that is actually what is
before us at present, but as the hon. Gentleman has moved on to that
conversation I am happy to have it as long as you, Mrs.
Humble, permit me.</div>
<a name="09032433000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Review of the
decisions and performance in that funding envelope will be taken up at
regular points during the year; the single account manager&#151;the
single funding interlocutor&#151;will be able to vary the funding
envelope in-year if demand is lower than expected, or if a provider is
underperforming. The process will not be too complex because the
funding will flow in direct response to learner choices, which frees up
providers from being constrained by rigid funding agreements, and
enables them to provide the courses that students and employers want,
rather than the courses that the LSC thinks they want. In return, money
will be routed more quickly to colleges and providers, and be settled
more quickly, because it will be based on real demand, not on complex
planning
decisions.</div><a name="09032433000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000497"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The reason I mentioned intervention powers is that
the LSC and therefore, I assume, the SFA have the ability to adopt or
create performance assessment systems, which could be directly linked
to funding. Perhaps, therefore, the Minister might comment on the 157
Group&#146;s suggestion that the SFA should have been a
non-departmental public body. Was that option considered, particularly
given the fact that the Young Person&#146;s Learning Agency enjoys
that
status?</div><a name="09032433000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000498"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the Minister, I must point out
that we are wandering away from what is a very narrowly drawn
amendment. I must advise members of the Committee that, if they
continue in this fashion, I shall treat the debate as a stand part
debate.</div>
<a name="09032433000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000499"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Thank you, Mrs.
Humble.</div><a name="09032433000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have said this before, but I can tell the hon. Member for South Holland
and The Deepings that we did consider whether the SFA should be a
non-departmental public body or a typical executive agency, which it is
not, or the more unusual body we finally decided on, or whether we
needed to legislate at all, which, strictly speaking, we do not.
Fundamentally, the reason that we decided on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>the body that we now have&#151;as I say, we have covered all this
before&#151;was that we wanted the SFA to be closer to Ministers, as
part of a more streamlined process that gets from policy making to
delivery in colleges and on high streets more quickly, efficiently and
cost-effectively, while retaining some of the distance and operational
independence that is also appropriate for the use of such large sums of
public money.</div>
<a name="09032433000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made an initial point. I would be grateful if he could remind
me of
it.</div><a name="09032433000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000500"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The LSC enjoys intervention powers around
performance and the relationship between funding and performance. When
I intervened on intervention powers, the Minister replied in a way that
suggested that those two things are not associated with one another,
but we know that, in practice, they are. There is close alignment in
the relationship between funding regimes or methods and the powers to
deal with performance in colleges, is there
not?</div><a name="09032433000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000501"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Obviously, there is a relationship and when we say
&#147;demand-led&#148;, that does not mean &#147;quality
neutral&#148;. Yes, the intervention powers transfer to the new body,
as do many of the previous powers of the LSC. The LSC is a body that
evolved over nine years and it was, in many ways, very successful, with
much good practice that we can continue. We are not chucking the baby
out with the bathwater.</div>
<a name="09032433000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000502"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Including the management of the FE capital
budget?</div><a name="09032433000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000503"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> In framework for excellence, we have a single
quality performance management tool for the whole of the 16-plus
environment, and the SFA&#146;s chief executive has explicit powers
on top of that. However, the operational intention is for the process
to be as light-touch and streamlined as possible.</div>
<a name="09032433000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that note,
I still hope that the hon. Member for Bristol, West will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032433000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000504"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I have been listening carefully to what the
Minister said in his responses to me and to the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings, who speaks for the Conservatives.</div>
<a name="09032433000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment, and indeed of many previous amendments, was to see if
a way could be found to make it easier for employers to offer
apprenticeship places. In response to previous amendments, we received
assurances from the Minister, for example that the Government would
foster the creation of group training associations, through the chief
executive of the SFA, to make it easier for small employers in
particular to offer apprenticeship places.</div>
<a name="09032433000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was looking
for an assurance from the Minister that the funding regime might be
amended to make it easier for employers to fund the off-the-job
training costs of an apprenticeship place. It is necessary for me to
clear up a comment that the Minister made about my party&#146;s
policy&#151;the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings, who
speaks for the Conservatives, can defend himself. We are not proposing
to cut the Train to Gain budget. We are simply saying that the future
growth of that budget, which is quite substantial at around 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div>&#163;500 million over the remainder of this comprehensive
spending review period, should be specifically allocated to the funding
of the off-the-job training costs of adult apprenticeships. Rather than
a cut in expenditure, it is more imaginative use of existing budgeted
Government resources, and it is important that we have such debates to
make clear what we each propose.</div>
<a name="09032433000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the
less, it would not be appropriate for a simple amendment to alter
fundamentally the Government&#146;s current budgetary provisions.
That is a matter beyond the Minister&#146;s pay grade, let alone
mine. We look forward to the Budget statement on 22 April to see
whether something more imaginative will come from the Treasury to fund
skills during the difficult economic circumstances that we are
facing.</div>
<a name="09032433000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000505"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I beg to move amendment 136, in
clause 99, page 60, line 20, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) The Chief
Executive must consult with the following when adopting or developing
schemes as set out in subsection
(1)&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) The
YPLA,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) a local education
authority,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c) Ofsted,
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(d) the Quality Assurance
Agency for Higher
Education.&#146;.</div><a name="09032433000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that, when the CEO of the Skills Funding Agency
is adopting or developing a performance assessment scheme, he does so
in conjunction with the YPLA, an LEA, Ofsted and the Quality Assurance
Agency for Higher Education. As we discussed earlier, the CEO of the
Skills Funding Agency is in charge of a large centralised and
relatively unaccountable body. I share the 157 Group&#146;s fears
about that. It suggests strongly in what it describes as its
supplementary evidence to the Committee that the status of the newly
created Skills Funding Agency be formally clarified under the Bill and,
as I have argued, that it should have the same status as the YPLA
rather than being the close-to-Ministers body the Minister described,
which simultaneously is supposed to be decentralised, responsive and
light touch. I am not sure that those things can be reconciled, given
the past experience of how Governments have managed their
affairs.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div><a name="09032433000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 157 Group
was at pains to point out that too much power is being placed in the
hands of Ministers and officials, which is out of line with the
experience at HEFCE and with the proposed status of the YPLA. The
amendment is designed to ensure that even if the SFA must remain within
the Department, it consults closely with other key agencies in the
development and adoption of performance methods and schemes. The
performance schemes are vital when deciding where funding should go
and, as such, are vital to the continuing existence and success of many
education
providers.</div><a name="09032433000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should ensure that every effort is made to see that the performance
schemes are developed with the closest co-operation of the providers,
namely LEAs and the YPLA. It is critical for the vitality of the sector
and to progressing to the light-touch mode that the Government claim
they want to see characterising the new system for the funding and
management of skills.</div>
<a name="09032433000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the 157
Group commented:</div>
<a name="09032433000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
have to remember that the SFA does not actually deliver anything. The
delivery has to be done through the provider network with employers and
so on, which is where you want to put the most resources to ensure that
you can do the maximum to help the
nation.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 31,
Q85.]</div><a name="09032433000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
argued for more power and action at local level with local authorities,
providers and employers. That is central to the Bill and to our
disagreement with the Government. A theme emerges from the analysis and
recommendations of the Leitch report on how the system needs to
change&#151;with much of which we agree&#151;the comments of
witnesses in the evidence sessions of the Committee and other
statements from experts in the field. There is a need to decentralise,
to move to a lighter-touch regime, to be more responsive to demand and
to involve employers at every stage of devising and delivering skills
training. However, time and again, those who have commented on the Bill
have concluded that the Government are at best paying lip service to
that approach, while simultaneously establishing a byzantine
bureaucracy that is frankly unlikely to deliver what they want or the
nation needs. At the very least, the Government should accept the
amendment to ensure that the SFA is consultative, if they must have an
SFA in the proposed form at
all.</div><a name="09032433000417"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000506"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I rise briefly to support the amendment. It is
common sense that consultation should take place with the YPLA and
local education authorities as they are co-funders under the new
arrangements for the provision offered by colleges and other training
providers. It is good practice to consult with other bodies that are
already concerned with quality assurance in higher education, such as
Ofsted and the QAA. The only point that I would add to the amendment is
consultation with representatives who offer a learner&#146;s
perspective on how the quality of the provision offered by colleges and
other providers should be assessed. The National Union of Students or
some other mechanism could be used to ascertain the opinions of
learners of the training courses that are delivered to them. I support
the amendment, but I would add that
point.</div><a name="09032433000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000507"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I do not know whether to deal first with the
amendment or with the concerns of hon. Members, which do not seem to be
exactly the same.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 515</div><a name="09032433000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 136
would place a duty on the chief executive to consult specified
organisations when adopting or developing schemes for the performance
assessment of training or education providers that fall within his
remit. It is similar to amendment 135 in respect of the YPLA, which we
debated last
Tuesday.</div><a name="09032433000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
share two of the concerns. First, we must ensure that the interests of
certain bodies are considered when adopting or developing performance
assessment schemes. That is essential in ensuring that learning
providers are treated fairly and encouraged to take responsibility for
self-assessment and improvement. Secondly, we must encourage the YPLA,
the SFA and others to work together to develop a co-ordinated approach
to performance assessment that keeps the burdens on colleges and other
providers to a minimum. All of that is already happening, as is joint
working.</div><a name="09032433000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the &#147;Raising Expectations&#148; White Paper, we committed to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000508"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> If it is already happening, why not accept the
amendment?</div><a name="09032433000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000509"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> We will not accept the amendment because it would
stop it happening or prevent it from happening as well as it does. If
the hon. Gentleman will give me a moment, I will explain
that.</div><a name="09032433000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department
for Children, Schools and Families are already leading discussions on
the arrangements for performance assessment schemes in the FE sector
after 2010, in consultation with key sector partners. The initial
consultation involved stakeholders including Ofsted, the Association of
Colleges, the Local Government Association and all the main
representative organisations. All that is already going on without a
statutory requirement, and it is neither right nor necessary to put
that level of detail into the Bill. The need for consultation will
inevitably vary. As was the case with the framework for excellence, we
anticipate that the chief executive will need to consult more widely
than just with the organisations listed. Colleges, other providers and
learners are obvious omissions from the list, underlining why it is
considerably more sensible to let the chief executive decide which
bodies to consult, according to the
circumstances.</div><a name="09032433000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
dealt with the amendment, I will now respond to some of the more
general points that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings
has made. He insists on describing the new structure as unaccountable,
even though the chief executive will sit on the DIUS board, be
responsible to the permanent secretary and through him to Ministers,
and be a statutory accounting officer himself, with statutory
responsibilities that are set out in the Bill. The chief executive of
Skills Funding will be very accountable indeed. The hon. Gentleman
tells us that the chief executive is unaccountable and at the same time
that he is too close to Ministers and should be in a non-departmental
public body. He cannot have it both ways. There are pros and cons at
both ends of the argument, and we have found a good
balance.</div><a name="09032433000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also tells us that we need to decentralise, but a
regional tier is fundamental to the new structure, and the ethos of the
new organisation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 516</div>will involve routing funds and delivery down to local level as quickly
and efficiently as possible. He tells us that we need to adopt a light
touch, but that is exactly what we are trying to do, and he keeps
telling us about the byzantine bureaucracy that we are creating. He
does not give any details of that bureaucracy, because there are none.
I have listed more than once the various ways in which, through a
single account manager, single accreditation and single data
collection, we are genuinely slimming down the system and making it
less
bureaucratic.</div><a name="09032433000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will answer the similar point made by the hon. Member for Bristol,
West&#151;he made it twice as I did not fully respond to it the first
time. I do not want to make pronouncements now about future spending
priority decisions, but if he is asking whether we anticipate that a
key driver of the development of the National Apprenticeship Service
will be to make apprenticeships less bureaucratic, easier to access,
and easier for employers and learners, I can say that yes, that is very
much part of what we are trying to do. On that basis, I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment and that we can move
on.</div><a name="09032433000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000510"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> An extraordinary picture is emerging. The Minister
says that it is impossible to desire accountability and at the same
time criticise the closeness of the body to Ministers, as if
accountability to Ministers is the only kind that counts. The 157 Group
talks about public accountability&#151;transparency, in its terms. It
is an extraordinary argument that one cannot say that the body is too
centrally directed and at the same time say that it is unaccountable.
We worry not whether the body is accountable to the Minister and his
hon. Friends in the Ministry, but whether it is accountable to those
who will be affected by its decisions and the powers vested in it. We
know what happened with the LSC and further education colleges. They
are in crisis because Ministers and the people who run the LSC have
made a complete mess of the capital funding system. So, it was not
terribly reassuring when the Minister said that this body will be
tightly controlled and answerable to
Ministers.</div><a name="09032433000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000511"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> On hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point, he cannot
have it both ways. He says that the LSC made a complete mess and that
it is all the fault of the Ministers, but the LSC is a non-departmental
public body, which is considerably further removed. Just a minute ago,
he was telling us that that was what we were doing wrong with the new
structure.</div>
<a name="09032433000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the matter
of accountability, the hon. Gentleman will have to forgive me for
having assumed that he might have some sense of democratic and
parliamentary accountability and that he might put some value on those
concepts. If not, I stand corrected.</div>
<a name="09032433000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000512"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I place tremendous value on democratic and
parliamentary accountability, but we are not confident that this
structure will deliver accountability of that kind. Using the FE
funding crisis as a defence and a way of legitimising the Government
position is, quite frankly, extremely dodgy, given the mess that the
Government, the Ministers responsible, and the LSC are in at the
moment.</div>
<a name="09032433000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000513"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I can only repeat that the hon. Gentleman cannot
have it both ways. The record will show clearly that it is not me who
has been trying to use the FE 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div>capital difficulties to make political points this morning&#151;I have
simply been replying to those that he has been
making.</div>
<a name="09032433000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000514"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I was not accusing the Minister of making political
points about them; I was accusing him of using the relationship between
Ministers and the LSC as a way of legitimising the argument that he
made about the relationship between the SFA and
Ministers.</div>
<a name="09032433000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000515"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> To repeat, it was the hon. Gentleman who used the
example of the current situation with the LSC to try to demonstrate
that the situation, as we plan it, will not work. I simply responded by
saying that he could not have it both ways. It was he who raised it,
not me.</div>
<a name="09032433000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000516"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I must point out that we are moving away
not only from the amendment, but from the clause that is before us. Can
we perhaps return to
both?</div><a name="09032433000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000517"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I do not want to cause the Minister any more
unnecessary pain about a circumstance that he has described publicly,
in the media, in pretty lurid terms, so I shall return to the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09032433000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the tone and content of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s response, I think
that we should press the amendment to a vote. That is not because it
would, if passed, make the clause or the Bill ideal, but because it
would to some degree mitigate the weaknesses inherent in the structure
that the Government are proposing by obliging the kind of consultation
that the Minister says is taking place anyway. The Minister repeatedly
tells us that things do not need to be in the Bill because they are
ipso facto and that things do not need to be in guidance because no
sensible Government would not do them. However, we know that that is
not the history of Governments, and of this Government in
particular.</div>
<a name="09032433000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000518"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a specific
example of that was the award of foundation degree-awarding powers to
FE colleges? In the end, we were both supportive of that, but none the
less had worries about the fact that the Government had not consulted
higher education before making that fundamental transfer of
power.</div><a name="09032433000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000519"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> There have been countless examples, of which that
is one, of the Government proceeding with significant changes without
consulting either Parliament or the sector affected. Assurances about
good will have to be supported by absolute guarantees that that good
will will be reinforced, whoever the Minister happens to be and whoever
is in Government. It might be hard for the Minister to come to terms
with this, but at some stage, someone altogether less agreeable, less
civilised and less generous than he, might occupy his office. On the
other hand, it might be that someone of the opposite persuasion who is
as generous, civilised, tolerant and open-minded, or more, occupies his
office&#151;as I hope to do. However, given that the first
eventuality is at least a possibility, we must ensure that the Bill is
as tightly worded as possible and for that reason, I intend to press
the amendment standing in my name and that of my hon. Friends to a
vote.</div>

service be categorised sectorally? How many employers do the Government

the discussions with the sector skills councils in front of me, but I

about the progress of the Government&#146;s targets and priorities in
connection with post-19 learning, a description of the chief
executive&#146;s learning and skills funding strategy and information
on the application of funding. It will also include information about

138 ensures that, when the chief executive sets up systems for

Member for Bristol, West in relation to my earlier amendment&#151;and
with FE colleges and providers. The amendment is very much in the
spirit of that proposed a few moments ago. I know that the hon.
Gentleman does not think that such things should be in the Bill, and I
appreciate that not everything can be, because of the need for
flexibility, but some of these relationships are fundamental to the
effective operation of the new regime, so in that spirit I have moved

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000537"></a>Mr.

too, whom we would not want to exclude inadvertently. Furthermore, it
may not always be necessary to consult the YPLA and local authorities
in all circumstances, and it would be an unnecessary and bureaucratic
burden on them to do
so.</div><a name="09032433000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question of whom the chief executive consults depends on the nature of
the system to be established&#151;we must give the chief executive
the flexibility to decide, in particular circumstances, who that should
be. Formal consultation mechanisms are already being established. For
example, we are putting in place robust governance arrangements for
IT-enabled systems, involving the chief executive reporting to a joint
DCSF-DIUS board comprising key stakeholder representatives, including
the YPLA, local authority representatives and
others.</div><a name="09032433000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
a customer level, we expect the chief executive to put in place and
operate customer scrutiny groups for each of its key systems. The
groups will include representatives of key stakeholders, customers and
system users. The first of those groups is being established to ensure
that the learner registration service is developed effectively.
Although we think that consultation is best left to the discretion of
the chief executive, if there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div>problem there are already levers in the Bill to ensure that consultation
takes place. Clause 114 requires the chief executive to have regard to
guidance from the Secretary of State, which may include guidance about
consulting learners, employers and other bodies that the Secretary of
State may specify in guidance. In the light of that explanation, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09032433000249"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000539"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> We are racing through the Bill, contrary to the
Minister&#146;s gloomy predictions at the beginning of our
deliberations. However, I take the opportunity again to raise the
matter drawn to the attention of the Committee by the further education
college sector. I refer to the letter from the 157 Group, which it
describes as supplementary evidence to the Committee. I shall quote
from it without addition and
unabridged:</div><a name="09032433000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe there is a potential unintentional gap within the proposed
legislation in guaranteeing funding for adult learners with
disabilities up to the age of 25 where the disability has not been
diagnosed previously while in compulsory education. Further education
colleges recruit a significant number of individuals who have
re-entered education after a diagnosis has been made. We therefore urge
you to revisit this section to ensure that funding and support is
available for these
individuals.&#148;</div><a name="09032433000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister comment on
that?</div><a name="09032433000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000540"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I did not make any gloomy predictions about the
progress that we might make today, and I have every confidence in the
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings sharing my desire to
make steady, appropriate but smart progress. I simply noted that his
optimistic summary of where we had reached to date was not one I could
quite share, although it pained me to diverge from
him.</div><a name="09032433000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000541"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I do not want to be unkind and I certainly do not
want to delay the Committee. I think the hon. Gentleman is a decent
chap who takes advice, so he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column521" />Column number: 521</div>should take heed of remarks by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton. When he does his next Bill&#151;this Bill is
his first as Minister&#151;it is important that he should not table
quite so many Government amendments at such a late stage. I know that
Government thinking moves on, but it is important that they get their
act together before the Bill arrives in Committee. I say that
generously.</div><a name="09032433000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000542"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am glad of the opportunity once again to thank
the hon. Gentleman for his generosity. It has moved me today as it has
on other occasions and no doubt will do so in future. On this occasion,
sadly, I have to remind him that of the 20 hours of debate hitherto,
only 53 minutes have been spent on Government amendments. I do not
propose to detain the Committee any longer on this question.</div>
<a name="09032433000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may go
straight to the heart of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question about
adult learners up to the age of 25 whose learning needs have not been
diagnosed, those are not matters that I should go into in detail here.
Efforts to meet the needs of those groups are central to the aims of
all the bodies involved from 16 to adulthood. We have talked at some
length on previous occasions about the various duties in the
Bill.</div><a name="09032433000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000543"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I do not want to be unkind to the hon. Gentleman,
particularly as he has described me as generous and sagacious, or
whatever the phrase was. What is the 157 Group getting at? Does the
Minister understand? If he does, what is his
response?</div><a name="09032433000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000544"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The chief executive of Skills Funding and the
Skills Funding Agency are best placed to meet the needs of those aged
19 and over with learning difficulties who are not subject to a
learning difficulty assessment under sections 139A and 140 of the
Learning and Skills Act 2000. Clause 111 states that the chief
executive of Skills Funding must, in performing the functions of the
office, have regard to the needs of persons aged 19 or over who have
learning difficulties, as defined in subsection 3, with the exception
of persons aged under 25 who are subject to learning difficulty
assessment. It is significant that we have imposed a specific duty on
the chief executive in relation to those aged 19 or over with learning
difficulties. That continues our policy intent, as expressed in the
annual &#147;Priorities for Success&#148; document from the
Learning and Skills Council, which sets out our expectation that
learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities are made a
priority and that that should be reflected in the provision and support
made available to them.</div>
<a name="09032433000419"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="09032433000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
imposing a specific duty on the chief executive, we have signalled our
intention to ensure that the improvement in participation and
progression of that group of learners will continue to be a priority.
We have virtually doubled the number of learners with learning
difficulties and/or disabilities in the FE system since 2001-02, and in
the past two years, we have spent about &#163;50 million improving
local disability provision, which demonstrates that we are making
learners with all forms of disabilities a priority in the FE system. I
therefore suggest that the concerns of the 157 Group are
unfounded.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000545"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I have a simple question for the Minister that I am
sure he will be able to answer with his usual brevity. What kind of
qualifications would the Secretary of State consider inappropriate for
public funding and therefore exclude under this
clause?</div><a name="09032433000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000546"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> It is not envisaged that that power would need to
be used very often, if at all, but if there was a proposal for a
national vocational qualification in computer hacking, for example, or
something equally inappropriate, that is the kind of thing we do not
think the Government should
fund.</div><a name="09032433000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000547"></a>Mr.

those kind of ethical considerations, rather than a qualitative
judgment on whether a qualification meets appropriate

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000548"></a>Mr.

such as the one I have described, when the Secretary of State feels
that the public interest is not being served. It could also conceivably
relate to value for money, but I stress that it is an exceptional power

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000551"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Now we turn to more meaty matters. The clause gives
the Secretary of State the power to direct the chief executive to use
funding conditions to require a training provider to co-operate with
other training providers or specified bodies. The Secretary of State
may require the chief executive to make it a condition of funding that
the financial resources made available to a specified provider or
providers of education or training must be dependent on requirements to
co-operate with other specified providers or
persons.</div><a name="09032433000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
364 deals with subsection (1)(a)(i) and (ii), which refer to providers
co-operating with a</div>
<a name="09032433000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;specified
provider or providers, or...specified
person&#148;,</div><a name="09032433000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
notably fail to mention the trade employer sector bodies, which is an
important omission. The clause is a technical, but vital, element of
the Bill. Therefore the amendment, although also technical, is
significant. It places a requirement on the chief executive to ensure
that providers work closely with trade employer sector bodies in the
utilisation of funding.</div>
<a name="09032433000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is it
significant? It has been argued time and time again that bodies such as
sector skills councils are crucial in delivering training and also that
employer representatives, such as the British Chambers of Commerce, CBI
and Federation of Small Businesses, are critical to shaping the skills
agenda. Yet we heard from employers in the witness sessions that they
had doubts about whether significant regard had been given to their
role, in the Bill, in doing so. Without a statutory duty to co-operate
with those bodies, providers might miss out on the wealth of experience
that those bodies can bring. In turn, the members of those bodies might
miss out on their chance to be represented in devising and shaping the
delivery of training. It is important, therefore, that we return to the
issue of employer involvement.</div>
<a name="09032433000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
problem with the current regime is that it is insensitive to employer
demand; not entirely insensitive, but certainly too insensitive. For
example, many employers report that they have to retrain people because
the character of the training they have received&#151;perhaps in
technical terms, for example&#151;is not in tune with the needs of
dynamic industries. Advanced economies become increasingly dynamic and
the skills sets required to drive the economy matches that change. It
is critically important that the system is as responsive to employer
needs as possible, so that what is taught and tested matches what is
happening in the
workplace.</div><a name="09032433000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
365 deals with subsection (3), which indicates that providers may work
with the YPLA, LEA or specified bodies of the SFA. The amendment is
designed to ensure that providers are encouraged to network together in
order to deliver education skills to a particular geographical area or
sector. Colleagues will recognise that subsection (3) indicates that
providers can also potentially be asked to co-operate with the SFA, the
YPLA and the LEAs in the delivery of training and education.</div>
<a name="09032433000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
clause is, again, an example of a missed opportunity. The Bill has been
described as that by more than one commentator: one thinks of both the
college sector and National Institute for Adult Continuing Education in
that regard. This time the clause has missed the potential for
providers to get together to deliver educational skills in a certain
part of the country,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div>or a certain market sector. Surely, a clause that emphasises
co-operation should encourage providers to work in networks, in order
to share expertise and experience, as well as providing education to
large areas and large numbers of companies. I reflect, once again, on
the comments made by the hon. Member for Bristol, West&#151;and on my
own remarks&#151;that training associations are at the heart of that
kind of co-operation. The Government have once again&#151;I hesitate
to be too critical, but one must speak frankly&#151;paid lip service
to Group Training Associations. I am not yet convinced that they see
them as central to the business of enabling small employers, in
particular, to make a step change in terms of the quality and quantity
of training that they
provide.</div><a name="09032433000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
365 makes a case for precisely that duty; the duty to share experience
and work across a particular area or sector. Rather than leaving
providers to work with LEAs, which have been criticised in Committee
sittings as bureaucratic and unresponsive, and criticised in witness
sessions for their poor track record of employer engagement, the
amendment seeks to encourage providers to come together, to work
together. It is one method of creating a truly responsive and flexible
skills system and one that works as best it can for employers, learners
and providers. I hope that in that spirit the hon. Gentleman will with
generosity and alacrity accept the
amendments.</div><a name="09032433000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000552"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> In the interests of time, I will just say that I
find the remarks made by the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings compelling and persuasive.</div>
<a name="09032433000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000553"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I do not want to couch my remarks, as the hon.
Gentleman did, in terms that adversely criticise the current
practitioners, many of whom are doing excellent things through tireless
work. Clearly, we would not be embarking on the reforms if we did not
believe that some things could be done better than they currently are.
When he says that the system is currently insensitive to employers, I
think that that is an adverse criticism, the harshness of which I
cannot
support.</div><a name="09032433000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
we want to make the system more sensitive to employers? Is that a
central theme of what we are doing? Certainly it is. We can all share
in that
aim.</div><a name="09032433000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000554"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> For the record, my precise words were &#147;not
entirely insensitive but certainly too
insensitive&#148;.</div><a name="09032433000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000555"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> In a sad lapse from his usual generous spirit, the
hon. Gentleman accused me of paying lip service to GTAs. We are very
keen on developing GTAs and supporting them. We have just announced
&#163;7 million for a new development scheme. They are at the heart
of what the National Apprenticeship Service will be doing to respond to
the downturn. I am glad that he and other Opposition Members share our
commitment.</div><a name="09032433000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Interpretation Act 1978 provides a list of words and expressions and
sets out how they are to be interpreted in any Act, unless a contrary
intention appears. The list includes the word &#147;person&#148;
and provides
that</div><a name="09032433000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;&#147;person&#148;
includes a body of persons corporate or
unincorporate&#148;.&#146;</div>
<a name="09032433000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore the word
&#147;person&#148; in the subsection will encompass a body
already.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 525</div><a name="09032433000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 365
proposes to add &#147;provider networks&#148; to the list of
persons in subsection (3) with whom training providers may be required
to co-operate, for example with regard to the planning and
commissioning of education and training provision within an
area.</div><a name="09032433000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
list at subsection (3) is not exhaustive and there may be a range of
other persons or bodies with whom it would be appropriate for a
provider to co-operate. We certainly support provider networks very
strongly, and the clause is in part intended to give impetus precisely
to such networks. A provider network will comprise a number of
individual providers coming together to, for example, address the needs
of learners, of employers or of a particular sector. The people and
bodies who make up such networks will already fall within the
provisions of subsection (1)(a)(i) or subsection (1)(a)(ii), and as
such it is unnecessary to include a separate reference to them under
subsection
(3).</div><a name="09032433000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members can follow what I am saying. I understand the
points that they are trying to make. I support the thrust of their
arguments. The amendments are not necessary and I hope that they might
be persuaded to withdraw
them.</div><a name="09032433000420"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000571"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 30, in
clause 119, page 69, line 38, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) enables
personal data to be shared between persons to whom this section applies
without first gaining the consent of the individual to whom it
belongs.&#146;.</div><a name="09032433000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is one of the many data-sharing provisions in this Bill and in
other recently introduced legislation. It is ironic that the Government
with the worst track record in safeguarding people&#146;s personal
data is the Government who have spawned more data-sharing legislation
than any other. The clause allows the SFA, the Young People&#146;s
Learning Agency and, as currently drafted, local education authorities
to share information to help them to carry out their duties. The
Government amendment in new clause 20 will remove LEAs from the list of
bodies that can share information under the provision, and that
concession is welcome. However, the new clause, which is in the next
group of amendments, will still allow an LEA to supply information to
the Skills Funding Agency and the YPLA, and vice versa. Therefore, I am
not entirely clear how removing LEAs from the list in subsection (2) of
the new clause really adds to the protection of
data.</div><a name="09032433000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would prevent any of those bodies, including LEAs, from
transferring information about an individual without that
individual&#146;s consent. That is a pretty standard safeguard, and I
cannot envisage that the Minister will have a problem with it. I look
forward to his accepting the
amendment.</div><a name="09032433000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000572"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments that
this Government have a pretty awful record on safeguarding personal
data. They also have a pretty awful record on seeking to ever increase
their own powers on the acquisition of personal data for their own
purposes, and we will return to that in the stand part
debate.</div><a name="09032433000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is specifically concerned with the consent of an individual
to have some control over data that is personal to them. It seems that
it is a fundamental principle that individuals, first of all, consent
to the sharing of that data with a body other than the one that
initially holds it, but they should be clear as to what data may be
shared with another body and for what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 527</div>purposes. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s justification
as to why the data may need to be shared, and what safeguards will be
put in place to ensure that each individual&#146;s privacy is
respected.</div><a name="09032433000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000573"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b> This is my
first contribution today, and it is a pleasure that you,
Mrs. Humble, are back, looking after us in the wonderful way
that you
do.</div><a name="09032433000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will give the chief executive of Skills Funding, the YPLA, LEAs
and people providing services to any of those organisations the power
to share necessary information to fulfil their functions effectively.
That will ensure that as those organisations take over the functions of
the LSC, they will each have access to relevant data to carry out their
functions. The data is currently collected, analysed and used by the
LSC to inform policy and funding decisions and to commission
provisions&#151;in essence, it is the transfer of those powers from
the LSC to its successor
bodies.</div><a name="09032433000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Naturally,
I understand concerns about handling personal information&#151;I
recall with affection the debates that we have had on that particular
issue. All the normal safeguards that one would expect will apply to
the retention and sharing of data under the clause&#151;in
particular, to answer to the hon. Member for Bristol, West, the Data
Protection Act 1998 will apply. When the information is first collected
from individuals, there will be a fair processing notice, which will
make it clear for what purpose their personal data will be used and
with whom they will be
shared.</div><a name="09032433000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the same robust security systems that operate now will
continue to operate in the future. Those systems will meet, as a
minimum, existing Cabinet Office requirements. It is significant that
the main data services function will be carried out by the SFA, which
will become part of the Department for Innovation, Universities and
Skills. As something that is part of a Department, it will be very much
required to fulfil those Cabinet Office requirements. Personal learner
data held securely in databases will, as now, be password protected.
Only individuals who have a justifiable and business reason to access
that data will be able to do so.</div>
<a name="09032433000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would have the effect that the bodies will not be able to share
personal information without the consent of the individual. If we
accepted the amendment&#151;I understand that it is well intentioned,
to secure individual rights and protections&#151;and individuals were
not to give their consent, it would render the aggregated data on the
reports, which the YPLA, the chief executive of Skills Funding and LEAs
must have to perform their functions, next to useless because they
would be
unreliable.</div><a name="09032433000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
order for the chief executive of Skills Funding or the YPLA to be able
to analyse the impact of their policies on learners, they will need to
build up composite models from individuals&#146; data, and, to do
that, they will need to be able to match individual data as it moves
through the system. Matching is only possible if information that could
identify an individual is shared; such data is therefore personal. I
reiterate that, while it is possible to anonymise some of the data to a
certain extent&#151;by removing names, for example&#151;other
aspects of the data are necessary in order to analyse them and answer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 528</div>the parliamentary questions that hon. Members love quite rightly to ask
as part of their scrutiny of the function of government. Those elements
of personal data would allow an individual to be identified, and it is
important that people understand that, although some aspects of the
data could be removed to make them look anonymous, the data would still
be regarded as personal in technical terms. That is why I resist the
amendment.</div><a name="09032433000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000574"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The right hon. Gentleman implies that data sharing
is necessary for research and to analyse the effectiveness of policy.
The clause heading, however, reads, &#147;Sharing of information for
education and training purposes&#148;, which implies that it is meant
to help individuals who are concerned about their own training and
education, and that it is not about Government
research.</div>
<a name="09032433000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000575"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Let me give the hon. Gentleman some other
examples, apart from research, of why data sharing is necessary. On
data flows from the YPLA to the SFA, the information and business
service unit will be located at the SFA, which is where data, in the
broad terms outlined by the clause, need to go to and from. The YPLA
will process the education maintenance allowance grant system, and, in
order to assess how well the EMA works in encouraging individuals to
progress to level 3 in further education colleges, we need to match
recipients of the EMA to those doing level 3 in such colleges. The SFA
therefore needs information, such as a postcode or unique learner
number, which identifies EMA recipients. If the flow of data was not
allowed, or if individuals refused permission for their personal data
to be shared, there is a risk that EMA policy would be based on very
poor data. That is an example of the need for
analysis.</div><a name="09032433000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
data flows from the SFA to the YPLA in relation to an individual, the
individual learner record and the school census data will be held by
the SFA&#146;s data service. The YPLA will secure and monitor
provision for learners with learning difficulties or a disability. That
will be done on an individual learner basis, because it relates to each
learner&#146;s statement of special educational needs, so the YPLA
must have access to personal data as recorded on that statement in
order to provide appropriate provision and support for individuals.
That data will be held by the SFA, and, if the data flow is not
allowed, some people with special needs would not receive appropriate
provision and support to engage in
learning.</div><a name="09032433000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000576"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> But in those circumstances, why would an individual
refuse permission for his or her personal data to be
supplied?</div><a name="09032433000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000577"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
that that might be of advantage to an individual, but the powers are
necessary to help individuals and to inform analysis. I have a series
of examples of such matters. When problems with a local authority
commission cannot be resolved through guidance and support, the YPLA
will be able to consider invoking the powers that we discussed
previously to commission provision and take it away from local
authorities.</div><a name="09032433000422"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09032433000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
such a scenario, the YPLA would need access to the analysis of local
information and trends&#151;where groups of learners may be dropping
out, for example&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 529</div>informed the local authority commissioning plans. While the YPLA would
have access to learner data from the SFA, it would also be important
for it to have access to the local authority data to ensure that the
YPLA could commission appropriate provision on the authority&#146;s
behalf. If the flow was not allowed or was not reliable, the YPLA would
not be able to assess and resolve local difficulties for learners as we
want it to so that the intervention
works.</div><a name="09032433000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000578"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Numbers on the rolls of colleges and schools are not
personal data, but belong to the college or school. Again, there is no
requirement in such circumstances for the information to be supplied.
The Minister&#146;s other examples involve either personal issues, in
which case it benefits the person to supply the information, or
research, which can be based on sampling and market research. All
private sector companies resort to that in carrying out their market
research and research
generally.</div><a name="09032433000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000579"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I simply disagree with the hon. Gentleman that
sampling is sufficient for these purposes. It is hugely important that
information is accurate and based on reality when commissioning the
provision to meet individual learner needs. The situation already
exists; we are not talking about imposing swathes of new powers. We are
talking about replicating what currently exists for the Learning and
Skills Council to ensure that commissioning is accurate and
appropriate.</div><a name="09032433000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would risk the funding and commissioning decisions of all
three organisations being flawed because they might be based on
incomplete or misleading data. Ultimately, the operation of the whole
system would be adversely affected and we would not be able to ensure
that learners get the best possible provision. We cannot accept the
system being impaired so that learners lose out. For that reason, I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, although I am
not
optimistic.</div><a name="09032433000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000580"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I was very disappointed in that response. I intended
the amendment to be probing, but the more answers the Minister gives,
the more concerned I am. It is clear that if information is needed for
an individual&#146;s education, there is no reason why they would not
give permission for the data to be supplied. The Minister gave the
example of a young person with a statement of educational
needs.</div><a name="09032433000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the Minister&#146;s other examples related to high-level aggregated
research to assess the effectiveness of Government policies. I do not
accept the view that personal data must be supplied in those
circumstances. It is precious information about an individual&#146;s
academic record or other matters. It has been given for different
purposes and in some circumstances in confidence. When a tutor or an
institution asks for such information, it is not on the basis that it
will be used for research. The individual is asked for it and wishes to
give it because it is necessary for their interaction with the
agency.</div><a name="09032433000343"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000581"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I will have just one last go by giving another
example. It relates to a data flow from a local authority to skills
funding, in respect of the National Apprenticeship Service. Local
authorities will need data 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div>to identify learners who drop out of apprenticeships in order to support
and re-engage them as appropriate. If an individual has dropped out, it
is not practical to say to them, &#147;Can we share your data because
it is in your best interests for us to re-engage you?&#148; If we
have that information from the outset, it will enable the individual to
be properly
supported.</div><a name="09032433000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000582"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> That all goes back to the debate about data sharing,
which the Minister referred to with affection. It is wrong for
information given for one purpose to be used to enforce a Government
policy, such as participation to the age of 18. I do not believe that
personal information should be used to enforce Government policy in the
way that he has suggested. If an individual does not wish to
participate in or engage with an apprenticeship, with higher learning
or with further education, it is a matter for that individual. It is up
to the state to provide high-quality provision, services and access to
education and training, but if individuals do not wish to access it, it
is not the role of the state to bully and badger them into taking
part.</div><a name="09032433000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000583"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am not talking about bullying and badgering, but
about providing support. If someone has dropped out and become
disengaged, we must be able to support them. We need to know about them
to be able to offer that support. We do not want to bully and badger
them, but to help them to get
on.</div><a name="09032433000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000584"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I agree: the state should provide support, but
whether an individual decides to access that support is, at the end of
the day, up to him or her. The only reason that the Minister wants that
information flow from a local authority to the Skills Funding Agency is
to enable badgering to take
place.</div><a name="09032433000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has not convinced me. I do not believe that the flow of
information is necessary in any of the examples that he has given.
Where it is necessary, it is clear that the individual concerned would
want to give consent because without it he or she would not get the
particular type of education that the statement of educational needs
enabled them to access. The other examples are about either pursuing
Government policy or high-level aggregated research, which can be
conducted in different ways without jeopardising personal information
that is garnered for one particular purpose and should not be used for
another purpose. The state needs to adhere to that important principle
at all times. In the light of the unconvincing response to amendment
30, I intend to test the opinion of the Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000599"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: Government amendment
422</div><a name="09032433000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 20&#151;<i class="I">Sharing of information for education and training
purposes</i><i class="I">.</i></div><a name="09032433000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000600"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> In speaking to amendment 30, I have already set
out the importance of the information sharing powers in clause 119. As
it stands, the clause extends local education authorities&#146;
existing statutory powers to share information with each other. On
reflection it is thought that the existing information-sharing powers
are sufficient for local education authorities&#146; new
responsibilities under the Bill. We do not wish to extend information
sharing gateways where they are not necessary. Hence, new clause 20,
which we propose as a replacement to clause 119 in its entirety,
differs in only two respects. First, local education
authorities&#146; existing statutory powers to share information will
not be widened and, secondly, the new clause clarifies that a</div>
<a name="09032433000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a member of the
Chief Executive&#146;s
staff&#148;</div><a name="09032433000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">includes
those appointed by him as well as those provided to him by the
Secretary of State. That clarity is necessary to provide consistency

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000603"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am still not clear why the new clause takes local
education authorities out of the list of persons to which subsection
(2) of clause 119 applies and replaces it with a smaller list that
omits local education authorities. The two subsequent subsections in
new clause 20 put back the power for LEAs to supply information to the
various bodies. Can the Minister explain the difference between the
provisions of new clause 20 and old clause
119?</div>
<a name="09032433000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000604"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The difference is as I set out. I take it that the
hon. Gentleman is referring to subsection (3), where local authorities
have been taken out of the list. In subsections (4) and (5),
&#147;person&#148; includes local authorities. My understanding is
that allowing local authorities to share information with Skills
Funding and the YPLA is necessary for the information sharing to work.
By removing those organisations from the earlier list, we are excluding
their ability to share information with each other. In essence, we
would regard that as unnecessary. If the situation is different I will
write to the hon. Gentleman, but that is my
understanding.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000605"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Will the Minister deal with the issue of what is
necessary and what is allowable? He said that the measure is about
excluding things that are unnecessary, but both the original clause and
the new clause bar only information that is not allowable in law. That
is not about necessity, but whether something is allowable. For
example, the original clause mentioned information that it would be an
offence to share or when other restrictions would prohibit
disclosure.</div><a name="09032433000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032433000606"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> When I talk about what is necessary, I mean what
is necessary in order for the various LSC successor bodies to be able
to carry out their functions. Such data sharing is necessary for the
LSC, and we are simply transferring that ability to the successor
bodies in response to debate on an earlier
amendment.</div><a name="09032433000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

information held for social security purposes by the Department for
Work and Pensions, so that it can check the validity of applications
for the allowance. The amendment will enable such information to be
passed to the LSC successor bodies so that the existing arrangements
can continue. I hope that the amendment is agreed to in due
