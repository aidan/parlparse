						<a name="07020850000170"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. The clause deal with
directions under clause 24, and mentions financial reserves. Will the
Minister define financial reserves? Does it include schools
balances?</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000171"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> While I wait for inspiration, perhapsI
should explain what the clause seeks to do. The explanatory notes say
that clause 25 is consequential on clause 24 and relates directly to
it. It provides thata direction under clause 24 may provide
that, if an authority seeks to apply financial reserves to reduce its
budget requirement for council tax purposes, consent is not required in
relation to financial
reserves</div>
					<a name="07020850000125"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of a
description specified in the
direction&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07020850000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise, the
direction may provide that consent is unnecessary for application of
financial reserves below a certain amount.</div>
					<a name="07020850000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members will be aware that
school reserves are reserves that belong to the school&#151;that has
been the case since the legislative changes made by the House. Although
the calculation of balances and assets includes school reserves, those
reserves are ring-fenced, so they cannot be accessed for council tax
purposes or, indeed, other purposes outside the remit of the school.
The reason for inclusion is that school reserves are part of public
sector assets and are therefore related to the public sector borrowing
requirement. Many local authorities think that the situation should be
otherwise, but Parliament decided that school balances should be
treated in that way.</div>
					<a name="07020850000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second, related factor is
that of the requirements and guidance of district auditors on what
constitutes a reasonable level of reserves for local authorities, which
varies between authorities, but which a direction under clause 24
cannot overturn. The Secretary of State may decide that consent is not
required for, say, insurance reserves. That is because an authority
might require its insurance reserves to be available for use at any
time and needs to adjust them annually to reflect changing risk costs.
Therefore, it might be appropriate for the authority to budget to use
some of those reserves to reduce the council tax. As a consequence, it
is not possible to say that all reserves are treated exactly the same.
One would have to make a direction in light of the provision that has
just been
made.</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000172"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> I think that I am beginning to understand what I
asked. There may be various reserve funds, and some wriggle room for
the local authority in termsof general day-to-day management
that would presumably be approved in the order. Otherwise, the
authority would have to go back to the Ministry every 10 minutes to
ask, &#147;Can we buy X or Y?&#148; Is that how it would operate?
The term that we used the other day was &#147;financial
envelope&#148;. The Government would specify that an authority could
spend a certain amount, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 200</div>but for anything over that amount the authority would have to go back to
the Secretary of State for permission.</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000173"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The Secretary of State would haveto take
into account the overall situation of local authority reserves, and
therefore of borrowing requirements, and the assessment of the
individual authority. If, for example, a local authority undertook a
one-off public event that required a significant amount of liability to
cover it, it could reduce its reserves and liabilities accordingly.
There are many other examples in which the level of reserves, or rather
the guidance about the level of reserves, would change as a result of
councils&#146; decisions.</div>
					<a name="07020850000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause provides the
Secretary of State with leeway to allow exemptions in some areas, but
the general rule as laid out in previous clauses could not change. The
clause means that the Secretary of State can provide that authorities
do not need to seek consent to apply some particular types of financial
reserves or reserves below a certain amount. Therefore, it gives some
common-sense room for
manoeuvre.</div>

							<a name="07020850000176"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The purpose of the amendment is twofold. First, it
would uphold the principle that activity under the legislation should
not anticipate its passage by the House. Secondly, it would give a
little flexibility to local authorities. During debate on an earlier
clause, we discussed what would happen to those authorities that are in
the process of disposal as a result of the amalgamation of authorities
or a change in the nature of an authority due to the switch from
two-tier to unitary authorities.</div>
					<a name="07020850000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause provides some
flexibility for those authorities that might be in the process of
negotiating contracts. Notwithstanding the fact that the procedure does
not prevent any contracts from being entered into, it does stipulate
that consent must be applied for and given by persons specified under
the Act. Who knows what negotiations authorities are having about their
internal processes? The process of decision making from two-tier to
unitary is going to take some months. As we have discussed, the
proposed timetable has not given some authorities much chance to
prepare for the process, and they could be quite far advanced in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 201</div>
						negotiations. If they are now required to go through
a procedure in which they have to apply for consent, how long will it
take for that consent to be given? Have the Government published what
protocols have to be observed before consent is given? Is there a time
scale for due diligence by the Government or specified persons so that
they can look at contracts and see whether they should be allowed
permission to proceed? What will be the implications if contracts are
not allowed to proceed because the Government take the view that they
are inappropriate? What reference criteria will the person specified
use to make a decision on whether a contract is
appropriate?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000177"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that decision
making has been frozen in the 26 local authorities that have tabled
bids, not simply those authorities whose bids may be subject to
ministerial approval?</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000178"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Nobody knows
which bids will be accepted, but all the authorities are potentially in
a hiatus. I do not know whether the procedure that local
authoritiesare going through requires them to submit to the
Government a list of contracts or potential contracts that they are
negotiating. I do not know whether the Minister has such a
list.</div>
					<a name="07020850000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment Nos.
53 and 54 are not asking for some great spend-up by authorities, but
would provide those authorities with some flexibility to make their own
decisions in the next few months. The authorities know the process
through which they are going, and that they have to prove certain
abilities to the Government if they are to have their bids for unitary
status accepted, so they are hardly likely to be in a position
tomake crass decisions or behave irresponsibly. The amendments
recognise that sense of responsibility and would give authorities the
flexibility to make their own decisions for a period, notwithstanding
the bid procedure.</div>
					<a name="07020850000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments test out what
the Government means by devolution and control. The Government could
take the power and authorities should behave responsibly. However, here
is a situation in which authorities are very likely to behave
responsibly and do the work that they need to do. They do not know what
the future will hold, but for six months or more, they could be in the
position of being unable to make contractual decisions on their own
account. I would therefore argue that there are perfectly valid reasons
why they should be able to carry on, as opposed to having an arbitrary
date forced upon them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000179"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I rise to support amendment No. 53, and to make
the point that the huge majority of local authorities will be careful
and prudent in the face of clause 27. They will not follow the example
of the urban district councils of which the hon. Member for Denton and
Reddish and myself are aware. In the past, those councils sometimes
produced poisoned pills. Bearing that in mind, the Minister may wish to
take a second look at the matter. Effectively, an authority that is
submitting a bid cannot reasonably enter into a contract to, for
instance, start a new school building or trade housing, until it knows
whether it is going to have its bid approved and what its spending
levels will be.</div>

					<a name="07020850000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were the Minister at all tempted

							<a name="07020850000180"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the diligence
he has shown in spotting that, althoughit is not quite as
relevant as he has made out. Ican reassure the hon. Members
for North-East Bedfordshire and for Hazel Grove that the intent and
scope of clause 27 is not as they fear. Both the House and the
Department will have experience of this issue, not only from urban
district councils, but from the wider reorganisations of the early
1970s and the 1990s. Clause 27 is informed by those
experiences.</div>
					<a name="07020850000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
the hon. Member for Lichfield may not have realised how apposite his
comments about the Lichfield mace were. There are provisions in local
government reorganisations that relate to ceremonial issues, and
legislation and direction has been necessary to ensure the protection
of ceremonial assets for the people of an area. If my comments were an
attack on the Lichfield mace, I regret them. I assure the hon.
Gentleman of its safety under this Government and the Bill&#151;just
in case he is tempted to write a press release this weekend.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> My Whip is looking at
me.</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000140"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div>
					<a name="07020850000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 27
provides for circumstances in which only disposals or contracts entered
into by authorities that are to be wound up and that are subject to
directions under clause 24&#151;and only those&#151;would
countfor the purposes of the financial limits set out
inclause 24. The provisions of the Bill became known on 12
December 2006, and when an authority disposes of land or enters into
certain contracts, the clause refers to decisions taken after 31
December that, subsequently, also become subject to the direction under
clause 24. In those cases, the value of the disposals or contracts made
after 31 December will be taken into account in determining whether the
authority has to seek consent for further disposals of land or certain
contracts after the date of the direction. That is the fair point about
which the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire was concerned, and
had his interpretation been correct, I would have agreed with him. It
would have involved an unreasonable burden on a local
authority.</div>
					<a name="07020850000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contracts
that will be caught are those entered into by the authority after 31
December, but before the direction was issued, and are those contracts
with the same person and/or those that relate to the same or similar
description of goods or services. For example, if an authority disposes
of land worth &#163;60,000 on2 January 2007 and subsequently
becomes subject to a direction order under clause 24, and if it then
seeks to dispose of a further piece of land worth, say, &#163;50,000
after the date of the direction, it will need to seek consent for that
further disposal because the value of both transactions is
&#163;110,000, which is more than the &#163;100,000 consideration
limit. Hon. Members can see that we are trying to ensure that, if there
were a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 203</div>vexatious attempt to dispose of assets to jeopardise the sustainability
of the future authority, the clause would deal with that
circumstance.</div>
					<a name="07020850000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
are sensible, common-sense measures. The amendment would wreck the
procedure. However, I would not describe it as a wrecking amendment,
because I genuinely do not believe that that is its purpose, but it is
not just a probing amendment. There is a genuine fear behind what the
hon. Gentleman said. The amendment would amend the date from which any
disposals or contracts entered into would count for the purposes of the
limit set out in clause 24. There are requirements of consent from the
Secretary of State before an authority that is to be dissolved can make
disposals or enter into contracts. The effect of the amendment would be
that councils that are to be wound up would be free to make disposals
or enter into contracts until that time, which could result in those
authorities that are to be abolished acting irresponsibly and purposely
disposing of assets or entering into contracts so as to have a negative
effect on any new authority. The intention of the amendment is met by
the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07020850000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If
I give some more figures, it may help the Committee to understand the
experience that the measure is based on. If an authority were to
dispose of parcels of land or enter into contracts for new arrangements
that were outside the pattern of previous contracting, such issues
would be taken into account. There were many examples from the previous
restructuring round when authorities that were to be wound up acted
irresponsibly. I emphasise that not only did the urban district
councils enter into such
decisions.</div>
					<a name="07020850000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
trying to restrict local authorities from making valid disposals or
entering into necessary contracts, as consent may be given. It is
simply a measure to protect the asset base of future unitary
authorities.</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000181"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I asked about the procedure to be gone through to
obtain consent and how long consent might take in certain
circumstances. Does the Minister have anything to say to the Committee
about that? Can he reassure authorities how quickly decisions can be
taken because some contractual negotiations could have been going on
for some time and the speed of decision could be of the essence? It
will be delayed by the process that he is
describing.</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000182"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Member for Hazel Grove feared that 26
authorities may have their decision making frozen as a result of this
provision. I assure him that that will not be the case because only the
decision on the direction would be affected. We do not know when that
may happen, but it would only be when the direction is in place.
Previous experience shows that, in such a transitionary arrangement,
the Department would be in daily contact with the local authority
concerned. The Bill provides for the provision of information so that
such decisions can be
taken.</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000183"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> I see that the Minister is trying to be helpful,
but I wish to illustrate my point by referring to Northumberland where
a proposal from the county council would effectively get rid of the
districts and a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 204</div>proposal from the districts would effectively get rid of the county
council. It therefore seems likely that the finance and legal officers
in all those authorities would say to their decision takers,
&#147;You need to be aware that the Minister might be issuing a
direction on this particular transaction, and the consequence of that
would be to slow down matters in each authority.&#148; Can he give us
an assurance either now or at a subsequent stage that can lift that
blight? Even now, there will be an inhibition on decision takers in
local authorities who are far more frightened of the Minister than he
realises.</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000184"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I think I can give the assurances that the hon.
Gentleman seeks. I recognise that a balance must be struck Opposition
Members were expressing suspicions and anxieties about the short period
of the window of opportunity. There is a balance to be struck between
having a reasonable time to take decisions, but not too long a period
that will bring about uncertainty in local government decision making.
That affects not only the function of the local authority, but the
employees and personnel within that local authority who have life
decisions to make about their future as a result of the changes. That
is why the matter is so serious. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point was
reasonable.It is one that the trade unions have understandably
made, too.</div>
					<a name="07020850000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Experience
shows that the shadow authority has used the direction in the most
significant number of circumstances. The clause will allow for the
Secretary of State to provide for those powers to the shadow
authorities. That is to ensure that the new authorities work together
in harmony, because there is a period between the decision and the
beginning of the life of the new authority when the districts and
county come together and personnel are being transferred. However, I
shall not comment on what is happening in
Northumberland.</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07020850000185"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): Given that the clause is
effectively retrospective and presuming that the Committee accepts it
today, is the Minister already in discussions with some of the
authorities that have put in for unitary status? To illustrate my
point, the county council in my constituency announced last autumn that
a new school would be built underthe building schools for the
future programme&#151;a&#163;20 million investment in Much
Wenlock that is very welcome. To get that school delivered on time,
contracts will have to be placed in the first six months of this year,
which is precisely the period that is relevant to the Bill. Could I ask
the Minster whether Shropshire county council is already in discussion
with his Department as to whether it will have permission to enter into
that contract? If not, how does he propose to cope with such
circumstances?</div>
					
					<a name="07020850000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000186"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman presents me with two dilemmas.
One is whether to mention his county and the other is that the
Government are restricted as to what they can do in relation to
conversations with authorities that have put in proposals or who are
affected by such proposals. The Government&#146;s policy and position
is to remain neutral and objective so that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 205</div>we are able to judge the proposals against the objective criteria. Let
me, however, give him the reassurance that he seeks.</div>
					<a name="07020850000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision is not
retrospective. It does not make unlawful any action that has been
undertaken prior to the Bill&#146;s enactment, but will allow
decisions taken from 1 January 2007 to be taken into account in the
decision to give a direction and thereby to provide power to the shadow
authority to require consent. It will therefore allow decisions taken
after 1 January on contracts and assets to be taken into account in the
drawing up of those directions, should that be required, on the
evidence of decision-making patterns regarding the disposal of assets
or the entering into contracts.</div>
					<a name="07020850000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know whether the hon.
Gentleman is familiar with the concept of unusual activity that the
banks and the credit card companies use, but let me describe the
situation in layperson&#146;s terms so as not to cause parliamentary
counsel too much concern. In his example, the normal course of business
and the proper undertaking of the duties of that local authority would
not be affected. Therefore we are not trying to restrict local
authorities from making valid disposals or entering into necessary
contracts. Let us remember that consent may well be given. The measure
in the clause simply protects the asset base for the future unitary
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07020850000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
my final point will give some assurance to the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire. If the date were to be amended to the
commencement of this part or any date later than the one specified,
that would increase the amount of time that the authorities that are to
be wound up or that may choose to be so could act irresponsibly. It
would have that perverse effect.I am sure that the Committee
does not want to encourage that. I therefore encourage the hon.
Gentlemen to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07020850000188"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> In the debate on the previous clause, the Minister
referred to a number of contracts and to parcelling that, as Members
may know, takes place when a piece of land is sold in three pieces or a
contract is let under four. I have always inclined towards the cock-up,
rather than the conspiracy, theory, and I know that it is terribly
difficult to define&#151;I know the Bill is trying to do
so&#151;what is part of one contract. I can therefore see a situation
in which an authority might inadvertently be caught up in exceeding the
limits and contravening clause 24 for a worthy cause such as a
children&#146;s home, school or project with a general public
benefit.</div>

					<a name="07020850000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 28 is a
hard clause that makes various actions void. What flexibility will the
Government have if there is a contravention of a direction made under
clause 24? Will contracts automatically be made void, resulting in all
sorts of legal action by the companies that have entered into
agreements with a council, or will the Government have the flexibility
not to implement a direction under clause 24? In other words, will they
nod through a contract that contravenes it as the result of a cock-up
or for a worthy cause, rather than leave a difficult legal jungle in
which a private sector company will be left in limbo, not knowing
whether it will be paid or whom it should
sue?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07020850000189"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman reinforces my view that he is a
decent Conservative, because a decent Conservative believes in the
cock-up theory of life. The former Minister for Higher Education, Lord
Brooke, once said to me that the problem with my lot, by which he meant
the Labour party, was that we believed in conspiracy theory, and the
problem with his party was that they believed in the cock-up theory;
but what I should understand was that they conspired and then cocked
up. I have always remembered that, and I suspect that it is the case
here. Experience shows that there are examples of decisions made
deliberately to jeopardise the good running of a new authority and
shadow authority.</div>
					<a name="07020850000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is not as harsh as it looks, but it is tough. It depends on
clause 24 in the first instance and follows from it, and its meaning is
that any disposal made without consent will be void&#151;it will be
treated under law as if it had never happened. Incidentally, the clause
refers to disposals, not contracts.</div>
					<a name="07020850000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2) provides that
any contract entered into without consent will not be enforceable
against a successor authority, so the contractor will not be able to
sue the successor for payment for work or services. Subsection (4)
provides that a contract entered into without consent will not be
considered a certified contract for the purposes of the Local
Government (Contracts) Act 1997, meaning that the contract cannot
benefit from the protection against legal challenge offered by that
Act. The Secretary of State will ensure that information regarding any
authority that is subject to a direction and the consequences of such a
direction&#151;that is the crucial point&#151;is given wide
publicity, including in the trade press, so that contractors are well
aware that certain authorities will need to gain consent before
entering into
contracts.</div>
					<a name="07020850000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee will bear with me, as it is important to put this on the
record. Subsections (5) and (6) provide that if an authority applies
reserves to reduce its budget requirement for council tax purposes in
breach of the direction, and only in breach of the direction, the
authority will be treated as though it had not made its council tax
calculations as required by the Local Government Finance Act 1992, and
accordingly will not be able to collect council tax.</div>
					<a name="07020850000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Poole is
right: those are tough measures&#151;but they will be available only
within the powers of the direction that we debated earlier. The
measures are designed to ensure that there are consequences for
authorities that choose to breach the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 207</div>terms of the direction&#151;in other words, those that enter into
conspiracies, not cock-ups. The intention is to ensure that authorities
that are going to be wound up do not dispose of valuable land, enter
into long-term contracts, or apply financial reserves above a limit
specified by the Secretary of State, to reduce council tax without
consent, all of which might otherwise have a negative effect on a new
authority and, importantly, on the services available to people in that
area. Essentially, the clause sets out the consequences for authorities
if they do not seek consent either for disposals or before entering
into certain contracts. I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

						</b> The clause allows the Secretary ofState
to amend the amounts that are identified in clause 24(1)&#151;the
amounts above which consent is required for disposal of land or for
certain contracts. Such amendment might be required if, for example,
property prices or land values were to increase markedly. The clause
also allows the Secretary of State to amend the date of 31 December,
which we have discussed. The clause therefore allows the provisions of
the Bill to be amended so that they are more workable&#151;in the
event, for example, that the decision-making process changed for some
reason, perhaps because of the point that the hon. Gentleman
madeon stage 2 of the consultation. It gives the

changed to a later date, not an earlier one. Let me emphasise something
else by way of further reassurance. The date is the date after which
decisions can be taken into account. Neither an authority nor an
official could be held to have acted unlawfully unless the relevant
decision was taken both knowingly and after the date of commencement of
the legislation, following Royal Assent. A change in date might come
about if the Government issued another invitation after a direction
made in the circumstances

Stunell:
						</b> It is important that we make progress today, so I
shall try not to detain the Committee for long.</div>
					<a name="07020850000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group comprises a coherent
set of amendments designed to give local councils the opportunity not
only to switch from one-third or one-half elections to all-out
elections, but to switch back the other way. Although that is rather
intricate, because the proposals are wound so much into this part of
the Bill, hopefully our amendments would allow
that.</div>
					<a name="07020850000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has
talked a great deal about how he is freeing local government and giving
it lots of choices, and about devolutionary government and amazing love
and motherhood government. It is wonderful to hear him talk about that,
but we are trying to coax him a little bit further so that he does not
just give local government the freedom to move in the direction that
the Government would prefer as far as elections go, but allows them the
freedom to go in the other direction if they choose&#151;to have a
reversible process, or one that gives them equal freedom to go in each
direction.</div>
					<a name="07020850000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evidence from the Local Government Association representatives was that
although as individuals they considered that all-out elections were
probably the way ahead, local government as a whole should have the
option to go in the opposite direction. I have been a member of
different authorities that have had both systems of election; we could
rehearsethe advantages and disadvantages at some length.
However, it is not for the Government to decide for local authorities
which of the pros and cons ought to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 210</div>
						take precedence in their decision making. We heard
from Unlock Democracy, which made exactly that point, and, although it
might serve to weaken my case, the Conservative leader of the district
councils made the same point,
too.</div>

					<a name="07020850000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
these matters are of a piece. It would not be profitable to explain in
detail how they all work, but I ask the Government to reconsider the
provision. If the Minister wants to gain a reputation for assisting
local government to deliver effective and representative government, he
ought not to constrain it. In giving authorities the freedom to move to
all-out elections, he ought equally to give them the freedom to move
the other way if they choose to do so. There are things to be said on
both sides; I shall not rehearse all the arguments, but give a few
examples. What some regard as decisive change might be regarded by
others as catastrophic change. Some have commented on the boom and bust
of all-out elections and the remarkable way in which, in the year of
all-out elections, council tax rises tend to be so much lower than in
the other three years. And so the arguments go
on.</div>

							<a name="07020850000201"></a>Alistair

						</b> In those circumstances, councils are only taking a
lead and mirroring the example of the Government, which produces a
council tax rebate in a general election year that mysteriously
disappears the year

Stunell:
						</b> I was tempted to use this place as an analogy,
but I thought that, on the whole, I would steer clear of it. Its
example is neither particularly good nor bad, but the point has been
made. Sometimes, as in 1979 or 1997, there is revolutionary change and
sometimes there is not. In the local government context, where there
are elections by thirds or by halves, the decision takers are always
looking over their shoulder. Ministers sometimes represent that as weak
leadership, but actually it is responsive leadership: representatives
are looking over their shoulder and considering what the public will do
next May. In a representative democracy, what is wrong with that, for
goodness&#146;
sake?</div>
					<a name="07020850000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not saying
that local government should have election by thirds. I am asking the
Committee and the Minister to consider making the second procedure open
to local government, as well as the first one. Of course, on the whole,
leaders in power prefer all-out elections every four years and
oppositions out of power prefer elections every year. Whether the
democracy that results is better or worse, the Minister will not be
able to produce a scrap of evidence to show one thing or the other. It
seems to us that there is every reason to give that freedom to local
authorities, and I trust that the hon. Gentleman will agree to do
so.</div>

							<a name="07020850000203"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> I have to start off by saying that I have always had
a natural sympathy for all-out elections because of their simplicity.
There is a manifesto, people try to carry it out and others make a
judgment. Having 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 211</div>said that, I am totally opposed to the Government specifying solutions
to local government because local tradition and practice are important.
I have sympathy with the argument made by the hon. Member for Hazel
Grove: why force a lever that forces change purely in one way? Choice
about whether electoral systems should be whole, one third or one half
rather than proportional representation should be down to local
government.</div>
					<a name="07020850000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are again trying to make up the mind for local government,
as they do in relation to committee systems and other matters. I hope
that the Minister listens to the debate and reflects on it. We have
heard much about devolution and bottom-up change and, if that really is
the way to go, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment should be
accepted.</div>

						<a name="07020850000204"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Neil Turner</b> (Wigan) (Lab): Hon. Members will see that I
have tabled an amendment similar to that tabled by the hon. Member for
Hazel Grove. To bring some colour back into the cheeks of my hon.
Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford, let me say that I shall
not be supporting the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment. However, I
shall be urging my hon. Friend the Minister to take account of what has
been said.</div>
					<a name="07020850000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We did not
discuss the matter very much during the evidence session, but the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove asked a question, to which the Minister
replied:</div>
					<a name="07020850000137"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Bill allows
the process of change. It is about accountability and transparency for
the electorate and our view is that all-out elections provide that in
the best form.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee
Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill,</i> 1 February
2007; c. 92.]</div>
					<a name="07020850000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
that that is at all relevant to the Bill, which is about putting the
decision-making process as far down the track of democracy as possible.
The view of the Minister on election arrangements is not relevant. On
Tuesday, the Minister
said:</div>
					<a name="07020850000138"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government&#146;s approach is devolutionary. It is for local
authorities to tell us the best solution for their area. The reason for
that, apart from what is apparent, is that the geographies and
economies of local areas are very
different.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee Local
Government and Public involvement in Health Bill,</i> 6 February 2007;
c. 139-140.]</div>
					<a name="07020850000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">He is saying
exactly what the Bill is all about. Its thrust is to push down the
decision-making process as far as possible. I do not think that the
logic of the clause as drafted stacks up in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="07020850000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am making an
assumption about what the Minister will say in response, but one of the
things that may well be said that the Bill is about the provision of
strong leadership. In other words, a four-yearly election gives a
four-year leadership and a clear decision-making process. However, that
does not stack up, either. There are clear sufficient safeguards in the
Bill that will allow for strong leadership in those authorities that
have elections by thirds or by halves. If that were so important, the
Bill should have a clause stating, &#147;Everybody shall go for
all-out elections.&#148; If that is the logic, the Government should
be saying, &#147;Make it
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07020850000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Councils
should not be subject to such provisions. I accept that there should
not be a constant ping-pong whereby there is a four-yearly election,
immediately after which, because a different party gets into power that
likes elections by thirds, there is a change. We could make sure that
that does not happen by having a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 212</div>clause in favour of an arrangement lasting eight years or 12 years. That
seems to me to be correct. The arrangement would have time to bed in;
people would understand the pros and cons, having been able to compare
one type of election against another.</div>
					<a name="07020850000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that this is a
major issue: I cannot see <i class="I">The Times</i> thundering about it, <i class="I">The
Guardian </i>railing against it, or <i class="I">The Daily Telegraph
</i>fulminating on it. I cannot see the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i> saying three
votes good, one vote bordering on autism; or the <i class="I">Daily Express</i>
saying that the issue is part of the great jigsaw of the Diana death
syndrome. I cannot even envisage letters in the &#147;Blagdon
Advertiser&#148; about it. Most people are not that bothered one way
or the other. However, the people of a local authority area should be
able to have election by thirds if they think that is correct. Having a
one-way street goes against the whole flow of the Bill. The Minister
should look against at the provision and allow local authorities the
ability to move in both directions, if they so
wish.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
Gwynne</b> (Denton and Reddish) (Lab): I draw hon.
Members&#146; attention, yet again, to my entry in the Register of
Members&#146; Interests. I support everything that my hon. Friend the
Member for Wigan said. I believe that it should be up to councils to
decide. I should state that I am biased because both the local
authorities in my constituency elect by thirds: Stockport and Tameside
are metropolitan boroughs and so have no option but to do so, but the
system works well in both. If nothing else, it encourages political
activity to take place all year round&#151;or most of the
time&#151;in all of the wards in both boroughs.</div>
					<a name="07020850000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was elected under the system
of thirds in 1996 and in 2000. Owing to the boundary changes of the
wards in Tameside, the 2004 elections were all-out. That coincided with
the European election and an all postal pilot, so the ballot papers
were like Ordnance Survey maps. I ought to be biased in favour of
all-out elections, because not only did I top the poll in my ward, but
I topped the poll out of the 250 candidates for election to the 59
seats in Tameside&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Hear, hear!&#148;]. But I am not biased in favour 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 213</div>of all-out elections. I think that thirds is a preferable system,
because it allows for greater activity, for long-term planning, and
gives more certainty to officers and executive
councillors.</div>

Tameside, but it is important to get back to the standard established
in the Committee of referring to Bedford and Bedfordshire. Although I
agree with the points that have been made about the encouragement that
year-round campaigning provides, there is an issue about continuity of
leadership. It is possible to achieve a perfect solution, which has of
course been done in Bedford: elections by thirds and a directly elected
mayor.</div>
