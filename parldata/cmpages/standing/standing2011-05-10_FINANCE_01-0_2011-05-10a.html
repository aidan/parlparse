experienced the excitement that can often occur in debates on Finance

about to engage will make this a year to be savoured. I am especially
glad to see the right hon. Member for Delyn and the hon. Member for
Bristol East, though I note

to undertake the challenge of serving on the Committee this time. His
absence will be keenly felt on both sides of the Committee. None the

the beginning of the Committee on the previous Finance Bill, I said
that that Bill was a product of consultation and deliberation. That is
truer of this Bill than any before it. We published the majority of
clauses in draft on 9 December for a period of technical consultation
and received more than 200 responses. I thank the bodies that have
worked with the Treasury and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs

draft legislation. The Bill is better for it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000019">&#160;</a>

and on behalf of the Opposition Benches I welcome you to the Chair,
just as we will welcome your colleague, Mr Hood, in due course. Like
the Minister, with whom I seem to have spent a considerable amount of
time in Committee over the past 12 months, I welcome the Clerk and his
team to our discussions. Let me reassure the Minister that although my
hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East and I are the only two shadow
Ministers present, I can say modestly that quality rather than quantity
will keep us on board today. If either of the Minister’s
ministerial colleagues wish to leave the Room at any time, we would be
more than happy for them to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000022">&#160;</a>

                           </div>and 26 schedules. In the past, I recall the then Opposition criticising
the complexity and scale of previous Finance Bills, so it is
interesting to note that the Government have maintained the level of
clauses and schedules in the legislation to be considered by the
Committee. We will make key criticisms of the Bill, and we will table
amendments to key clauses during our discussions. However, the
Opposition are content with the sittings motion and we will support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000023">&#160;</a>

Member for Elmet and Rothwell to enjoy his marriage
and—potentially—help the hon. Members for Bristol West
and for Brecon and Radnorshire to enjoy their divorce from the
coalition in due course. There will be occasions when, by natural
inclination, the Liberal Democrats might be happier supporting the
Labour Opposition than some of the measures in Bill, and we will see if
we can tempt them to do so. In the meantime, I look forward to
commencing the discussion on clause 1. I wish the sittings
motion well, and look forward to spending the next 14 sittings with the

                        <p>By
that stage, I expect the review to have been completed. This matter is
important and the Labour Opposition want to focus on it. It is
important to debate it and to obtain a clear idea of the
Government’s intention and proposals for the 50p rate of tax.
That is in the Bill for consideration and approval today, but the
Chancellor has indicated that he wants to review it in future. An
article in <em>The Daily Telegraph, </em>which I obviously read every day
and which is an important organ of communication to the masses,
indicates that the Chancellor of the Exchequer—it refers to him
as George
Osborne—<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“is
hoping to scrap the 50p top rate of tax in his Budget in 2013, on the
back of evidence that the new higher rate does not make money for the
Exchequer.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000307">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
article, by Andrew Porter, says:<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Chancellor has insisted that the rate is only temporary and he wants to
offer traditional Tory supporters tax cuts well before the next
election.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000308">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the background to the amendment before us. We seek clarity from the
Minister and, through him, from the Chancellor on the review, its
progress, who will be involved, how it will be undertaken, why he seems
to have pre-empted it by saying that he wants to scrap the tax rate by
2013, and on the general merits or demerits of the proposal in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to look at the history of the 50p tax rate to date, and I
hope that you will allow me to do so, Mr Gale, because it is relevant
to our discussion about the clause. Hon. Members will recall that when
my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)
was Chancellor of the Exchequer he said in his pre-Budget statement on
24 November 2008 that it included some measures to raise revenue for
future years. He said that among the options to raise funds, the
fairest should affect those who had done best from the growth in the
previous decade. He indicated that they were those with the highest
incomes who had seen their earnings almost double since 1996 and would
see them rise still further from April 2011, according to his then
predictions. He intended to introduce a new income tax rate of 45% on
incomes of more than £150,000, which would affect only the top
1% of incomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
pre-Budget report at that time indicated that the higher rate of 45%
would be effective from April 2011. It estimated that the 45% rate
would raise around £670 million in 2011-12. At the time,
there was comment and discussion about that. Some commentators believed
that it was a return to the redistributive taxes of the 1970s, some
thought that it would not raise the money that the Chancellor
predicted, and some thought that it was a good and positive
development. The key point was that the Chancellor indicated that the
potential to raise money via a higher rate was available and something
he felt strongly about. The Trades Union Congress—this will
interest my right hon. and hon. Friends—thought that that was a
positive move, and discussions took place across the board with a range
of feedback about the 45p tax
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the 2009 Budget on 22 April 2009, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Edinburgh South West announced two important revisions to the previous
pre-Budget proposals for the rate of taxation. He said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000035">&#160;</a>

help pay for additional support for people now and to invest in the
future, I have decided that the new rate will be 50 per cent., and will
come in from April next year—a year earlier.”

                        <p class="tabbed">The
new income tax rates were set in the 2010 Budget so that from April
2010, a 50% additional rate of tax would apply on incomes above
£150,000. Discussions took place and there was comment across
the board on that proposal. The then Chancellor
believed—rightly, in my view—that those who earn
£150,000 or more should contribute more when we are tackling a
deficit than those on lower incomes. Because of that, the Finance Bill
proceeded with the proposal for a 50p tax
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am pleased to say that because of the election being called, the
Finance Bill was debated in its entirety over three hours on 7 April
2010 with little reference being made by the then Opposition to the new
income tax structure; the Finance Bill was approved; and the new 50p
rate of tax was brought into
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Indeed,
during the general election campaign, the three major parties made no
mention of any changes to the new higher rate of tax. The Conservatives
did not mention it. I think that that was primarily because they did
not want to be seen as the party that was supporting tax cuts for the
richest members of society. I am not sure, but the Liberal Democrats
probably wanted us to tax even more highly. The Labour party went into
that election with the Budget proposals to ensure that we had the 50p
tax rate as a permanent feature of the tax

Gale. The reason why I am talking about 2010 is that we went into the
election campaign with a Finance Bill that had not been contested by
the then Opposition. They did not say that they wished to change the
50p tax rate. There was consensus in the House of Commons that the 50p
tax rate should be introduced in 2010 to help with the deficit and to
ensure that we were all in this together and that it was not the case
that just some people in our community did not pay their
share.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000041">&#160;</a>

purpose in referring back to the comments of my right hon. Friend the
Member for Edinburgh South West and what happened at the end of the
previous Parliament, when we decided to take steps to have a 45p tax
rate and then a 50p tax rate—and the Conservatives did not
oppose the 50p tax rate during the election—is to simply lay the
ground for saying that we have some choices to make on deficit
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000048">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will come
on to those choices in a moment, but the Chancellor has already
announced in his Budget that the 50p rate referred to in clause 1 will
not exist in the future. He has also announced a review but, apart some
very vague information, we know no details yet about how it will be
undertaken, by whom, when, where or why. I will come on to that review
in a moment. The purpose of the amendment is to get clear details of
the review, how it will be undertaken and what steps it will take, so
that we can ensure that it has transparency, clarity, objectives and a
time scale.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000049">&#160;</a>

will go. He has pencilled in a date by which it will
go—2013—but we do not know how that will be done. We need
to know so that Parliament, and those people who take an interest in
these matters outside Parliament, can scrutinise that process. I am
grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention because he has

so important. We need to understand exactly why the Government want to
take such an approach, and the timing should be about good financial

There are several issues that we need to explore and I hope that my
hon. Friends will assist later in doing so. One issue is the timing of
the review. The Chancellor in his Budget speech on 23 March confirmed
that there will be no change in the rates of income tax for the coming
year. That fact is reflected in clause 1. However, he suggested that
the case for the 50p rate should be re-examined once we have
comprehensive data on the amounts of money it has actually raised for
the Exchequer in its first year. That is perfectly reasonable, and I
give the Chancellor the benefit of the doubt on that. It is reasonable
that we consider the level of resources that the 50p rate raises. But
as a result of spin to the papers, the headlines on the same Budget
speech discussions stated: “George Osborne: 50p rate could be
scrapped by 2013.” Already we have an indication that the
direction of travel is to scrap the 50p rate by 2013, probably 18
months before an election. Is that about an election win, deficit
management or income generation? Or is that simply about the fact that
the Chancellor is not clear about what the review consider, when, how,
by whom and where. That is why we have tabled the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000052">&#160;</a>

that. Labour Front Benchers have a very clear position: we support the

Chancellor has said that he wants a review of the 50p rate to be

has not been clear about how, where, when and for what purpose. In due
course, I will explain the challenges that will also be faced by ending
the 50p rate. We already know the direction of travel. In answer to my
parliamentary question on 26 April 2011 and to that of my hon. Friend

rate until such time as he decides that he does not want to have it. He
will base the rate—going back to the point made by the hon.
Member for Elmet and Rothwell—on evidence-based decision making
on the level of income that the tax raises. I fear that that is not
evidence-based policy making at all, but dogma-based policy making on

have thought that the hon. Gentleman appreciated it as well. At the
moment, we have some 275,000 50p top-rate taxpayers who do not know
whether they will pay that top rate of tax for one, two, three or four
years—for the duration of this Parliament. The review that has
been thrown on to the table has no clarity about its terms of
reference, objectives or time scale. The Chancellor and the Minister
have said that the tax rate is damaging. We could have a
self-fulfilling prophecy of people deferring and fiddling around with
various taxes to ensure that they do not pay the 50p tax rate over the
next two years.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000059">&#160;</a>

many issues that are creating a vacuum. Will the Minister clarify a
number of simple points? If he announces to the House of Commons, as
the Chancellor of the Exchequer has done, that a review will be
undertaken by HMRC, it is incumbent on him to say to the House,
“This is the time scale. This is who will undertake it. This is
when it will report. This is how you put evidence into it. This is when
we will make a decision for a future Budget on whether that 50p tax

return to shortly. All the Budget proposals by Treasury
Ministers—and the Opposition—are about choices. They have
to choose which taxes to raise and which to leave. We are told that we
are all in this together, and we are told that there is a deficit that
needs to be tackled. There certainly is a deficit that needs to be
tackled—let us not shy away from that. We can have a wider
debate on that at some point if you wish, Mr Gale, but the key point is
this: what choices are the Government making to tackle that
deficit?<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000062">&#160;</a>

year, in clause 1, the Government support a 50p tax rate that will
raise some money. I would welcome the Minister’s latest estimate
of how much money that will raise. In future years, however, they are
creating that vacuum. One Government option under review is to reduce
the tax rate to 40p while, at the same time, raising other taxes that
will hit other people in our society in a different way. From answers
to written questions that I have tabled, we think that that option will
do lasting damage. The Government are making a political choice, which
we need to explore before we give our support, or otherwise, to the

point, ultimately—this is why it is important to set out a
formal review of procedures—is that I need to know exactly how,
when and where the Government are establishing that review on the tax

we should reduce the tax rate to 40% and, if so, on what
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000065">&#160;</a>

eligible for the additional rate of tax at this rate. The point I am
making, and the only reason I make those points about the regional
areas, is that in the north-west, where 18,000 people pay the
additional rate of tax, there are some 3.2 million taxpayers. In the
eastern region, where 34,000 people pay the additional rate of tax,
there are fewer taxpayers across the board. There are fewer higher rate
taxpayers in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for
Wirral South, and for Sefton Central than in the eastern region where
there are fewer taxpayers as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000075">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Financial
Secretary may smirk, but the point is quite simple. This is a choice.
If the tax cut goes ahead in 2013, it will give a tax cut to more
people in the east than in the north-west. We are clearly not all in
this together. <em>[</em>

not like the point, but in the constituency of my hon. Friend the
Member for Gateshead, 5,000 people pay the additional rate of tax out
of a population of 1.2 million. In the south-east, 67,000 people will
pay out of a population of just over 4 million. More people pay it
because there

                           </strong> The former Prime Minister had enough confidence in
me to make me a Minister for 11 of his 12 years in office.
The next Prime Minister had enough confidence in me to make me a

well aware of my views on these matters as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000078">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The simple
point I am making to the Minister is that we are talking about a
political choice. Ultimately if the choice is made to reduce the 50p
rate to 40p—we do not yet know when, where and how, which is the
purpose of the amendment—the benefits of the reduction will be
felt more strongly in London, the south-east and the east than in
Scotland, Wales, the north-west, the east midlands, the west midlands
and Northern Ireland. That may not be a politically palatable point for
some Government Members, but if we are all in this together, the tax
cut choice that is potentially being made by the Government for future
years will disproportionately benefit people in certain regions. We
happen to represent around the room today, with the honourable
exception of my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow, regions that
will be disproportionately hit by that tax
cut.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000079">&#160;</a>

do not have constituency figures. I wish I did, but the Library cannot
provide them. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow
will have fewer of the 94,000 higher additional rate taxpayers in
London in her constituency than there are in the constituency of the
Cities of London and Westminster, where we are today. I am only
guessing but I might be correct, and I hope that my hon. Friend will
concur. The point I am making, which is valid for all our arguments, is
that if we are to have a review that looks at the income that will be
lost or gained by this tax progressing for the next few years, it
should also look at the impact on regional disparities and at the other
taxation that might have to rise to meet the Government’s
deficit reduction plan and which will hit people disproportionately
across all regions of the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000080">&#160;</a>

argument incredible. First, to make a serious point, the Government
have introduced plans that differentiate between different regions to
provide a stimulus for business and to try and move business
populations, apart from that in the south-east, to other parts of the
country. Secondly, however, I will follow the right hon.
Gentleman’s argument and give a spurious analogy. As there are
more Manchester United fans in Surrey than elsewhere, if Manchester
United were given a 10 point reduction, it would affect more people in
Surrey than in Manchester. That is a nonsensical argument. The right
hon. Gentleman cannot seriously suggest that, in order

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. He needs
to recognise that, as of today and, indeed, under clause 1, we have a
proposal for a 50p tax rate that applies across the whole of the United
Kingdom. I support that, and, although I would not want to speak for
them, I suspect that all my hon. Friends support that, too. Indeed, the
Government support that, because it is in clause 1. However, according
to the Chancellor, we are going to abolish the 50p tax rate in 2013. We
do not yet know, which is why we have tabled the amendment, how much
that has been considered, but we believe that he wants to abolish it in
2013. The simple point that I am making is that, when the tax rate
falls from 50p to 40p, the benefits of the reduction in taxation will
be disproportionately spread across the United Kingdom. There will be
people in London, the south-east and the east who will get more benefit
from that tax cut than in the north-east, Yorkshire, Scotland, Wales
and other regions that are represented across the Committee
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000082">&#160;</a>

looking at this issue in the round. I am simply saying that that is one
option in 2013 that could have a disproportionate effect. We want to
see the evidence, which is why I hope that the hon. Lady will support
my proposal, because it says that we should have terms of reference, a
timetable for the review and updates to Parliament on progress. In that
way we can see what the HMRC revenues are and what progress is being
made, and we can make a judgment based on revenue rather than what we
appear to have already, which is dogma. I refer again to the article in
<em>The</em> 
                           <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, which
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000084">&#160;</a>

that is the case, let him say so. Let him just ditch the review and
just do it. If the review is evidence based, however, as the hon. Lady
seems to want it to be, she should support the amendment, so that we
can see what the evidence is, so that we can monitor it and so that it
is not just a case of a rabbit being pulled out of the hat in the 2013
Budget that says, “Here’s a tax cut of 10p in the pound
to the top 275,000 taxpayers, which predominantly goes to London, the
south-east and the east.” That is my point, and I hope that the

that those who work between 16 and 29 hours will lose £1,300;
child benefit will be frozen, which will cost about £100 to
£240 across the board, and it will be abolished for higher rate
families in 2013; benefits and tax credits will rise according to the

suggest a review with a timetable and terms of reference so that the
matter can be considered in detail. For the hon. Member for
Staffordshire Moorlands, we suggest making it evidence-based rather
than basing it on dogma. We suggest considering all these points
clearly, because in 2013 there will be severe challenges to the living
standards of many people on middle and low incomes. However, people on
higher incomes—there are only 275,000 of them—will find
themselves paying less tax; they will pay 10p in the pound less on the
additional rate, and the Chancellor has indicated that he wants to do
that now. What is the point of having a review over the next three
years if the Chancellor has already said what he wants to do? The
purpose of the amendment is to put some framework to that review, so
that we can track it, possibly in a productive

ensure that those who were able to bear the burden fairly did so, and
people on £150,000 and more are in a position to bear some of
the burden much more ably than those on lower incomes. If the hon.

what will happen as a result of tax changes? That is why the Government
should hold a review to consider all the evidence. If there is evidence
of people deliberately avoiding paying the 50% rate, it should be
considered but, as we heard, hard-pressed families across the country
face massive cuts, and it would be wrong of the Chancellor to press
ahead without considering what the impact will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000094">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That brings us back to the amendment, which is
about terms of reference, the timetable and updates to Parliament. I am
concerned to ensure that we take an evidence-based approach. I give
credit to the hon. Member for Staffordshire Moorlands for this, but
information may ultimately show that we do not gain revenue through the
50p but lose it. I do not know whether that is true, but I want to know
how and when the assessment will be made. I also want to ensure that we
do not have what is effectively a three-year vacuum, in which
individuals do not know what the position is and can make alternative
tax arrangements or look elsewhere. It is important that we have
clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is
important for two other reasons. I shall refer first to that august
organ of the media, <em>The Guardian</em>, which on every occasion is
accurate and factual in its reporting. On Sunday 27 March 2011, it ran
the headline, “Cable confirms ending of 50p tax rate”.
That was very helpful. Again, forget the evidence, forget the
discussions during the next three years, forget the review and the
points about whether that policy raises or does not raise money. The
Business Secretary “confirms ending of 50p tax rate”.
Interestingly, the headline goes on to say, “and reveals
‘mansion tax’ plans.” The article says:<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
business secretary, Vince Cable, has confirmed the 50p rate on tax will

abolished”.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
article does not say “may”, “could”,
“possibly” or “on evidence”. It says the
rate “will be abolished”. It goes on to say that
he<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000097">&#160;</a>

am I not to believe the Business Secretary, a key member of the
Government and a key supporter of the Exchequer Secretary? Who am I not

presumably it “will be abolished”. If he says that it
“will be abolished” and the Government are

is generous in giving way. It is helpful of him to make the point that
the Government are clearly thinking about different tax proposals. A
moment ago, he referred to the regional variations in the impact of the
higher rate. Does he agree that the terms of reference should include,
for example, the impact of VAT, which has hit hardest many of those in
the poorest and lower to middle-income families in some of the
constituencies that Labour Members represent? It would be helpful if
the terms of reference were debated fully, so that we have the
opportunity to make those sorts of points.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000101">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because he makes
an interesting point. The terms of reference for the abolition of the

principle.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The terms of
reference should also consider whether a choice is made between that
tax and other taxes, assessing whatever level of income it raises
versus that raised by other taxation. There should also be an
assessment of how that tax impacts on sectors of our community. I have
talked about regions. Not all of the London region, the south-east
region and the east region is wealthy and prosperous. There are a range
of options to be chosen by the Government when it comes to

the Member for Sefton Central said, and that the murmurings we have

this as a matter of dogma, rather than as a question, as our amendment

about evidence. The purpose of the amendment is to ask for clarity. We
are not asking for very much. I am asking for the review’s terms
of reference and timetable, and for updates to be given to Parliament.
We are not saying to the Minister, “Make a decision.” We
are simply asking, “On what basis are you making the decision?
Over what time scale are you making it? Who is advising you about it?
Are you taking into account the information that the hon. Member for
Staffordshire Moorlands was so helpful in bringing to the table? Are
you taking into account the points that my hon. Friend the Member for

when he emphasises the need for transparency. It is quite proper to
speculate about what might happen. We have heard much of that in the
debate so far today. However, at the end of March the Deputy Prime
Minister said that a modified version of the mansion tax would be
introduced—I am quoting from <em>The Daily
Telegraph</em>—<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000113">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That plays into this
debate. The Deputy Prime Minister said that it would be a different
sort of mansion tax from the one that was promised before the election.
That emphasises again the importance of being clear about how this
review is taking place. There is speculation

the mansion tax is being considered as part of the terms of the review
of the abolition of the 50p rate. Two Liberal Democrat
Members—the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnorshire and for
Bristol West—are present in Committee today. Perhaps they can
help. I would be happy to take an intervention from them on whether
they believe that the mansion tax is a better way of ensuring that the
richest people in the community “pay their way.” Do they
see that proposal as a replacement for the 50p
rate?<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000119">&#160;</a>

the terms of reference include a discussion about things such as the
mansion tax? I do not know. The Business Secretary is indicating that
the issue is on the table. He is saying that, if the 50p rate is
removed, it should be replaced by the mansion tax. On a point of
clarity, I am not sure whether we would support such a tax. It has its
attractions in some parts, but I do not think that it would be
workable, feasible or practical. I do not think that the Liberal
Democrats think it would be either, which is why they turfed the policy
overboard previously. <em>[</em>

of the Office for Budget Responsibility, whose terms of reference

                        <p class="tabbed">Why
has the Chancellor not submitted the review of the proposed tax change
in 2013 to the OBR? It is an organ of Government that is independent
and designed to look at such matters in a fair and effective way. I do
not understand why he has asked HMRC to conduct the review. Does he
anticipate—this goes to the heart of the amendment—that
the information from HMRC will be public, will be shared with the OBR,
and will be open to public scrutiny in the House of Commons and
elsewhere? I am at a loss as to why HMRC is doing the review—we
do not know any of its other details—when the OBR has been
established for that very
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
will the Exchequer Secretary ensure that, between now and 2013, there
is transparency, with external scrutiny, and that information is
publicly available? What public information on the progress of the
review during the two and a half years does he expect? What
instructions have Treasury Ministers given to HMRC, or to any other
agent of the Government, about the review and the team carrying out the
review? When will they report and to whom? Will an interim report be
made public? Are there really no formal terms of reference for the
review? If there are, why does not the Exchequer Secretary simply
publish them as per the amendment before us today? Will the Treasury,
the OBR and HMRC assess behavioural responses that will lead to changes
in other taxes, owing to the 50p rate? The measure cannot be seen in
isolation, as my hon. Friends have pointed
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000128">&#160;</a>

make no comment other than to put it on the record that, on 22
February, Duncan Weldon, a<em> Guardian</em> writer on economics,
indicated that he believes the 50p tax rate is paying
dividends:<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000129">&#160;</a>

otherwise of the 50p rate in relation to the level of taxation that it

                           </div>bringing in. That would answer the point made by the hon. Member for

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not wish to detain the Committee for ever on these points, but it is
important that we get some answers from the Exchequer Secretary about
the long-term plan for this particular taxation proposal. When we come
to the clause stand part debate shortly, we will be asked to endorse
the 50p tax rate for this year. Therefore, the Minister must believe
that the 50p tax rate is raising money this year, or he would ask us to
reject it now. We are being asked to accept that it will be in
existence for the next 12 months. Although we have heard it from the
Chancellor only in a throwaway comment in the Budget statement, we are
being asked to accept that there will be a review. We need to know very
clearly the terms of that review. We need to know who can contribute to
that review and on what basis the Exchequer Secretary will make
decisions in
2013.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Exchequer Secretary justify why he has already apparently set out
his stall in favour of the abolition of the 50p rate in 2013,
irrespective of the evidence, by saying that it should not be a
long-term tax, that it is damaging to the economy and does not raise
income? He seems to be facing both ways at once in trying to kick it
long to show that he is being fair in making an assessment, while at
the same time sending a signal out to everyone that he wishes to
abolish the tax and have the 40p rate for all. That links back to the
points that I made earlier. Such a choice potentially has a
differential impact on incomes across the United Kingdom. That choice
is being made at a time when we are making other difficult choices that
are hitting a range of people across the UK in different ways. In my
view, the choice should be made on the principle of evidence. We
strongly believe that we can raise money from this tax and that it
should be in place for the duration of this Parliament. We will look at
the evidence and make a judgment for the next Parliament on the basis
of that information. The Exchequer Secretary has done the opposite. He
has said he does not believe that this is a fair tax or that it is
right to have it, and he will try to concoct a review, about which we
know little, to justify that in retrospect and to move to abolition in
2013.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
clear division between the Government and the Opposition, and I hope we
will be able to explore it in some detail. For these purposes, however,
I hope that the Exchequer Secretary will accept the amendment, which
makes no judgment on the 50p tax rate, but simply says, “Publish
the terms of reference and the time scale and make sure we do not have
a vacuum on these important
issues.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000135">&#160;</a>

to see how much the additional rate actually raises. HMRC will look at

                        <p class="tabbed">To answer one
of the right hon. Gentleman’s questions, HMRC is undertaking the
review because it is important that all the information available on
the 50% rate is considered, and only HMRC can analyse individual
self-assessment returns, because they contain confidential taxpayer
information. That is why HMRC has been asked to perform this
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In looking at
the issue, HMRC’s main challenge will be to isolate the impact
of the additional rate from other factors. In light of that, it will
conclude its analysis as soon as it is practical to do so. Its findings
will then be used to inform the Government’s
wider thinking on taxation policy, with any
announcements made by the Chancellor as part of the annual Budget
process in the usual
manner.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, the Government keep all taxes under review and reserve the
right to announce changes at the appropriate time. Indeed, tax changes
are generally made at Budgets. Given that, there is no reason to accept
the amendment, and I ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me also say a word or two about transparency. It has to be acknowledged
that the Government have substantially increased the transparency of
the Budget forecasting process with the introduction of Office for
Budget Responsibility. We have ensured that independent outside experts
can make assessments of the forecasts and projections in the Budget. We
have made substantial advances in that respect, and the OBR will be
involved in future Budgets, ensuring that projections are as accurate
as possible by providing some independent analysis. There has,
therefore, already been a substantial increase in
transparency.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given your
strictures, Mr Gale, perhaps I can say a word or two about clause 1
generally. The Government are committed to creating a fairer tax system
that provides greater reward for work and aspiration while supporting
the public finances. This year will see the largest ever
increase—£1,000—in the personal allowance, which
is introduced in clause 3, to which we will turn shortly. That
represents the first step in our commitment to increase the personal
allowance to £10,000 and will remove more than 800,000 people
from income tax
altogether.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000144">&#160;</a>

different conditions in different parts of the country. Not long ago,
in our debates on the National Insurance Contributions Bill, in which
we proposed an employers’ holiday for some parts of the UK and
not for others, the Opposition argued that we should apply it to every
part of the country. We therefore recognise that different parts of the

back to the 50% rate in the context of the clause, we believe that now

people are increasingly mobile, our income tax system must be
internationally competitive. High tax rates send a negative signal to
individuals and businesses that are looking to work and invest in the

damage to the UK’s economy if it became

when the 50% rate was introduced. The Chancellor announced in the
Budget that HMRC will review those projections and the information that
had come in. Clearly, there was considerable uncertainty about the
projections made under the previous Government. I am not saying that
they were made in bad faith, by any means. I think that they were done
in good faith, but there is clearly a range of views. Some economists
argue that the rate could be a lot less; some argue that it could be a
lot
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000156">&#160;</a>

fact is that there is uncertainty about the behavioural impacts of the
50p rate, such as to what extent it will increase tax avoidance, to
what extent it will mean more people leaving the UK or not entering the
UK and to what extent it will result in people retiring earlier.
Significant questions can be asked. Indeed, if we were to consider a
purely static analysis of the 50% rate, we would get three times the
amount projected by the previous Government. However, within the
figures is the assumption that there will be considerable behavioural
changes, but when there are assumptions on such a scale, there is
considerable uncertainty, which is why we want to look at the data when
they come in—a task that HMRC will
perform.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000157">&#160;</a>

again the reasons for keeping the 50p tax rate. He did not say whether
he agreed with the Chancellor’s saying that it was about
fairness and that those on much lower incomes were making sacrifices.
Equally, is the rate being kept to help with deficit reduction or not?
My third point ties in with what my right hon. Friend the Member for
Delyn said: is it not better to analyse the likely impact before making
decisions rather than leaving the matter uncertain? From what the hon.

the data early in 2012, which is exactly what it will do. The fact is
that tax decisions are announced in Budgets. Decisions about the 50p
rate will be announced in a Budget, and that will be informed by
HMRC’s analysis, as the Chancellor outlined in his Budget
speech, and which I am reiterating today. The amendment would not add
anything. I urge the right hon. Member for Delyn to withdraw it, and I
urge my hon. Friends to reject it should he press it to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000161">&#160;</a>

want to stress that the 50p rate is a temporary measure and it could be
damaging. That is not a particularly “ideological”
position—I think that was the word the right hon. Member for
Delyn used—after all, it is consistent with the position that
the Labour party took in 1997, 2001 and 2005, although it did not
maintain that manifesto position after the 2005 general election; I
recognise that it took a different position in 2010. Some Labour
Members may notice what 1997, 2001 and 2005 have in common compared
with 2010 as far as their party is concerned, and I will let them draw
their own conclusions. It seems to me that a party that does not
recognise the need for the UK to have a competitive tax system is not
doing itself any favours.</p>

moment in which everyone has to make considerable sacrifices due to the
state of the public finances left by the Labour Government. We
recognise that, and in these circumstances, we are not rushing to
remove the additional rate of income tax. We want to explore the facts
further and how much revenue it is raising, but in the longer term, in
a globalised world in which it is more important than ever that the UK
is competitive, a 50p tax rate, which is higher than that of most of
our competitors, clearly puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Were we
to signal that it was permanent, which I think is the Labour
party’s position, it would not do the UK any favours as we go
around trying to attract businesses to invest in the UK and to get the

                           </div>thoughts on damaging family income? I wrote to the Treasury when the
announcement was made about cutting child benefit to highlight the many
families in my constituency in Walthamstow who, by dint of London
weighting, found themselves tipping into the higher income bracket. If
they had two or three children, they lost £3,000 or
£4,000 a year. I wrote to ask whether, if the measure was just
about addressing the deficit, the Government would commit to reviewing
it in 2015. I got no response to that, yet the Government are making a
clear commitment on the 50p tax rate due to the damage it might do to
Britain’s competitiveness. Will the Exchequer Secretary make a
statement to the Committee about the impact of the damage that the cut
in child benefit is doing to families in places such as Walthamstow and
other areas of London? Given the case he makes today, will the
Government also review the cut?<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000164">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not want to test your patience at any great
length, Mr Gale, but the decision on child benefit will affect
households in the highest 20% of income. We recognise that it is a
tough decision; it is an example of the tough decisions that we have to
make due to the state of the public finances. The hon. Lady is
perfectly entitled to make her case, although I worry that the right
hon. Member for Delyn will argue that there are fewer higher rate
taxpayers in other parts of the country compared with London, so were
we to change our policy, it would favour London and the south-east over
the rest of the UK. I wait to hear that
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000165">&#160;</a>

Walthamstow I am talking about are, for example, bendy bus drivers,
who, because of London weighting, find themselves just tipping over
into that category by £1,000 or £2,000. Will the
Exchequer Secretary confirm that the Government care more for the
people they might attract from overseas? The 50% tax rate might affect
bankers, but it also affects bendy bus drivers and nurses working
overtime in our NHS who live in London and find themselves tipping into
that category. Let us be clear about the Government’s
priorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000167">&#160;</a>

reduce the deficit, which means making some tough decisions. If the 50p
rate becomes a permanent part of our tax environment, in the long-term
it would, at the very least, damage our competitiveness and we would
raise less in tax. If we have an uncompetitive tax system that drives
businesses and high earners out of the UK, we would have less to spend
on public services and on child benefit. That is a simple economic
lesson that needs to be relearned from time to time, but it remains a
fact of

dynamic impact of the changes on child benefit will be considerable, we
are not persuaded by that. We do not think that the evidence supports
that. A lot of evidence suggests that a marginal rate of 50% on high
earners is more likely to have a behavioural
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000171">&#160;</a>

evidence will come to light as a consequence of the self-assessment

seems right that any decisions on additional rates should be informed
by that analysis, although it is clear that over the longer-term a
permanent tax rate of 50% would be damaging. Any decisions on the
additional rates would be made in a Budget and legislated for in a
subsequent Finance Bill. This Finance Bill does not withdraw the
additional rates. If and when that happens, I am sure a future
Committee will debate it at some

Walthamstow, which the Exchequer Secretary himself echoed, is that the
relaxation of the 50p rate would disproportionately benefit one part of
the country: London and the south-east of England. In London and the
south-east of England there would be 161,000 beneficiaries of such a
relaxation; in the rest of the United Kingdom there would be only
138,000 beneficiaries. Obviously, a relaxation of the 50p tax rate
would have disproportionate benefits and
detriments.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000173">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> But if that is the right thing to do, and if that
is what the evidence points to, additional sums would be raised in
taxation by a more competitive regime. Such sums would enable us to
fund public services throughout the UK. That is the argument we are
making. It was accepted by the Labour party in previous years, and the
Labour party may want to reconsider it a little more closely than it
appears to be doing at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000174">&#160;</a>

overriding priority of the June 2010 Budget was to reduce the fiscal
deficit and bring the public finances back under control. Clause 1
introduces income tax for 2011-12, and in doing so supports the

a conclusion on the matter, and I wish to examine it further. The
Minister said he had no indication yet of how much revenue has been
raised in real terms by the 50p proposal in the years 2010-11. That is
subject to further consideration by HMRC when self-assessment tax forms
come in. However, the Minister and his colleagues have already said
that they believe it to be a damaging tax. My point is this: the
Minister has made  a judgment based on his dogmatic view of the
50p tax rate, rather than on evidence, income or even where that
income, if there is any, will come from in future
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000176">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Well, we could continue that discussion for a long
time. In the years of the Labour Governments, up to the banking crisis,
we had increasing investment and jobs, and increasing public sector
investment, which created jobs and employment. Therefore, we were able
to maintain a lower tax regime, because we had strong public sector-led
investment. As the Minister is aware, there was a worldwide banking
crisis, which impacted not just on the UK but elsewhere. Therefore, we
have lost revenues due to higher levels of unemployment and a range of
other reasons. The Government at the time felt that a key task was to
raise £1.1 billion from that additional rate. Unlike the current
Government, we thought we should all be in it
together.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000178">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s argument. It seems that the reason why the Labour
Government did not have to raise the higher rate of income tax in those
years was that public spending was high, if I understood him correctly.
When public spending is high, one does not need to raise taxes. It is
still not clear to me why in 1997 the Labour party felt it was good to
say that higher rate income tax should not go above 40%, given the
position set out by the right hon. Gentleman

Labour Government felt that they could strengthen the economy, and
build jobs and public services, by a range of measures that did not
include that particular one. In the time of deficit and crisis, we
believed that we could recoup additional income. The estimate was of
£1.1 billion for 2010-11, and a further £2.4 billion each
year until 2014-15. That would be £10.7 billion in total, from
that level of taxation of a group of people, who, I remind the

of the amendment is to have clear terms of reference and a timetable,
so that the decision that the Minister takes on the 50p tax rate for
future Budgets—I accept not for this one—is based on
evidence. If the evidence shows that the 50p tax rate means that we
have reduced income, the Labour party would not support that. The
purpose of the tax rate was to ensure that we spread the income
generation across income levels. The estimate of £10.7 billion
up to the next election is money that can be raised from one portion of
society to spend on important projects elsewhere. It is important to do
that and make that assessment. The Minister seems to have already taken
a decision that he is against the 50p rate as a matter of principle,
and will not take into consideration the evidence that Members have
seen about its impact on income generation as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000182">&#160;</a>

incumbent on the Exchequer Secretary to tell the Committee exactly what
he believes, as a matter of principle, about the 50% tax rate. The
purpose of the amendment is to set a framework to assess whether the
50p tax rate should be retained after a future date. We have taken a
principled view that it should be kept for the duration of this
Parliament, because assessments made by the previous Labour Government
showed that it would raise £10.7 billion over the next three to
four

Chancellor’s view. My concern is that as a result of that
conclusion we might not be able to raise the level of revenue that we
could through the 50p rate, which will be damaging to the economy, and
we would give a tax break to people in certain parts of the United

rate. The Minister could make an assessment on the basis of previous
Labour Governments’ assessments of how much money has been
raised from that tax rate, but he persists in saying that the
Government want to abolish it. They want to have some justification for
doing so, however, so that they do not appear to be benefiting only the
richer sections of our community at a time when everybody else is
facing child benefit cuts, high levels of unemployment, working tax
credit freezes and massive public spending cuts. A certain sector of
our community would be not only insulated but given a tax handout,
which would not play well in the first year of a three-year austerity
Budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000196">&#160;</a>

that the 50p tax rate will lead to a loss of revenue and therefore
should be scrapped. The Minister hopes that that will be the case, but

intends to scrap the 50p tax rate as a sop to the 275,000 people who
are affected by it, about whom Members have expressed some concern, who
are predominantly still in London, the south-east and the east. For the
record, I am not arguing for differential taxation across the United
Kingdom; I am simply saying that Ministers’ decisions will have
a different impact on different parts of the United Kingdom. Reducing
the tax rate from 50% to 40% will disproportionately benefit people who
live in London, the south-east and the east. It will undoubtedly
benefit people in my constituency; there must be somebody who earns
more than £150,000 in my constituency, but there are not many
such people. In other constituencies there are many more, which is why
the Minister needs to reflect.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000199">&#160;</a>

top rate of tax? They may consider the whole picture of taxation. Our
plea for evidence, demonstration and facts relates not only to the top
rate of tax that we are debating in clause 1 but to the interplay
between that rate of tax and other taxation. It relates to the general
impact that that has on society and on whether the UK is therefore a
good business prospect globally.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000200">&#160;</a>

thought that people locate to the United Kingdom because of issues of

things. People live in London because it is a vibrant, dynamic city
with lots to offer, not only because of the rate of taxation. People
live in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
South, because of the great opportunities there, which are not only
related to the level of taxes. The banking industry and financial
services sector industry are thriving not only because of the level of
taxation in Edinburgh. I cannot imagine people upping sticks from
Edinburgh with the financial services sector, simply because the level
of tax remained at 50p.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000201">&#160;</a>

aspect that has just been mentioned, about where people locate big
businesses and where employment is generated, is key. The Institute for
Fiscal Studies, as my right hon. Friend will remember, drew a profile
of this Government’s choices, in terms of their austerity budget
and tax policies, and the only thing that kept the graph moving towards
the top decile paying the most was the 50p tax rate. Therefore, if
there is a lower proportion of the additional taxpayers in
Scotland—and indeed, in Edinburgh—than there are in the
east, south-east, or in London, that means that the poorest in my
constituency are paying a disproportionate amount for the mistakes that
have been made by the very people who should be paying this 50p tax
rate. Does my right hon. Friend agree that it would be very good to see
a proper profile of who is paying the most in order to pay down the
deficit?<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000205">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed, and I remind my hon. Friend that there are
some 16,000 additional rate taxpayers in Scotland, compared with 18,000
in the north-west, 34,000 in the east, and 94,000 in London. It is
important to reflect on that point, because if a decision is made by
the Exchequer Secretary, income may well be forgone. The previous
Labour Government planned to raise the figure that I mentioned earlier,
which was about £10 billion. We do not yet know,
because the Exchequer Secretary has not been clear with us as to what
that level has been in the past year, but if it is proved that income
has been generated and if the tax is ultimately reduced, that income
will either have to be found through additional funds being raised from
other people in society, as my hon. Friend has said, or through
additional public expenditure cuts. The Government have to make that
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000206">&#160;</a>

are, which is why I support amendment 3. I do not know whether he is
taking into account issues to do with other choices of expenditure, in
the event that the 50p tax rate is shown to generate income. For the
record, the Minister has steadfastly refused to answer the question
whether he would abolish the tax if it was proved to raise money. My
fear is that the review will not take into account the other impacts of
potential taxation or public spending cuts, in the event that the 50p
tax rate proves to be one that raises
income.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000207">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Exchequer Secretary has made it clear that
even if this is proven to work, inasmuch as it raises additional
revenue, we could still end up in the

                           </div>position of having nebulous, vague political arguments about
competitiveness, even if by his own measure of raising revenue that 50p

                           </strong> Indeed. One of the worries that I have, which I
think supports what my hon. Friend has said, is that we may end up with
a self-fulfilling prophecy. Given what the Chancellor and the Exchequer
Secretary have said, individuals will now expect the 50p tax rate to go
in 2013. They will make arrangements to move their resources into other
areas or pay deferred taxation, using accountancy to achieve that
objective. That will ensure a self-fulfilling prophecy over that
period, and the issue of not raising revenue that the hon. Member for
Staffordshire Moorlands mentioned might come to the fore. I think that
the Exchequer Secretary needs to reflect on that strongly.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I was also
concerned not to hear from the Exchequer Secretary any detailed comment
on whether the Business Secretary has initiated discussions on the
mansion tax as part of the review. I go by what I read in the papers,
so I would welcome an indication of whether the review will consider
other forms of taxation, such as the mansion tax, for those in the
richer sectors of our community as part of the income generation that
he seeks from the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000213">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would be
grateful if the Exchequer Secretary answered those points, but if he
wants to make any response on the other points, I will happily listen
to it. Also, I ask him once more why he has not indicated that the OBR
is doing the review.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000214">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 2 sets the basic rate limit for income tax
for the 2011-12 tax year. The limit set this year ensures that the gain
from the personal allowance increase for 2011-12 is focused on the low
and middle-income taxpayers who need it most, and it is set in such a
way that the majority of higher rate taxpayers pay the same amount of
tax and national insurance contributions as planned by the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause reduces the basic rate limit by £2,400 to £35,000
in 2011-12 which, when combined with the £1,000 increase in the
personal allowance introduced by clause 3, means that the higher rate
tax threshold for 2011-12 is reduced by £1,400 in cash terms, to
£42,475. Together with the corresponding adjustments made to
keep the national insurance upper earnings and profits limits aligned
with the higher rate tax threshold, that means that the majority of
higher rate taxpayers pay the same amount as planned by the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
coalition Government are committed to creating a fairer tax system that
rewards work, with real-terms progress every year towards increasing
the personal allowance to £10,000. The £1,000 increase in
the personal allowance introduced by clause 3 represents the first step
towards that £10,000, and will benefit 23 million individuals,
removing more than 800,000 people from income tax altogether. However,
we had also to ensure that increasing the personal allowance by
£1,000—the largest increase ever—was consistent
with bringing  the public finances back under control.
Accordingly, we have made the adjustment in clause 2 to focus
the benefits on people on low and middle incomes—the
right decision for a fair and sustainable
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000265">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
overriding priority of the June 2010 Budget was to reduce the fiscal
deficit. At a time when we are asking so much of so many, it is right
to reward the efforts of people who choose to work by increasing the
personal allowance, but equally, it is right to focus the gain from the
increased allowance on those who need it most. The change in the basic
rate limit does exactly
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000266">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the Minister said, clause 2 sets the basic rate
limit for income tax at £35,000. Subsection (1)
replaces the existing amount of the basic rate limit in section 10(5)
of the Income Tax Act 2007, which is £37,400, with the figure of
£35,000 for 2011-12. Subsection (2) disapplies the
indexation provisions for the basic rate limit for 2011-12 as a whole.
As the Committee will know, an individual’s taxable income is
charged to tax at the basic rate of tax up to the basic rate limit. The
basic rate limit is subject to indexation—an annual increase
based on the percentage increase to the retail prices index. Parliament
can override indexed amounts through the provisions in the Finance
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
basic rate limit for 2010-11—the year until April of this
year—was £37,400. Had that been indexed, it would have
become £39,200. Because of clause 2, it is now at
£35,000, which means that we have dragged into the higher rate
of taxation an increased number of individuals across the board. The
clause sets the basic

			Column number: 36<a class="bkMark" name="Column36">&#160;</a>
                           </div>rate limit at £35,000 in 2011-12. That follows the announcement
in the June Budget that the basic rate limit would
be reduced below the figure in the plans that the coalition Government
inherited, in order to ensure that the increase in personal allowances
was targeted on basic rate taxpayers. That links to clause 3, which we
will discuss

                        <p class="tabbed">The
reason why I am testing the Minister on this matter is that I want an
indication from him not only of the impact on those people who will now
be subject to higher rate taxation, but of the implications of that
higher rate taxation in relation to a range of other measures in due
course. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the
reduction in the basic rate limit will mean that an additional 750,000
people are dragged into the higher rate tax bracket. I would welcome
from the Minister an indication of his assessment of the number of
people who are now being put into the higher rate tax bracket who would
not have been in it had this change not been forthcoming, because those
individuals will pay a higher level of tax and that will have a
knock-on effect on a range of other issues, which I will explore in a
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000269">&#160;</a>

about this, but one of the key issues that has been raised, certainly
with me in my constituency, relates to those individuals who earned
£36,000 to £37,000 a year and were in the lower rate tax
bracket, but who now, because of this sleight of hand by the
Chancellor, have gone into the higher tax bracket and are in danger of
losing their child benefit. Could my right hon. Friend comment on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000270">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend anticipates the discussions that we
intend to have on this clause. The Minister did not really touch on
those issues in his introductory remarks. That sleight of
hand—that was a useful phrase that my hon. Friend
employed—means that whatever number of individuals are brought
into the higher tax bracket will be affected in 2012 and 2013 by a
range of other measures that apply to people in the higher tax bracket.
My hon. Friend mentioned one example—child benefit. Clearly,
individuals with children will lose their child benefit in 2013 when
the Government remove child benefit from households with a higher rate
taxpayer. The Government are not only breaking the universality of
child benefit, but ensuring that those individuals who are higher rate
tax payers do not receive child benefit. Clause 2 means that a number
of people—we have determined that it could be about 750,000, but
I would welcome the Minister’s assessment of the number in due
course—on relatively modest incomes of £35,000 to
£43,000 are being dragged into the higher rate tax bracket and
will therefore find themselves subject to the loss of benefits in a
range of other
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will know that it is not only child benefit that is affected.
Last week on the Floor of the House we discussed clause 35,
“Reduction in childcare relief for higher earners”, which
effectively reduces the level of child care tax relief for higher
earners. Before we agree on the clause, the Minister should examine how
many individuals will be affected in other ways, downstream or in other
years, by the changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the
Government have confirmed, it is estimated that about 160,000
additional households that currently qualify for child benefit will be
dragged into paying the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 37<a class="bkMark" name="Column37">&#160;</a>
                           </div>higher rate of tax. I accept that a considerable number of
households on relatively modest incomes will
benefit from the provisions in clause 3 and the higher threshold, but
they will then find themselves in the higher tax bracket. In 2013 they
will lose benefits such as child benefit, which is essential for child
care and child support, particularly in a single-parent
household.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to tease out the Minister’s assessment of what impact
those changes will have on the wider level of benefits downstream in
2012 and 2013. Will he give the Committee some indication of what
modelling has been done and what savings have been made? What will the
impact of the changes be for those people who currently receive child
benefit, and who perhaps thought that they would continue to receive it
even when they heard in the press that it was being removed for higher
earners? Some of those people will now be pulled into the higher
earning category, and they will lose child benefit and child care
vouchers and tax relief accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Treasury has estimated that 20,000 additional people in single-income
families will pay the higher rate of tax from April 2011, and 15,000
from April 2012. It is important for the Minister to give the Committee
his assessment of the impact of the legislation, particularly with
regard to single people. The clause will bring additional people into
the higher-rate tax bracket, and I want to know whether an assessment
of the measure has been made, including a breakdown of how many single
people and couples will fall into that extra category, along the lines
of the Treasury figures. What is the Minister’s assessment of
how the changes in clause 2 will affect people in 2013? There will be
those who believe that they are paying the lower rate of taxation but
who, if clause 2 is agreed, will find themselves paying the higher
rate. In due course—in two years’ time—they will
find that they also lose child benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
my view, a modest income of between £35,000 and £40,000 a
year might well be earned by a junior police officer, a junior teacher
or a junior local government worker. There will certainly be people in
the private sector on relatively modest incomes who find themselves
dragged into the higher rate tax bracket because of the measures in the
clause, and that will lead them to lose child benefit in 2013. Has the
Minister had cross-governmental discussions with colleagues from the
Department for Work and Pensions or the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills about the impact of the legislation on potential
employment opportunities for single parents, both male and female? The
marginal difference between the higher rate of tax and the loss of
child benefit may mean that people are not able to afford the child
care that could keep a single person at work in the community,
particularly in metropolitan areas such as
London.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000276">&#160;</a>

It will be a devastating blow for the many people for whom we have

the potential income of families, particularly those with children, who
will also lose their child benefit. The measure is stunning, and I

higher rate taxpayers will get, essentially, the same tax relief as
basic rate taxpayers. Without the changes under clause 35, higher rate
taxpayers would continue to get greater tax relief than basic rate

                           </strong> Oh, the Minister will respond in due course. It is
worth while his doing that, because people fear that the clause, as
portrayed by him, is very much linked to clause 3, which we will
discuss shortly. Clause 3 raises the level of personal
allowance to approximately £7,500, with an objective, set in the
coalition document, to raise it to the Liberal Democrats’
aspiration of approximately £10,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In his
introductory remarks on clause 2, the Minister said that the increase
in personal allowance has been paid for, in part, by the change in the
allowance in clause 2—it has helped to support the funding of
clause 3. Does he expect to extend the provisions in clause
2 still further between now and 2013? Does he expect to
include more people in the higher rate tax bracket to achieve the
aspiration in clause 3, and to achieve the future aspirations to the
£10,000 limit? We will debate those matters in detail when we
discuss clause 3, but they link significantly to my points on the
impact of clause 2.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000285">&#160;</a>

I want the Minister to tell us two things. First, what assessment has
he made of the number of individuals who will be deemed to be higher
rate taxpayers because of clause 2? Secondly, what assessment has he
made of that higher rate taxpayer inclusion on people’s ability
to access benefits, such as child benefit, in 2012 and 2013? He needs
to make clear to the Committee the

                           </div>impact of all those measures, because today we are simply faced with
clause 2, which makes no mention of the fact that higher rate taxpayers
will lose child benefit in 2013. It makes no mention of the
arrangements for working families tax credit and other benefits, which
will change as a result of the higher rate taxpayer status in
2013.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
particularly important for us to hear the Minister’s assessment
of how many women the measure will affect. How many women, many of whom
depend on child benefit, will be brought into the higher tax rate?
Within that, how many single women will be affected by the change in
clause 2? He will find that individuals will lose out on future
benefits because of the change. It is incumbent on him to talk about
not just the clause, but its knock-on impact on others in society as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000287">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me see what I can say in response to the
questions asked by the right hon. Gentleman. Clauses 2 and 3
will ensure that the benefit from the increase in the personal
allowance is focused on those who pay basic rate income tax. To be fair
to him, he did not fall into the trap, as some have, of saying that
there will be an income tax increase for those paying higher rate
income tax, as the reduction in the basic rate merely counteracts the
benefit that would otherwise apply to the increase in the personal
allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked what the number of losers will be. To put it
more precisely, he asked how many people will become higher rate
taxpayers as a consequence of a reduction in the basic rate limit.
Compared with the plans that we inherited, an additional 385,000 people
will become higher rate taxpayers in 2011-12. Around two thirds of them
will be better off under the overall approach because they will
experience the full benefits of the increase in the personal allowance
without experiencing the full loss from the reduction in the basic rate
limit. He may be interested to know that I am able to provide a
regional breakdown of those numbers. I will not give that to the
Committee on this occasion, but the information is available if he
wants
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
I can provide some clarity on one or two of the comments that suggested
that people earning £36,000 will start paying the higher rate of
tax. That is not how the income tax system works. Individuals start
paying the higher rate from £42,475. That threshold
represents  the sum of the personal allowance, which is
£7,475, and the basic rate limit of £35,000. We have also
announced our plans for the following year. As we want to focus on
encouraging work across the piece, and we do not need to keep the
measure limited to basic rate taxpayers, we are not reducing the basic
rate limit in the same way, so we will not bring more people into the
higher tax
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000290">&#160;</a>

know that you, Mr Gale, will not want us to engage in a lengthy debate
on child benefit. The right hon. Gentleman asked a number of factual
questions, not all of which I am in a position to answer. However, at a
time when we have to make difficult decisions, it is not fair for
people on low incomes to continue subsidising the child benefit of
those earning much more. As I said, it is right to focus the gains of
the personal allowance increase for 2011-12 on low and middle-income
taxpayers. The changes to personal tax thresholds announced in the June
2010 Budget mean that the majority of higher

			Column number: 40<a class="bkMark" name="Column40">&#160;</a>

right hon. Gentleman is asking me for a considerable breakdown. We are
some way away from the changes in child benefit. I am not sure that it
helps hugely to give figures here about changes in the current personal
rate limit in order to assess the impact that they will have in January
2013. I do not intend to be detained on this particular

is an important point? The Committee needs to know what impact these
proposals will have before it can approve clause 2 today. The impact
will be that a number of people—I would welcome clarification on
the number—will be brought into the higher rate of tax and,
therefore, under current Government policies will lose child benefit in
2013. It is important that the Committee sees this figure before it

has not been considered before our discussion

                           </strong> The 2012 Finance Bill will put in place the
relevant thresholds that will apply in January 2013. We still have to
legislate on the child benefit changes, and there will be plenty of
opportunity to debate their impact later. Additional people will be
paying this tax as a consequence of the changes. It is estimated that
the figure is 385,000, two thirds of whom will still be gaining from
the overall package of changes in income tax. Increasing the personal
allowance demonstrates the Government’s commitment to make sure
that work pays and to reward those who choose to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000294">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In that case, I will carry on for a moment. We
also need to know another key fact, which has not been touched on by
the Minister. How many single people do the Treasury estimate will fall
into the higher rate tax band as a result of the changes under clause
2? A single person who falls into the higher rate tax band under the
proposals in clause 2 may not qualify for child benefit in 2013. Two
individuals with a joint income that is £25,000 more than that
of the single person will, under the current Government proposals,
receive child benefit in 2013. At the moment, only higher rate
taxpayers are losing out under the proposals on child benefit. I accept
that child benefit is a separate issue, but there is a causal link. If
an individual becomes a higher taxpayer, they will, under Government
proposals, lose child benefit. If need be, we will continue until
1 o’clock and the Minister can reflect on this in the
three hours between now and the next sitting. It is incumbent on him to
bring back to this Committee his assessment of the number of single
people who will be paying a higher rate of tax as a result of clause 2
and who will be losing child benefit under the proposals for 2013. We
need to know that figure before we can agree on this
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11051091000295">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn
for giving way. Do his points not raise further concerns about the
different measures on household income and individual income? I am
thinking of some of the problems that we are seeing both in this Bill
and in the child benefit proposals. I notice a recurring pattern here.
In a number of Committees that I have  sat on with my right
hon. Friend and the Exchequer Secretary, there has not been enough data
effectively to scrutinise some of these concerns. I hope that
the  Exchequer Secretary will listen to my right hon.
