</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Good afternoon, Mrs. Dunwoody. It seems appropriate that we should be talking about parental care under your benevolent stewardship, which gives me a reassuring feeling. I am sure that you will exercise due weight of authority as our proceedings develop. Having finished the pleasantries, I have been told to get on, so I shall&#151;quickly, ma'am. After speaking to my amendment, I shall address similar points raised by amendment No. 38.
<P>
The amendment, which is a probing one, proposes the deletion of the words ``or expecting to have''. It is important to specify the parent who has care when considering a parental leave entitlement, or problems could in several circumstances arise. First, parents may unfortunately be separated or divorced and share responsibility for the care of a child. Many hon. Members will have come across instances in their constituencies when dealing with Child Support Agency cases, of parents who sometimes manipulate the concept and definition of shared care. Depending on who has what proportion of the responsibility for care, the costs attributable to the support of a child, as defined by the CSA, change and battles go on as to who is responsibile for how many nights a week, and so on. We are therefore talking about something that has a major impact on that aspect of social life. Trying to define who is responsible for a child when determining entitlement to parental leave could also have a major impact.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> In the cases that the hon. Gentleman is speaking about, we should separate those who have parental responsibility for financial contributions and have access to the child from those who have a financial responsibility but do not, for a range of reasons, have access to the child or who have been prevented from having such access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I have agree with the Minister; I was going to make that distinction. However, we must determine precisely what ``expecting to have responsibility'' means. It could mean that one or other parent is planning to go into hospital&#151;not for an emergency case, an eventuality that is dealt with in another part of the Bill&#151;which clearly requires the other parent to be responsible. It could mean that there is a regular arrangement, not involving financial transactions, for a child with separated or divorced parents to stay with one or other of them; the expectation of responsibility in such a case would be clear to all concerned. However, for a host of reasons, those who have expectation of responsibility may not fall into the same category as those who have true entitlement to parental leave; there could be an expectation of responsibility for a child which, in the event, may not materialise. That is my concern: the use of the word ``expecting''. What checks and balances will employers have to verify such expectation? Is it intended that statements or evidence should be required from an employee not normally the parent with care to justify a change or expected change in circumstances? The Bill is not clear about who is entitled to claim parental leave. It is not in the spirit of the Bill that an employer should have to decide the basis of a relationship between two parents and a child. The employer needs to have clear eligibility criteria. Employers should be able to expect the Bill to allow them to exercise discretion, as most reasonable employers would.
<P>
I want to know what the Minister has in mind, but a case can be made for the regulations to set out precisely and clearly a list of those entitled to claim parental leave, based on their responsibility for a child. Such a list would clearly include natural or adoptive parents. Step-parents and legal guardians would obviously be entitled to make a claim for parental leave. However, others could claim to have parental responsibilities, as defined in the Children Act 1989, if a residence order has been made. Such an order need not have a financial connotation, but it would certainly imply some responsibility.
<P>
The concept of responsibility in the Bill could create much uncertainty for employers. It will be difficult for them to establish who has genuine responsibility and therefore who has the right to claim parental leave. It does not take much imagination to envisage a case where both parents are working, the responsibility for the care of the children being shared at different times between themselves, grandparents, aunts or even friends. Each of those people could, as the Bill is written, claim responsibility for the care of the children and therefore be entitled to parental leave. If each was entitled to claim an element of parental leave, if would be a complex matter for the employer to determine exactly who had the right to the benefit.
<P>
It becomes even more complex if we consider the right to transfer different elements of parental leave rights. I think, for instance, of workers who have the short-term care of children, particularly those who undertake short-term foster care. It is an admirable thing to do, and I certainly applaud and support those who take on such responsibilities. Clearly, it is valuable for children of unsettled background. In the context of the Bill, however, we need to know whether it is intended that parental leave rights should extend to foster carers, even if their responsibility is short term&#151;perhaps even less than three months, as I am sure sometimes happens. Employers need to have a precise definition of responsibility for care, or the expectation of responsibility, because it could be suggested that a foster parent would expect to have continual responsibility for a number of children over a number of years, but for a relatively short time in respect of each.
<P>
It is worth pointing out that the European Community directive from which the regulation and the Bill emanate sets out the intention of giving parents the right to claim parental leave. Employers will be placed in the position of trying to determine the expectation of a responsibility of care, and will need a way of monitoring whether the employee is making a reasonable claim for leave. What type of evidence can the employer call for under the Bill to confirm that the employee's claim is justified? What reasonable evidence is it intended that the employee should present to the employer to justify an expectation of responsibility? A birth certificate? A birth certificate and a marriage certificate? It would hardly be appropriate in our modern society to say that only those who can produce a birth certificate and a marriage certificate should be entitled to parental leave. Complexities begin to mount when an employer legitimately tries to determine whether a claim for parental leave on the basis of expectation of responsibility for a child is justified. The concept of responsibility is difficult to define and, in some cases, difficult to prove, and even more difficult to regulate through the Bill.
<P>
I spent a heavily involved lunch ensuring that what I had to say on amendment No. 38 was right. Only a sandwich passed my lips; I hardly had time for anything else.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that this is a most responsible and sober Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I would not dare attend if it were any other.
<P>
Other Opposition Members, too, will discuss amendment No. 38, which raises the problem of defining at what age the entitlement to parental leave should cease. A clear case exists for defining in the Bill that the entitlement should cease when the child has reached compulsory school age&#151;I do not want to tread on anyone's toes; the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) will no doubt go into some detail on the matter&#151;especially when related to the directive, which, as hon. Members will know, allows leave to be taken up to the child's eighth birthday. However, I believe that that definition in the directive recognises that in different countries in the European Union, children start their formal education at different ages. The directive is therefore quite loose and open, to account for those different characteristics in the education system.
<P>
If the Government intend that parental leave should in general be taken before a child's compulsory formal education starts, the Bill should be clear about that. As it stands, it is not. Even in our confined consideration of our own system, no guarantee exists that formal, compulsory education will continue to start at the age of five. I therefore believe that we should specify compulsory education, rather than the age of the child. Considerable support exists in Parliament and elsewhere to reduce the compulsory starting age for school to below five. Strong support exists for early-years education, which means children starting school at four years old. In years to come, compulsory education may start earlier than five years old.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): In the interests of clarity, it is already a statutory responsibility of local education authorities to secure provision, although it is not a statutory obligation of parents to offer their children to take up that provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes precisely my point. It is a statutory obligation to provide early-years education should parents want to partake of it. That may change; it may become a compulsory requirement under another Government or Secretary of State.
<P>
Will the Minister look more closely at the regulations on the age at which parental leave can be taken and link it to the compulsory school age, rather than relying on the broader definition given in the EC directive?
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I am pleased to speak in this debate because these amendments are of particular importance; they typify the sort of amendments that need to be tabled when debating a Bill that gives so little detail about the Government's intentions. The amendments are intended to enable the Government to tell us exactly how they envisage the parental leave provisions being applied.
<P>
I endorse much of what the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) said in moving amemdment No. 59. Many of his intentions in moving that amendment are the same as mine in tabling amendment No. 68. The precise circumstances in which an employee, not necessarily a parent under the Bill, should be eligible for parental leave must be made clear. Under the Bill, employees will be eligible for leave if they satisfy provisions relating to the ``duration of employment'' and if they have, or are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``expecting to have, responsibility for a child''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That leaves remarkably wide scope, which would cause businesses considerable concern. If the Bill is implemented as drafted, it might create much work for tribunals and lawyers.
<P>
Under amendment No. 59, the phrase ``or expecting to have'' would be deleted from the Bill. That important amendment must be examined.
<P>
From my reading of the Bill, it is unclear whether the provision will apply only after the birth of the child, or whether it can apply before a child has been born. There is nothing necessarily wrong in the latter; there might be good reasons why a parent, or other person expecting to care for a newborn child, might reasonably want to take time off work to make the necessary preparations. I have no particular objection to that, but the Bill does not make it clear, and I should be grateful for any elucidation.
<P>
I apologise for arriving a few minutes late. I was in the Chamber, hoping to be called to speak on other business. I think that I missed only a short part of the remarks of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. However, I arrived in time to hear the Minister suggest that the necessary definitions might include a combination of financial responsibility and access. I was interested in that point, which goes to the heart of amendment No. 68, because it, too, is an extraordinarily wide definition that might not exclude a number of people or groups of people, such as those to whom the hon. Member for Eastleigh referred.
<P>
It is possible that many different people would have access to a child and share in the financial responsibility for that child. For example, grandparents might provide accommodation to a family without payment. Nevertheless, that is a financial benefit in kind, which might qualify as a financial contribution. Clearly that would be combined with access. A great many people who are not parents, adoptive parents, step-parents or even grandparents might be eligible for leave because of the wording of the schedule. We need a clear definition of what combination of financial support and access is necessary to bring people within eligibility. An absent parent may provide some level of financial support. As has been said, in our weekly constituency business we all come across a wide variety of family circumstances, some of them very unfortunate. In some cases, people are separated through no fault on either side. In others, absent parents go to enormous lengths to make proper financial provision. We also come across many cases in which little provision is made, sometimes deliberately, sometimes because of the absent parent's financial circumstances. We might therefore be talking about a parent who provides a low level of financial support or who may be given or choose to have limited access to a child.
<P>
The principal reason why amendment No. 68 provides that someone must have responsibility for day-to-day care to be eligible for leave is to try to bring logic into the provision so that it will not preclude those who are genuinely involved, financially or otherwise, in the support of a child from the entitlement, but will preclude people taking lengthy periods of parental leave when they have very limited financial involvement with or access arrangements to a child. One might consider the relatively common arrangement, for example, of an absent father who sees his children regularly at the weekends. It is a good arrangement. There are many worse ones operating in the case of broken down families. Yet if such a parent worked Monday to Friday, he would not realistically be justified in taking parental leave. It is difficult to see how a parent who sees his or her child only on a Saturday, for example, perhaps not even overnight, and not at all during the week, is entitled to seek parental leave for some months. Such a parent is not closely involved in the day-to-day burden of child care and takes no real responsibility for it.
<P>
The amendment would limit some of the other potential abuses to which the hon. Member for Eastleigh has referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): If a mother goes out to work, leaving a child to be looked after in the family home by the grandmother, the grandmother, not the mother, takes on the day-to-day care of the child, although the mother has overall responsibility. If the mother had a nervous breakdown, for example, according to my understanding of the amendment, she could not claim the entitlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> No, I am not sure that that is correct. The amendment is not intended to have that effect. The point at which someone ceases to have day-to-day responsibility for care is open to definition and I accept that it should be narrowed down. However, the amendment is no more vaguely drafted than the schedule. In the example described by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies), I envisage that the grandparent involved would have day-to-day responsibility and may therefore qualify for leave if she were an employee. The case of a mother who goes out to work in normal circumstances&#151;I accept that if she had a nervous breakdown it would be different&#151;can be dealt with separately.
<P>
In short, the hon. Member for Croydon, Central is wrong to suggest that amendment No. 68 would remove the right to parental leave under such circumstances. It would make much clearer the circumstances under which parental leave was appropriate and it would prevent some of the more obvious abuses that could occur under the Bill. It would certainly limit the availability of parental leave, which otherwise would be available to a number of different employees in respect of the same child. It would not necessarily be a blanket prohibition, but it would provide a rather narrower definition than the Bill, under which any number of employees who have some share in the responsibility of the care of a child could claim parental leave, in any number of employments.
<P>
The amendment would, within reason, limit the possibility of parental leave being taken simultaneously by a number of different employees. It would also limit the chances of serial child care, mentioned by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. At the very least, if a number of different people were taking responsibility for the care of a child, they would have to demonstrate that they had day-to-day responsibility.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 is not particularly far-reaching, but it seeks to impose a little sense on a rather vague provision. Together with the other amendments in this group, it will alleviate some of the anxieties of a number of businesses. The Engineering Employers Federation was worried that any number of people could be entitled to take leave for the care of the same child. It is easy to envisage a working mother and father, a grandparent, an aunt and a friend all having responsibility for a child at different times of the week. Indeed, it is possible that they may have responsibility in different weeks or at different points during the early years of a child's life. The provision needs a little more definition and a little more clarity.
<P>
The Government are fond of praying in aid the Confederation of British Industry, but the CBI has expressed profound concerns about the costs that the measure will pile onto businesses, especially when considered with the costs being put on business by the minimum wage and the working time regulations. It is important that the Minister addresses that point.
<P>
I hope that the Government will look favourably on amendment No. 68 and the other amendments in the group. They represent a serious and important attempt to provide the clarity that the Bill sadly lacks.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I agree with my hon. Friends and the Liberal Democrat members of the Committee about the drafting of the schedule. I am sure that all hon. Members will have received representations from industry. The CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Engineering Employers Federation are all singing from the same hymn sheet. The lack of clarity in the regulations is causing them much concern. The smaller the business, the greater the impact of the regulations. It is not clear who will benefit from paternity leave.
<P>
The Government are proposing to go ahead with family-friendly policies. It is therefore only fair that businesses should know where they stand. The regulations should be drawn up as tightly as possible, in order to avoid the many grey areas through which employers and employees can frustrate what might otherwise be a reasonable course of action. We are dealing with a two-way relationship, and it is important that people know exactly where they stand. The way in which the Government have drafted the schedule has left us scratching our heads about the possible definitions that could be derived.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would introduce much greater clarity, because it would specify who is a parent. It would be much easier for employers to verify that they have a duty under the Bill to allow a parent to take parental leave if they know exactly what the definition of a parent is.
<P>
The Government may want to insert nuances into our amendment, but its broad thrust is right. A parent should be a natural biological parent, an adoptive parent or someone subject to a fostering agreement. Mum's latest boyfriend should not constitute the parent of a child and therefore be eligible for three months' leave merely because it suits him at the time. Businesses could not be expected to operate on the basis of knowing with whom their employees cohabit and what responsibilities might arise as a result of that cohabitation. It is unreasonable that such a fluid prospect should be part of an employer's responsibilities under the Bill, and that no clear definition exists so that someone can present to his employer a piece of paper to show that he is the natural, adoptive or foster father of the child. The foster definition might present difficulties because of the number of children who may be involved. Public-spirited people who foster more children might create an uncomfortable liability for their employer, which hon. Members should carefully consider.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Is the hon. Lady saying that the Bill should embrace a stepfather if he is married, but not if he is not?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am saying that employers will experience great difficulty in the event of a rolling programme of cohabitation. What is the definition of a stepfather? Employers have a right to know. Perhaps it would mean that such a person would have to adopt the child in such a relationship to be eligible under the Bill. An open-ended right to parental leave could be created through a series of relationships, which is not in the spirit of the Government's intentions. That would not be fair to employers, and would create huge unfairness if an employee wanted to create a significant right to time off work while maintaining the availability of his or her job. Like other Opposition Members, I urge the Government to consider the matter, and to provide clarification in the schedule so that we know exactly who will constitute parents.
<P>
The other amendments that we have tabled, some of which the Government may accept, propose the inclusion of other criteria in the Bill to make it more clear. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) spoke eloquently to the amendment that he tabled.
<P>
The word ``responsibility'' is used in the schedule, which produces a very open-ended definition. I am not a lawyer, but I am frequently amazed, surprised, astonished and, sometimes, incredibly impressed that lawyers can give words all sorts of definitions and meanings that I have never thought of. The word ``responsibility'' cries out as being one of those words because it is used in so many ways in the Bill. I am sure that the Prime Minister would have much to say about responsibilities; he is very fond of them. The creativity that could be applied&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Lady will be interested to know that the hon. Member for Daventry argued, in moving a previous amendment, that the word ``responsibility'' should be included in the Bill, contrary to what she says about the use of such language.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman must accept my apologies; I was not here this morning. However, I suspect that he is playing semantic games with me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the record, it should be stated that amendment No. 30, which I moved, used the equally magic word ``reasonably'', not ``responsibly''. Untypically, the hon. Member for Croydon, Central is slightly inaccurate.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I thank by hon. Friend for making that clear for the public record. I shall forgive the hon. Member for Croydon, Central for having misheard this morning and for trying to wrong-foot me now.
<P>
It is important that the Government take the problem presented by the use of the word ``responsibility'' more seriously. Employers are fearful of the Bill and of the rights that will be introduced, the costs that will be imposed and the dislocation to their businesses that will result. They are not sure how things will pan out and what the impact will be on their businesses. Therefore, it is vital that the legal definition is as tight as possible&#151;I know that that statement must be qualified because it is not always possible to have a watertight definition.
<P>
Inasmuch as the creativity of civil servants can be applied to such matters, it is important to decide on a clear definition, so that we can have a reasonable expectation of its standing up in court if employers and employees disagree about their rights and responsibilities.
<P>
We should all be capable of explaining such matters to those who question us about what we do here and how we spend our time. If I have to explain the rights and responsibilities under the Bill to employees and employers in my constituency, I should like to be able to give them a clear definition, not one that is rather open ended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): The hon. Lady could do no better than to direct the employers and employees who request definitions and explanations to the forthcoming Trades Union Congress explanatory document, ``Great Expectations'', which is a guide for parents. That excellent document will be useful to both employers and employees.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to that document. I would be more than happy to do what he suggests if it helped my constituents. However, I am intrigued that the TUC is more aware of who the Bill will cover than members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce (South Dorset):</B> We have heard from the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) that the TUC has apparently seen the draft regulations; it could not have written the document without them. Similarly, I understand that other organisations have seen draft regulations for other clauses. I would have thought that the Minister would immediately leap to his feet to reassure us that the Committee will see the same draft information that has been given to the TUC and others.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I hope that the Minister will clarify the matter because it would be disgraceful if organisations were able to speak with greater clarity and certainty on the matter than hon. Members they had access to information that has been denied us. That would be a great abuse of Parliament; I will resist the temptation to say that such abuse would not, under the present regime, shock me. I am sure that the Minister will want to reassure us by clarifying who has been able to see the information.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Lady is under an illusion: the regulations have not yet been drafted. The document to which my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles and the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce)&#151;in his usual churlish manner&#151;alluded deals with the current operation of the law. When the law is changed by the Bill, the TUC will have to amend the document substantially.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I thank the Minister for pointing that out, but I refute the slur on my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset, who made a telling point that brought the Minister to his feet. On the point made by the hon. Member for Eccles, I look forward to the redrawing of the document&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I treated with some lenience the advertising ploy of the hon. Member for Eccles, but I shall not continue to be so tolerant. Could we return to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Of course, Mrs. Dunwoody. Before the distraction to which you rightly referred, I was saying how important it is for the Minister to clarify ``responsibility'' because it is so open-ended a term. It could mean anything. Although I approve of the definition of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West because the phrase ``day-to-day responsibility to care'' adds greater clarity and certainty to the schedule, there may be more appropriate definitions. I am sure that Opposition Members would be happy to hear them. However, we think that the amendment is an improvement on the schedule and hope that the Minister will consider the matter because it is important to the many businesses that fear that relations, friends, girlfriends and boyfriends would be able to claim such responsibility. It is important that we specify the person responsible and define what would be entailed in the circumstances. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendments because they add clarity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The way in which the Government have set about the matter&#151;enabling by legislation to be followed by regulations&#151;should mean that everyone can join in the party. The Minister this morning effectively told us that our remarks would be taken into account and that the TUC and other representative bodies would wish to do consider them. In the light of your remarks, Mrs. Dunwoody, I shall say only briefly that I am fortunate enough to be on the mailing list of the TUC and regard much of its material as clear and to the point&#151;something from which Governments can learn.
<P>
We want to get the matter right. We want the regulations to be sensible and that involves ensuring that they are understood by those to whom they apply&#151;employees and employers. I said this morning, in relation to maternity leave, that I was troubled, as were some responsible employers' organisations, by the fact that if the arrangements did not always work as intended, people could lose their rights because of the complexity of the regulations. It is a matter of common interest, and I shall return to it later.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before I start my general remarks, and rather than speaking to my amendments, I must say that the debate has been constructive. As constituency Members, we could hardly fail to accept the huge complexity of modern family arrangements. It is not any part of our work today to seek to prescribe some kind of platonic ideal of the family, which is the only one to which the regulations might apply, because many people of good will, who have tremendous dedication and, to use an old-fashioned word, love towards children, are involved with looking after children.
<P>
We need to balance that against the suspicion&#151;I put it no higher than that&#151;that if some people see a provision for leave they will exploit that advantage, although I concede, and the Minister has not told me otherwise, that it will be unpaid leave. When the Minister eventually gets round to drafting the regulations, he will have to pick his way through a minefield. I wanted first to establish the sensitivity of the matter.
<P>
A catch phrase of mine, used at home to the intense annoyance of my spouse and children, is the doctrine that when one has clarity one will have quality of response. In other words, if I am told that I have to take the top off before I spread the marmalade, it will work better than if I am merely told&#151;but perhaps I should leave it at that. I shall make the point more seriously in the context of the eventual regulations.
<P>
It is clearly better if the law is precisely set out. However, the difficulty is compounded by the complexity of modern family arrangements; if they are set out in a rather precise and prescriptive way, that will inevitably give rise to some injustice. A perfectly reasonable arrangement that might seem to any Member of Parliament the proper way to qualify someone for parental leave might suddenly turn out not be reasonable because it is not in the schedule.
<P>
That is a real dilemma, but I add a third point to my general observations. I have the feeling at the back of my mind that it may be necessary to prescribe an automatic list and to provide a term of art. However, the best that the Government draftsman can come up with is to provide for other conditions that may entitle a person to parental leave. That also affects the employer, because he will have to decide whether an application for parental leave is justified. We must remember that the employer may have to argue his case before a tribunal, so he will want a broad rule of thumb that will make it clear whether parental leave can be given, and he may want to be able to look at a slightly wider case.
<P>
The Minister may care to reflect on the fact that provision may be needed to allow the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which is highly respected, or some other adviser to say whether A.N. Other qualifies for parental leave. It should be possible to make inquiries about that person's eligibility. It is difficult to do, but worth trying to get it right.
<P>
My final general point is, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh and I found in earlier exchanges, that matters can be dealt with at different levels. At level A, the employee will approach the employer and ask for some parental leave because of the family situation. At level B, the employee takes the employer to a tribunal to seek redress for the employer's failure to allow parental leave. It is unfortunate that in the second case, the employer is in a position of enforcement because the prior conditions were not sufficiently clear to make a reasonably informed judgment about whether parental leave was appropriate.
<P>
That is a general example, but it sets out the dilemma. We want to be fair to people who act as parents, but to be as clear as we reasonably can to parties involved so that they understand the arrangements. That reflects the dialogue with and representations from people such as engineering employers and bodies such as the CBI, and it is the proper sort of debate to have in Committee.
<P>
Through the amendments tabled in my name, I have tried, first, to provide a better functional definition of the relationship between the parent&#151;or the person with responsibility for the child&#151;and the child in question and, secondly, to provide a clearer definition of the age that the child may attain and still provide the responsible person with the opportunity to claim parental leave.
<P>
I shall deal with those two points separately. The first is not a literal reproduction of, but is drawn from, the concept in the Irish legislation on force majeure leave. The Irish legislation provides a list. It comprises a child or adoptive child, a spouse, a person to whom the employee is in loco parentis, a brother, sister, parent or grandparent. The list is provided for force majeure leave, rather than parental leave, although the two arise under the same directive. It does not go further than that. I remind the Committee that the Irish provision is for paid leave, which is, perhaps, another reason for being precise.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 is designed to define a fairly close relationship between an individual and the child in question. Incidentally, I shall pose a question to which I do not know the answer. I must have copied the Irish wording, as I have used the phrase ``adoptive child'' rather than ``adopted child''. No doubt one of the lawyers will tell me whether a real distinction is made between the two. I suspect that both relate to a child who has been adopted, and possibly to a child undergoing the process of adoption rather than only post the event. It is clear, I think, to all hon. Members that adopted or adoptive children enter into the matter. The amendment is an attempt to produce a working definition with which to start. The Minister may need a term of art to back it up, but I should like him to reflect on it.
<P>
Amendment No. 37, which proposes the deletion of lines 9 and 10, is designed to prevent that aspect from being determined by regulations, and to launch the general point that we are not happy because we do not know what will happen.
<P>
Amendment No. 38 deals with the other end of the telescope. When is a child a child? It takes us back to exchanges that we have already had about the age of compulsory schooling and the hon. Member for Eastleigh helpfully commented on it. The CBI has commented specifically on it in severeal respects. It wants parental leave to be taken before the fifth birthday of the child in question, which is essentially the substance of the amendment that I have tabled. Interestingly&#151;although it occurred to me only when I saw its briefing&#151;it goes on to say that the provision in the European directive for such leave to be taken up to the child's eighth birthday reflects the different ages at which formal schooling commences in the various member states. That must be true. Nearly all children are in school by the age of eight. It is interesting that our inclination is to reduce that age, a matter of some debate among educationalists. The CBI also expresses concern, which is not explicit in the amendment, about the possibility of large numbers of claims in a short time&#151;perhaps hitting a single employer&#151;from employees whose children are approaching their fifth birthday. The CBI suggests that retrospective claims should not be permitted for children born before the date of United Kingdom implementation. Perhaps the Minister will reflect on that matter. The CBI then makes a more general point about the need for significant notice to be given.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the likelihood is that, as the compulsory school age decreases over time from five to four to three, the entitlement will be squeezed well below the threshold that the CBI targets&#151;the age of five&#151;and that, therefore, we should be in favour of a particular age rather than the moving target of compulsory school age?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understand that point. It is inherent in the nature of probing amendents that they have a certain substance. I have no particular proprietary wish to secure that point. Indeed, Labour Members might make the point that, even if children are of compulsory school attendance age and a school most of the time, schools are not required to look after them during the school holidays when they are at home. I will concede that point, but the amendment is intended to provide a term of art. We would generally expect school children to be looked after by their parents. We could argue endlessly about how that should be interpreted. However, the amendment is a workable attempt to reach a definition.
<P>
We await the Minister's response to this important group of amendments. The hon. Member for Eastleigh might want to consider that response before deciding whether to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman concludes, will he confirm whether the last line of amendment No. 36 contains a typographical error? It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or that the employer has been appointed to foster the child or is otherwise in loco parentis.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is indeed a typo. I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. One reads such things time and again and still overlooks them. Of course, it should read, ``the employee''.
<P>
We want to get the regulations right. A balance must be drawn&#151;hard cases must not be left out but the inclusion of too many cases might be over-prescriptive and make it very difficult for the regulations to work. The regulations will not be easy to draft. Responsible industry opinion accepts the parental leave directive with some reservations and has some specific concerns about such matters. We shall listen to the Minister's response to what has been a pre-regulation consultative debate before deciding what to do on this group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> It is good to see you back in the Chair this afternoon, Mrs. Dunwoody. I had a frisson of worry that you had been put on the blacklist after the publication of the wonderful report of the Transport Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, which you chair so ably. Perhaps it was simply the thought that the Government had asked you to reorganise the Coastguard service that kept you out of the Chair this morning. I hope that that will be the case. Having flattered you so far, Mrs. Dunwoody, I hope that you will allow me a little leeway in the brief speech that I wish to make.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should bear it in mind that the Chair always listens carefully to flattery but never actually believes a word of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Only when it is true, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Many companies have rightly thought it appropriate to allow men to take parental leave, especially when the child has been born recently. I shall be grateful to the Minister if he will put something straight for the record. If a company decided to offer three months unpaid parental leave, especially if that were done non contractually but at the manager's discretion, would it be illegal to withdraw the paid leave that had been given previously? On Second Reading, the Minister and the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) said that people who deducted wages for holiday pay&#151;a subject on which I did not intervene because it is not dealt with by the Bill&#151;were acting illegally. The courts may find that that is illegal, but the regulations do not state that it is. Would the Minister clarify whether companies who currently give paid parental leave will, when the regulations are in force, be breaking them if they unilaterally withdrew holiday pay? If not, should a measure be included in the regulations to protect a right that some people already enjoy?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> If I may assist the hon. Gentleman, whether or not a written contract provides for paid leave, the fact that it is now provided forms an implied contractual provision. If, when the legislation is passed, an employer wanted to withdraw such leave, he would have to consult appropriately for a change in employees' terms and conditions. The issue is not a difficult one for employers. I think that I have covered his example of an employer who was not asked to do so giving paid leave and then withdrawing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am most grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall answer as many of the points as possible, alongside the comments that I wish to make; I have made a note of hon. Members' points and hope that I can cover them all effectively. There has been considerable discussion on a range of amendments. I shall try to deal with the comments made.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Daventry said, our debate has been an opportunity to discuss people's perceptions of the regulations and what they should cover. I repeat my commitment that the debate is very much part of the process. The consultations have been going on for some time and it is interesting that hon. Members talked about the CBI. However, they did not mention the fact that the CBI welcomed both the schedule and the way in which the Government have proceeded. It particularly welcomed the workplace agreements between employers and employees as a basis for making determinations on the granting of parental leave. The Government are totally committed to ensuring that the regulations that will eventually be placed before the House are developed on the basis of the practitioners' need for regulations that are user-friendly, clear and balaced between details and principles, and will ensure flexibility.
<P>
On amendment No. 59, I understand hon. Members' concerns that parental leave should be for parents and used for the benefit of the child; we agree with that general principle and that such leave should not be taken before the child is born. However, the amendment would delete that provision&#151;probably because of the way in which it is worded.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West asked about time off at the birth of the child. Under the parental leave scheme, fathers will, for the first time, be entitled to take time off to care for the child provided that they satisfy the qualifying conditions, including the requirement to have had one year's service. In many cases that will enable fathers to be off work at the time of the birth.
<P>
The question of whether the father should be able to have time off to attend the birth will be dealt with when we consult on the regulations. It is recognised that fathers are a part of the bonding process and it is a matter of everyday practice that they should attend the birth.
<P>
On a personal note, I was refused access to the birth of my first two children. I arrived a few hours after the first birth and the nursing sister told me that only the father could enter the ward. I was taken in by my uncle, my mother's youngest brother. I said to the sister, ``I am the father.'' She replied, ``Get lost.'' My uncle saw my daughter before I did. However, after some negotiation, I was able to see my daughter; she is now nearly 30 years of age and has five children of her own, although I am not sure that I would qualify for parental leave for them. Our purpose is quite clear. We want fathers to have time off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, because he is going a long way to giving us some of the detail that we seek. I press him to go a little further. He suggested that consultation would include the question of time off for fathers to attend the birth. Is it legitimate for us to conclude that consultation will not include the question of time off prior to the birth? I make no comment about whether it is good or bad, but it needs to be established for the benefit of businesses and employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I said that we could consult on the question of fathers taking time off at about the time of birth. It is a new right, and we shall consult over its extent. The Government understand and recognise the need in the present climate to involve fathers as far as possible. I have given as clear an indication as I can.
<P>
The provision that the amendment of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, deals with is intended for cases of adoption. The Bill represents a big step forward for the rights of adoptive parents at work. At present, they have none. We want those new rights at work to meet the special needs that may arise in adoption cases. My officials have already held talks with adoption agencies and other organisations, which is why we propose such flexibility. Children are placed with prospective parents a significant time before the formal adoption takes place. That is an important time, during which the family and social services staff work out whether the arrangement is a happy one and whether, based on the needs of the child, it can be made permanent. Vital bonds are forged during that time, and if problems do arise&#151;either because of the specific needs of the child or because of the home environment&#151;they need to be resolved in a positive and effective way to develop the relationship towards making a final decision on adoption. It seems reasonable and fair that the proposals should cover that.
<P>
It is also clear that many prospective adoptive parents will want to take leave to be with the child during that period to sort out any difficulties and to help put the adoption on a firm and permanent footing. That is particularly true for parents who want to adopt children who are not babies or toddlers. Increasingly, it is in the interests of us all to encourage the adoption of children who may have spent a significant part of their childhood in care or foster arrangements that took no care of their long-term needs. Through the Bill, we can provide encouragement and incentive to ensure that potential adoptive parents who take on such difficulties are supported. It is therefore important that they can take time off during that important period. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will therefore agree that we should retain such a valuable provision.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry discussed amendment No. 36, which appears to be an attempt to restrain regulation-making powers. Once again, it is misconceived and could defeat the objective of parental leave.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Before the Minister moves on, I should like to draw his mind back to his comments about people who qualify for parental leave. He said that it was the intention that parents should be entitled to parental leave. Through tabling the amendment, I have tried to clarify the question of responsibility for care. Perhaps he will come to that later, but I should like him to comment on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The issues surrounding responsibility for care of a child will be covered in the consultation, and the regulations will be clear about them. I shall discuss those when we reach them.
<P>
As we said from the outset, common ground exists that parental leave is essentially for parents. It is for people who have parental responsibility for a child, who care for a child and who want to take leave in order to carry out those caring responsibilities. That concept is fundamental to the Government's interpretation.
<P>
In considering the issue, we are taking as a starting point people who have formal parental responsibility in law for the child on whose behalf they want to take leave. That clear guideline will be understood and clear to apply. We want to make sure that it fully meets the objectives of parental leave, and we shall consult on how to define it in the regulations. It will include a wide range of family circumstances. It will include unmarried parents who have parental responsibility, and adoptive parents. We may need to exclude some people with legal responsibility&#151;for example, bodies that have statutory, rather than personal, responsibility for children in care.
<P>
Some hon. Members raised the issue of foster care, which is a complex area. A range of types of foster parents exist, including those who provide overnight care, in cases involving a safety order; those who remove and maintain a child for 24 or 36 hours; those who provide respite care of children over weekends and holidays to enable the parents or carer to have time off, those who are on a register, usually run by the local authority, perhaps in conjunction with a charity; and those who regularly take in foster children, but usually only for a matter of weeks or months while the long-term care of the children, especially those with a physical or learning disability, is determined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Does the Minister recognise that we are facing a quandary, or even a conundrum? We want to encourage public-spirited carers who take short-term responsibility for children with tremendous difficulties, but who, because of their attitude to doing that, may place themselves in a vulnerable position with employers because of the time that they require. Will the Minister reflect on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Yes, I am trying to do so in pointing out the areas that require clarification in consultation.
<P>
Some foster parents become long-term foster parents and do one of two things. Sometimes the child remains in their custody&#151;although always under the legal care of the local authority&#151;and remains with the family throughout childhood and, indeed, sometimes into adulthood. Others transfer that long-term foster care at a later date to take parental responsibility, and adopt the child. Given such complexity, we have included bodies such as fostering agencies in the consultation process to consider further the question of parents involved in fostering arrangements. Time off work is not necessary the important issue, as many groups representing foster parents suggest. I give the hon. Member for Eastleigh the commitment that, at both the ministerial and the official levels of the consultation process, those involved in fostering will be fully consulted about the entitlements, if any, that they will have under the final regulations.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are holding discussions with the Lord Chancellor's Department because the Lord Chancellor is considering changing the law on the parental responsibilities of unmarried fathers. As the law stands, an unmarried father who wishes to have parental responsibility must apply to the courts, which must make a determination. The Lord Chancellor's Department is considering whether a new definition is needed to allow unmarried fathers other forms of access to parental responsibility as that might help to strengthen family life. Those continuing discussions may lead to consultations on the draft regulations that deal with those parents, if they have access to and responsibility for their children.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West tabled amendment No. 68, which would ensure that parental leave was given only to people with day-to-day responsibility to care for a child. The Bill makes it clear that parental leave will be for those with responsibility for a child, who care for a child, and who want to take leave to carry out those responsibilities. The regulations should provide for that.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 would tie responsibility for a child to the day-to-day care of that child. In many cases, the two go together, but there are some exceptions. For example, when parents split up, one of them may no longer be able to take day-to-day care of their children and the non-resident parent may even need to travel some distance to maintain contact with them. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that parental leave can be especially helpful to those parents. They may not have day-to-day contact with their children, but they may be responsible and committed to their upbringing.
<P>
From my experience of working in such matters, I know that when relationships break down and people fail to have access to their children, some very difficult problems can result&#151;children have even been snatched. One of the main reasons why those abductions take place is one or other parent's loss of access or the fear of losing access. It is crucial that we have the leeway in the regulations to take account of those difficult matters, which involve reasonable, responsible and committed people who have specific, genuine problems. The worries that have been expressed in the debate should not be used as a lever to prevent time off for proper access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the encouraging clarification that he is giving. Am I right to infer from his remarks that the regulations will be drafted in such a way that a parent or other employee must have a significant role in the care of a child? If that is so, I am greatly reassured. I am not trying to play semantic games, but I ask him to go a little further in his remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall not accept the hon. Gentleman's invitation. I do not think that I can be clearer about the definition of the word ``responsibility''&#151;a proven meaningful relationship must exist. We must take account of significant commitments and the sense of involvement when drafting the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I realise that we are all exploring this matter from different angles. Is the Minister saying that, when there is a clearer relationship&#151;perhaps a blood relationship, or some other legal relationship&#151;the matter is open and shut, but that, in relation to the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, people who walk off the street and say that they want to assume responsibilites but have no direct relationship of the sort that has been suggested will have to face a rather sterner test before establishing the right to parental leave?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We may be referring to step-parents or people who may become step-parents, as when one relationship breaks down, a new one tends to develop and need to develop. Children are vulnerable to the inability of adults, when they establish a new relationship, to take into account their children's need for a bond in the relationship, but such bonding is vital. That is why parents must remain responsible for their upbringing and have a relationship with them and a common-sense understanding of what a relationship is. It is not, as the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) suggested, a Saturday night out, following which one can have three months' unpaid parental leave. That is not the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the Minister of State for being so open about what he is thinking about these issues, but perhaps I can put two other cases to him. I do not expect him to answer immediately, but I hope that he will take them into account when considering the regulations.
<P>
The first relates to foster parents. My wife and I were short-term foster parents for some years. As the regulations stand&#151;I know that this is taking the point to ridiculous lengths&#151;I could effectively have been on parental leave all that time because, as I understand it, one can have three months for each child, and each child that we fostered was never there for more than a month or so.
<P>
Will the Minister of State also take into account the case of people who take children in? Swanage, for instance, has many language schools, and youngsters are taken in and looked after by families. Again, depending on the regulations, a silly situation could arise where someone professionally takes in children to look after them while they are at a language school. That could cause the employer difficulties because they want to keep chopping and changing with their wife, who perhaps normally looks after the family. Again, the regulations must be clear about the way in which the Bill deals with the issue. I am not trying to be difficult. I know that the Minister of State is trying to achieve his purpose rather than deal with any of those examples.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am loth to comment on the last example, because I am not clear what the hon. Gentleman was saying. It depends on the age of the child. An adult or a teenager would not be called a child. An employee of a language school that his children attend is like a schoolteacher. When the children are at the school, they are under the school's control for the legal purposes of education. That does not mean that the schoolteacher can thereafter claim three months' unpaid parental leave for every child in the classroom. That is clearly nonsense.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, he cannot deduce from my extensive remarks about foster parents that his own situation would be covered by the regulations. I made it clear that the purpose of the consultation on foster parents is to look at the intricacies with the fostering agencies in the public and the voluntary sector.

<P>

<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that parental leave would not arise as a result of a Saturday night stand, but what in the Bill would stop a right to parental leave being created in serial relationships where there are eligible children?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I do not want to do the hon. Lady a disservice, but I am not certain what she is getting at. The starting point is parental responsibility in law. I have made that clear in everything that I have said and, to be fair, I think that the hon. Members who have contributed to the debate accept it. Therefore, there is no disagreement about the starting point. We need to extend that in a few cases to others, such as local authorities, as I have said, but we must ensure that we meet the objective that those who have parental responsibility have access to unpaid parental leave.
<P>
That is why, when we draw up the regulations, the consultation must be widened so that there is clarity about the definitions and maximum support for them, both from employers and from organisations representing parents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My intervention is prompted by the exchanges that have just taken place. I invite the Minister to clarify the fact&#151;this is my understanding on first reading&#151;that if a person ceases to have responsibility as a parent, his or her entitlement to parental leave is extinguished.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. That goes back to my earlier point about responsibility in law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is being generous with his time. Should those circumstances arise, will there be a statutory requirement on a person who is already on parental leave to inform the employer that parental responsibility has ceased?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Someone who claims leave will have to justify it and continue to justify it. I assume that if someone falsely claims leave, that will be a matter for the employer to resolve. It may even be a matter for disciplinary proceedings by the employer. One cannot claim parental leave unless one qualifies for it.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the Minister make clear to which hon. Member he is giving way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. I give way to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to come back on this point because he seems to have misunderstood what I said. I was not referring to the situation in which an employee wrongly claims the right to parental leave. The Minister made it clear, in response to an earlier intervention, that if parental responsibility ceased during parental leave, then the right to that leave would end. Would there then be a statutory obligation to inform the employer that the circumstances had changed during the period of leave?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am loth to get bogged down in this but, to give an example, if a child is adopted and the natural father is no longer the father, he then has no legal responsibility for the child whatever. However, that covers a minuscule number of cases. The starting point is parental responsibility in law, and in that situation it would no longer exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I seek simply to help the Minister because he is trying to help the Committee.
<P>
The analogy that comes to my mind is the obligation on someone in receipt of benefit to advise the Department of Social Security of any material change in one's conditions. In the same way, we should like the Minister to reflect on whether if, sadly, the child died, that would be another case, because one would no longer be a parent. However, there would be some obligation on the employee to say to the employer, ``I was going to be away, but that is no longer the case.'' That would not disqualify the claim, but it would disqualify a continuing absence.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Given that we are having a debate about what should be included in the regulations, I shall reflect on what the hon. Gentleman has said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Perhaps I can help the Minister a little further. Will he confirm that, under the definition in the regulations, the concept of parental responsibility would extend to those people who have temporary responsibility for minors, such as those who agree to look after children attending language schools&#151;individuals in the community, not the teachers&#151;or to people who have au pairs under 18? Would those situations be embraced by the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It goes back to the point about parental responsibility in law. I think that we are in danger of over-egging the pudding, by thinking of 1,001 analogies, most of which are hypothetical in the extreme. I have set out the position as clearly and honestly as I can, so I shall deal with some of the other amendments.
<P>
Before we consider Amendment No. 37, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry, I shall answer some of the points that were raised.
<P>
The issue of parents who live away from home, which I believe was raised by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, is an important one. We do not intend to set a condition that, in order to qualify, a parent must be living at home. However, the purpose of parental leave is to provide child care, and we will consider how best to give effect to that in the regulations.
<P>
There is also the issue of unmarried fathers who live&#151;or do not live&#151;with a child. We are aware that family circumstances vary widely and we are considering how best to introduce parental leave to take account of that variation. As I said, where a relationship is clear, it should be sustained, because it is important to the child. The proposals should therefore take into account the comments that have been made.

The question of parental leave for step-parents was raised, to which I believe I responded. The hon. Member for Eastleigh mentioned the requirement of employers for proof of paternity. We may need to ensure that employers can satisfy themselves that a request for parental leave is genuine, without burdening them with the job of gatekeeper for the scheme. However, the point was well made and it is one with which we have sympathy.
<P>
The issue of retrospective leave was raised by the hon. Member for Daventry. As I said, we are still finalising the details of the scheme. In line with the directive, we intend to introduce parental leave by 15 December for children born or adopted after the introduction of the provision. Again, we shall consult on the details. We are working on the basis that there will not be retrospection in the sense described by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I confess that I was nearly defeated by amendment No. 37 because I was not quite sure of the motivation behind it. It appears to provide for unlimited parental leave, but that may be an unintended consequence of pinching the wording from the Irish legislation, which deals with paid parental leave. On balance, a move to unlimited, paid parental leave would be a step too far, even for this Government. The White Paper made it absolutely clear that our proposals were a settlement for this Parliament, and on that basis I must resist the amendment.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 38, it may well be that parental leave will be restricted to parents with children below school age. The explanatory note expresses our view that it is likely to be restricted to children below the age of eight. I think that it is a bit early to give a precise answer. The White Paper requested views on the matter, and we received substantial contributions from various organisations. However, the responses were varied and some were rather limited. It would be helpful if more specific proposals were put out for consultation to those organisations that represent employers, employees and parents, in order to get a better picture.
<P>
During the consultation process, agreement was expressed in rather general terms, although organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry were more specific. Once our proposals have been set out, the organisations concerned will, I hope, express their views with greater clarity.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Daventry that adopted children may have different requirements. The new powers contained in paragraphs 76 and 79 of the schedule will ensure that those requirements can be met. We want further to consider and consult on the needs of all disabled children, not only those with special educational needs.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members appreciate our efforts to ensure that the provisions attract the widest possible support among the public, employers and trade unions. The amendment would prevent that because it would inhibit the flexibility of our proposals. I hope that those explanations have substantively answered all the points made by the hon. Members and that they will withdraw their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the Minister for his extended and frank discussion of the amendments. He took them seriously and made a commitment to keep hon. Members informed about consultation on specific aspects of the regulations. For those reasons, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 50, line 11, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) A man may not satisfy these conditions on more than one occasion during any 12 month period.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be brief. Far be it from me to suggest that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, could be in error, but much of the debate on this issue probably took place in relation to the previous group of amendments. The purpose of the amendment is to recognise that men, for physiological reasons, can become fathers on many occasions, while women are subject to biological constraints that limit the number of children that they can have in a given period. It is a probing amendment that registers the point that I also intended to make with amendment No. 68.
<P>
A man can have a biological relationship with a child, a financial and legal responsibility for a child determined by the Child Support Agency or even limited access to a child, but there is a world of difference between that and any meaningful obligation or responsibility to care for a child. In using the word ``man'', I mean father&#151;

<P>

<B>Barbara Follett </B>(Stevenage): A friend of mine adopted a child, and then gave birth to a child herself exactly 10 months later. She would therefore have had to take leave twice in a year. Why does the hon. Gentleman limit the amendment to a man?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> All of the amendments intend to put a little flesh on the bones of the Bill, in a way that I hope is reasonable. Clearly, the hon. Lady's Friend would not have been affected biologically, but I accept that a reasonable case could be made for the legislation to cover such situations. The fact remains, however, that there are men who, as a result of serial relationships, have a large number of children, for whom they may be held to have responsibility. No provision in the Bill limits such circumstances.
<P>
It is unfortunate&#151;our debate on the previous group of amendments showed this&#151;that we have to debate enabling legislation, not a proper detailed Bill. In such circumstances, we must put trust in the Minister to consult sensibly and lay sensible regulations.
<P>
I want to register the further point that the definition that is applied must be one of real responsibility to care, not merely a blood relationship, a legal and financial responsibility or limited access. I accept what the Minister said about the importance of having sufficient time for travel in certain circumstances&#151;some of which are particularly difficult&#151;and the Government must face those problems when they try to formulate sensible regulations. I hope that the Minister accepts&#151;once again&#151;that it is important that a mere blood relationship cannot be sufficient if there is no evidence of a genuine responsibility to care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I shall respond to the amendment in the spirit in which it was moved, although it is dramatically badly worded. If the hon. Gentleman pushes it to a vote, we shall resist it.
<P>
As we keep saying, the starting point is parental responsibility and love. Not for the first time, the hon. Gentleman has moved an amendment that is intended to flush out the contents of the regulations, but his approach is based on a false premise. People who have no relationship to a child or responsibility for him or her will not be covered by parental leave&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman entirely misunderstands me. I referred to someone who was beyond question the father of the child but who does nothing to care for him or her.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I do not consider that there is a need for such a restriction in the Bill. We are considering the details of the scheme, and we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards against individuals seeking to take numerous periods of leave, thus disrupting their employer's business. The regulations are likely to specify a minimum period for parental leave and, where there are good reasons, employers will be able to postpone leave. We shall discuss that in more detail later in relation to another amendment.
<P>
I hope that I have not misunderstood the hon. Gentleman again. Every time that I say something, I appear to have misunderstood him. I listened carefully to him, and I thought that the amendment would restrict men but not women. If so, there are strong objections to it, because it would constitute unequal treatment of men. Such a restriction applying to men but not women would be clearly discriminatory, and directly contrary to sex discrimination legislation. It could therefore have no effect in law, and it would send entirely the wrong message about the need for fathers, as well as mothers, to balance work and home life. One of the benefits of the parental leave provisions will be in encouraging a culture where it is accepted as right and proper for fathers and mothers to spend quality time with their children. The amendment would completely undermine that objective.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary and the hon. Gentleman's points&#151;especially those about the difficulties associated with leave paid&#151;will be dealt with in the regulations. Minimum periods and the fact that good employers will be able to postpone leave are relevant in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the slight improvements in the information that he has given and for his statement that there are likely to be minimum leave periods. I make no bones about the fact that this is a probing amendment. Although it is tempting to discuss sexual discrimination in this context, I shall not refer to, for example, all-women shortlists.
<P>
The Minister could give more exercise to parliamentary draftsmen. Drafting the Bill was clearly not enough for them&#151;they were not asked to draft a detailed Bill. They could draft an amendment that would refer to natural parents and, introduce a time limit in relation to a child's natural parents. That would avoid the difficulties to which he referred.
<P>
There are differences between men and women in terms of the parental responsibilities that are contained in the Bill. Sadly, there are also often differences between men and women in terms of the seriousness with which they take their responsibilities to care for their children. The Government should ensure that the detailed regulations are not allowed to prejudice the profitable operation of businesses.
<P>
I do not wish to press the amendment to a Division, but I hope that the Minister of State will take my points seriously. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and shall have regard to the reasonable requirements of those businesses on whose employees rights are conferred under this chapter.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The purpose behind the amendments is to obtain clarification on the specification of periods of absence, their monitoring and the procedure between the employer and the employee to record clearly that leave has been taken. Again, we are striving for clarity and balance, while recognising the needs of the employee and the employer. We need clear rules and to know what the obligations are. We must strike a balance between flexibility and clarity.
<P>
A number of important factors are involved. Factors highlighted in the explanatory notes to the Bill in respect of matters such as postponing leave include peak business periods, a peak period of regular absences in the firm or the particular employee's key skills and responsibilities.
<P>
I want to probe the Minister's thinking. How will the regulations define what is appropriate in specific cases? How should the timing of parental leave be specified? Should it be in blocks of one or two months or the whole three months? Should there be a minimum length of parental leave that can be taken for example, a week, a day or even half a day? How will the employer's needs be balanced with the employee's needs? How far will the regulations go in defining a wide range of possible cases where parental leave will be requested? How much will be defined in the regulations and how much left to employment tribunals to decide what is reasonable?
<P>
What about part-time workers? Is it intended that they will have a pro rata entitlement to parental leave, specified as I suggest in my amendment? Would it be the same as that set out in the working time regulations, where full-time workers are entitled to 13 weeks? Assuming a five-day working week, would a part-time worker working three days a week be entitled to eight weeks' parental leave? Some clarification on that would be helpful. We also need a definition of the working week, because many people work irregular or variable hours at different times of the working cycle. How will we calculate their entitlement in terms of the hours that they work?
<P>
Equally important in the amendment is the monitoring of parental leave if it is not taken as a single three-month period. The Bill must define how we record which of the two parents has taken leave, how much has been taken and for which child. We need a simple, uncluttered system. While the piecemeal approach is perhaps desirable in family circumstances, it can make record keeping much more onerous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there are considerable difficulties in prescribing the amount of work done in a working week where there are two employers or where home work is taken in and two or three different people may be involved? It will be important to clarify overlapping rights and responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I shall refer later to cases where people have more than one employer, but the question of home workers is particularly interesting, and the Minister of State can no doubt give us guidance on it.
<P>
The key issue is how to record parental leave taken when an employee changes jobs. It is intended that employers would maintain a certificate of the amount of parental leave taken to be given to the employee on leaving that employment for another job? I am talking about people changing employers when they have taken part of their entitlement to parental leave. Will the requirement be that a certificate is provided by the employer and passed to the new employer to allow the remaining allowance of parental leave to be granted? If such a certificate is not provided, will that entitlement be granted? I am trying to achieve a balance between making employers' record-keeping simple and having a robust monitoring system so that parental leave entitlement is not exploited.
<P>
There is also the question, as the hon. Member for Daventry said, of the employee who has several jobs. Record-keeping in that case must be able to deal with leave taken from either or both the employers for whom the employee could be working at any one time.
<P>
We must also look at the question of giving notice for specified periods of parental leave. It is clear from the general tone of the Committee that hon. Members agree that small firms have problems, which we hope to iron out as we define the regulations. One of the problems is planning with a small work force and the need, therefore, to receive a notice of intent from a parent who wishes to exercise the right to parental leave. Will the regulations give employers the right to refuse parental leave unless, for example, they are given a month's notice by the employee? I expect that employers would be flexible, particularly around the birth of a child, because clearly one cannot give notice of that; nature takes its course. However, we need to know what notice will be specified and whether it should be regardless of whether partial leave or the full entitlement was requested.
<P>
Finally, we need to know whether the regulations will require employees to agree a fixed date on which they will return to work, having taken part of their parental leave. Having taken a part, they may say later, ``I would like to extend it to my full entitlement.'' Unlike maternity leave, where there is no requirement on the mother to give a commitment to return to work, there is a case for saying that a parent taking parental leave should be asked to give a fixed date for their return to work.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Amendment No. 53 is an interesting and constructive suggestion, requiring the specification of 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a maximum period of absence which may be taken as part of a period of parental leave.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The theory behind that is consistent with the general approach of companies, for example towards holiday entitlement. Does the hon. Gentleman have in mind a maximum period?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> As I understand it, the thinking behind the Bill is that the entitlement should be three months, as is set out in the directive, I believe. However, it is not clear whether that could subsequently be extended.
<P>
To take the hon. Gentleman's point a stage further, we need to discuss whether the Government intend the leave to be taken only as a three-month block or whether there should be flexibility to chop it up into smaller parts of a month, a week or whatever. Different firms, organisations and practices will have different preferences, as will the parents, but it is still not clear how the regulations will deal with that.
<P>
Finally, I want to hear from the Minister whether an employee should be obliged to give notice of his intention to extend parental leave, where he or she has taken only part of the full entitlement. That is a key point. I await the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before I speak to my own amendment, may I say that I largely concur with the remarks of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. It is important to probe the Government on this matter. Responsible employer representations that we have received make it clear that employers are in the dark on several of these issues. Before the regulations are made, we should all be enlightened on those issues.
<P>
I pause briefly to say that I am aware of some of the definitional points, which I was going to discuss. The Minister will need to respond to those points in Committee and&#151;probably&#151;before the consultation period, which he will initiate.
<P>
The representations of the engineering employers are interesting. They suggest that the norm should be a three-month period en bloc.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Perhaps they represent a particular point of view. They deal mainly with larger firms in the production process, which may not want to suffer chops and changes and disruption. In many cases, it would be more satisfactory for the parent and firms to arrange a short priod of time off over a longer period, which would be for everyone's benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes, I agree, I was going to say that a three-month period would be reasonable for engineering employers. That is based on the presumption that the maximum period to be prescribed will be three months, but the Minister needs to clarify that matter. The hon. Gentleman has said that it is appropriate for process industries to have a longer period, but it may make sense for smaller employers and service industries to use an arrangement involving shorter periods.
<P>
That raises another matter on which I hope the Minister will reflect. There may be a collective arrangement between unions and employers in a recognised shop, in which such terms are the norm. However, there may be individuals whose situation does not fit the collective agreement, and it might be wise to consider whether it is possible for agreement to be reached between those parties, notwithstanding the collective agreement. That is an attempt not to subvert trade union rights but to reflect the realities of the situation.
<P>
On record-keeping, I must re-emphasise what the hon. Member for Eastleigh said. As the Minister is well aware, we learned from the national minimum wage about the complexity of employee relations, especially in relation to the type of work that is done, the types of arrangements that are involved, which include agency and home work, and the overlapping employments that can arise at any one time. An employer might think that he had discharged his responsibilities, but if an employee had ceased to work for a second employer without notifying the first employer, there might still be residual obligations or entitlements.
<P>
My amendment No. 39 is designed to bolt onto the regulations a general provision that one should try to make the regulations fit the interests of business, which is not objectionable or difficult. That approach, which has recently become a little more common in our legislation, may involve a continental model and may therefore appeal to Labour Members.
<P>
The regulations need to be clear, intelligible, enforceable, relatively easy to advise on&#151;if necessary&#151;and simple, as far as that is consistent with the interests of justice. We shall argue later in our consideration of the Bill that the Employment Services, ACAS and others will have to take employers through the process and help to smooth out any difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I do not want to minimise the potential attraction of our amendment to Labour Members, but does my hon. Friend agree that whatever the merits&#151;or otherwise&#151;of the European model in this context, Committee members can learn from the American practice, which facilitates maximum flexibility for small companies in particular?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is an acknowledged expert on American practice. We have a lot to learn from America, which has a dynamic economy and has increased employment, almost always through small employers. We disregard that experience at our peril. I have the feeling that those considerations will surface again and again in our deliberations and I am sure that when my hon. Friend is in Committee, he will not allow me to forget them, nor shall I do so.
<P>
Therefore, in a mid-Atlantic, bipartisan way, we can say yes, we are concerned about the interests of business; yes, it is important that the regulations should bear them in mind, and that is not a disguised attack on employee rights or anything else. Indeed, it would be entirely consistent with the lapidary phrases coming from the lips of the Secretary of State about the importance of business, which I shared with the House on Second Reading, causing some distress to several Labour Members, who seemed to think that he was overlooking the interests of workers. They also seemed to think that it was I who uttered those words&#151;the voice of Jacob at the hands of Esau, or the other way round.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, we make the point, which the Minister made with some conviction but we would like him to make again, that he must think about the interests of business and make the regulations as workable and as sensible as possible. The amendment endeavours to spur him in that direction. So in tabling the amendment and speaking to it, I re-emphasise our support for the general concepts behind the probing amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastleigh, and we look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Eastleigh should be debated under amendment No. 49, which deals with notice and records.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh mentioned part-time workers, who are covered pro rata. On home working, under the national minimum wage regulations, two things apply. First, to qualify for parental leave, a home worker must meet the qualifications of working for an employer for at least a year. The minimum wage regulations provide for recording time worked and income received. That is the first attempt quantitatively to determine, for the employer and for the home worker, time worked and its relation to pay. In terms of assisting home workers and the relationship between home workers and their employers, the Government have started the process of trying to resolve some difficult issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I had rather anticipated that reply. I infer from what the Minister says that he would seek to apply the concepts behind the minimum wage definition of home workers, converting work into hours, to whatever regulations are included for part-time workers, who are also home workers under the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Home workers are not necessarily part-time workers. I am just trying to emphasise that, in drafting legislation, the Government are aware of the needs of home workers, but that those needs vary depending on the legislation. All I am saying is that, whenever the issue of home working is raised, the Government seek, in their regulatory consultation, to deal with home workers in a way that is sympathetic to their needs and to their relationship with employers. That is all that the hon. Gentleman need read into what I have said.
<P>
The issue of job changes was also raised. That issue will form part of the consultation and must be resolved, although I cannot give the Committee a detailed analysis of how that will be done. However, I assure hon. Members that there will be consultation and the Government will consider what action is necessary to deal with the issue, both in relation to individuals and employers. The hon. Member for Eastleigh's point is well made.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to collective or workplace agreements. A collective agreement may be with a trade union; the workplace agreement does not have to be with a trade union but may be with the work force. That is why the CBI and others have welcomed the relationship between new sections 76 and 81, which are aimed at reaching an agreement with the work force, through a collective or workplace agreement, that deals with issues that relate to the needs of the enterprise. That flexibility has been welcomed by employers and employee organisations. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the wish of the hon. Member for Eastleigh for a flexible scheme for parental leave. In many cases a single period of absence may suit neither employee nor employer, who may prefer a couple of breaks or a number of shorter ones, where the absence can be more easily covered. My instincts are to allow employers and employees to agree whatever system of parental leave best meets their needs. We have provided new section 81 so that such agreements can be reached. Whatever we put into the regulations, employers and employees will be able to agree their own arrangements where appropriate. It is important to give that commitment.
<P>
Once again, it would not be right to tie our hands before we have consulted on the details of a statutory scheme. We know that there will be a trade-off between simplicity and flexibility&#151;a point that the hon. Member for Eastleigh made at the outset. I am glad that he recognised that. It may be best to have a simple statutory scheme that will be straightforward to operate, although perhaps not ideal in terms of flexibility, and to encourage people to work in partnership to improve it at their workplace. Therefore, there is still a need to get the right balance between simplicity and flexibility and to allow employees and employers to agree a system of parental leave that meets the needs of their enterprise.
<P>
Hon. Members may welcome an assurance that we aim to keep paperwork to the minimum. That is why we want to consult further. It would not be right to rule out any options, and I hope that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will not press amendment No. 57.
<P>
Amendment No. 58 relates to the circumstances in which an employee who wants to take parental leave may legitimately be disappointed. I have great sympathy with hon Members' wish to ensure that employers are not left in the lurch at particularly difficult times. Equally, we must ensure that employees can exercise their legitimate right to take parental leave. The existing provisions allow us to make that balance.
<P>
The regulations will provide that business can postpone parental leave in reasonable circumstances. The employer's interests will have to be weighed against the employee's. A parent who wants to be with a child recovering from an operation cannot postpone that need, but one who simply wants some time with a child might be asked not to take it during a rush period in the workplace.
<P>
Hon. Members may be concerned about popular times such as Christmas or school holidays. That is a management issue that must be faced now in each workplace. The management must deal with the same dilemmas now, regardless of the directive.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Will the Minister comment on my concerns about a requirement or lack of one for employees to give due notice if they wish to take parental leave, particularly in the circumstances that he has described?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That issue arises later and I should prefer to deal with it then, when we shall have clarity about the issues that are available. I am not dodging the issue.
<P>
There are already management issues around leave at critical periods of production or when there are peaks and troughs in the demand for goods and services, for instance at Christmas or during holiday periods. The directive does not change that. Those periods must still be managed. People want to spend time with their families at these times, and employers must already deal with that. If they want to postpone leave, they can do so, provided that there are good business reasons that outweigh the employee's needs. That is part of good relations and rights and responsibilities towards one another&#151;the whole process of partnership in the workplace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I apologise to the Minister in advance if he has already addressed this point. Will the regulations specify the proportion of employees who are entitled to take leave at any one time, or will that be left to local discretion?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman did not have to apologise; the point has not been raised in that context. An individual right is at issue. Management must strike a balance in making decisions that affect the business. If 45 out of 50 employees said on Friday that they wanted Monday off, it would be reasonable for an employer to suggest an alternative arrangement. Management must have a relationship with employees that allows it to take a lead in a way that is as non-disruptive to the company and its activities as possible. Employees will increasingly work in such a way, because they want to take holidays, but they also want to return to a successful enterprise to which they are committed. If the right balance can be struck between work responsibilities and family responsibilities, employees will be committed to the workplace and the company.
<P>
It is not easy to strike such a balance. If it were, I would not give as much time to the consultation on the regulatory regime. We cannot anticipate every possible case in drafting regulations. That is why the balance is so important, and I shall spend my time on getting it right. The last thing that the Government want to do is introduce legislation to improve and develop relations in the workplace in a ham-handed or cack-handed way. Our aim is to support and encourage good practice.
<P>
Parental leave is useful to employers and employees, and it is a practical solution where employees need a spell of leave to care for their children. I am trying to meet the concerns expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee&#151;everybody agrees with the concept and principle of parental leave; the question is how can that leave be taken in a non-disruptive and effective way for the employer and employee. That is why opportunity will be provided for further comment on the draft regulations before they are laid before the House. On that basis, I hope that hon. Members will withdraw their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He has made it clear that he recognises the difficulty and complexity of the task in front of him. For those reasons, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 50, line 32, leave out from beginning to end of line 4 on page 51.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee long with the amendment, even though it appears radical because it removes a whole section from the schedule&#151;[Interruption.] it is a probing amendment on the nature of the contract or relationship with employees during the period of parental leave.
<P>
This morning, the Minister helpfully and positively made some points about the need for communication with employees taking leave&#151;maternity leave in that case, but the same principle would apply&#151;in relation to any changes in terms or conditions of employement that might arise. Such changes may or may not include trade union recognition. The Opposition want to clarify the legal basis on which that would take place. With respect to the Minister, most Committee members and, indeed, myself, we are moving into what is essentially lawyers' territory, and I am not particularly confident about any view that I might hold on such matters. I am simply recording, for the Committee's benefit, the doubts and concerns that surfaced most explicitly in the briefing from the Engineering Employers Federation, and which drew on the analogy of maternity leave.
<P>
In the past, under maternity leave, the contract of employment has effectively been suspended. The 1998 Court of Appeal case, the charmingly named Halfpenny v. IGE Medical Systems Ltd., established the suspension of a contract of employment during maternity leave. However, the contract could be revived when a women correctly exercised her right to return.
<P>
I see nothing wrong in principle with that approach to parental leave. However, the regulations need to define the current position and the status of the contract of employment. In that respect, they need to draw on the experience of maternity leave, which has been less than utterly smooth. Whatever the outcome, the regulations must be entirely workable and must clarify the rights of employers and employees. I hope that the Minister of State will respond to that point in the spirit in which I have raised it.

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The Government's prime aim in crafting the provisions is to create simple, straightforward legislation, insofar as this complex matter allows. We want to improve the current provisions by removing complexity wherever possible. During the consultation period, employers and employees wholeheartedly endorsed that approach. Although it was perhaps acting against its own best interests, even the legal profession called for simplification of the current proposals.
<P>
Against that background, Opposition Members must take care to ensure that their probing amendments do not repeat past mistakes. The amendment would create the same confusion about parental leave as currently exists with regard to the longer period of maternity absence.
<P>
What effect would the amendment have on the employee's terms and conditions of employment during parental leave? We are removing the confusion that surrounds additional maternity leave by considering it as leave, and by specifying the terms, if any, that will continue throughout it.
<P>
The concluding remarks of the hon. Member for Daventry suggested that he was content with that approach. Most of the respondents to the consultation exercise took the same view. Ninety per cent. of respondents, including three quarters of employers organisations, said that they wanted us to proceed in that way.
<P>
We do not want the complexities that we are removing from maternity leave to be reintroduced into parental leave. New section 77 will entitle us to specify which, if any, of the benefits of the employment contract should continue during and after parental leave. Of course, we do not want parental leave to impose onerous burdens on employers, but we do want to reduce doubt and uncertainty. I believe that there is common ground on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am possibly anticipating a point that the Minister of State is about to make. The explanatory notes also make it clear that, in certain respects, the provision will enable employee obligations such as duties of confidentiality to be continued. Will he confirm that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall come to that point, which I shall be happy to confirm during my response.
<P>
As the explanatory note makes clear, we intend generally to leave employers free to decide their terms and conditions during a period of parental leave. New section 77(2)(b) will ensure that the regulations cannot require pay to continue during parental leave. Nevertheless, employers can choose to pay employees who are on parental leave, and some already do. We hope that employers will increasingly see the benefits of family-friendly policies, which encourage and motivate a productive work force. However, we wish to ensure that even if an employer does not choose to offer benefits during parental leave, the contract will be kept alive.
<P>
The regulations may therefore specify that employees and employers should agree to be bound by confidentiality and trust, as the hon. Member for Daventry said. If an employer chooses not to continue benefits during leave, the employee will not lose any accrued rights. In effect, those benefits will be suspended during leave, and, under the powers of new section 77(4)(b), they will be reactivated on return.
<P>
That, I believe, is the clarification that the hon. Gentleman sought. I cannot comment on the legal case that he cited, but we aim to cover the point that he was trying to make&#151;albeit that the hon. Gentleman was talking about reactivation. New section 77(4)(b) would reactivate benefits and accrued rights. The amendment could therefore prevent us from achieving those desirable results. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister of State. It was a classic probing amendment. We all seek a degree of clarity. There may be a theological dispute among lawyers as to whether a contract is continued or suspended. Perhaps we should leave it to the lawyers. However, we shall need a set of regulations that make clear what rights and obligations continue when leave is being taken and how they are reactivated thereafter.
<P>
There are several ways of skinning a cat. The Minister and the Committee are at one on the matter. Our exchanges have clarified the outstanding concerns. We hope that the Minister will produce some workable regulations as a result. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 51, line 5, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.

<P>
No. 64, in page 51, line 24, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 41, in page 51, leave out lines 25 to 27.
<P>
No. 42, in page 51, line 30, after first `leave', insert `(excluding additional maternity leave)'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am sure that you will be pleased to know, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I intend to be brief, primarily because many of the questions that arise from the amendment have already been given by the Minister in his fulsome replies to other amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 60, 61, 62 and 63 would simply change ``may'' to ``shall''. The intention is to attempt to draw from the Minister more specific information about what will be set down in regulations, in order to give clarity to both employers and employees. As I said, the Minister has already gone some way to explaining that, so I shall not dwell on those amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 65 would add the requirement that consent should not be ``unreasonably withheld''. It is intended to provide some protection for employees and some guidance to employment tribunals. I call upon the Minister to say whether any progress can be made in putting in the Bill the route by which employees can demonstrate to a tribunal that they have made a complaint to an employer and that the employer has unreasonably denied them parental leave.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Briefly, and in the same spirit, amendments Nos 41 and 42 are essentially probing amendments. First, we want to know what is meant by transferring an entitlement from one employee to another. They presumably will both have parental responsibilities, and the implication is that they would be for the same child. Secondly, amendment No. 42 is about the interaction between maternity leave and parental leave, and whether they can be claimed in parallel or consecutively. If the Minister can respond to those points, we should be content with a good day's work.
<P>
