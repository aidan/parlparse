<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call Sir George Young to move the sittings motion, I welcome Members to the Committee. I am confident that the Committee will handle this private Member's Bill efficiently and in good order.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young </B>(North-West Hampshire): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"That, during proceedings on the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>

<P>
I am delighted that the Committee is to meet under your benign but firm chairmanship, Mr. Winterton. I hope that this Bill does not take as long to consider as the Finance Bill which I piloted to the statute book in 1994. That Bill was in Committee for several months.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin proceedings, I remind the Committee that copies of a financial resolution connected to the Bill are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that they must give adequate notice of amendments. As a general rule, I and my co-Chairman do not intend to call starred amendments, including those that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee. I hope that that information will be helpful to all hon. Members.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I echo the words of my right hon. Friend in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton. I hope that the Committee will be fruitful and businesslike in its consideration of this substantial Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 65 is a modest, probing amendment. It is meant to clarify that clause 1 will cover services provided by motor cycles in addition to those provided by four-wheel vehicles. It has been suggested to me that any doubts in this regard should be clarified and dispelled. I therefore hope that it can be put on the record that the Bill will cover motor-cycle services. If that is not so, I hope that Committee members will accept my amendment so that the matter can be put beyond peradventure.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> I hope that I can quickly reassure my right hon. Friend. I understand his wish to see the embrace of my Bill extended to motor bikes. I am advised that the definition of private hire vehicles in clause 1 includes motor cycles. That is no coincidence because as some hon. Members may know London already has some PHV bike firms. I agree with my right hon. Friend that such firms should be covered by the Bill. With that assurance, I hope that my right hon. Friend will agree to withdraw his amendment so that we can get proceedings off to a good start.
<P>
The remaining amendments have been tabled in my name. They are minor, technical amendments, designed to improve the drafting of the Bill. Amendment No. 64 specifies that paragraph 1 of schedule 1 should be deleted. That is because the deregulation proposal mirrored by the amendment has been withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> In the light of my right hon. Friend's comments, I am satisfied that the meaning of the clause is as I had hoped. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 22, in page 1, line 9, leave out "one or more". [Sir George Young.]
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 1, line 13, leave out from "accepts" to end of line 14 and insert "private hire bookings".
<P>

<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> These are drafting amendments intended to make the Bill clearer. The key amendment is amendment No. 25, which defines a private hire booking as a booking for the hire of a private hire vehicles for the purpose of carrying one or more passengers. The definition makes it clear that when one operator subcontracts to another a booking that the first operator has taken, the subcontract must be treated as an ordinary booking by the second operator; for example, he has to fulfil it using a licensed vehicle and driver and to keep proper records of the booking.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 are drafting amendments that clarify the meaning of clause 2. That clause requires London minicab operators to have the necessary licence and will impose a penalty of those that do not. The amendments describe what a person to whom the clause applies must do to act as an operator: to make provision for the acceptance of minicab bookings, or to invite them.
<P>
The other amendments are consequential on the adoption of the definition in amendment No. 25.
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We now have the opportunity to start to consider the substance of and intentions behind the Bill.[Mr. Forth] I want to make some points covering enhanced safety provision and to use the amendments to probe the issue of enforcement under the Bill. I hope that I may be allowed to return to that theme from time to time during our deliberations, because one of the main criteria by which the Bill will stand or fall will be the effectiveness of its enforcement. Most people with whom I have discussed the matter have agreed that existing law has not been enforced effectively, and that that, more than almost anything else, has given rise to many of the difficulties in the existing trade as defined in current law. Therefore it is crucial that we should satisfy ourselves that the Bill, should it reach the statute book, will be properly enforced. Perhaps through the amendments I may persuade my right hon. Friend or I hope the Minister, to give the Committee some of their ideas about provision for enforcement, including the resources that will be available. It will be possible to discuss finance in more detail later, but at this stage we should explore the likely extent, appropriateness and adequacy of enforcement with respect to what will, after the passing of the Bill, remain a very large body of licensed private hire vehicles.
<P>
Amendment No. 66 concentrates on safety of users of private hire vehicles, a key element of the Bill. Under the amendment, all the employees of an operator would need credentials to show that they had no relevant criminal convictions. Great stress has been laid, understandably, on the need for customers of private hire vehicles to be reassured that drivers would not have previous criminal convictions. The other employees of the operators should be able to provide similar reassurance, if only because many of them would have access to the names and addresses of, and the bookings made by, the customers of the private hire vehicle service. To that extent customers might and I stress that they only might be vulnerable to abuse of that privileged position and the information needed for the booking process. Vulnerable women come to mind in that context, but in the light of yesterday's proceedings in the House, I am tempted to say that young, vulnerable males may be of just as much concern. However, that is another matter.
<P>
I hope that, having considered the amendment in a serious and constructive way, the Bill's promoter and the Minister will make their own judgment about whether it would strengthen the measure's effect in providing reassurances about safety to users of private hire vehicles, given the sort of information that will inevitably pass through the hands of the operator.
<P>
I hope that I shall not be out of order, Mr. Winterton, in mentioning, with respect to amendment No. 67, that a later amendment, No. 75 to clause 7, covers the same territory. Amendment No. 67 is my contribution to provoking a debate in Committee about the view of the Bill's promoter and the Minister on the crucial matter of wheelchair access to private hire vehicles. That is a difficult but important subject. Forthcoming provisions for dealing with the matter will apply to the taxicab trade.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Does the Committee view the private hire vehicle sector of the trade in the same light as taxicabs, or as separate and different? That is a fundamental question.
<P>
Are private hire vehicles, which would be licensed under the Bill, considered to be a permanent and essential part of transport provision in London? If so, is not it legitimate, necessary and desirable for the Bill to include provisions for access for wheelchair-bound people to a crucial part of the transport service in greater London? I hope that the promoter and the Minster will respond fully, if only to clarify our view of that aspect of private hire.
<P>
If the amendment was accepted, any private hire vehicle operator who was approached by a wheelchair-bound person would have an obligation, if not to provide a service directly some operators are small, and perhaps use only one car at least to demonstrate a capacity to provide the service, for example, through subcontracting or mutual agreement arrangement. I tabled the amendment in the spirit that has driven previous measures on the subject that of equality of access for people who are wheelchair bound to various services.
<P>
Why should the private hire vehicle sector, which will continue to be crucial be different from public transport or the taxicab trade? I hope that the amendment will provoke a comprehensive response about provision of access for wheelchair-bound people to a licensed service and thus a legitimate part of transport services in London.
<P>
The answer depends on our estimate of how many private hire vehicles will continue to operate in greater London if the Bill is fully implemented. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) will give amendment No. 67 serious attention.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 is a probing amendment intended to clarify the sort of regime that is envisaged for the licensing process. We may return to the subject later when we consider the two other legs drivers and vehicles of the three-legged licensing regime. I raise the matter now as a general topic.
<P>
It strikes me forcefully that we are considering an apparatus for vetting and licensing operators, drivers and vehicles. That raises important matters, about which the Committee should be satisfied before we complete our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
How many operators will seek to be licensed under the Bill? Many important considerations will follow from that, not least the manpower and resources that will be required by the licensing authority to undertake initial licensing and relicensing. My amendment is relevant because it explores the difference in resource requirements between a five or a three-year regime. We can return to the issue later when we discuss a one-year licensing cycle.
<P>
If the licensing process is to be effective we must bear that in mind throughout our debate or else we are wasting our time how large will the licensing body have to be, initially and on-going, effectively to discharge the responsibilities outlined in clause 3 and elsewhere and to provide the necessary assurances to customers using this crucial sector of London transport? I hope and expect that my right hon. Friend and the Minister will provide us with detailed projections of operators, drivers and vehicles in relation to the size and scale of the licensing body required to maintain an effective licensing regime.
<P>
A further consideration is the time scale. Lest anyone misunderstands, I am assuming I may be wrong and I hope to receive clarification that there is no possibility of the regime outlined in the Bill coming into effect in days, weeks or even months. My advice from experts in these matters is that it will take years effectively to establish and operate the bureaucracy necessary to fulfil all the licensing requirements in this clause for operators and in later clauses for vehicles and drivers.
<P>
It is important for people to understand that even if the Bill provides a start in the process that many hope will solve many transport problems, its full implementation and effectiveness will inevitably take time which, in turn, will impact on the resources and manpower required in the first place and later. I add as a postscript we shall have to return to this important issue later that all that will read across into the level of fees to be imposed on those seeking licences, since we are told that the regime will have to be self-financing.
<P>
I would not say that we have circularity, but we seem to have interdependence of argument here. The numbers of licensees, operators, drivers and vehicles and the size of the bureaucracy necessary to implement and continue the licensing regime, bearing in mind that the scheme is to be self-financing, will necessarily affect the determination of the level of the licence. But that is not the end of the story, because the licence fee will read across into the number of people operating. I shall return to the matter later when we debate more appropriate clauses, but I wanted to put down a marker and apprise my right hon. Friend of my thinking.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 is wholly different. It is a detailed amendment and has a passing importance. It arose in response to discussions with people who are intimately involved with the varying aspects of the trade. I put the amendment more tentatively than the others but it was put to me that difficulties can arise from and nuisance can be caused by casual parking of vehicles in public thoroughfares. It was thus suggested that one of the requirements of an operator's licence should be that the operator's premises make provision for proper parking, preferably off street although I have not put that in the amendment.
<P>
One could argue that there is a safety element to this, as there is to almost every aspect of the Bill. One could argue that it might discourage touting because if operators' vehicles were properly parked in an identified area it would minimise the likelihood or possibility of cars not belonging to that operator, or perhaps even belonging to him, being parked in the street nearby or outside and being hailed illegally by someone walking along the pavement.
<P>
I do not press the matter too far it is a thought that occurred to me in framing the amendment. I mention it because we should briefly consider whether such a provision should be included in the operator's licence to deal with an issue that has been raised with me by at least one person. I think that I have now covered all the amendments standing in my name; if I have not, Mr. Winterton, I may seek to catch your eye again.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> Before I deal with my right hon. Friend's detailed points, I shall deal with some of the more general ones. The Minister may seek to catch your eye, Mr. Winterton, to say a word or two about enforcement. My right hon. Friend will have seen that on Second Reading I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is no point in legislating without enforcement." [Official Report, 23 January 1988; Vol. 304, c. 1258.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend that the Bill must be enforced.
<P>
On the phasing in of the Bill, I envisage that operators will be licensed and that over a period of time vehicles and drivers will be included. The Minister may want to say something about the phased implementation of the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
My right hon. Friend also raised a philosophical point about whether it was my intention or the purpose of the Bill to lead to a unified trade whereby minicabs and the black cabs operate under a common umbrella. That point was raised on Second Reading. My Bill is neutral on that. We may end up with a unified trade or we may not. All that my Bill seeks to do is to extend to London the provisions for minicabs that exist outside. If it led to a unified trade it could be argued that having a common Public Carriage Office licensing both was an assistance, but it is not an object of my Bill to lead to a unified trade.
<P>
My right hon. Friend also said that the Bill raised important principles, and he addressed his remarks to the issue of licensing operators. Yes it does, but these principles have been addressed everywhere else in the country. Everywhere but London has come to terms with some of the issues that my right hon. Friend has mentioned, such as fees, the bureaucracy and the need to license operators. This is not virgin territory. It extends a regime that exists outside.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My right hon. Friend rightly points out that this is done elsewhere, but he must be aware that it is not necessarily done perfectly or without difficulty. Again, it has been put to me on a number of occasions that there are a considerable number of problems in other large conurbations such as Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham with different aspects of their licensing regimes. Simply to say that because they have it we should have it I am sure that my right hon. Friend did not intend that risks ignoring the considerable problems with the different licensing regimes in those other places.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> We will come to various parts of the Bill where the provisions for London are different and where we have, to some extent, been able to build on the experience from outside. I will deal with those as we come to them.
<P>
I turn now to my right hon. Friend's more detailed amendments. Amendments Nos. 66 and 70 deal with criminal convictions and operators' licences. In drafting the amendments, my right hon. Friend will have read clause 15(3)(b), which enables the Secretary of State to require an applicant for an operator's licence to furnish particulars of any convictions recorded against him,[Sir George Young] irrespective of the offence. The Bill therefore makes provision for operators. My right hon. Friend went slightly further: I believe that he wants employees of licensed operators also to be validated.
<P>
An operator will wish to satisfy himself about the respectability of his employees. However, we need to remember that mere employees unlike the drivers, who need to be licensed will not be out alone in a lockable vehicle with customers. It is therefore right to draw a distinction between the regime for driver licensing and that for employees sitting in an operating centre. My right hon. Friend's amendments may not do exactly what he intended. The Secretary of State is required to state in a statutory instrument whatever a relevant criminal conviction is. He has only to fail to make such a statutory instrument amendment No. 70 uses the phrase "may specify" for the provision to be without effect in any event. I repeat that the Secretary of State can require would-be operators to declare criminal convictions. With that assurance, I hope that my right hon. Friend will not press the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 68, which my right hon. Friend said was more probing than the others, would reduce the term of an operator's licence from five years to three years. In proposing a maximum period of five years for an operator's licence, my Bill follows legislative precedent elsewhere. I would take some persuading that it is necessary to shorten the maximum period, especially as elsewhere in the Bill the Secretary of State is empowered to grant a licence for such shorter period as he thinks appropriate, and clause 16 gives the Secretary of State powers to revoke, or suspend, a licence.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 also relates to an operator's licence, and covers the number of parking spaces in an operating centre. The short answer to my right hon. Friend's amendment is that clause 3(4) already gives the power to impose the licence condition that he mentioned. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A London PHV operator's licence shall be granted subject to such conditions as may be prescribed and such other conditions as the Secretary of State may think fit."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My advice is that that power could certainly cover a specification of parking places for each operating centre; it is a power, not a duty. I believe that that is the right balance. A restriction may not be necessary in every case: operating centres and associated parking arrangements will vary. If there is not a problem, the imposition of conditions will not be necessary. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has been vocal elsewhere about the importance of not requiring unnecessary regulations: this point could fall into that category.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My right hon. Friend is touching tantalisingly on the issue of the mechanism whereby operators will be considered, or vetted, before a licence is granted. I accept his contention that the licensing authority, guided, as ever, by the Secretary of State under statutory instruments, regulations and so on, would be right to consider each application on its merits. I take his point that that may include the relevance of a parking place provision. But does not my right hon. Friend accept that his argument exposes the fact that the licensing process is likely to be and should be vigorous and detailed from the outset, and carry with it implications for the time and resources required by the licensing authority?
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> My right hon. Friend has moved on to the issue of resources. I am not sure whether it is appropriate to deal with resourcing on this group of amendments possibly not. It would be right at some point to debate the likely level of fees, resources and the manpower.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 67 and 75 relate to vehicle licences and to the important matter of wheelchair accessibility. I acknowledge readily my right hon. Friend's good intentions in tabling amendment No. 67, which relates to an applicant's ability to provide a wheelchair-accessible vehicle. However, I feel obliged to advise the Committee to resist the amendment because its effect would be limited and doubtful.
<P>
I recognise that the amendment would not make all minicabs accessible to passengers in wheelchairs. It would require only that, as a condition for granting an operator's licence, the Secretary of State should satisfy himself that the applicant could provide such a vehicle, if necessary by a subcontract. That does not seem to be much of a constraint, because it would be difficult for the Secretary of State to make a judgment and, especially, to find grounds to refuse a licence. He would simply need to be aware that some wheelchair-accessible vehicles are owned somewhere, by some operators. That is a rather vague requirement.
<P>
A number of operators, especially the larger ones, have wheelchair-accessible vehicles, so the condition required by the amendment has already been met. As that is the case, it would be hard for the Secretary of State to refuse a particular licence application. There might well be reasons for believing that an operator will not be able to subcontract a wheelchair-accessible vehicle at a particular time. It might, therefore, also be difficult for the magistrates court to resist an appeal against a refusal.
<P>
Despite the good intentions of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, the amendment would be rather hollow in practice and it might usefully be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment No. 75 would require that all licensed London minicabs should be wheelchair accessible. I know that, in tabling the amendment, my right hon. Friend's heart was in the right place, but I should like to remind him of the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. That Act was passed under a Government of which both he and I were distinguished members. It provided that taxis should be wheelchair accessible, but it made no such general provision in respect of minicabs. The amendment would mean that only in London would there be a requirement that all minicabs should be accessible by wheelchair users. That would be anomalous.
<P>
There was a reason for taxis and minicabs being treated differently under the legislation. Taxis ply for hire on the street; they are the only vehicles that have that right and the Bill makes no change to it. Taxis may be hired spontaneously a spontaneous hiring, as it is known in the jargon. People in wheelchairs should be able to make such a spontaneous hiring, just like the rest of us, confident that they can get into the first vehicle that they hail. They should not have to wait at the kerbside in the hope that a suitable vehicle will come along.
<P>
By contrast, minicabs operate through an operating centre; they cannot ply for hire. That is a significant distinction in the context of the amendment. The previous Government recognised that distinction when they introduced the Disability Discrimination Bill, as did Parliament when the Bill was passed with an accessibility requirement for taxis, but not for minicabs. I will not rehearse all the arguments made when that Bill was before Parliament, but I will repeat that it would be anomalous to introduce a different requirement for London minicabs than for those in the rest of the country. Against that background, I ask my right hon. Friend not to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
Amendment No. 76 refers to licences. There is not much of a case for a three-year vehicle licence. The typical family car must have an annual MOT; minicabs usually have a much higher mileage and the Bill provides for them to be tested up to three times a year. Under those circumstances, a one-year licence for minicabs is right on the grounds of safety alone.
<P>
I will not discuss amendment No. 77 as my right hon. Friend did not speak to it. I have responded to the amendments to the best of my ability and hope that my right hon. Friend will not press them to a division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Efford </B>(Eltham): I welcome you, Mr. Winterton, to the Chair. I congratulate the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire on his work in promoting the Bill. It raises difficult issues and previous attempts to introduce legislation on them have failed. The right hon. Gentleman deserves our congratulations for pursuing the matter.
<P>
I am not sure whether my comments should be in the stand part debate or in the debate on individual amendments. I defer to your judgment, Mr. Winterton 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The amendments, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> If I may start, then, with amendment No. 67 which relates to wheelchair access. In his response to the amendment, the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire underlined the problem with the previous Government's policy that policy has not yet been changed by the present Government. The problem is that large sections of London are not covered by wheelchair-accessible vehicles. There is an anomaly: we want universal access to such vehicles, but it does not exist because large parts of London are not served by a licensed taxi service.
<P>
I reiterate a point that I made on Second Reading that if we are going to achieve universal accessibility, given that the market place for licensed taxis and minicabs is not a level playing field, certain requirements and stipulations must be made particularly for health authority contracts for which wheelchair accessibility should be a minimum requirement. We know that health authorities have contracts with companies that do not provide 100 per cent. accessible vehicles, yet that is required of the licensed taxi trade and is not reflected in their contracts. That is an important anomaly and it must be addressed.
<P>
A spontaneous hiring, from the perspective of the person operating in the industry, every hiring whether private-hire or a taxi is an immediate hiring. Even if a journey is booked a week in advance, the job is issued to the next driver on the rank or the next in line on the radio circuit whether private hire or a licensed taxi. There is no difference between the two industries in that regard. The two drivers do exactly the same job and perform exactly the same task. It is spurious to suggest any difference between the two professions with respect to immediate hiring.
<P>
I wish to move on to amendment No. 69 and planning. I have tabled another amendment though I shall not speak to it now which deals with the issue. A problem is created for existing premises. Several minicab firms have already been set up though they do not meet the requirements. My amendment could solve the problem by dealing with planning applications for premises to be used as private hire vehicle operating centres.
<P>
I move on to enforcement, criminal records and staff. I spoke to members of the national association of taxi and private hire enforcement officers, who told me that when employees and operators are of the highest standard, that will be reflected in the operation of the company and in the behaviour and attitude of drivers. Setting high standards will produce the desired effect. I urge whoever is responding to the debate to take that important issue into account. It is crucial to make the legislation workable and enforceable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> I record my pleasure, Mr. Winterton, in serving again under your chairmanship.
<P>
The right hon. Members for Bromley and Chislehurst and for North-West Hampshire underlined the importance of enforcement. I should like to explain our view of enforcement being broadened when the Bill becomes law. It is, of course, a duty for the Metropolitan police to enforce the law when this House has given its assent. The police will maintain their dedicated team the cab enforcement section whose duties include not only monitoring licensed taxi drivers, but enforcing wider laws against touting and illegal plying for hire by minicabs. The Metropolitan police are considering increasing the size of that squad for taxicab and minicab work by drawing on licence fee income. The Public Carriage Office will ensure that all officers are properly informed about the provisions of the Bill, if it becomes law.
<P>
We are considering a new measure, and it is right for the House and those outside to expect something more. I am happy to tell the Committee that the Metropolitan police intend to establish a new, dedicated minicab enforcement team if the Bill is enacted. Precise numbers have not yet been determined. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire and, in a different way, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, pointed out, the process is at an early stage.[Ms Glenda Jackson] We are not working with absolute figures for applicants for licences to become legal minicab operators or drivers.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Public Carriage Office is considering employing 20 extra staff to form the unit. They will be financed through the minicab trade's licence fees. They will be responsible for enforcing the Bill, and they will be armed with the powers for which the Bill provides, including spot checks on licences, records and vehicles. The element of surprise will be a valuable tool. No operator will be sure about when a member of the enforcement team will visit to check that the firm is properly licensed and that records are being kept as required by law. A driver cannot be sure about when his badge and licence will be checked. Therefore, all concerned will have an incentive to keep on their toes.
<P>
I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Efford), who rights raised an important issue, that operators will be responsible for ensuring that their staff are properly trained. There will be an element of self-enforcement. Operators and drivers will be cautious about operating illegally because, for the first time, they will have a licence to lose. Under the Bill, their means of earning a living can be taken away.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested that staff in the operators' premises should undergo criminal record checks. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said that the danger to the travelling public was perceived to be in the minicab: in a locked vehicle. We have evidence to support that. However, I take the point of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst about the possibility of opportunistic criminal activities. Clause 16 grants the Secretary of State a wide power to suspend licences if he is no longer satisfied that the licence holder is fit to hold a licence.
<P>
If there were grounds for suspicion, or a series of attacks such as those to which the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred, the Secretary of State in this instance, the Public Carriage Office in practice could examine the circumstances and, if necessary, revoke the licence. I am not an expert on existing law to protect data, but I would have thought that the opportunistic activities that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned were already illegal. The Secretary of State's powers are very flexible.
<P>
As I said earlier, it is difficult to be precise about the size of the industry. We have no reliable information because the industry is not regulated. It is estimated that there are 1,500 operators and 45,000 vehicles and drivers. No one pretends that the task is not sizeable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> On a point of information, I contacted "Yellow Pages" and asked how many people advertised for private hire in the book. It indicated that the figure was a little more than 13,000.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I repeat the point that I made earlier. We have no truly accurate figures. However, I have heard that there are as many as 80,000 unlicensed minicab drivers operating in London. The Bill will introduce licensing on the grounds of public safety. It will also remove the anomaly of London being the only city in the United Kingdom not to have such a licensing system.
<P>
Of course, we accept that licensing will not happen overnight and not even in a week or a month. However, I do not share the somewhat depressing view of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that should the House agree to enact the Bill licensing cannot be introduced in a reasonable period. I do not envisage that that process will stretch into infinity, as it will give us the assurance that when we hire a minicab, the operator, the driver and the vehicle will all be licensed.
<P>
Should the Bill become law, we hope that the first licences will be granted to operators next year, with the rest being granted 12 months or so after that. We propose to begin with operators because good operators would, we believe, lead to the rest of the operation being conducted properly.
<P>
I turn to fees. I confirm that the minicab trade will finance its own regulation through fees. There will be no cross-subsidy from the taxi trade. Details will be worked out later, as the Bill has yet to receive Royal Assent. However, it does not seem that the fees would be out of line with those in other parts of the country: I am sure that that is what the trade expects. I hope that I have reassured the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham.
<P>
I will briefly touch on points made about wheelchair access, especially those made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham. I understand the point that he made about hiring. However, suppose that a person in a wheelchair is outside on the street. It starts pouring with rain and he or she decides to take a taxi. The taxi trade has priority in such cases. We have ensured that black cabs are wheelchair accessible.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham spoke about minicab operators who have contracts for transporting people in wheelchairs and who, in many instances, send vehicles that are not wheelchair accessible. I have met wheelchair users who say that the minicab is their preferred mode of transport. I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that many minicab operators have vehicles that are wheelchair accessible. However, black cabs are specifically required to be hirable by someone putting up his or her hand and asking to be taken to a destination. That right of accessibility is the due of wheelchair users.
<P>
My hon. Friend said that all public transport should be accessible to everyone. The Government agree with him, and we have already taken steps to achieve such accessibility. That goal will take some time to achieve. However, I trust that I have reassured him on taxis and on minicab accessibility for wheelchair users.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend and to the Minister for their full replies to the points made during debate on my amendments. On the strength of what has been said, I will not press most of my amendments. However I must be guided by you here, Mr. Winterton, because my procedure is a but rusty I had it in mind to press amendment No. 67 to a vote.
<P>
I have listened carefully to what my right hon. Friend and the Minister have said about wheelchairs and I am not very happy with it. My right hon. Friend said that this is not a requirement anywhere else, so why should we make it one for London? However, he also said that we are basing ourselves on what has been done elsewhere and building on and developing it, so it would be quite legitimate to say that if we felt that wheelchair accessibility was not as desired elsewhere we should give a lead in London. Surely on that basis we should feel free to use the Bill to push out the frontiers, were that deemed desirable.
<P>
The Minister based her arguments on the fact that someone who is wheelchair bound can always hire a black cab. I always thought that the main argument about people with disabilities concerned equality of access and opportunity. As is well known, black cabs are not freely available throughout greater London. A person in a wheelchair who wishes to hail a cab may want to avail himself of what we are still allowed to call minicabs because the fare is lower or because the service offered is different.
<P>
It is not necessarily the case, as I think the Minister was saying, that in the end people in wheelchairs are all right because they can always hail a black cab. Certainly, in terms of cost, that would not be true. If we follow that line of argument there is a danger, I put it no higher than that, of saying that in the end someone in a wheelchair can always get a cab even though it may cost them a lot more than it would otherwise. That is not equality of access.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I did not say that it was all right for people in wheelchairs because they can always hail a cab. Black cabs have to be wheelchair accessible because they are the only form of transport, within the context of the debate this morning, that can be hailed in that way. It is entirely possible for someone to ring and ask for a black cab that is accessible. It is also entirely possible for him to ring a minicab operator and explain the situation, if he does not have a car that is wheelchair accessible and it is his preferred way of transport. Many wheelchair users like to be transported in what appears to be a perfectly ordinary saloon car as they have a wheelchair which folds up. But the essential point is that the vehicles that has the right to ply for hire is a black cab and its accessibility to wheelchair users is supreme.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am, of course, grateful to the Minister for that elaboration. I am not sure that it answers my point, to which I shall adhere for the time being. I argue that people in wheelchairs should, as far as is reasonably possible, have equal access to the services that others have, whether that be taxi cabs or minicabs. Why can those who are wheelchair bound not have reasonable or equal access to what we choose to call minicabs?
<P>
I hope my right hon. Friend will forgive me, but I shall paraphrase him. He said that we did not need the subcontractor arrangements that I felt should be built in because someone somewhere will be able to supply the service and that that, in principle, should be fine. But he does not satisfy the requirements of equality of access. In some parts of London there may be a large minicab operator with vehicles that can handle people who are wheelchair bound, but I suspect that there will be other large parts of London where that is not the case.
<P>
What is the equality of access for people in wheelchairs to minicabs in those parts of London where there may not be a service in the immediate area and where, at the same time, black cabs do not normally ply? First, the person might have difficulty in getting a black cab and, if he or she succeeded, would find it very expensive. Secondly, perhaps on telephoning two or three local minicab operators and explaining the need for wheelchair provision, the response would be that they did not make that provision. That would not be satisfactory. My amendment therefore provides that at the very least the operator should be able to say, "I may not be able to provide what is needed, but I know someone reasonably local who can, and I shall either put you in touch with them or subcontract the job."
<P>
That is what I was getting at. I do not think that the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Minister for North-West Hampshire or the Minister come anywhere near satisfying that modest requirement.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The central issue, which, interesting though the right hon. Gentleman's argument is, he fails to deal with, is that the requirement for all black cabs to be wheelchair accessible is based on the idea that would-be passengers hire them spontaneously. There is no expectation of ringing up or planning a journey. The requirement gives people who are wheelchair bound the same right of immediate access to a black cab as other people, by means of putting up their hand while on the pavement. Black cabs are the only vehicles in the categories that we are concerned with that have the right to pick up a passenger in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> There is no difference between me and the Minister on that point of course I accept it. The Bill is about minicabs, or private hire vehicles, is it not? My point is about how far it is reasonable to expect a decree of equal or reasonable access for people who use wheelchairs to the important, and, it is to be hoped, continuing, private hire vehicle sector. I am not talking about people hailing cars from pavements in a way that is illegal now, although not enforced, and which will continue to be illegal under the Bill.
<P>
We have not yet had a satisfactory answer to the question why people in wheelchairs should not have reasonable equality of access to the crucial sector of private hire vehicles.
<P>
I now move on to a matter about which I am, I confess, somewhat alarmed. When we discussed enforcement, the Minister helpfully gave us a glimpse into her thinking and that of the Metropolitan police and, no doubt, the experts in her Department. She said with a modest flourish that we should all feel reassured because there would be a dedicated minicab enforcement team of 20 extra staff. I do not know what other Committee members think; however, with the prospect of 18,000 or 19,000 taxi cabs continuing to operate on the roads of London and, we can probably all agree, 40,000 or 50,000 private hire vehicles even after[Mr. Forth] the licensing process a total of at least 50,000 or 60,000 I am not sure that 20 extra enforcement staff to be taken on by the PCO will fulfil the requirement of providing reassurance about safety, which was supposedly the point of the Bill, or eliminating touting, which I consider the source of the main problem in the past. That does not strike me at first blush as desperately reassuring. What makes it worse is that when the Minister estimated the number of operators at 1,500 
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I have checked my figures and the number is 1,300 not 13,000, and I apologise if I misled the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That is a relief.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Perhaps I may reassure the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. Approximately 20,000 black cabs are operating in London. The cab enforcement section comprises four officers. A dedicated minicab team of 20 I admit that my mathematics is not the best would be five times the number of those who enforce the existing laws for 20,000 vehicles, so it could cover about 100,000 minicabs, could it not? I hope that that reassures the right hon. Gentleman. Twenty members of staff may seem like a very small section, but should be seen in relation to the number of staff engaged in regulation of the black cab trade.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but I am not remotely reassured because she has only illustrated the extent of the problem. There is no comparison whatever between enforcing or policing existing cab provision and seeking to enforce the new regime on the minicab or private hire vehicle sector. It is one thing to ensure that the taxicab trade runs as it should, but altogether another to enforce this new regime on a failing sector. The raison d'\ketre and driving force of the Bill is that this sector contains dubious operators and that there is already a serious problem of illegal trading by private hire vehicles. It is already illegal under existing law, which is simply not being enforced.
<P>
Moreover, I must add in parenthesis the fact that the police currently do not always want to enforce existing provisions. All the police want is to ensure that people spilling out of nightclubs and other such places late at night, sometimes under the influence of liquor, are cleared off the pavements as quickly as possible. The ideal people to carry out that task are illegal minicab drivers. It is a widely held belief that the police turn a blind eye. They know that if they enforced existing laws rigorously and prevented touting outside places of entertainment late at night, they would face the problem of law enforcement on the pavement with many people waiting for black cabs because inadequate numbers of vehicles are available to take them home. I add that in passing because it goes some way to explaining why existing law is not enforced as much as it should be.
<P>
I do not accept the Minister's suggestion that the Committee should be happy because a tiny number of people are enforcing existing provisions. I do not know whether she concedes that there is an almost complete failure to enforce existing laws on private hire vehicles. If she does, the Committee should consider whether 20 enforcement officers will be adequate to enforce the Bill throughout greater London. Can 20 people police a trade that will be driven under ground if the new licensing regime is too oppressive and expensive? We must not ignore that possibility.
<P>
I place great emphasis on enforcement and I hope that other members of the Committee will participate in the debate at some stage. Surely we must reassure people that if we are going to all the trouble of introducing this new law, setting up a new bureaucracy and establishing a new licensing regime with three different types of provision, there is going to be effective enforcement otherwise we are all wasting our time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): My calculations suggest that there is one enforcement officer for every 5,000 black cabs; and one enforcement officer for every 65 minicab offices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I do not know how the hon. Gentleman arrived at those figures. He may want to elaborate on them.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I have already provided figures for black cab traders but I did not mention 16 non-constabulary staff who will do spot checks on taxis. There will also be 20 additional staff who will concentrate exclusively on the minicab trade. The right hon. Gentleman must be aware that the licensing regime will reduce the number of people who will put themselves forward as minicab operators and drivers because they simply will not get a licence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Of course. Perhaps I have missed the point, but surely it depends on whether the extra people, whom the Minister mentioned with such pride, will concentrate solely on those who already have licences, or will also consider the illegal touting business. That business is a problem now and it will continue to be a problem if we drive people out of the legitimate regime into illegal operating. Will the Minister's 20 extra people be involved in dealing with such operators?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> As I have already said, it is the duty of every Metropolitan police office to enforce the law. We have a totally unregulated minicab force; there are no precise numbers. We have heard that there might be 80,000 or 100,000. The introduction of licensing will reduce the number of such people. There will be an increase of the numbers at the Public Carriage Office to ensure that enforcement is carried out. I hope that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is reassured by that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I will not try your patience further, Mr. Winterton, as I sense that it is becoming exhausted. Suffice it to say that either the Minister is right about the matter or I am. Members of the Committee will make up their own minds about that.
<P>
The existing law in this area is not even remotely being enforced, and I have not yet been given any reason to be confident that the new law will be enforced. If that turns out to be the case, we are not only wasting out time, but, what is even worse, we are raising people's expectations in a dangerous way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's concerns. However, does he not accept that the Bill will create the revenue stream to allow us to finance an enforcement service that will deal with the illegal elements in the private hire industry? That is the thrust of the measures. If the Bill does not deal with those illegal elements, it is not worth the paper it is written on. There are many self-regulating operators who will not need much enforcement at all. The enforcement officers must be dedicated and they must identify the illegal touts who do not operate from an operating centre. The touts work in cars that look like any other vehicle on the road and are not as easily identifiable as a licensed taxi. That makes enforcement difficult. The Liberal Democrat point is therefore totally irrelevant.
<P>
The Bill will create a revenue stream. If it does not work, we shall at least have a framework within which to increase the number of enforcement officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Eltham. We shall return to that matter later.
<P>
There is a certain circularity to the argument. Will the number of people needed to enforce the legislation dictate the fee, or will the setting of the fee dictate the number of people? Which comes first?
<P>
I accept the thrust of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Eltham. If we were to find that the enforcement regime was not sufficient, presumably a decision would be made by the PCO, driven relentlessly by the Minister and her Secretary of State, to make a huge increase in the number of people in the enforcement team. That in turn would increase the licensing fee. The danger would then be that many operators might be driven out of the legitimate, licensed area of the business. They would tout and operate illegally because we had priced them out of business. All these factors are connected and interdependent. There are no free lunches in this business, if I might put it in that way.
<P>
I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire and to the Minister for the answers that they have given us. We now know much more about how the Bill would work. However, I am not reassured about enforcement and hope that we shall have the opportunity to return to that matter.
<P>
I should like to press amendment No. 67 to a vote. Is that possible procedurally, Mr. Winterton?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call Sir George Young, I advise the Committee and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that I am happy to allow a vote on amendment No. 67. That is, of course, on the basis that the hon. Gentleman withdraws amendment No. 66.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> I was going to try to talk my right hon. Friend out of pressing amendment No. 67 to a vote. It is the only amendment in the group about which we do not agree. I invite my right hon. Friend to reconsider whether the amendment would be a useful addition to the statute book.
<P>
Let us imagine that my right hon. Friend is the Secretary of State, and I am an applicant for a licence. Let us then imagine that we have accepted the amendment and thus added to the Bill the qualification that I have to provide,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(whether or not by the use of a subcontractor) a vehicle capable of carrying a wheelchair using passenger".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I might apply to him and simply say that, in London, there are a number of subcontractors who have wheelchair-accessible vehicles. My right hon. Friend could not reject my application unless he had evidence to the contrary. If he rejected the application, he would be straight in front of a magistrates court, and he would lose the case on appeal. Therefore, the argument is not about whether minicab users should have access to vehicles, but whether the amendment would achieve that goal.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment does not specify a local subcontractor. Therefore, unless it can be shown that there is not such a subcontractor somewhere in London, the amendment is meaningless and not worth adding to the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> In that case, I accept that my drafting is defective.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> Ah!
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My right hon. Friend will know almost as well as I do, after sharing a similar experience approximately a year ago, that one of the disadvantages that modest Back Benchers, especially those in opposition, suffer is lack of the support that my right hon. Friend and I were privileged to have for some years. My right hon. Friend, quite rightly, is still privileged to have such support for this Bill.
<P>
I accept my right hon. Friend's comments. I should perhaps have included the word "local" in the amendment. What opportunity exists for me to correct the amendment, now or later, to achieve the desired result? My right hon. Friend hinted that he considered the aim to be desirable.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> I take it that my right hon. Friend will not invite the Committee to accept an amendment that he agrees is defective. Even if the amendment included the word "local", there are other arguments against it. I would simply have to show that, in my locality, there was someone who had a wheelchair-accessible minicab. The amendment is not a useful addition to the Bill.
<P>
My right hon. Friend and I do not disagree about the objective, but the amendment would not assist the Secretary of State, and it would not help people who need to travel in wheelchair-accessible vehicles. The amendment would be an encumbrance. Even if my right hon. Friend persuaded you, Mr. Winterton, to accept manuscript amendments and you said that you would not do that I could not commend the amendment, as amended, to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> On the basis of my right hon. Friend's comments, I shall not press amendment No. 67. However, I shall examine the matter further, and take my right hon. Friend's helpful advice to try to improve the amendment during our Committee proceedings or later.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not relevant to seek to withdraw amendment No. 67. I must ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he will withdraw amendment No. 66. What he does later in the Bill's progress is entirely up to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Guided, as ever, by you, Mr. Winterton, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I seek only to reinforce what the Minister helpfully told the Committee, which was that she envisaged the first operators being licensed under the clause next year. I take her to say that if the Bill receives Royal Assent in the autumn of this year which, procedurally, is the earliest time it could do so the Public Carriage Office would be given the responsibility of initiating the process, and would be able to begin operator licensing next year. The hon. Lady said that she envisaged the other licenses being available within 12 months of that time. That is most helpful because not only does it give us an idea of the time scale that the Minister has in mind, it helps to determine the type of operation that the PCO would have to establish to work its way through the 1,300 or 1,500 applications that we believe will be made. The hon. Member for Eltham no doubt agrees that the number in "Yellow Pages" alone will not be a total guide that there may be a large number of operators who have not taken the trouble to put an entry in that publication. The 1,300 or 1,500 may be a modest/minimum figure, but it helps the Committee to build a picture of the time scale and operation for implementing the Bill's provisions. It is useful, and I hope that we can continue to build on it as we go through the Bill.



<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I must respond to the right hon. Gentleman. We are hopeful that that will happen. It is, as he rightly said, dependent upon the Bill's passage and upon Royal Assent. The Public Carriage Office has been appraised of the possibility and is hoping that that will happen. I have little doubt that that hope will be fulfilled.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 72, in page 3, line 21, after "form", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(which, in the case of bookings made by telephone, shall include a recording of the telephone call)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The first amendment is for probing or clarificatory purposes. It has been pointed out to me that the phrase in subsection (1)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall not in London accept a booking for the hire of a private hire vehicle other than at an operating centre specified in his licence"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
could be interpreted as implying a physical presence at the centre to make a booking. We all know that private hire vehicles are hired largely by telephone and only rarely in person at a centre. I seek guidance. I thought that my wording would be broader and more permissive of the possibility of a variety of methods of booking, including personal visit or telephone call. I wish to establish beyond doubt that in no sense would the wording quoted above restrict in any way the legitimate or acceptable method by which bookings could be made. That is the only point that I want to establish; it is a matter of clarification.
<P>
Amendment No. 72 concerns a different point, possibly of greater importance, with respect to enforceability and the reassurances that the Bill is intended to provide. It is meant to explore or clarify the nature of the prescribed form of bookings to be accepted by the operating centre, and to put it beyond doubt, by including it in the Bill, that a recording should be made of telephone bookings. It has been put to me that that procedure could in many circumstances provide crucial evidence, should an unfortunate incident occur. It might also provide some reassurance to those who made bookings by telephone if it were widely known that such a recording would be made and kept as a permanent record of who made the booking, through whom and for what purpose.
<P>
I am the more in favour of that way of doing things because it might be thought easier to alter, falsify or make retrospectively a written record of bookings. That would be much more difficult if recordings were made of telephone conversations. Although I am no expert in the matter, I assume that recordings would provide greater reassurance, because they would make such tampering more difficult for a person who was determined to use a position either as a driver or working in the operating centre to prey on vulnerable people.
<P>
The amendment is intended to explore the ways in which the Bill will enable everything reasonable and possible to be done to provide reassurance.

<P>

<B>Sir George Young:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his probing approach to the amendments. I was slightly alarmed during the previous debate by the example of a taxi driver adding a nought to the end of a figure, something that I am sure happens very rarely.
<P>
Of course a booking could be accepted at an operating centre over the telephone. That is how most bookings are made, and nothing in clause 4 precludes that. The difficulty with amendment No. 71 is that it goes further, by suggesting that bookings should be made through an operating centre. I am reluctant to compromise on this point.
<P>
We are aiming for a properly regulated minicab trade. Proper regulation entails the regulator being able to contact those who are being regulated, and being able to find out what their activities have been. That is the reason for the Bill's concept of an operating centre a place where bookings are taken and records are kept. The Bill is therefore specific about the need for a booking to be taken, as clause 4(1) states, "at an operating centre".
<P>
The alternative, perhaps especially in London in the age of the mobile phone, would be no more than operations that were really being run from the pavement. In that way of doing things, the operator could too quickly become a shadowy figure, here today and somewhere else tomorrow. I wonder whether an operator moving around with a mobile phone would really keep proper records. Without those, could a proper check be kept on what he got up to, or inquiries be made if something went wrong? We need to make life difficult for the fly-by-night element in the London minicab trade, small though it may be. The implication of amendment No. 71 is that such an operation as I described might be possible.
<P>
My right hon. Friend might have suggested though he did not that a small firm could operate by switching calls through, during the evening, from the office to home. If an operator wants to work from home, there is no reason, in principle, why the home address should not be added to the licence as an operating centre for certain hours of the day, with proper records being kept. We want visibility and traceability. As my right hon. Friend said a few moments ago, minicabs should be properly regulated, so we need operating centres where bookings are taken and where records are kept.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 72. I was encouraged by the importance that my right hon. Friend attaches to record-keeping under the Bill. I understand why he might want tape recordings to be made of telephone bookings. Occasionally, when trying to tune into a local radio station, one strays into a minicab firm's wave length and one can hear such bookings being made. I must say those are among the least exciting broadcasts that I have listened to.
<P>
I do not rule out the idea of tape recordings of bookings. However, the Bill makes provision for the Secretary of State to prescribe the records to be kept of bookings. On reflection, it might be best for the Secretary of State to determine such matters after consultation. He will have to embody his requirements in regulations, on which Parliament will have the opportunity to comment.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I suggest to my right hon. Friend not for the last time in our debates on this Bill, I suspect that flexibility has merits, especially when provision is made for regulations. I therefore hope that he will not feel obliged to press amendments Nos. 71 and 72 to a vote.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The recording of such calls is a good idea. I would certainly be happy to present it to the Public Carriage Office. However, consideration must be given to the extra cost for operators and to the possibility that they must inform customers that calls are being recorded. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire has said, the Secretary of State has flexible powers and will be required to consult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend and to the Minister for their replies. This may sound slightly ungenerous however, it may be relevant. When the Minister helpfully outlined her draft timetable, she may have forgotten that that time scale would be extended by the consultation process that will take place, presumably at key stages of policy development between the statute and the regulations.
<P>
I have a vivid memory of being criticised, often vehemently, by the Minister and by her colleagues when they were in opposition and I held a modest position in Government. I was told then that consultation should never be hurried. I therefore assume that the Minister would wish to allow for a proper period of consultation.
<P>
I am reassured by what my right hon. Friend and the Minister have said. My right hon. Friend implied that there is no problem with the Bill's wording the words that bother me would not inhibit the making of bookings. My right hon. Friend is satisfied, so the world must be too, that different forms of bookings either by telephone or by going to the operating centre in person are fully permitted by the Bill's wording. Given that reassurance, amendment No. 71 is otiose and I beg to ask leave to withdraw it. Furthermore, given the Minister's reasonable response to the recording of telephone bookings, I will not seek to press amendment No. 72 to a vote.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" (1) A London PHV operator (`the first operator') who has in London accepted a private hire booking may not arrange for another operator to provide a vehicle to carry out that booking as sub-contractor unless 
(a) the other operator is a London PHV operator and the sub-contracted booking is accepted at an operating centre in London;
(b) the other operator is licenced under section 55 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 (in this Act referred to as `the 1976 Act') by the council of a district and the sub-contracted booking is accepted in that district; or
(c) the other operator accepts the sub-contracted booking in Scotland.

<P>
(4) It is immaterial for the purposes of subsection (1) whether or not sub-contracting is permitted by the contract between the first operator and the person who made the booking.
<P>
(5) For the avoidance of doubt (and subject to any relevant contract terms), a contract of hire between a person who made a private hire booking at an operating centre in London and the London PHV operator who accepted the booking remains in force despite the making of arrangements by that operator for another contractor to provide a vehicle to carry out that booking as sub-contractor.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> There are some important amendments in the group; perhaps I could begin with amendment No. 33 and new clause 1. They concern subcontracting by one operator to another and their main purpose is to respond to points that were put to me after publication of the Bill. In its earlier form, clause 4(3) prevented subcontracting across the London boundary by a London operator to one outside London, for example in Surrey. It was suggested that that was an unreasonable restriction on flexibility and no help to customers of minicab operators near the London boundary. At busy times such operators might want to fulfil a booking by working with colleagues in another firm across the London boundary, thus making sure that customers get their minicabs.
<P>
I have tabled an amendment to permit subcontracting across the London boundary. New clause 1(1) does that but we must make sure that there are proper safeguards for the customer. It also provides that bookings can be subcontracted only to properly licensed operators. The only exception is Scotland, where the law does not provide for operators to be licensed, although there is a requirement in Scottish law that drivers and vehicles should be licensed; so the protection remains.
<P>
Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of new clause 1 are mainly consequential to the main intention but subsection (5) repeats the main intention of the original clause 5 which in due course will be deleted. It ensures that even if an original booking is subcontracted, the original contract between customer and the first operator is maintained. If something should go wrong, the customer does not have to follow it up with the subcontractor; the first operator remains responsible. That keeps things rightly simple for the customer and gives the original operator a proper incentive to subcontract only to operators whom he trusts.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will agree that these amendments show a willingness to respond to representations while still maintaining the protection for the customer which the Bill is all about. That leads me to amendment No. 73, tabled by my right hon. Friend. I am happy to accept in in principle. The same objective of allowing subcontracting to licensed operators outside London is achieved by the various amendments tabled by the Minister and me. I hope that, with that assurance, he will not feel the need to press his amendment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 48 are minor amendments to clarify clause 6. The first makes it clear that the offence is allowing a minicab to be driven by an unlicensed driver. The second avoids spelling out the name of the 1976 Act in full. The third indicates that the clause applies to subcontractor bookings as well as those made by members of the public.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst I must point out that amendment No. 73, to which the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire referred, has not been selected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> You are cruel, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
Could I ask my right hon. Friend to look at the penultimate line of his new clause? It has been raised with me and perhaps with him too that there may be an error in the wording. I cannot judge, as I am not sufficiently expert in these matters. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"despite the making of arrangements by that operator for another contractor to provide a vehicle to carry out that booking as sub-contractor";<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but those who know more about these things than I do thought that that should say "operator". I mention that in the spirit of helpfulness to my right hon. Friend, and leave the thought with him.
<P>
Could my right hon. Friend answer a basic and obvious question for the sake of reassurance? Will it be acceptable, as I have assumed throughout, for someone to book a private hire vehicle in London through a licensed London operator which can then freely transport that person outside London? Equally it should be acceptable for people who, like me, live in Chislehurst, to book vehicles in Dartford or Sevenoaks which would then transport then into London or across London. I assume that the Bill's provisions or amendments to them will deal with any difficulty arising. I am asking not about subcontracting as such, which was mentioned by my right hon. Friend, but about whether my right hon. Friend is satisfied that nothing in the Bill will prevent me, as a London resident, from booking a private hire vehicle from outside London to transport me to an address inside London; or conversely, from booking a vehicle from within London to an address outside London? I am seeking my right hon. Friend's reassurance on that.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> Nothing in the Bill would impede my right hon. Friend from accessing the Houses of Parliament from the points of departure that he outlined. When he uses a minicab from outside London, he already has protection because the firm will already be licensed that may well be the reason he chose that firm. The Bill does not impact on the contract or the ability of the firm registered outside London to collect and deliver him to London. I am happy to provide the assurance that he sought.

<B>Sir George Young:</B> Representations have been made that the defence of due diligence is more appropriate than one of without reasonable excuse. It is not enough for the defendant to find a reasonable excuse; he has to show that he has made an effort to avoid contravention of the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 deals with clause 6 and provides a minor clarification of the defence to any charge of the offence. Amendment No. 44 improves the drafting, making it clear that operating a licensed minicab without displaying its official licence plate or disc is an offence. Amendment No. 47 makes it clear that it is an offence to allow a minicab to be driven by an unlicensed driver.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> the purpose of the amendment is to initiate a short but productive debate on meters in private hire vehicles. An intriguing amount of passion is aroused by that subject apparently a relatively innocent one. Should meters in private hire vehicles be prohibited? Should there be a permissive arrangement, such as the one that exists at present, or should meters be mandatory? The object of the amendment is to clear our minds about what is desirable in the brave new world that we are creating for private hire vehicles.<P>
Before I considered such matters in detail, I thought that the case for meters in private hire vehicles was not self-evidently desirable. Some people say that it must be desirable because it makes matters clear for the customer. That would be the case only if there was a rigid fare structure of the type used by taxi operators. Other people have suggested that meters would be misleading: if a person does not know the fare structure in advance, he or she will not know the rate at which the meter will tick up the time and the money. Others suggest that meters in private hire vehicles would reassure customers that the vehicle is approved. That would therefore lead to more people climbing into the vehicles of drivers who were illegally touting for trade.
<P>
The Committee must think through the issues and make some decisions. Are meters desirable and should they be obligatory under the Bill? Is the matter one that the operator and the driver of the vehicle should decide for themselves in relation to their saleability or their accountability to the customer? Alternatively, should meters be prohibited because as some would argue, although we might shortly hear otherwise the mere existence of a meter in a vehicle would give it some[Mr. Forth]
spurious legitimacy? People would then be lured into a vehicle that was plying illegally. That would increase risks rather than reducing them. These are all matters of judgment.
<P>
My view is that, on balance, the existing permissive arrangement is probably the best one. If an operator decided that meters were desirable for his business and that they would reassure his customers, who would be able to see how much money was involved during their journey, that would be a perfectly acceptable arrangement. However, the issue might also trespass on a question to which we shall probably keep returning during our debates: do we want to see a separate market for private hire vehicles, as distinct from taxi cabs?
<P>
Many people in the black cab trade make little secret of their view that somewhere down the line the distinction that exists at present between private hire vehicles and taxi cabs will disappear. My right hon, Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire alluded to that fact in his opening remarks. Other people hold the view that London taxis provide a unique service that is well understood and much treasured, and that private hire vehicles can and should provide a quite different service. I think that that was reflected in the Minister's remarks. In many ways, it is also recognised in the Bill. However, time and time again we come up against that matter. Each of us must think about it and draw our own conclusions.
<P>
The issue of meters highlights the differences. Should meters be exclusive to the black cab trade, or can they be used perfectly legitimately in private hire vehicles? The amendment is designed to highlight that debate so that the Committee can establish its view about whether meters should be compulsory, prohibited or permissive.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for rehearsing the arguments for and against taxi meters. I think he said that he preferred to remain with a discretionary position, which is the current position, although amendment No. 74 makes it obligatory to have an appropriate meter device before getting a licence. I take it that that is the peg on which he hangs the debate rather then a serious proposition.
<P>
There is an issue about the potential confusion between taxis and minicabs that can be caused by meters. A meter could imply to a newcomer to London that the vehicle is a taxi. It could also suggest that the fare scale is in some way determined by the Secretary of State when, in fact, it is set by the operator. A meter also implies that the fare is set exactly by the distance driven and or time taken, but that should not be the arrangement with a minicab. By definition, a minicab is a pre-booked hiring so the operator can tell the passenger what the fare will be. Indeed, the passenger is always well advised to obtain a quote before setting off. There is no operator for a taxi so the cost depends on the driver knowing the shortest route. With a pre-quoted fare that is less important.
<P>
The question of compulsory meters was raised on Second Reading. I have considered it carefully since then. It was one of the most difficult issues on which I had to come to a judgment. I felt it only right to consider the representations that I received in quite the opposite direction, especially from representatives of the taxi trade. On balance I have come down in favour of ruling out meters on arguments which I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept. Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 are another case where I am proposing changes in response to representations that have been made to me. I can see that the hon. Member for Eltham, who tabled amendment No. 6, and presumably the licensed cab trade, also agree with that.
<P>
The original clause 11 effectively said that a London minicab could be fitted with a meter but that the meter had to be properly tested. That was fine as far as it went but it was put to me that London minicabs ought not to have meters and there are two reasons for that view. First, there is simply the possibility that people who are not familiar with London might think that any vehicle with a meter is a taxi with all that that implies. That would not be the case. Secondly, people might think that the meter implied that the fares were in some way set or approved by the Government. That is true for taxis but it is certainly not the case for minicabs. The meter could be set at whatever rate the operator chose.
<P>
In short, it is argued that meters could give rise to misunderstandings and confusion between taxi and minicabs. I do not want that and neither does the Committee. The amendments simply have the effect of banning the fitting of taxi meters in London licensed minicabs. That is a straightforward and sensible position and it acknowledges the force of the case that was put to me.
<P>
If amendment No. 6 were adopted it would have the effect of prohibiting a minicab from being licensed if it were fitted with a taxi meter, but it would not make it an offence for one to be fitted after the vehicle had been licensed. The owner would simply have to remove the meter when the vehicle was due to be licensed and replace it shortly after. On reflection, the hon. Member for Eltham might consider that amendments Nos. 45 and 46 do slightly better what amendment No. 6 seeks to do and he might decide not to press his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I rise in support of right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. Having heard the arguments for and against meters in minicabs I believe that the option of meters should remain. I understand that meters were in the Bill originally and have now been removed. In fact it is worse than that, it is now an offence to have a meter. My view is that customers will be reassured by the presence of a meter.
<P>
I understand the argument that unscrupulous minicab operators will set an unrealistic rate and that people may get a surprise at the end of their journey but that applies nowadays. How many people who use minicabs regularly I do so occasionally establish the fare at the outset? I certainly do not. I have an impression of what the fare should be and might challenge it if, when I arrive home, it seems unrealistic, but I doubt whether the overwhelming majority of people ask about the fare at the outset. People would be reassured by the presence of meters. There may be misunderstandings about how the meter operates but a tourist from abroad using a minicab would surely prefer a meter to being quoted a figure at the end of the journey with no mechanical evidence to back it up.
<P>
Finally, future technological changes provide another reason in favour of meters. In the future, it might be possible to charge customers remotely via a beacon system by the roadside or perhaps by a satellite charging system. I therefore want meters to be included within the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I shall speak to this amendment and when we reach my amendment I will beg the Committee's leave to withdraw it in favour 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman does not need to ask leave to withdraw. Only if he wants a separate division for his amendment does he have to ask the Chairman's leave to grant it. His amendment is grouped with others and we vote only on the lead amendment. I hope that I have made myself clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Winterton.
<P>
I want to talk about pre-booking and agreeing fares before a passenger embarks on a journey. That represents the key difference between a licensed taxi and a minicab. Once meters are allowed into minicabs it becomes impossible to draw a distinction between the two. It will make enforcement of the Bill more difficult because the meters will have to be properly calibrated. They must be sealed and every time vehicles are checked, the agreed tariff set by the operator must be seen to have been applied by individual drivers, which will be extremely difficult to police and enforce. Whatever form of metering is used by time or distance it will be hard to enforce across the whole of London.
<P>
I welcome the amendments proposed by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire who has listened to the arguments put forward in our debate and recognised the practical problems of introducing metering into private hire vehicles. He has come to a balanced judgment, not just refusing to recommend meters but making it an offence to fit them to minicabs. That will make the Bill much easier to enforce and will reduce the number of enforcement surveys that would be required to ensure that meters are properly calibrated to protect the public.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I support everything said by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire and indeed by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham about the wisdom of not having meters in minicabs. I should also like to deal with the point made by my hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) about the failure of minicab drivers to quote specific fares. Under the Bill it will be an offence not to quote a fare, which is the best way to provide consumer protection. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire made clear, the presence of a meter in a vehicle other than a black cab could be confusing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> In the light of the Minister's comments, I will seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 74. I hope that later we will have the opportunity to vote on amendment No. 45 to clause 11. Those of us who have not been persuaded by the argument about meters would wish to divide the Committee at that point, to vote against the amendment prohibiting meters in private hire vehicles.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is a matter of judgment, with arguments on both sides. However, saying absolutely that there should no meters is an interesting development because when the Bill was originally drafted it contained provisions on meters and their calibration. I hope that we will briefly consider resources and enforcement of the provisions in clause 7 when we come to the clause stand part debate. It strikes me that it would be appropriate to carry out calibration and checking of meters when vehicles are in for their annual relicensing.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As amendment No. 45 has been tabled by the promoter, there will clearly be an opportunity to vote on it later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> This may be the time to resume the dialogue that we had on the methods, timing and resources of licensing operators, for we have come to clause 7, which deals with the parallel process of licensing vehicles. We may have thought that it would be onerous for minicab operators to carry out the licensing process. There are 1,300 to 1,500 operators, possibly even more. The licensing cycle if my memory serves me right is five years. However, the Bill presents us with the bigger challenge of a licensing regime in which 40,000 to 50,000 vehicles will be subject to rigorous inspection on an annual basis. That suggests that considerable effort will be required to implement the clause.
<P>
We are entitled to hear some views from the Bill's promoter and from the Minister on the manpower and resources that will be required to bring clause 7 into effect. It strikes me again, I speak as a layman that putting such a large number of vehicles through an annual licensing process would require considerable commitment from the PCO. I assume that that body would be responsible for licensing, as the Minister said so during the Second Reading debate.
<P>
We must be satisfied that the reassuringly rigorous requirements outlined in clause 7 would be implemented in an equally reassuring way. However, we must have some idea of the resources and staffing that would be required to give proper effect to clause 7. I hope that my right hon. Friend or the Minister will provide an idea of what manpower, resources and facilities are envisaged, and perhaps an inkling of the overall budget figures that are contemplated, so that we and those who will be involved in the licensing process should the Bill reach the statute book can[Mr. Forth]
build up an idea of the fee structure that will be necessary to make the exercise self-financing.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I wish that I could be somewhat more helpful to the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst; I refer to the points that I made earlier, about the lack of precision as to the number of minicab drivers who will present themselves for licensing. As I said, I have been told figures ranging from 40,000, through 80,000, to 100,000. I remind the right hon. Gentleman of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham when we were discussing the possibly burdensome aspect of licensing of operators. The right hon. Gentleman was concerned about there being facilities to accommodate the gradual increase that he expected as we do in the number of people, whether operators or drivers, presenting themselves for licencing. The point made by my hon. Friend was that the licensing scheme is self-financing. The level of facilities available will relate to the number of people presenting themselves for licencing.
<P>
We are perhaps going down the wrong road by presupposing that everyone who earns a living as a minicab driver now would want to pursue that career after the licensing regime had been introduced. The one part of the licensing scheme that is in a sense self-regulating is the part based on the operator. It would not be in the interest of the operator to employ someone dodgy. I take the point about the number of people required to examine drivers. However, in other parts of the country, where local authorities have responsibility for licensing such vehicles, they can, and in many instances do, require the driver to present himself or his vehicle twice a year. I have had meetings with licensing authorities and have yet to hear from any of them that they found the requirements of their licensing regime burdensome. Equally, I have not had very strong representations from those whom they license about burdensome or elongated arrangements, or about being unable to pursue their living because obtaining a licence takes too long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Will the Minister concede the importance of the fact that London is so much bigger, even than great cities such as Manchester, Birmingham or Newcastle, particularly given that it is intended to set up the new regime where there has previously been no regulation? The Minister has drawn comparisons with other regimes, but she must surely concede that the question of scale would need to be taken into account when undertaking the scheme in London
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I absolutely accept the right hon. Gentleman's point which I and the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire have also made that the proposal is a considerable change. However, it has not been approached as a blank sheet of paper. The issue has been discussed for decades. The licensing is to be entrusted to the most experienced hands in the country the Metropolitan police, via the Public Carriage Office. I accept the right hon. Gentleman's concerns, but no one envisages setting up an office with a requirement for everyone if we are considering 40,000, which is a mean figure between the two extremes to present themselves overnight. If we accept the mean figure, consider the four requirements that currently furnish well the needs of the black cab trade, and bear in mind that a Public Carriage Office team of 20, and potentially more, will be dedicated to minicab licensing; in that case, the implementation of the Bill, if it receives Royal Assent, will not be delayed by inadequate procedures or requirements to establish the eventual regulatory regime.

<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 6, line 23, leave out subsection 3.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 15, in clause 29, page 15, line 5, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2) The Secretary of State may make regulations adding to, deleting, or otherwise varying the provisions of subsection (1).".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> The amendments highlight problems that can occur in licensing, and I hope that they will provoke comment.
<P>
Enforcement officers have experienced difficulty with the permission given to private hire operators to remove licence plates. That has created problems with touting, and drivers' claims that they are using their cars privately and not plying for hire when they are parked outside, for example, a nightclub. the law is very difficult to enforce, and amendment No. 5 seeks clarification.
<P>
Other professions, for example funeral directors, and firms that hire out limousines for weddings, require fleets of cars. For special occasions such as Ascot, such firms will make available for private hire the limousines that are not used for weddings. If vehicles are made available for private hire, they should be covered by the Bill.
<P>
Anxieties were expressed about those two points. Licence plates should be permanently attached to vehicles, and the Bill should cover vehicles that are casually used for private hire.
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> Amendment No. 5 would delete subsection (3), which allows the Secretary of State to exempt a specified vehicle from the general requirement to display a disc or plate. A similar power covers drivers' badges.
<P>
I do not envisage widespread exemptions, but there is a case for allowing some chauffeur operations to apply for exemptions on the grounds that displaying a plate might adversely affect the image of the service. The power will be useful, and it will be used sparingly. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.
<P>
Clause 29 allows vehicles that are used as minicabs only in connection with weddings and funerals to be exempted from the provisions of the Bill. For example, a vintage car, used occasionally for weddings and not hired out otherwise, need not be licensed under the Bill, nor need the driver. That is a narrower exception than the one in the legislation that applies outside London.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be unreasonable to require a vehicle used in the way that I have described to be licensed as a minicab, for its driver to be licensed as a minicab driver and for the person arranging the hire to be licensed as a minicab operator. On the other hand, I recognise that there has been no demand for other uses of hire vehicles to be exempted in that way. There seems to be no need for the provisions of the amendment. I do not ask the Committee to broaden the scope of exemption. To do that would lead to the possibility of the Bill being diluted in future. However, there is a case for those specific exemptions, and I hope that the hon. Member for Eltham will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I shall withdraw the amendment, but I should like some further clarification. Under what special circumstances does the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire envisage the removal of licence plates? How would they detract from the image of the vehicle? What type of plate would be placed on vehicles that would affect the overall look of a vehicle when it was used for a wedding or for some other special occasion? If a funeral limousine is used to take a group of people to a special event for example, a race meeting is that private hire or is that exempt, so that the vehicle does not require a licensed driver or a licence plate in the way that would be required for any other private hire vehicle?
<P>
<B>Sir George Young:</B> The circumstances described by the hon. Member for Eltham would not be covered by the exemption in clause 29, which relates only to funerals and weddings. A vehicle used for any other purpose would need to be licensed.
<P>
The hon. Member asked under which circumstances it might be appropriate for a limousine to be used without the driver having a badge and without the vehicle having a disc. Perhaps a film star attending the premiere of his or her film might not want everybody to know that the vehicle was a minicab, or technically a minicab, licensed for that occasion. In other circumstances, there might be security grounds on which someone might not want it known that a private hire vehicle had been used because it might be identified.
<P>
There are some limited exemptions for the type of occasion that I have described. It might not be appropriate for the image of some operations for the driver to have a badge around his neck and for the vehicle to display a disc. I hope that the Secretary of State will be allowed some discretion to exercise such exemptions sparingly and with common sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will recognise that drivers are not to wear their badges for reasons of snobbery. That would create an important loophole. When my hon. Friend considers any possible guidance to accompany the Bill, she might examine ways of shrinking that loophole to stop its exploitation by the more illegal elements in the private hire industry.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Our glamorous Minister, Ms Jackson.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> It is a long time since anyone called me glamorous, Mr. Winterton, but it still gives a slight frisson.
<P>
I am mindful of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said that there is no desire for the expansion of any of the forms of exemption in the Bill. I hope therefore that the hon. Member for Eltham will be reassured and will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> This is the occasion to proceed with our gentle probing about costs and related matters. We considered the operators' licensing regime; we touched briefly on the vehicle licensing regime; and we now turn to the third leg of the stool the drivers' licensing regime. We want as clear an idea as possible of the way in which the tripartite regime will operate. The Minister has been helpful so far in outlining her thoughts that matters will be dealt with initially under the aegis of the Metropolitan police and that the Public Carriage office will be involved. The Minister also hinted that she may hand responsibility to the new Greater London authority or assembly.
<P>
I set aside for the moment the exact details of the number of drivers and licensing authority staff and emphasise two key considerations. First, how long will it take for this regime to take effect? How long will the people of London have to wait before they can partake of the full reassurance of the Bill and know that operators, vehicles and drivers are properly licensed?
<P>
The Minister has been somewhat helpful on that first question. She alluded to the beginning of next year and she mentioned a consultation process, although we have not yet teased out how long it might take. In a different context, she said that completion, at least relating to operations, could occur within 12 months thereafter.
<P>
The key question is whether the parallel process for vehicles and drivers can also be undertaken in that period or whether it will take longer. The people of London would like to be assured that all is well, that the Bill is going to take effect and that there is sufficient clarity over objectives but they cannot be so assured yet. The "not yet" is the key issue for us to understand.
<P>
The second question is about enforcement. There seems to have been a difference of emphasis between myself and the Minister, who seems to believe that it will take care of itself, partly because of the licensing regime and partly because of the higher number of people involved in the scheme. We may have to agree to disagree because in my view the numbers that she mentioned cannot even begin to solve the problem of enforcement never mind the possible difficulty of the fee level being set so high by the resource requirements of a bureaucratic operation that many operators and drivers will be driven out of the legitimate licensed regime into illicit operation. In that eventuality, we will not have solved the problem that the Bill was intended to solve. We shall, no doubt, return to that issue later.
<P>
Now is the time for us to be given more information about the regime for the regulation and licensing of drivers, as opposed to operators and vehicles. I hope that the Committee will be given an appropriate amount of information at this stage of consideration of the Bill.

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's concerns. It is not the first time this morning that he has expressed them. He perceives a gap between requirements and the facilities available to meet them. My remarks have clearly not reassured him, so I shall not bore him or the Committee by going over them again. However, I set out the facts as we know them and I repeat that in existing licensing schemes outside London the particular difficulties to which the right hon. Gentleman referred have not presented themselves.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman did, however, make a point warranting further consideration when he asked about the perception of the people of London and wondered when they would feel confident that they had the protections afforded by the Bill. We are gathered here in Committee precisely because of the lack of confidence of the people of London in the present arrangements. If the Bill receives Royal Assent and becomes law, they will be pleased because they have argued in favour of it for a long time. As with all new legislation
