</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The sitting motion that I tabled earlier this week has not been selected. That is a pity, to say the very least. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) and other supporters of the Bill expressed the hope that the Bill would be dealt with expeditiously without the use of delaying tactics or filibuster. I acquit the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), who is not in his place, of taking anyone by surprise, as he said on Second Reading that he would table many amendments. What his motives are I cannot say, but he has done so. This morning's amendment paper contains around 150 new amendments, although we have reached our third sitting and are yet to leave the first line of the substantive part of the Bill.
<P>
Debating our original sittings motion before Christmas, several Members made it clear that they deprecated any use of parliamentary tactics or filibuster. The hon. Member for Worcester said:
"The Committee should not indulge in deliberate delaying tactics doing so would be wholly wrong. The British public and many hon. Members do not necessarily understand some of the House's more arcane practices." [Official Report, Standing Committee C, 17 December 1997; c. 4.]
<P>
I can assure the Committee that the hon. gentleman is learning fast.
<P>
The hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) also not here this morning said:
"If there are concerns about the legislation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester said I doubt that there are, because I know the trouble that he took to find expert advice before drafting the legislation" [Official Report, Standing Committee C, 17 December 1997; c. 6.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am reluctant to intervene on the hon. and learned Gentleman. As I have not selected his motion, it is fair to give him an opportunity on a point of order to make his point. However, he is in danger of engaging in the debate that would have taken place had I selected his motion. I ask him to make his case as succinctly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I hope that you will give me a little indulgence, Mr. O'Hara. We are talking about an extension of the criminal law. The Bill would have the power to send people to prison or fine them heavily. If we are to criminalise hundreds of thousands of innocent British citizens, the Committee must address itself to the promises that Members gave. I do not impugn anyone's motives, but the consequences of the Committee's current conduct will be to bring the Committee into disrepute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Absolute rubbish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Sedentary interventions of that calibre merely amplify my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Could I intervene?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman cannot intervene on a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I will do my best to ignore the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin). There are a number of other citations from Hansard of 17 December, to which I will not refer because of your strictures, Mr. O'Hara. The general point that they all made was that filibustering and delaying tactics were to be deprecated.
<P>
The Bill extends the criminal law. It makes criminals of hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens. If the Committee is to recover the respect of the general public that it ought to have, I suggest either that it be brought into order by curtailment and making more economic use of time, or that it agree to my sittings motion.
<P>
Members of the Committee clearly want to talk a great deal about the Bill. We are still on line 1 of clause 1. If the hon. Member for Worcester is sincere in his desire to get the Bill on to the statute book, he will either bring his right hon. and hon. Friends into order, or he will agree to my sittings motion that we sit on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
<P>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish clearly does not think that we have enough time. I find it extremely surprising that the hon. Member for[Mr. Garnier]
Worcester who is conducting the Committee thinks that we have enough time. I urge you, Mr. O'Hara, to reconsider your decision not to select my sittings motion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Chairmen are guided by precedent. We have examined the record and the precedent for the moving of a procedural motion in Committee by someone other than the sponsor of the Bill is most unusual. In the past 30 years, that has happened on only three occasions and those were in the most exceptional circumstances.
<P>
In my judgment, we are not in the most exceptional circumstances. Therefore, I see no justification for departing from that strong precedent. The hon. and learned Gentleman points out that we are debating changes in criminal law, about which we should proceed with the utmost caution. If we are to proceed with the utmost caution, we should give full and frank opportunity for such matters to be considered. However, precedent guides me. Precedent for my acceptance of a procedural motion that is not tabled by the sponsor of the Bill is extremely rare. I do not find the exceptional circumstances that would justify my selecting the amendment. However, I gave the hon. and learned Gentleman the opportunity to make his case, which he did with a little correction succinctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am most grateful for that explanation. Will you clarify a matter for me, Mr. O'Hara? I think that you said that it was unusual. Is it unheard of?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I said extremely rare. Three times in 30 years is extremely rare.
<P>
<B>Miss Ann Widdecombe </B>(Maidstone and The Weald): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The word filibuster has been used. There is such a thing as a careful and thorough examination of the Bill, and there is something else called a filibuster. We look to the Chair to keep us in order, not, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) suggested, to the sponsor of the Bill. Is it your view, Mr. O'Hara, that what we have had so far is a thorough examination of the Bill?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> So far, those parts of the Bill that have been examined have been examined extremely thoroughly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I would like to draw the Committee's attention to an incident that took place yesterday afternoon and that is central to the purpose of the Committee. It took place in Kent, between Paddock wood and Tonbridge, on the Eurostar rail 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Events that took place in Kent are not the business of the Committee and are, therefore, not the subject of points of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): Good morning, Mr. O'Hara. I note that we have already had the better part of 10 minutes spent, an ungenerous fellow might say, filibustering. At the end of the previous sitting, we were having a good debate on amendments tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. I hope that today will be similar and that we will examine the Bill carefully.
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough said in his point of order that the Bill was designed to turn hundreds of thousands of innocent people into criminals. Of course, that is not its intention it will not be applied retrospectively. If the Bill is enacted, anyone who chooses to break the law will, ipso facto, not be innocent because they will have chosen to break the law. The hon. and learned Gentleman presented something of a false argument, but I say this in a spirit of conciliation that proves the need for careful deliberation. When the Bill reaches the Report stage we should be confident that we have produced a robust, fair and good piece of legislation that fulfils the requirements laid down on Second Reading and the wishes of the British public, who strongly support it.
<P>
At our previous sitting, we began to discuss the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. He said that the amendment was intended to change the offence from that of intentionally hunting a wild mammal with dogs to that of killing a wild mammal. Members on both sides of the Committee agreed that our debate about the amendment went to the heart of the Bill. How far should the Bill go and what should it reasonably cover? My hon. Friend, who is not currently in the Committee, presented several arguments and showed that the amendment would bring the Bill more in line with the public's wishes. The public are concerned about the unnecessary savaging to death of a fox, a hare or any other wild mammal. However, the amendment seems to imply that the public are therefore not concerned with other aspects of hunting, namely its random nature, the chase, the inconvenience that is caused to others and the stress that is caused to the mammal being hunted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Will my hon. Friend join me in condemning the West Kent fox hounds? Yesterday, in pursuit 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I thought that a moment ago you invited the hon. Member for Worcester to control himself on the grounds that what goes on in Kent is not the Committee's business.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> More precisely, I said that the hon. Gentleman's point should not be the subject of a point of order. However, it could be the subject of an intervention on an amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. Kent is part of the United Kingdom and it is covered by United Kingdom legislation.
<P>
The actions of the West Kent fox hounds are relevant to our debate. Yesterday, in pursuit of a fox somewhere between Paddock wood and Tonbridge, that hunt came across the Eurostar rail line. At 14.12 the driver of a test train who was travelling along that line reported a fire on the track and the emergency services were called. When the driver reached the scene of the incident, he saw that 10 fox hounds had been electrocuted and had ignited. The chase meant that those fox hounds had crossed a rail line, been electrocuted and had ignited, which caused delays to 43 trains. That is central to our debate about the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am happy to listen to the hon. Member for Worcester, who is obviously keen for the Committee to sit for as long as possible. However, he has intervened at length and should, perhaps have made his point in a speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps the intervention of the hon. Member for Worcester has become a little long and he should draw his remarks to a speedy close.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall return to that matter later because it is central to our debate. The animal being chased suffers unnecessarily, but so did the fox hounds that ignited when they crossed a high-speed electric rail line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. I was unaware of that incident, but it does not represent an unusual occurrence the whole point is that hunting is of such a random nature. The alternative is drag hunting, in which a route can be planned in advance to ensure that such things do not occur. That would be a great advantage to all concerned.
<P>
In response to constituents who have written to me about the Bill, I have said several times that I regard the abolition of hunting with dogs as an animal welfare issue, not merely for the animal being hunted. Injuries to horses and fox hounds should also be considered. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester might be interested to hear that my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew), while riding at the weekend, found a fox hound that had lost the pack and was wandering, lost and lonely, on the hillsides of Cumbria. I am pleased to say that, as he is a responsible Member, he returned the hound to the huntsmen. As the hound was clearly a conscientious objector, In only hope that it was not shot at dawn. That is the fate of most hunting hounds that are past their sell-by date.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Member that his main business is to speak to the amendment, not to deal with the intervention at great length.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. O'Hara. I will speak about public opinion, as it relates to the amendment, later in my speech. The public do not share my hon. Friend's opinion that it would be acceptable for the Bill to deal only with killing.
<P>
Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. \UOpik) is not present; I hope that he will be later. He has already contributed to the debate on this amendment by urging caution on hon. Members who argue that hunting is an unnatural act that causes animals to behave unnaturally. As we heard in the debate last week, animals go to abattoirs to supply food, which cannot be construed as acting naturally. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire pointed out that the Bill does not deal with fishing. I agree that it does not and it was never intended to. Hon Members should be reminded that this is a hunting with dogs Bill. I said last week that I knew of no abattoirs that use packs of dogs to kill the animals. Similarly, I have never seen a fisherman send dogs into water equipped with snorkels and flippers. The Bill seeks to protect wild animals from intentional hunting and the amendment would seriously dilute that intention.
<P>
The simple truth despite the analogies that hon. Members opposing the Bill seek to draw is that nothing quite compares to hunting with dogs. It is unique. The sport for the record, when I use the word sport in this context I tend to put it in inverted commas involves the training of one set of animals to chase, harry and kill another animal, purely for the entertainment of human beings. After all, that is why hunting with dogs was invented in the first place. We have had other debates we will no doubt have more on the role of hunting with dogs in controlling fox numbers. I believe, as do most hon. Members, that hunting with dogs plays no role in keeping fox numbers down in parts of the country where that is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin McNamara </B>(Hull, North): I am worried about the accuracy of my hon. Friend's statement that hunting was originally introduced for sport. I thought that originally it was to obtain food for the people. We want to get rid of the practice because it is no longer necessary for that purpose and is now used for sport. I would hate my hon. Friend to be attacked for being inaccurate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am as grateful as ever for the guidance of my right hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I am not right honourable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am sorry, I thought that my hon. Friend was right honourable. If he is not, then he should be. In terms of history, he is certainly able to get much closer to the dates concerned than I am. Therefore, I am happy to accept his guidance on this matter.
<P>
Whatever this history, we no longer need to hunt with dogs. That is why the Bill is so important and why it enjoys so much support from the British people.
<P>
Last week, during the debate on a previous amendment, I introduced the subject of changing the Bill's title. Hon. Members will recall that we were discussing whether the offence should be one of intentionally hunting with dogs and whether the Bill should have a different title. During that debate, we were rebuked by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) for smiling at a story about a Dobermann that attacked a Yorkshire terrier. I want to make it clear that we were not smiling about the story, but about the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West alluded to a Dobermann called Hannah. That was the source of amusement not that there is anything wrong with that name; it is a beautiful name and I have an equally beautiful daughter with that name. We were certainly not smiling at the atrocity committed on the Yorkshire terrier.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> Good try.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> The amendment would require us to consider changing the title of the Bill yet again. We could hardly pass legislation entitled the Wild[Mr. Cawsey]
Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill if we changed the offence to one of killing. During last week's debate we discussed including the word "intentionally" in the title. Now we could have a Bill entitled the "Wild mammals (intentional killing of dogs with odd names) Bill", which could set a record for the Bill with the longest name ever. That is not the Committee's intention. We want a Bill that is simple to understand and, when it becomes law, easy to implement. Although the Bill's title is important for clarity of intent, it is not as important as workable legislation. The amendment is fundamentally flawed because it would introduce an element of doubt about when a criminal offence has been committed.
<P>
The fact that an animal lies dead at the end of a hunt does not necessarily prove who killed the animal or the cause of death. If the amendment were accepted, it would be necessary to prove that. It could mean that there would have to be a post mortem after every hunt to establish the cause of death. That would certainly show some interesting results because, on the few occasions when a post mortem has been possible at the end of a hunt, it has often been found that the cause of death was not, as supporters of hunting suggest, a single bite to the back of the neck. I know that the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has undertaken post mortems which showed that disembowelling and other nasty rituals had taken place and the animal had suffered a slow death, not the quick death that hunters would have us believe.
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, would it be a criminal offence if a mammal died of a heart attack during the chase? Probably not, but it shows the difficulties that would result from accepting the amendment in its present form. The amendment would enable stag hunting to continue because dogs would be able to chase and harry the stag. They may even pull it to shreads after it is dead, but the actual act of killing, usually undertaken by a hyped-up, over-excited human, getting off on shooting a terrified beast, would be legal.
<P>
Professor Bateson has given graphic evidence about the stag's suffering before finally being killed. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) will probably speak on that subject later.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, North): I intend to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am pleased to hear it.
<P>
I do not believe that the House, which voted overwhelmingly in favour of the legislation on Second Reading, wanted us to send it back a Bill that allows the practice of stag hunting to continue. Indeed, Professor Bateson's report is so damaging to the case of those who wish to hunt with dogs that the British Field Sports Society sent Lord Soulsby to discredit it. One can only wonder at what amount of silver crossed his palm, but whatever it was, he failed. Bateson's report is highly credible. Surely it is no surprise to anyone that it severely damages the case of those who wish to continue to hunt.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> What did the hon. Gentleman mean by referring to silver crossing the palm of Lord Soulsby?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman needs clarification. I suggest that he visits a gipsy to obtain a satisfactory answer for himself.
<P>
I hope that we will reject the amendment and get to the stage when the Bill can be sent to the other place with its original intentions in tact. Lord Soulsby and the like will then have their opportunity to consider amendemts such as the one we are discussing. They can try to find persuasive arguments to challenge Bateson and to amend the Bill. There has, of course, been much media interest recently, not only in the Bill and its progress but also in Government plans to abolish hereditary peers. The peers have told us that they do not intend to distort Government legislation, whatever party is in power or whatever the wishes of the House. When the Bill with, I hope, this aspect unamended finally reaches the other place, peers will have an ideal opportunity to show that they respect the wishes of the democratic House and to acknowledge that their role is not to distort or block legislation. What an excellent time it is for them to prove that. Perhaps people will reconsider their role in Parliament, if they prove themselves worthy of the title that they give themselves.
<P>
Other hunting activities could also be affected by the amendment or, rather, unaffected by it. The amendment would allow crated stag hunting to continue. For those who are not aware of crated stag hunting, I should explain that it certainly happens in Ireland on both sides of the border. A stag is caught and physically forced into a crate, which is transported to that part of the countryside where the stag is to be pursued. The stag is then released, by which time it is injured and distressed, to be chased and harried as usual by the dogs. As with all stag hunting, it is the inevitable slow chase that it is designed to be. Eventually, the dogs corner the stag, as is always the case. When they do so, the stag is not actually killed because, as it is not from that environment it is not a danger to it. The stag is recaptured and placed back in the crate, which is returned from whence it came with an exhausted, frightened and disturbed animal, which is then released.
<P>
The amendment would allow that activity to continue. I do not believe that when the British public overwhelmingly endorsed this private Member's Bill, they thought that the Committee would allow that activity to continue. It beggars belief and is yet another reason why the amendment should be rejected.
<P>
How might the amendment affect fox hunting, which is the most high-profile hunt it is the most well known and people find it the most offensive? Again, what will happen if the only illegality occurs when the kill is made? Some people are desperate to keep hunting. I can almost imagine them removing the teeth of the hounds so that they could continue to hunt without savaging the fox to death at the end, although perhaps the hounds could give it a nasty suck. Proving a kill would be difficult, which would be an incentive for those who want to continue to hunt foxes with hounds to do so. They would know that successful prosecution would be difficult because of having to prove how the fox had been killed. I do not believe that that is what the British public want.
<P>
At our first sitting, I said that there is no registered hunt in my large rural constituency. I also said that occasionally perhaps once a year the village of Alkborough is an uneasy host to the Brocklesby hunt. Following those comments, villagers have contacted me to express concern that if the Bill or amendments such as these are successful, that practice may continue. The problem is not just the fox or the hounds, but the impact that the hunt has on the lives of those who live in areas where uncontrolled hunting takes place, as we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. In my constituency, footpaths are chained and a farmer who runs an outdoor pig unit told me that the hunt ran across his land uninvited, and startled his pigs. There are many pigs in north Lincolnshire it is completely unsubsidised farming, by the way and it is not good enough that people who are going about their duties and business are harassed in that way.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Am I right in thinking that the hon. Gentleman's constituency has mostly arable farming rather than stock farming?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I just said that there are many pigs. We do not grow them, they are animals. There is a lot of arable farming, but we also have pigs, as is probably the case in any other part of the country. Indeed, my neighbouring Member of Parliament, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), and I describe our part of the world as the pig capital of Britain. We are very proud of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Perhaps I may make myself clear. The point that I was trying to agree with the hon. Gentleman is that his constituency is not a grassland, but an arable constituency. I dare say that the pigs may once have stood on grass, but when they come off the field, the grass is probably no longer there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> In that respect, I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman, but we also have some beef and quite a lot of sheep, especially in the Isle of Axholme. I fear that you will tell me, Mr. O'Hara, that I am waxing lyrical about the beauty and joys of north Lincolnshire and east Yorkshire rather than the amendment, but we have occasional hunting, which is pertinent to the Bill, although no hunt is registered in the constituency. Foxes have been driven into the village and that has been distressing for the people who live there. My point concerns the random nature of hunting, and if the amendment were successful, that would continue because there would be ways round the legislation to enable hunting to continue.
<P>
We have had one example today from my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, but many hon. Members will have heard about the incident in Sheffield over Christmas, when hounds ran across a school playground. Such incidents should not be lightly dismissed and we do not want the Bill to allow them to continue. We want to encourage those who want to follow dogs and ride their horses to change to drag hunting and to stop the sort of atrocities that we have been discussing.
<P>
If the amendment is successful, hare coursing could continue. We all know what happens. Two dogs run after a hare and those who try to support hare coursing say that they do not often catch it. I doubt whether there are official statistics, but if that comment is taken at face value, would hare coursing be able to continue if a successful prosecution required a kill? I would be surprised if any member of the Committee had not seen photographic evidence of the appalling situation when the hare is caught by both dogs and ends up in a tug of war in which there is only one loser the hare. If the organisers act quickly, they can stop that tug of war so that the hare is not killed. In that case, under the amendment, they would not have committed an offence, but the hare would still have been chased for no purpose other than human pleasure and would have had to undergo the terror of the tug of war. Literally, it would have its neck saved, but when the British public say that they want hunting with dogs ended, that sort of activity is what they want banished to the dustbin of history. I am not sure that my hon. Friend's amendment would be satisfactory to the public in that it dilutes the Bill's intentions.
<P>
I do not believe that anyone seriously argues that there is a case for hare hunting these days. The hare population is only 20 per cent. of what it was 100 years ago. Hare hunting is designed to be slow, providing a long chase and a "thrill" for those who participate. It has nothing to do with conservation. In Horse and Hound in 1980, a correspondent wrote that a pack of dogs was considered to be well bred if it took 60 to 90 minutes to run the hare to exhaustion and kill it. The letter stated:
"It is probably better to have a good hunt of over an hour or 90 minutes rather than overmatch the hare and pull her down in 20 minutes."<P>

<P>
That says a lot about the mentality of those who want to follow a hunt. It is nice to hear Opposition Members making the odd contribution odd can be used in several contexts but let us hear no more nonsense about hare hunting being about conservation and the countryside. It is to do with individual pleasure over as long a period as possible. The amendment would make the law so difficult to implement that I fear that hare hunting would continue. We would have to prove the cause of death, which may be difficult.
<P>
If the Bill ends up saying that it is illegal not to hunt with dogs but to kill with dogs, monitoring the hunt would be crucial. Otherwise, the legislation would be ineffective and not worth having. Who, therefore, will carry out the monitoring? Will it be the policy? They often have to attend hunts, but they have an awful lot to do without monitoring them to satisfy themselves whether the dog killed the fox, hare or whatever and whether there should be a prosecution. The amendment takes us into a grey area and we should reject it so that we get clearly understood legislation that is easier to implement.
<P>
The policing of hunts is, however, relevant, particularly if the amendment succeeds. For four years before I came here, I was chairman of Humberside police authority, where we discussed that issue several times. The amendment would make it even more difficult to judge whether the police should charge for their services or give them as part of their public order duties. Many of us find it slightly perverse that widely supported professional sports, such as the Premier[Mr. Cawsey]
League and any division, pay the police for policing football matches that are attended by hundreds of thousands of people every weekend, but hunting with hounds, which is supported by a minority, is policed free of charge. I hope that the Home Office may deal with that perverse situation during this Parliament.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The costs of policing take us somewhat far from the business of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. The point that I was coming to and, in view of your ruling, I shall get there more quickly is that if the amendment were adopted the police presence at hunts would have to be increased. Who would pay for their services? If hunts continue to receive free services from the police and urban sports do not, there will be a significant effect on local council tax payers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Is not the distinction very simple? In Premier League football matches, the clubs or the companies that own the clubs invite the police on to their private land to perform crowd control functions. The police are not invited by masters of fox hunts or by anyone else to attend hunts. The police go there because they fear that there will be a breach of the peace by hunt saboteurs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> That is an interesting distinction, but it is totally incorrect. The hon. and learned Gentleman appears to be saying that if football teams did not invite the police to football matches they would not be there, but we all know that that is complete and utter nonsense. They go there for the same reasons that they go to hunts, namely, because they are concerned about potential public order offences and because they want to discharge their duties. I have a problem not with that, but with the fact that the police presence is a chargeable duty for urban sports and is free for rural sports, which is inherently unfair.
<P>
Enforcing the distinction between hunting and killing would involve an increased police presence, and council tax charges would inevitably rise. If the amendment were accepted, the Home Office would have to consider that matter.
<P>
I said earlier that I wanted to discuss what the public expect from the Bill. They expect a Bill that will ban hunting with dogs. That is simple and unequivocal and it is not open to misrepresentation because everyone will be able to understand what the law of the land requires. If the amendment were adopted, the Bill could be interpreted in different ways by different police forces and by different courts. If we watered down the Bill as much as the amendment requires, the public would be completely amazed.
<P>
Since last week, when we began discussing the amendment, I have gone through all the mail that I received on this matter from my constituents. Interestingly, there has not been the slightest indication in any letter that people want the Bill to include the distinction that is in the amendment. The amendment was moved on the grounds that that is what the public want it was alleged that they were concerned about kills but not about the rest of the hunt. The letters that I have received do not suggest that that is the case.
<P>
One of the great joys of representing my constituency is the fact that it is mainly rural, but partly urban. We keep hearing about rural Members letting down urban Members or vice versa. I have, as it were, a foot in each camp. The public want a simple Bill that bans hunting with dogs they do not want one that includes this odd amendment. The people who live in the urban part of my constituency, which is the port of Goole, tended not to write in great numbers about this matter. The people who wrote were my rural constituents. Of nearly 1,000 letters, 95 per cent. have been in favour of the Bill, and 5 per cent. against. Nearly all those constituents are from the rural part of my constituency and they want the Bill in its original state, without the amendments.
<P>
We hear over and over that the Bill is about the urban versus the rural parts of the country. That is simply not true. I represent a partly urban, partly rural constituency, and my mail bag tells me so. I received a letter this week from Mrs. Crothers of Goole who accused me of saying that no one in Goole had been interest in the Bill. To be fair to her she is a very nice person she does not support the Bill, but she made the point that even people in urban areas were entitled to that view. However, public opinion wants the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> A moment ago, the hon. Gentleman said that the 1,000 or so people who had written to him wanted the Bill to be passed in its original state. Will he undertake not to table or support any further amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> If the hon. and learned Gentleman reads the record, he will see that I have not moved any amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I said, any further amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole has just said that he has not moved any.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) and I come from Humberside. He is our senior Member I say that in the nicest possible way and is brilliant at keeping me on track. I am grateful to him for that point.
<P>
My constituents want a Bill that will ban hunting with dogs. My intention is to ensure that that is what we get. If an amendment would achieve that or if someone could persuade me that the Bill needed to be changed to make that happen, I would support that amendment or person. My constituents want a Bill that will ban all hunting with dogs, not just when kills are made, with all the difficulties that that distinction raises.
<P>
I understand the intentions of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. He is sincere in saying that the amendment would make the Bill more acceptable. However, having considered the matter carefully, spoken to constituents and read by mail, I believe that the public want a simple Bill to ban hunting with dogs and that more likely if we reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I apologise for not being here last week for the beginning of the debate on these amendments. I have read Hansard diligently and am aware of the substance of the debate.
<P>
When I read amendment No. 19, I was surprised that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish thought that it was worth debating. It seemed obvious that it would take out the heart of the Bill. However, I then read the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire, who said:
"The cruelty that people perceive is when the dogs kill the fox." [Official Report, Standing Committee C, 14 January 1998; c.76.]<P>

<P>
He said that changing the Bill would eliminate that perceived cruelty. He added that the amendment enabled us to have a philosophical debate about the heart of the Bill. I realised then the main issue; what is cruelty? What aspect of this sport, pastime or whatever we call it do people find cruel and would like to ban?
<P>
On Second Reading, I spoke only about deer hunting. I called it deer hunting rather than stag hunting because not only stags but hinds are hunted in fact, I believe they are being hunted now. Today I wish to speak only about that matter, not because I am not interested in other matters, but because I am the only Member in Committee in whose constituency deer hunting takes place. As Hon. Members will know, deer hunting takes place in the constituencies of only three Members of the House: the right hon. Member for Bridgewater (Mr. King), the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) and myself. Two out of the three deer hunt packs are based in my constituency, so I have a responsibility, as well as a right, to speak about the matter.
<P>
For the record, I believe that there are also six or seven fox hunt packs in my constituency. I am over-blessed with hunt packs, and that has given me an interesting postbag. However, the majority of my constituents support my stance on the issue.
<P>
There are red deer in other parts of the west country, as well as Cumbria, East Anglia and Scotland, none of which are hunted. Only those on the Quantocks and Exmoor must suffer being hunted. Annually, 1,000 red deer are culled by rifle on the Quantocks and Exmoor. A further 150 are culled by the hunt, but they, too, are culled by rifle, not by dogs. If the amendment were accepted, it would allow the chase to continue. It would also allow culling to continue because that is done by rifle and not by dogs yet it is the chase that most people find so offensive and cruel. No one who has the welfare of red deer in mind objects to culling. In fact, they need to be culled because they are successful at increasing their numbers and, without culling, would probably become a pest.
<P>
I have to disagree with the hon. Member whose constituency I cannot remember, although I know that it is the pig capital of the world 
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Brigg and Goole.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Thank you.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the most offensive hunting was fox hunting. I think that deer hunting is the most offensive. Having spoken to many hon. Members about the matter during the past few months, I believe that if there had been a vote on deer hunting alone, the result would have been 99 per cent. to 1 per cent. because most hon. Members think that it should have ended a long time ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> The Bill aims to encompass all types of hunting. In the past, people tried to persuade us to legislate first about hare coursing, then about stag hunting, and hoped that we would also deal with fox hunting. In relation to hare coursing, we got a Bill through the House of Commons, which then went to the House of Lords, where a special Committee was formed and the Bill was effectively killed. If this Bill is going to be killed in the House of Lords, let us make sure that we include everything in it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Yes, I must make it clear that I agree with all the items encompassed by the Bill; I am just taking issue with the suggestion that fox hunting is the most offensive form of hunting. I think that deer hunting is the most offensive but, in discussing cruelty to animals, the measurement of offensiveness is pretty subjective. I want to talk about the cruelty involved in hunting deer cruelty that has been taking place for many years.
<P>
I have a letter to the North Devon Herald dated 1926 about an incident that took place that summer. The writer says,
"For some weeks two or three very fine stags have been seen on Summer House Hill. It was hoped these noble animals would not be disturbed, as they would add so much to the attraction of beautiful Lynton; but alas, this was not to be, and much to our regret the hounds were brought and one of these noble animals was chased and driven over the Tors, and stones were thrown. The stag leapt over the cliff and broke its neck, leg and antlers. When the stag was landed on the beach and brought to Lynmouth residents and visitors protested against such diabolical cruelty, and hissed and booed the huntsmen and followers."<P>

<P>
Would the Bill allow that to occur? That stag was chased, admittedly in 1926, but it was not killed by its hunters. It could be argued that it committed suicide because it leapt over a cliff and broke its neck. The amendment would allow that cruelty to continue.
<P>
A series of incidents of cruelty 1926 was probably not the first involving the hunting of stags and deer has been documented by the League Against Cruel Sports, the Devon and Somerset Residents Association for Deer Protection and many others. I have pages of such incidents, but I shall not read them out. Many reached the national press. It was reported that a hunted stag which was chased into the village of Hawcombe took refuge on a cottage roof. I expect many hon. Members saw the photograph of that stag standing on the roof. A pregnant hind was chased by the Quantock stag hounds over Triscombe quarry and landed on a ledge. That incident prompted an outcry locally and, I think, also attracted national publicity. The Quantock stay hounds drew massive media publicity when they dragged a cornered deer out of a doctor's porch in the village of Merridge, where it had sought refuge. It was reported that garden furniture and ornaments were smashed as huntsmen struggled with the young stag. That is part of the cruelty involved in the hunt, not the kill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> The hon. Lady is giving us an appalling catalogue of cruelty. Would she be interested in taking an intervention in defence of that cruelty?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I certainly would, but opponents of the Bill are sitting in silence. Perhaps they think that such cruelty to wild mammals is acceptable. I would happily accept an intervention explaining why they believe that that is so, but they continue to sit in stony silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of the phrase, "silence is deafening"?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> It is certainly not golden on this occasion.
<P>
Another incident, again captured on video, involved a fine Exmoor stag being manhandled and almost drowned in the river Barle by members of the Devon and Somerset stag hounds after being misshot several times before finally being killed. That was regarded as so appalling by people who support deer hunting that the Masters of Deerhounds Association imposed a five-week ban on the Devon and Somerset stag hounds.
<P>
My final example might partly explain why the National Trust, in response both to the Bateson report about which we shall hear more shortly and to other events, decided to ban deer hunting on its land. In August 1996, an exhausted stag lay down in the heather on National Trust land. It had run approximately 15 miles over very hilly country and could go no further. The hunt master took aim three times with his short-barrelled shotgun from a distance of no more than five yards. The stag's body jolted before it stood up and ran off with its jaw smashed and blood dripping from its wound. It was a further 15 minutes before the stag was finally killed with a humane killer.
<P>
That is another example of the cruelty involved in deer hunting, a cruelty which I believe most decent people wish to see ended. I take the silence of those opposed to the Bill as a sign that they too would wish that cruelty to be stopped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): Does the hon. Lady accept that many people who have written to me trying to justify stag hunting would abhor what she has described? They would argue that the pursuit could be regulated so that hunting could continue. Her horrible examples could be regulated out of existence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ballard:</B> I would be interested to hear how they could be regulated. How could we prevent a stag getting into a river and then being chased by hounds? How could we prevent a frightened stag from landing on a cottage roof or ending up on a ledge in a quarry? My predecessor, the previous hon. Member for Taunton, although a supporter of hunting, was so appalled by some of the things that were reported to be happening in the Quantock stag hounds that he set himself up as a monitor of that hunt and promised to report any of its wrongdoings. I never read any of his reports and I am not sure what form the monitoring took did he follow them regularly, three times a week, or did he have more pressing work in Westminster? I cannot see how those sorts of things can be regulated; we must press for an outright ban. That, of course, is what the National Trust eventually did, in response to the Bateson report. That report said unequivocally that
"hunting a deer with hounds over a period of several hours is unnatural"
<P>
It does not simulate hunting with wolves hounds are bred for stamina. People who go hunting want a long hunt; they do not want it to be over quickly. I have met people who have come from Essex even some who have come from as far away as the United States for a day's hunting on Exmoor. I was not being rude about Essex, by the way. It is as good as Kent, but not as good as Somerset.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> It is not as good as Kent.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I was not talking about cricket.
<P>
Some people are willing to pay a couple of hundred pounds or more for a day of deer hunting. They are not just from Exmoor or the Quantocks they come from further afield. Such hunts are even advertised on the internet, which is why people from the United States are attracted. If they pay a few hundred pounds a day for the pleasure of going deer hunting, they do not want it to be over in five minutes. They want a long hunt and it is designed to be so.
<P>
One of those who responded to the report was Dr. John Henshaw, who has owned a herd of deer from parkland for 18 years. He said:
"The importance and value of the Bateson report cannot be diminished, but it has to be said that the nature of myopathy has been long known, also its potential as a likely cause of severe and unwarranted suffering to the red deer of the West Country. The conclusions of Professor Bateson's study will assist in the development of a more rational and humane system for deer control and management, though it is sad to consider that attitudes prevailed to ignore the red light of suffering by deer that had been switched on such a long time before"<P>

<P>
What did Members vote for on Second Reading and what did the public expect? Did they expect us to ban the killing of wild animials, or did they expect us to ban hunting? A national opinion poll, which specifically dealt with hunting, found that only 4 per cent. of the population approved of it and 81 per cent. disapproved. I suspect that the missing 15 per cent. could not make up their minds. Interestingly, 76 per cent. of Conservative voters disapproved of stag hunting, so it is not a question of party loyalty.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> All is not lost.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I think that most decent people disapprove of stag hunting. Most people in rural areas as well as those in urban areas disapprove of stag hunting. It is the hunt that they disapprove of, not merely the kill.
<P>
I read the West Somerset Free Press every week, usually because it is very rude about me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Is it free?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> No, it is not free. It devotes half a page a week bizarrely, although they must think that there is some commercial advantage in it to tales of hunting on Exmoor and the Quantocks. Someone presumably a member of the hunt writes a long discourse on it. Hon. Members should not be concerned; I will not read it out, despite the fact that it refers a great deal to attractive parts of my constituency. The report contains two columns of description of stag hunting the one I have here concerns the chasing of an old stag on 20 October including what the hounds are doing and where they go after a comprehensive tour of the plantation. Clearly, this was not a short hunt. The final words of the report were that the hunt was stopped and that, "Home" was the order. Therefore there was no kill. The report described the chase and the hunt. It then went on for nearly three columns about where the hunt went and what happened. Finally, it went down to take the stag under Badgeworthy Cottage.
<P>
The next tale says that the stag was accounted for just before 6 o'clock. I think that hunts usually set off at about noon, so it was a six-hour hunt.
<P>
The tales never use the word kill, which is very interesting; they use phrases such as accounted for, or seen off. Perhaps they are slightly squeamish about using the word kill. It is not the kill that they find so interesting and exciting, and that they want to write about in the local paper, it is the hunt.
<P>
The amendment has been useful although I found it bizarre because it has allowed consideration of the issues at the heart of the debate on hunting. However, I feel very strongly that the amendment needs to be killed off or accounted for by the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we proceed with the debate on this group of amendments, in listening to the debate so far, I have become increasingly aware that hunting is being defined in terms of intentional cruelty to animals. I am therefore minded to group other amendments with this group of amendments as their subject matter is already in large measure being debated. They are: Amendment No. 44, in line 6, after "mammal" insert "and intentionally causes any unnecessary suffering to that wild mammal".<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): It is interesting to take stock of where the Committee is on the amendment. This is the third sitting of the Committee 
<P>
Mr. McNamara rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I know that it is not the hon. Gentleman's fault that he was not here earlier today when that point was made by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. Perhaps, however, you, Mr. O'Hara, could explain that we have already dealt with that point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is only proper that I should allow the hon. Gentleman to make his point briefly before I respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> This is the second time that I have spoken during the Committee's proceedings. I utter four words, and am interrupted twice by two Labour Members, which shows some degree of the tolerance with which they approach the proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am not giving way to the hon. Gentleman. I should be allowed to utter at least a sentence before I give way. Those who oppose the Bill have listened with courtesy 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is making a point of order and I want to take that point of order before another point of order is raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I have not made a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. You called me to speak.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I beg your pardon. I was under the impression that the hon. Gentleman was about to make a point of order. If it is not a point of order, I will take the point of order from the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara).
<P>
<B>Mr. McNamara:</B> I wonder whether you would be kind enough to explain to the Committee, Mr. O'Hara, how the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) can take stock of the position that we are now in when he has never been present to discuss it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I note the point, but it is not a point of order for me to rule on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Are you calling me to speak in the debate, Mr. O'Hara.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> You are being called to speak in the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> This is a continuation of a debate that was in full flow last week. The Committee will know that many of those who oppose the Bill have a number of other responsibilities; I am also on the Trade and Industry Select Committee. I do not think that it is necessary to be present for the whole debate to understand points that are made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> To reinforce the point that my hon. Friend is making, the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard), who has just resumed her seat, candidly admitted that she was not here at all last week, but has just made a most interesting contribution to the deliberations on the amendment. The point of order raised by the hon. Gentleman is therefore 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The point raised by the hon. Member for Hull, North was not accepted by the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I find it rather sad that so far in the proceedings, those who oppose the Bill have listened with care and courtesy to the points that have been made by the other side, without making the sort of rather juvenile interventions that the hon. Member for Hove just made. I had hoped that as this is a serious debate on a serious issue, there could be mutual courtesy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> As the hon. Gentleman mentioned me, I shall intervene, although I did not do so earlier. During my speech on the amendment last week I asked the opponents of the Bill they are represented by the two Conservative Members two specific questions concerning the Bateson evidence. Are you going to challenge Bateson's scientific evidence, which was accepted by the Royal Society, or do you now accept it? Fundamental to the Bill and the hunting, killing and suffering of animals is whether the opponents of the Bill now accept the Royal Society's endorsement.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the hon. Member for Banbury resumes, and after trying to analyse the syntax[The Chairman]
of that intervention, I think, that I am justified in drawing attention to the fact that all comments should be addressed to the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Phrases such as "spit it out", which was the hon. Gentleman's intervention, are juvenile. Perhaps I may now continue my speech in my own way.
<P>
This is the third sitting of the Committee and we are still discussing line 1, clause 1 of the Bill. I cannot recall being a member of any Committee that has made such slow progress.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Chair is under the impression that we are discussing line 5.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> We are discussing the question of substituting the word kill for the word hunt, which is in line 1.
<P>
Whether the word is hunt or kill, the Bill would criminalise certain activities. Many criminal activities are easy to define in statute in very few words. For example, Parliament has found no difficulty in defining theft, which is dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving. It is defined in a single sentence in the Theft Act 1968. Yet here we are in week three of our discussion of the Bill, still considering amendments tabled by proponents of the Bill, who are trying to work out what they want to criminalise. They recognise that a substantial minority of people in this country do not consider hunting to be a criminal or potentially criminal activity.
<P>
Supporters of the Bill should recognise that law students in their first term of reading for a law degree must get to grips with what laws may cure and the fact that if laws are to be respected they must command public support. I suspect that one of the reasons for the Committee having to grapple with a whole host of amendments of definition Amendment No. 19 is one and other amendments refer solely to definition is that the sponsors of the Bill are having great difficulty in defining the activity that they want to criminalise. They want to anticipate people's reaction and realise that a substantial number of people in the countryside do not believe that what the Bill seeks to criminalise is a criminal activity. Every time proponents of the Bill table amendments, they demonstrate beyond preadventure that it is extraordinarily difficult to define as a criminal activity what they are seeking to outlaw. At the end of the day, it has to be recognised that some magistrates courts on a wet Thursday afternoon will have to interpret the legislation in relation to a particular activity which may or may not have gone on. Whereas the law of theft can be defined in a single sentence, here we have a multiclause Bill being multiply amended by its proponents who recognise that it is extremely difficult to define the activity they seek to criminalise. That simply endorses the fact that it is difficult and dangerous for Parliament to seek to criminalise activities which a large and substantial minority of people do not consider to be criminal.
<P>
The Opposition certainly learnt that with the community charge or poll tax. The poll tax had to be repealed and the council tax introduced because it simply did not command public support as valid law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> This does.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The hon. Gentleman must recognise that not just a few, but a substantial number of people gathered in Hyde park on 10 July. They may not be an absolute majority of the people in Britain but they are a substantial minority who clearly do not consider the activity that they are engaged in as criminal. Public support does not follow the Bill to that extent and that is demonstrated by the very fact that it is having to be amended, or potentially amended, so much.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I am a little bemused. As far as I understand it, the Bill has not been amended yet. The only amendments to have gone to a vote have been defeated. As I understand it after only eight months here, the purpose of the Committee stage is to use probing amendments to test the legislation. I should have thought, given the hon. Gentleman's legal background, that he would have appreciated the importance of getting the legislation right. I would welcome his views on that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member resumes, I am conscious of the fact that the tenor of his remarks is relevant to a clause stand part debate rather than addressing the specific amendments. On the other hand, it is likely that I shall be minded not to allow a clause stand part debate in view of the extensive debate on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I had nearly finished my remarks, but I thought that out of courtesy I should give way to the two hon. Members who had sought to intervene.
<P>
It is bizarre, to quote the hon. Member for Taunton, for the proponents of the Bill to table so many amendments. With a Government Bill, one sometimes expects Government drafting amendments if parliamentary counsel realise as the Bill goes through that they have made drafting errors. However, I certainly do not expect proponents of the Bill to argue that all the amendments relate to drafting errors. It is bizarre in the extreme for a Bill to be probed by its proponents. It is an insult to the House to bring to the House and Committee a Bill about which its proponents are so insecure that they require so many probing amendments. I give way to the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for remembering my place in the queue. He mentioned the rally in Hyde park as evidence of the support for hunting. Does he not accept that that rally was billed as a countryside rally to protect all aspects of country life? There may have been a number of people who were there not to support hunting at least it was advertised that way in my part of the country to get people to go along to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The hon. Lady must understand this goes to the nub of the matter that the thousands of people in Hyde park clearly see the ability to engage in field sports as an intrinsic part of the countryside. That they understand, and I suspect that no one in Hyde park was there other than because of their concern about the Bill. But they see the Bill as part of many assaults on the countryside as they perceive it right to trespass, interference with the way in which they husband and farm their land and so on. They see the Government's proposals for increasing and unrestricted access to the countryside as part of an urban-based urban Government imposing urban values on the countryside. That is why they were there on 10 July and, I suspect, why many thousands will be there again on 1 March.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> My hon. Friend said that it was bizarre that the Bill, which came through its Second Reading, was now being subjected to dozens if not hundreds of amendments. Is that not even more bizarre when we recall that in December last the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) said:
"The Bill is not long and it is not difficult." [Official Report, Standing Committee C, 17 December, 1997; c.18.]<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> At the outset, Conservative Members were given a pre-emptive lecture about filibustering, or protracting the Committee proceedings. I have no doubt that if those of us who opposed the Bill had tabled the same number and type of amendments we would have been accused of filibustering. I feel sure that its proponents cannot believe in filibustering their own Bill because it must be in the interests of anyone who promotes a Bill to get it in and out of Committee as speedily as possible. That cannot be the rational explanation for the extraordinary amendment paper. Labour Members being rational beings, we must therefore seek some other reason, so the only other rational explanation that I can think of is that, as a team, they have considerable difficulty working out what they wish to criminalise: end of story. Bill was intended as a criminal measure. I hope that in their difficulty they recognise that this demonstrates the difficulty of enforcing public consent on a measure on which there is none.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I stand by my earlier comments. No doubt the hon. Gentleman will be aware that I have neither tabled nor supported any of the amendments. However, it is right that hon. Members who have concerns that they wish to address, and who have heard the concerns of people outside the House, should bring them to Committee. If the drafting is flawed and questions need to be raised, this is the proper place to do so. If we did not examine the Bill fully, people outside the House would not understand why.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I realise that the Bill was drafted last summer. However, the hon. Lady has just demonstrated how perverse the whole business is if the Bill's proponents have introduced proposals in which they have so little confidence that its supporters considered a large number of amendments necessary.
<P>
Last week, there was the truly bizarre scene of the promoter of the Bill introducing an amendment, obliging the Minister present to support it and speak in its favour, and then voting against his own amendment. My point is constantly being remade; the Committee and the Bill's proponents have difficulty in defining what they seek to criminalise. It is as simple as that. The longer the Committee sits, the more they make it clear to people outside the House how difficult it is to pinpoint the activity that they want to criminalise while reinforcing the point that the Bill does not have public consent.
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am grateful to my usual hon. Friend for giving way. Does he not accept that it is a matter of courtesy to the House to discuss in Committee the points that have been raised in debates? Would the House not take it badly if we sat in Committee, waltzed through the Bill without dealing with those points and went back to the House without being able to say that earlier concerns had been addressed? Is it not the case that stag hunting and the issue of the chase versus the kill were raised in the House and should be examined in Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> My right hon. Friend, who is not without experience, will look at the amendment paper and not try to convince me without a smile on her face that these amendments have been tabled as a result of debate in the House. The amendments have arisen because the Bill's proponents are concerned about its initial drafting. None of the amendments has been tabled by opponents. The more amendments are tabled, the more it demonstrates the difficulties that the proponents are having in defining precisely what they are seeking to criminalise. [Interruption.] No, I shall not give way again. I have made the point ad nauseam and it was a good point the first time round. I am not sure that it is such a good point the 10th time round. It remains a valid point, however, and the more the Committee continues to debate it, the more it confirms its validity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> May I return the Committee to the amendment, which deals with the hunt versus the kill? I should also like to remind hon. Members of the point about yesterday's incident in Kent that I made briefly in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole. There it was the hunt not the kill that caused so much disruption. A total of 43 trains 
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am grateful to my temporary hon. Friend for giving way. Does he agree that if a hunt cannot even take care of its own hounds, it is futile to suggest that it can, through regulation, take account of what deer and other hunted animals do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to my temporary right hon. Friend who has made a valid point. I am sure that on this side of the Committee we would all concur with her thoughts.
<P>
Let me return to yesterday's incident in Kent. Of the 43 delayed trains, two were Eurostar trains coming from abroad one from Brussels, the other from Paris. We should think about the perspective that people in Belgium and France will gain of this country how it treats its wild mammals and other animals and whether hunting as opposed to killing is relevant. The Brussels train was delayed by 56 minutes; the Paris train, which had averages 700 passengers, was delayed by 28 minutes. The total delay for rail passengers our constituents was 600 minutes: 10 hours of delay caused by hunting.
[Mr. Foster]
<P>
The West Kent fox hunt chased the fox and its hounds were literally fried alive in the process. Yesterday, on BBC Radio Kent, the excuse put forward by this group of hunters was:
"The fox ran the wrong way".
<P>
Can we take that seriously?
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> I am grateful to my temporary hon. Friend for giving way again. Is he familiar with the film "The Bellstone Fox"? Is it not likely that every hunt in the land is familiar with it? Does he recall that the film showed hounds being killed on a railway line? Is it not therefore extraordinary that the hunt should have been anywhere near a railway line in the first place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I have to confess to my temporary right hon. Friend that I cannot recall having seen the film. No doubt, I shall soon be inundated with copies.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> The hon. Member was too young to have seen it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am glad that the hon. Member for Taunton said that I was too young, which I take as a compliment.
<P>
The hunt cannot control where it goes when it is chasing a wild mammal. It is impossible to do so. That is the purpose of the Bill. In a drag hunt the scent could have been laid well away from the railway line, so that there was no chance that the hounds would have been fried alive. I have heard many arguments from outside the House about the treatment of hounds and about what effect the Bill might have on them. I can assure hon. Members that the Bill will not fry alive 10 hounds on a Tuesday afternoon.
<P>
The amendment makes great play of the words "hunting" and "killing" and the greater part of the argument must relate to the activity I will not call it a sport of deer hunting. I want to remind hon. Members of some facts about that activity to set it in context. There are nearly 500,000 deer in this country and about 80,000 are culled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman said "this country". Does he mean England or the United Kingdom? Will he distinguish between those deer in Scotland that are shot by rifle in the highlands, and those in Devon and Somerset, which might be the ones that he wants to discuss.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Bill and my reference to "this country" apply to the United Kingdom.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out that Scottish deer are shot and that it is illegal to hunt them with dogs. That might give some credibility to my many hon. Friends who represent Scottish constituencies when they tell us that they and their constituents belong to a better class of people. They will not condone the kind of deer hunting that has been mentioned.
<P>
There are nearly 500,000 deer in this country about 150 are hunted by dogs. We cannot, therefore, believe for one moment that the hunting is a viable means of culling. It is a pleasurable activity carried out by a small minority of people. Such hunting causes unnecessary cruelty and that is why the National Trust asked Professor Bateson to report on hunting on its land.
<P>
I pay tribute to Professor Patrick Bateson's work, which has been much maligned by opponents of his report and the Bill. I am sure that his report will stand the test of time and that it will go down in history as one of the nails in the coffin of the hunting argument in this country.
<P>
When Professor Bateson began his work, a panel of 14 distinguished scientists was set up from both the pro and anti-hunting camps. That made his report as objective and scientific as possible. It looked only at hunting and not necessarily at killing. Professor Bateson examined the behaviour of the deer that were chased for signs of distress caused by hunting. Behavioural matters and physiological changes were considered. It is difficult to understand what the welfare of an animal might mean and a variety of criteria were selected. On the behavioural side, deer are basically sedentary animals on a normal day, an average deer will travel less than three miles. When deer are hunted by wild animals for example, by wolves in the forests of Poland they are chased in short bursts because the wolves rely on ambush and stealth to kill them, rather than spending their energy on a prolonged hunt.
<P>
The immediate disturbance to the deer that are not hunted by the dogs is considerable. It is not only those that are hunted that suffer stress, but also the others in the herd when the pack of dogs select the one that will be chased. Professor Bateson found that the average hunt went a distance of 12 miles and lasted about three hours. That is a considerable distance and is outside the normal range that a deer would travel. The average deer travels about three miles a day. A hunt causes the deer an excessive change from its normal lifestyle.
<P>
Half the hunted deer escaped. A considerable number of deer had their welfare affected adversely. Although 150 were killed through hunting with dogs, we can assume that 150 more showed stress after being chased and managing to escape.
<P>
On Exmoor, where there is a considerable amount of water, the deer was found to have run deliberately into water in 50 per cent. of the hunts because of the excessive heat caused by the chase. I can confirm to my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton that I have seen video evidence of a hunt in which someone was trying, in effect, to drown a deer. It had been shot and it was being drowned because it had not been killed outright. A more grotesque sight I cannot imagine.
<P>
The hon. Member for Banbury arrived relatively late for the debate and has not had an opportunity to intervene. I should welcome an intervention on whether he condemns stag hunting. Nor has his colleague, the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, intervened, so I ask him whether he would like to do so. I take it from his silence that his side believes in and finds favour in stag hunting.
<P>
When the deer become tired, they halt. Then they are killed. They are shot. In 30 per cent. of cases more than one shot is required.
<P>
Let us consider the physiological changes that the animal will have gone through during the hunt. What has the animal's body gone through? I am not a scientist, so will refer to my briefing note to make sure that I have Professor Bateson's scientific terminology correct.
<P>
It was found that blood sugar levels fell sharply in the early stages of a hunt, and glycogen the muscle reserve energy supply became quickly exhausted. Professor Bateson reported that it was
"extremely unusual to see animals so depleted of glycogen under normal circumstances."
<P>
Lactate in the blood is produced by muscles that use glucose and glycogen and increased rapidly over the first 5 km of a hunt. Thereafter it declined and was used as a substitute for fuel for the body. Fatty acids in the blood rose steadily throughout the hunt, indicating increased use of the fat as an immediate energy source, and that is always associated with high physiological stress levels.
<P>
Red pigment in blood plasma increased throughout the hunt. Initially, that was from broken red blood cells, but it came latterly from damaged muscle tissue. In the later stages of a hunt, muscle enzymes start to appear in the blood, and that indicates significant muscle damage. Professor Bateson concluded:
"The consensus of the Panel was that the levels of muscle enzymes indicate that hunting made extreme demands upon the muscles of red deer, approaching life threatening levels."
<P>
We are referring to the hunt, not the kill. Already the deer has approached life-threatening levels.
<P>
With regard to hormones in the body, cortisol, which prepares the body for physical exertion, rose rapidly at the beginning of the hunt but continued to rise albeit more slowly thereafter. Endorphin, a natural pain killer, rose steadily throughout. The data indicate that the deer experienced a degree of stress gravely exceeding that normally required to mobilise the body for flight.
<P>
Other scientific studies have shown that prolonged high levels of those hormones may lead to suppression of the imune system and to a degeneration of the neurones in the brain. Those are the consequences of a hunt, not a kill.
<P>
Professor Bateson concluded that the pattern of data was entirely consistent with the view that hunted animals hunted, not killed are extremely frightened, push themselves as much as they are able, and risk a great deal to save their lives. The hon. Member for Taunton has described the lengths to which the animals will go to escape the dogs.
<P>
Commonly-used indicators of welfare suggest that hunted deer are in very poor condition by the time they are killed. Indeed, they are no better off than an injured animal that is put down, owing to the stress that they have endured. Professor Bateson writes:
"It is clear that lengthy chases in the course of hunting ... impose on red deer stresses that are likely to cause great suffering."<P>

<P>
He states that the hunts cause red deer to experience conditions that lie far outside their normal expected range of experiences. That raises serious questions about the welfare of deer.
<P>
Shooting, or killing outright by stalking, does not put the deer through that experience. That is why I urge the Committee to throw out the amendment. It is the hunt, not the kill, that causes those red deer and stags to experience something so awful something that the Bill's opponents have had an opportunity to condemn, but have not condemned.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Eileen Gordon </B>(Romford): I also want to register my view that the hunt and chase are intrinsically cruel and that I therefore oppose the amendments. The issue is at the heart of the Bill and merits debate. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester and my hon. Friend in Committee the Member for Taunton, I want to discuss deer hunting.
<P>
I admit that we do not have deer hunts in Romford. I hope that my constituents do not visit other constituencies to carry out such a practice. I should have sharp words with them if they did. Perhaps, I may act as the voice of that part of the country apart from the west country that does not feel the need to cull deer through the chase and killing with hounds.
<P>
I record my thanks to Professor Bateson for his excellent report. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North will go into detail about it, but perhaps I may prepare for his contribution with a few remarks. Professor Bateson is a man of great integrity and approached his study of deer and stag hunting with a scientist's objectivity. As he said in the report,
"We really did not know what we were going to find. As always in science, we failed to find some things that we had expected to find and we uncovered some major surprises which nobody had foreseen. Inexorably we were led to certain conclusions. I hope that those who will undoubtedly dislike these conclusions will accept that we have arrived at them honestly and, in some respects, not without sadness."<P>

<P>
I think that it was an objective report. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester has explained, Professor Bateson found strong evidence of the physiological changes undergone by the deer as the result of the hunt and chase.
<P>
We have already heard about the animals' physical distress and I should call that evidence pretty conclusive. Professor Bateson also compared that with data about non-hunted deer. He writes:
"These data on hunted deer contrast strongly with data on farmed deer and on clean-shot deer from Exmoor and Scotland. The non-hunted deer did not differ from each other. They had low levels of stress hormones, low levels of lactate and low levels of haemoglobin."<P>

<P>
Therefore, they were not caused the same distress as deer that had been hunted, sometimes for 19 km, before being killed.
<P>
The report concluded:
"the level of total suffering would be markedly reduced if hunting with hounds were ended. Hunting with hounds can no longer be justified on welfare grounds, taking into account the standards applied in other fields of animal welfare."<P>

<P>
The report confirmed through evidence what most people knew by instinct. Hunting deer over long distances is cruel and causes the animals distress. When I first heard about the contents of the report, I thought, "I could have told you that." But scientific evidence was needed to back up common sense.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am pretty scared of speaking in Committee. Fear or stress causes physiological changers in a human body. Why should animals be different? Fear is a primitive[Mrs. Eileen Gordon]
instinct that supposedly sophisticated humans cannot control well. Despite Professor Bateson's report, deer hunters will never be convinced that they are cruel to the animals, I do not want to be flippant, but even if deer could speak, hunters would probably claim that the creatures were being economical with the truth, that they did not understand the issues or that they were being hunted for their own good.
<P>
The debate revealed that there is no justification for hunting as a culling method because 99 per cent. of culled deer are shot. Control is a poor excuse for hunting deer. The hunt and the kill is for the hunter's pleasure. There is no other reason for the activity. If stag hunting with hounds is such an effective method of controlling numbers, why does it take place in only a small part of the country?
<P>
Even poachers do no believe that hunting is the best method of obtaining a kill. An article in The Times yesterday stated that poachers simply shot the deer, they did not chase them over long distances. Nevertheless poachers are cruel. The article states:
"Poachers use a high-powered lamp to pick up a deer's eyes and shoot from up to 250 yards."<P>

<P>
That is illegal and I hope that the perpetrators are caught.
<P>
I oppose chasing deer to the point of exhaustion. There is no acceptable reason for continuing such a barbaric practice.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Since entering Parliament in May, I have had the good fortune to secure three Adjournment debates. The subjects were: Gulf war syndrome, biotechnology and the impact of hunting for sport. After the debate on hunting, I received a letter from the Provost's Lodge, King's College, Cambridge. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) tells me that it is a fine building that serves an even finer claret. The provost is Professor P. P. G. Bateson ScD FRS. He does his scientific research not there but in the department of animal behaviour at the university of Cambridge. The extent of his academic and scientific excellence and eminence is demonstrated by the fact that he is provost of such a distinguished college. I must, with some embarrassment, quote his letter to me:
"I am writing to congratulate you on your excellent speech in the House of Commons on 29 October 1997"
<P>
The hon. Member for Bolsover often does the same.
"It is a great pleasure to see scientific evidence" 
<P>
it is that that I want to elaborate 
"being brought to bear in political debate and being done so with such accuracy and effectiveness. If I can help you at later stages in what is likely to be a protracted discussion, please contact me."
<P>
That I have done. I spoke to Patrick Bateson about his work indeed, we argued about the scientific merits of parts of it. He convinced me that he knows what he is doing. As I said last week, he has produced more than a report. His findings were subsequently published by Proceedings of the Royal Society 1997, volume 264, in a paper entitled "Physiological effects of hunting red deer". I must emphasise the contribution that was made by Elizabeth Bradshaw, the paper's co-author. Often, the senior author gets all the credit, but the hard work is often done by the poor research assistant, who lives on a three-year grant and they are always female.
<P>
I shall read out the important parts of the paper. In view of our earlier debate, it is important to record in Hansard the full details of the excellence of the science. It states:
"When red deer and that is the genus Cervus species elaphus" 
<P>
I do enjoy using Latin; I spent six years in a Scottish school learning it, and it is difficult to find anyone else who speaks it. However, I noticed that the hon. Member for Banbury used the phrase "ad nauseam", so he has at least two words of Latin 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For the Committee's benefit, elaphus is the Greek for Cervus, which is Latin.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> The three of us could form a parliamentary group.
<P>
The Bateson report continues:
"When red deer were hunted by humans with hounds the average distance travelled was at least 19 kilometres" 
<P>
that matter was discussed earlier 
"The study was of 64 hunted red deer, and it provides the first empirical evidence on their state at the time of death and during the hunt. Blood and muscle samples obtained from hunted deer after death compared with samples from 50 non-hunted red deer that had been cleanly shot" 
<P>
and that is an important feature of this research 
"with rifles. The effects on deer of long hunts" 
<P>
which was mentioned earlier, so I shall skim through the conclusions, include
"depletion of carbohydrate resources for powering muscles, disruption of muscle tissues and elevated secretion of beta-endorphins. Concentrations of cortisol" <P>

<P>
which is a hormone 
"typically associated with extreme physiological and psychological stress were found. Damage of red blood cells occurred early in the hunts".<P>

<P>
Possible mechanisms were discussed in the paper, which continued:
"Taken together, the evidence suggests that red deer are not well adapted by their evolutionary or individual history to cope with the level of activity imposed on them when hunted with hounds."<P>

<P>
Its final conclusion after the discussion is that
"the exertion associated with hunting with hounds resulted in marked physiological disturbances... including muscle damage and... intravascular haemolysis. We do not believe that these changes merely occurred at the ends of hunts. The evidence suggests that haemolysis occurred early in the hunt, resulting perhaps from upsets in ionic balance, extreme plasma acidity or hyperthermia. Other evidence points to the cumulative effects of hunting, for instance leakage of muscle enzymes into the blood stream was greater in more extensive hunts".<P>

<P>
That is an important feature of the work.
"We were not able to dissociate various factors that may have separately or jointly contributed to the observed concentrations of substances in the plasma. Nevertheless, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that the physiological effects of hunts of even relatively short distances and duration are severe, while longer hunts are characterised by signs of extreme exhaustion. Physiological changes of this nature are uncommon in both human and non-human athletes and would not be expected to result from the typically short chases of red deer by wolves in natural conditions."<P>

<P>
He backs that up in the introduction 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may want to quote further from the document. However, I advise him that he at least reached, and possibly exceeded, the bounds of reasonable length with the previous quotation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. The findings on wolves are confirmed by other work published in Denmark and other countries. I was going to tell the Committee where those papers were published, but that information appears in the publication.
<P>
I wish to consider the many criticisms of the report Bateson made to the National Trust. I shall not list all the critics, but significant comments have been made by Professor Geist, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior and Dr. Wise.
<P>
The Countryside Alliance has claimed that it has uncovered more critics, but it has not released their names. Miss Janet George, the press officer of the Countryside Alliance, has used the internet to drum up damaging remarks on what she described as the "junk science" of the Bateson report. Many colleagues in Professor Bateson's department have been telephoned by the Countryside Alliance and asked to provide critical comments. Indeed, they have been asked to supply details of his private life.
<P>
Professor Bateson responded to many of the points made by the critics in an article published in Hunting magazine, in statements to the National Trust, in letters to the media and in extensive correspondence. He has never shied away from the debate. Lord Soulsby's report, which was commissioned by the Countryside Alliance, accepted the validity of his techniques, but called for more research. Bateson has, in turn, criticised the omissions, tendentious character and weak reasoning of the Soulsby report.
<P>
Professor Hoppeler, a distinguished exercise physiologist, and Dr. Fletcher, a veterinarian and red deer farmer, were both at Lord Soulsby's seminar when the issues were raised and they have criticised Soulsby's report. The comments are valuable because they are entirely independent.
<P>
The Bateson report is supported by many professors in Britain and elsewhere. They include Professor Clutton-Brock FRS, Professor Dawkins, Dr. Ewbank, Professor Harris, Mr. Kestin and so on. All those supporters of Bateson were members of the scientific assessment panel that met for two full days. In January 1996, it discussed the methodology and, in October 1996, it considered the data. Those meetings of independent scientists were critical and intense, far more so than the average referee's reports prepared for a professional journal.
<P>
The panel included Dr. Reynolds, who was the nominee of the British Field Sports Society. In a letter to The Daily Telegraph, Reynolds wrote:
"My role, with other members of the study's scientific panel, was to examine critically and objectively the science defining the condition of hunted deer and the logical conclusions that follow. Not wishing to go beyond this scientific involvement, I therefore neither agree nor disagree with Prof. Bateson's view that the level of suffering endured by hunted deer is `unacceptable'."<P>

<P>
In addition to those on the panel, Bateson received help from many other experts, both before and after the report was presented to the National Trust. The people who wrote to Bateson and congratulated him are all experts in different aspects of the work that Bateson elaborated on his report.
<P>
The scientific findings on the physiological data have been published in a first paper and findings on behavioural aspects will appear in a second paper, which will also be peer reviewed. I have the details of that, and I am sure that it will stand the test of the review.
<P>
Contrary to a claim by Miss Janet George on the internet, the paper was not rejected by Nature, which is probably the best journal in this country in which to have a paper on science published. It has an impact factor of 25, which gives any person a real pull in obtaining research money. Anyone who has a paper published in Nature is home and dry when it comes to obtaining the next three-year grant. The paper was not rejected by Nature on the basis that the research was nonsense, but because the press had got the story and all the details were in the newspapers.
<P>
Scientists are funny folk; they like to keep details of their research to scientific journals and peer reviews. They do not want it to be published in the tabloids. For example, Professor Gallow first gave details of the data on the AIDS virus at a presidential conference in the United States. That was no way to behave according to the professional academic community. The professor has been reviled by many sectors of that community ever since and was subsequently caught up in counter-claims because his discovery of the HIV virus first appear in the newspapers. It cannot be said that a paper was rejected by Nature because the scientific research was bad.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The objections to the report come under six headings: methodological flaws; factual errors; language; omission of study areas; alternative interpretations of the data; and, the scientific status of animal welfare. I could take five days to talk about the subject, but I shall try to keep my comments brief.
<P>
Much was heard initially about how the study was fatally flawed because of how the blood was collected. However, Bateson pointed out that his critics' argument was upside down. If the study had found nothing of significance, anti-hunt campaigners might have claimed, legitimately, that it was due to poor technique. As things stand, pro-hunt critics failed to explain the large differences between hunted and non-hunted animals and within the hunted group of deer, the strong correlation between those same measures and the extent of the hunt. As a consequence of the rebuttal, that criticism has subsided.
<P>
The implications of the report are central to our debate. It was written for the National Trust, under high pressure, and for that reason there are one or two small factual mistakes. For example, the report states that the conversion of glucose to lactate requires oxygen. It does not. That slip is regarded as serious, but critics have not been able to show that that statement makes any difference whatever to the report's conclusion. It is used as an example of the author's incompetence as a physiologist. In fact, Bateson has worked with physiologists and biochemists in the same department for 30 years. I can confirm that scientists do talk to each other and interchange data now and again.
<P>
One criticism is that the report's language is too emotive and that that masked and distorted the scientific findings. Bateson strongly rebuts that charge. In the main report and the annexe, which went into the[Dr. Gibson]
scientific matters in greater detail, he first presented the evidence and then, as is usual in such reports, drew conclusions. It is manifestly false to suggest that he muddled up the scientific evidence with the conclusions. In making judgments on the welfare of deer hunted with hounds, he was castigated for using phrases such as "great suffering". The word "suffering" appears in at least two Acts of Parliament dealing with animal welfare and in the brief that Bateson was given by the National Trust. Its dictionary definition is perfectly plain, "suffering" is to have something painful, distressing or injurious inflicted or imposed on one. Bateson concluded that stag hunting creates in the deer a state that existing legislation already prohibits people from inflicting on animals in other contexts. "Ah," said his critics, who were determined to prove that he is anthropomorphic and has a closed mind, "What about the notorious reference to Bambi in the foreword of the report to the National Trust?" Either they did not look at what he wrote or they deliberately misrepresented him. He was merely describing the mindset of some of the protagonists in the stag hunting debate. He continued immediately afterwards to describe the other side as follows:
"The hunt supporters, many of whom are excellent naturalists, have believed sincerely that very little suffering is involved in hunting with hounds. They regard this method of culling red deer not only as necessary for the protection of the environment but also as an entirely natural process."
<P>
It is clear from that quote that he was setting the scene. he was not adopting a position himself.
<P>
Professor Bateson has been charged with leaving out important topics, such as the study of carted deer where deer are chased with hounds, but not killed deer on treadmills and deer escaping from hunts. He considered each of those, but decided not to pursue them. Carted deer would not have provided the necessary comparison because the deer are thoroughly familiar with humans and hounds and are chased only half the distance of the hunted deer.
<P>
Studying red deer on treadmills would have required lengthy training that would have rendered comparisons with wild deer effectively useless. Including carted deer or deer on treadmills would have been of questionable relevance and would have reflected research away from the central issue of what happens to wild red deer when they are hunted. Following escaping deer would have required the radio-collaring of large numbers of deer before hunting. That project was proposed, but was effectively blocked by interested parties from both sides of the hunting debate.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman of my previous ruling that quotations should not be of excessive length.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Bateson concluded that his study would have needed much larger sample sizes that would have eclipsed the other projects.
<P>
Bateson has also been criticised with regard to hunting among deer that escaped. Data for New Zealand indicates how severe are the effects on red deer being chased by, for example, helicopters; many deaths followed. Historical sources of stag hunting on Exmoor show that hunting can have severe effects for deer that escape. In his 1887 book, "Stag-Hunting on Exmoor", Lord Fortescue describes how the stag hunters cut notches in the ears of hunted deer then released them. He was disappointed that so few were ever seen again. One was found dead the next day.
<P>
Local people on Exmoor say today that escaping hunted deer are seen back where they were originally harboured. Bateson is sure that that is sometimes true but has no idea how often. It is clear that, in that area, an anecdote goes a long way. It is estimated that seven deer a year may die from myopathy or immuno-suppression after escaping from a stag hunt. That figure has been ridiculed because it is claimed that corpses would always be found. It is odd that country people should be so unaware of the effectiveness of badgers in disposing of corpses. It is also remarkably inconsistent to claim, as has been done repeatedly, that Bateson's estimate for wounding by stoppers is too low. If a wounding rate of 15 per cent. were correct, a minimum of 50 corpses should be found each year in stag hunting country.
<P>
The report suggests that hunted deer passed through a period when their blood became acid because of muscular activity. The critics suggested that deer hunted for a long time had undergone less exertion at the outset and did not reach such a peak. To propose a second interpretation of the data is not to render the first incorrect. It raises a question that can be examined by available evidence. Professor Bateson investigated the possibility that deer hunted for longer distances exerted themselves less at the beginning of the hunt and found no evidence for that hypothesis.
<P>
Claims that the changes found in deer are what would be expected in an animal that is freely exercising, ignore the evidence of muscle and blood damage and the high levels of cortisol. Cortisol is associated with exercise and the study of other animals has shown that high levels of the hormone are associated with loss of social status in the animal community, social isolation and other emotional challenges.
<P>
Critics have also argued that that happens only at the end of the hunt. That claim ignores evidence that blood damage occurs early in the hunt, possibly resulting from upsets in ionic balance and extreme levels of acidity or overheating.
<P>
Other evidence points to the cumulative effects of hunting. There is evidence of a cumulative effect the longer the distance. The cortisol level is higher in more extensive hunts and leakage of muscle enzymes into the bloodstream is greater.
<P>
In the Veterinary Times, Professor Allen criticised the conclusion that hunting causes red deer to experience conditions that lie far outside those that would normally be experienced by a species living in a natural environment. He suggests that what happens to stags in rough is just as bad. At the Salisbury symposium that he helped to organise on behalf of the Countryside Alliance, he presented evidence dealing with that point. The hunted stags have remarkably high levels of cortisol, muscle enzymes, haemoglobin and bilirubin compared with rutting stags that have been cleanly shot. The latter did not differ from shot hinds in those measures.
<P>
Allen went on to argue that even though the average hunt is 19 km long, the average speed is low, implying that the deer had an easy time of it. However, once again, he forgot the evidence presented at the meeting that he helped to organise. The hunted deer never trot at any even pace over the whole hunt. They gallop at full capacity, pause for varying amounts of time until they are rediscovered, and then gallop away again. Humans find comparable regimes of sprinting and pausing very tiring. Moreover, nobody at the Soulsby symposium doubted that the deer were extremely exhausted in hunts of more than average length.
<P>
It is often claimed that animal welfare is not science. If science is viewed narrowly, as the uncovering of mechanism, it might be possible to claim that the study of animal welfare does not fall within such a definition. However, that definition would also exclude from science much of astronomy, epidemiology, taxonomy, natural history, evolutionary biology and the activities of one of the country's most celebrated scientists, Charles Darwin. However, if science is viewed more appropiately, as the application of orderly method to natural phenomena, the charge that studies of animal welfare are unscientific is nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> If the hon. Gentleman looks down at his desk, he will find something from the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) asking him to bring his remarks to a close.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibsons:</B> I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for his kind intervention.
<P>
Four questions were tackled in Bateson's research: to what extent are physiological states associated with extreme stress, distress, pain and suffering in humans found in hunted deer; to what extent are the deer damaged by hunting; to what extent has the deer's evolutionary and individual history prepared it for being chased by hounds and to what extent does a hunted deer differ from one that is severely injured. Those questions may be answered by science and have been answered by Bateson.
<P>
While hunting with hounds has a welfare cost, so does stalking with guns.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been most tolerant of the hon. Gentleman, but must intervene at this stage. There is a convention that the reading of speeches is not welcomed in the Chamber of the House. It is regarded as even less suitable in the more intimate atmosphere of Committees. I understand the purpose of the hon. Gentleman's speech. As a scientist, he is underpinning the scientific validity of the Bateson report, which has been quoted extensively in relation to this group of amendments. For that reason, I have been exceedingly tolerant of the fact that the hon. Gentleman has been reading his speech, but I ask him to show regard for that convention of the House.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I shall bring my speech to an abrupt close. I believe that I am making my point clearly, so if I may, I shall read the conclusion. Because of the time, my speech has been sadly curtailed, but there is a considerable amount of data still to mention.
<P>
The crucial point is that all the evidence from Bateson's report comes to the same conclusion. Differences of interpretation of any one part of the scientific evidence do not alter its welfare implications. It is the accumulation of the evidence, coupled with what is known about the biology of the red deer, that makes the overall case so compelling. His judgment that hunting deer with hounds is unacceptable stands. At the beginning of the study, the burden of proof was on those who claimed that deer suffered in the course of hunting. The position has now been reversed. If anybody believes that hunting is benign, it is up to them to provide the evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Amendment No. 19 stands in my name, and I believe that we are also considering amendments Nos. 44 and 45. I hope that we can proceed quickly to a vote, but I hope that you will allow a separate vote on amendment No. 44, Mr. O'Hara, because it has been suggested that adding the words in amendment No. 44 would address many of the points that have been raised.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Given that I was initially minded to group those amendments separately it was only in the light of contributions relating to the amendments grouped with amendment No. 19 that I decided to add amendments Nos. 44 and 45 to the group if the hon. Gentleman wants a separate vote on amendment No. 44, I shall allow one.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> May I congratulate the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish? It is now 12.45 pm on the third day of the Committee. By speaking to amendment No. 44, he has taken the Committee to line 2 of clause 1(1). He has made a little progress on this Bill in this Committee in the parliamentary year of 1997-98.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I was surprised by the jeering remarks of those who oppose the Bill. They volunteered to serve on the Committee and I expected them to do some of the necessary probing. I understand that they may have a reason to keep quiet or that they may have no confidence in their arguments, but it is unfair to jeer at us for tabling amendments. I have received a substantial number of letters from people outside Parliament who believe that the Bill goes too far. One of our duties in Committee is to provide answers for those people or, if that is not possible, to modify the Bill accordingly. The amendment is a way of putting to the Bill's sponsors some of the problems that have been raised with me in correspondence.
<P>
One of the concerns is that a great deal of damage is caused to farmers' crops by animals covered by the legislation, in particular deer and hares, but also foxes and mink. In the case of some of those species, it might be wrong to get rid of hunting because we do not have alternative humane methods of pest control.
<P>
I am willing to admit that in my youth I used to set snares. I always felt considerable disgust when I successfully caught anything mainly rabbits and terrible horror when, on one occasion, I caught a fox. It was a very unpleasant process. Many people argue that if fox hunting is stopped we will have to get into poisoning, gassing, snaring and other methods of controlling foxes, which will cause more cruelty and nastiness in the countryside then the continuation of fox hunting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that argument, or is he merely relating it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am simply relating to the Committee that that argument has been expressed in a fairly substantial number of letters.
<P>
Although I waver to some extent on this matter, I think that fox numbers are possibly naturally controlled, and that it is unnecessary to snare, trap, shoot or get rid of them in any other way. That argument should certainly be examined by the Committee, and it might be better if hon. Members who enthusiastically and wholeheartedly agreed with it were to put it forward, as they might be able to do so with more conviction. It is a valid argument, and I cannot see any reason why hundreds of people should write to the Committee to put that point of view unless they hold it validly. It is up to my hon. Friend to answer that point.
<P>
My hon. Friend also mentioned job losses. There is much heart-felt concern expressed in correspondence that the legislation will result in a large number of job losses in the countryside, and I have seen various estimates of how many jobs will be lost. I have a letter from a lady who has set up a small business producing horse riding boots who is frightened that the number of people who go riding will fall substantially as a result of the loss of hunting, and that her business will be threatened.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the vast majority of people who go horse riding never go hunting, and probably cannot afford to hunt? He can reassure the lady who makes horse riding boots that her business will not be threatened by a ban on hunting.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman responds to that intervention, I would be grateful if he would make clear to the Committee the relevance job losses to this amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> If the traditional forms of hunting that the amendment exempts from the Bill disappear, job losses will follow. A whole series of the letters that I have received makes the point that a large number of people living in the countryside depend, either directly or indirectly, on hunting activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in Leicestershire, which the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) did not condescend to visit during his tour of the country, nearly 10 million is spent per year on activities connected with hunting? That includes spending on livery stables, clothing manufacturers, retail shops selling clothing for riders, saddleries, feed merchants, engineers and horse box manufacturers. Is he also aware that 750 people in Leicestershire are employed as a direct consequence of hunting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is is possible to confirm my suspicion, after visiting the Quorn hunt in September, that Quorn is in fact part of Leicestershire?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I cannot see how that is a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I do not want to discuss whether or not a certain place is in Leicestershire, and I am not sure whether the fox has any idea whether or not it is in Leicestershire. The hon. Gentleman's intervention, however, was useful in that it illustrated that many people believe that countryside jobs are at stake. I am disappointed that neither the hon. and learned Gentleman nor his hon. Friends who do not seem very enthusiastic about attending the Committee are moving an amendment. An awful lot of the letters that have been received make the same point about job losses. It is a point that must be answered.
<P>
The Bill raises other questions about whether jobs will be lost, and whether, if the will of the House is that the Bill is enacted, hon. Members should consider whether some form of compensation may be necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> There is a suspicion that the proponents of the Bill, of whom the hon. Gentleman is one, are not being entirely candid with the public, and that their motives for tabling numerous amendments should be examined. If the hon. Gentleman genuinely wants a real debate, as opposed to engaging in parliamentary and Committee-style tactics so that the Bill is delayed as long as possible, I am not prepared to join in that game. If, on the other hand, he cares to recast how the Committee deals with the Bill, and gives undertakings that the Bill can be dealt with 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That intervention is not entirely relevant to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> We are accused of doing things, or not doing things. I merely wanted to extract from the hon. Gentleman some candour as to what he and his colleagues are about in their conduct of the Bill. I agree that we could proceed much more quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> There is no argument about what I am about. I am about ensuring that the Bill is properly scrutinised in Committee. It would be scandalous for the Committee not to have addressed at some point during its proceedings the question of jobs in the countryside.
<P>
It is obvious that many amendments are tabled in my name. There are two fundamental principles in respect of Committee proceedings on the Bill. First, we must ensure that the wording is correct and that it achieves what is intended. Secondly, we must answer the criticims that are made so that when the Bill returns to the House on Report, our proceedings in Committee will illuminate short debates on some of the key issues that may arise in the House. That is the duty that I perform.
<P>
We have a democratic responsibility to ensure that the views of the minority are expressed. I am saddened that those who oppose the Bill have not felt that it is reasonable to ensure that those arguments are set out. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough made an intervention about the number of jobs in Leicestershire that are involved. I should have thought that in 10 minutes he could have set out the interests of those groups of people within his constituency. I hope that some of my right hon. and hon. Friends will present counter-arguments to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> My hon. Friend will be aware that during the three sittings of the Committee, a number of challenges have been made to those opposed to the Bill on the former Attorney-General's comments, on Professor Bateson's work and on the issue of jobs. Does he have any evidence that we will receive any response?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I wait with interest to see whethr hon. Members make such arguments. It would be unfair on those outside if that opportunity were not exploited. I emphasise that my hon. Friends will have to deal with questions about how to control countryside pests more humanely if the Bill is enacted. They will have to address the problem of job losses and of what will happen to the hounds that are now employed in hunting and kept for that purpose. I cannot see that many of those hounds will be kept if we change to drag hunting; as I understand it, they are not suitable for drag hunting. Such issues must be considered. Will farmers put up with deer on their land in areas such as the Quantocks if hunting is no longer possible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I welcome the opportunity to make a further contribution. It always seems to fall to me to speak at this time. I said to an hon. Friend last week that the Committee was not over until I had spoken, but she said that that remark could be interpreted differently.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, who has done the Committee a great service. In an ideal world, amendments would seek to probe the essence of the Bill, and those who oppose the Bill would table amendments to try to change it. However, unfortunately, that is not
