not here for the whole of the proceedings this morning; I missed an
hour, having sat and listened to the hon. Member for Hammersmith for an
hour and a half, and I had rather anticipated that I would come back to
find that the first speech of the day had concluded. I want to register
my concern, as I think you have, that if we continue progress at this
rate it will have implications for the consideration by the Committee
of the rest of the Bill. I simply make that observation having been
here for two and a half hours, with the Committee still on the first
speech on the first group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000009">&#160;</a>

the Government Benches about local authorities’ ability to
support services such as citizens advice bureaux. He drew attention to
the fact that some councils were making a bigger contribution than
others. I suggest that he might read the report of the special interest
group of municipal authorities, which demonstrates how hard the cuts
have hit some of the most deprived councils in Britain. That is
probably why they have struggled to maintain resources for citizens
advice bureaux. So far the Government’s cuts have not hit across
the board; they have hit the most deprived communities hardest, and
they are just the same communities where there will be even more
pressures on citizens advice bureaux if the Bill goes
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000021">&#160;</a>

Friend for reminding me where I was. I was trying to conclude, but was
answering a point made by the right hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington. When I spoke of my preliminary point, I was not being
entirely flippant, because I have spoken to all the amendments in my
name in the first group, but have not dealt with those tabled by my
colleagues. I anticipate that they will deal with those so
comprehensively that I shall not need to speak again, but of course if
I feel the necessity I shall avail myself of the
opportunity.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
conclude on the point made by the right hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington, I am slightly surprised: I was addressing a issue about
amendment 61, which would to clause
1:<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000023">&#160;</a>

Lord Chancellor must each year lay before Parliament a further report

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Using
the example of homelessness, I had simply made a point to highlight the
great disparity between the cost of early advice, while also noting the
benefits, and the actual cost of homelessness, which could run to a
factor of some thousands. The analogy works for other branches of
social welfare legal aid as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000024">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
had said that the decline in citizens advice bureaux, law centres and
advice centres generally was preventing that early advice from being
given. Hence, exacerbated costs were likely. Although I accept what the
right hon. Gentleman said, which was that some local
authorities—all credit to them—have protected their
advice agency, the overall pattern is, as my hon. Friend the Member
for St Helens North said, that most have made cuts while some
have made deep cuts of up to 100%. That tends to be in the areas where
such centres are most needed—the most deprived areas. I would
not like the Committee to be under the misapprehension that this is
somehow a swings-and-roundabouts situation. It clearly is
not.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000025">&#160;</a>

shall conclude by addressing two matters that were raised this morning,
which I could not address at the time. I apologise for that. The first
relates to the Minister, and I bet we will hear more of this from him.
He was keen to emphasise mediation and the money that had gone into it.
I had not completely familiarised myself with the submission from
Resolution. I have had a look at it between the sittings, and what
surprises me is its vigour. I have read about 200 responses and it is
one of the strongest. This is from one of the leading organisations
that would be a beneficiary and whose interests would be promoted by
the Government. I am conscious of that, and I do not resile from it.
Mediation is a good thing if it
works.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">

                  </strong> My contact with Resolution suggests that many
of its members would argue that other forms such as collaborative law
or, indeed, court law might be preferable. It is an organisation of
solicitors who deal with family law. They are not necessarily advocates
for mediation per
se.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000030">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> With respect to the Minister, that is splitting
hairs. Yes, they are family law solicitors and one of the principal
pursuits is mediation. They are experts in mediation and their
submission strongly supports it. My point to the Minister is that they
support it in the context of other remedies. They
say:<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Mediation
will continue to receive funding. This is welcome, but mediation is not
suitable for all cases. Other valuable non-court options appear to be
ignored. There needs to be funding provision for cases where mediation
is unsuitable or fails, e.g. where one party refuses to take
part.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000357">&#160;</a>

will be the only option available to families who qualify for legal
aid... The proposals fail to recognise the important role tailored
legal advice plays in helping couples reach ‘agreement’.
In order to negotiate sensibly and reach fair agreements, couples need
a proper understanding of their legal rights… Families need
tailored legal advice specific to their particular circumstances,
alongside any dispute resolution process. Yet under these proposals,
funding for legal advice alongside mediation is limited to £150
per person with an additional one-off fee of £200 for the
drafting of a court order setting out the terms of settlement in
finance cases… legal advice supports the
parties.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000360">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It
is worth noting that in Australia, family relationship centres were
initially established and designed to actively discourage legal advice
and input from lawyers—but this policy has now been reversed and
increasingly lawyers attend dispute resolution sessions with their
clients. The proposals appear to ignore other solutions, including
solicitor negotiation and collaborative law. If all cases are pushed
into mediation, the success rate will worsen and the process will be
undermined. Legal aid should be available for family law cases where
mediation fails or is deemed unsuitable by a
mediator.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000361">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> In fairness to Resolution, it does not want to
be set up to fail. It does not want to be in a position whereby it is
held up as a golden fleece by the Government—or a golden
something. This will be the solution when Resolution knows that it is
part of the solution. We will come back to this matter in the
autumn, I am sure, but that is the point that the Government need to
address. I hope they will do so and perhaps even consider introducing
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the position of families and of children, I had an interesting session
with JustRights yesterday; I do not know whether the Minister has met
it. JustRights represents 30 organisations representing children. Its
concern involves how children will be particularly disadvantaged by
this measure. This affects not only families, but
children.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
final point on mediation is that most family cases—more than
90%—are settled outside court. Very few go to court. The benefit
of advice from lawyers and the ability of lawyers to negotiate and
reach a consensual solution are almost completely disregarded by the
Government. The Government are looking at those cases that are
litigated, which, by definition, are the most intractable and the least
suitable for such a
process.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to make a point about comparative jurisdictions, which I am sure
we will return to, and to place something on the record. I have already
mentioned the inaccurate figures quoted in relation to New
Zealand—the figure of £8 rather than £20, which is
where we actually are. This morning, I heard the sedentary comment,
“Yes, but that is still half the cost.” I said that other
factors would explain that, but the best rebuttal point here is the
fact that looking at the total cost of civil and criminal justice
systems in whatever jurisdiction—that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 204<a class="bkMark" name="Column204">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is the fair comparator—gets rid of the differentiation between
adversarial and inquisitorial systems, and between Roman law and common
law jurisdictions. It perhaps does not get rid of some of the social
differences, but at least it provides a comparison of what developed
countries pay for their legal
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These
figures were provided by the European Commission for the Efficiency of
Justice, and they are comparable figures, unlike the ones that the
Government choose to use. The per capita totals spent on the judiciary
and courts, including legal aid, are £75 for England and Wales,
£86 for Spain, £57 for France, £106 for Germany,
£114 for the Netherlands, £79 for Belgium and £73

I hope that the anti-Europeans here are not going to say that there is
not a proper system of criminal or civil justice in France, Italy or
Spain simply because their system of law is different from ours. I
think that those are better comparators because they are societies that
are more like the UK than Canada, Australia or New Zealand. If it keeps
the hon. Lady happy, she will remember that I said that the figure for
England and Wales is £75, while the figure of New Zealand is
£109 per head, which is substantially in excess. She will no
doubt reply that that is not a fair comparison, but that was my point

she may have a niche market in knowing eligibility thresholds for legal
aid in every country around the world. I do not want to trespass on her
specialisms. With all due respect, that is not the point. That is a
tiny snapshot, just one part of the legal aid and advice assistance
system. One would have to look at all the different ways of accessing
the courts, all the benefits people could have and the fact that, in
many jurisdictions there are legal help services that are publicly

legal aid is entirely to the point. Labour Members have argued that the
proposals will hit the poorest hardest, so we need to consider what the
definition of “poorest” is in different countries. If the

say what is the relative position of Britain and other

entirely because of the areas that are being taken out of scope. The
changes in eligibility are important. I do not want to skirt round them
and will talk about them as well, but the changes to scope are what is
important here––the removal of entire areas of social
welfare family legal aid so that it is simply no longer accessible at
all. The reason why I am addressing the overall cost is that that is
the way the Government put it. The Lord Chancellor made a statement on
the day the Bill was published that was effectively the response to the
consultation document, for what it was worth. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“In
some cases the system encourages people to bring issues before the
courts when other solutions might be better. In others it enables
people to pursue litigation that they would not contemplate were they
paying for it out of their own pocket.”—[<em>Official

               <p>The
Government’s argument is that people go to court willy-nilly, do
not have skin in the game and litigate too quickly, and there are lots
of lawyers encouraging people to litigate. We do not agree with that
and it is something to which we will return. If that is the way the
Government put their case—we are a litigious society in which
anybody can get to court without incurring any personal financial
risk—that is nonsense. It is perfectly fair to compare the
relative costs of the judicial and justice systems in different,
comparable developed countries. When we find that, far from being the
most expensive, we are probably below average, although that does not
suit the hon. Member for South West
Norfolk.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000051">&#160;</a>

mediation should be the first course of action—Opposition
Members have no problem with that principle—but if it does not
work, people should have access to justice? The Bill takes a group of
people out of scope so that they do not get that justice. The
Government are trying to hide the fact that mediation is an alternative
plan, with legal aid removed for a range of
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000052">&#160;</a>

that to denigrate mediators—I have clearly put on record the
role that I believe mediators can play—but the Government have
given another not very convincing excuse, like not needing law centres
to advise about welfare benefits because people can go to a jobcentre,
or not needing CABs to advise about employment law because people can
ask an employment tribunal. They are risible explanations and
alternatives. Perhaps mediation has a larger part to play, but it is
part of a continuum. The hon. Member for South West Norfolk can respond
if she wants, but the Government cannot answer the point that if
litigation is taken out of the system altogether, that not only removes
provision for the minority of cases in which it is
necessary—most cases settle or find alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms—but completely changes the game, because
everybody knows, particularly

whatever else is on offer, that there is no stick. There may be a

second-guess what happens in the constituency of the hon. Member for
Broxtowe. There may be private firms there that have legal aid
franchises. I am not talking about the current position, which I
explained this morning, whereby my constituency is sadly becoming an
advice desert. Two or three years ago, it had good advice provision on
paper, but even at that stage it was still difficult for people to get
housing advice. Notionally, three different organisations in quite a
small local authority area had an LSC contract for housing advice, but
demand was such that, even when they were all running at full volume,
there was a long wait—perhaps of two months—to get an
appointment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000057">&#160;</a>

are not talking about either the luxury of having advice or the lack of
need for advice, or even everyone having a plentiful supply. On the
contrary, the service has been a patchwork for the past 10 or 20 years.
There are only 56 law centres in the country, so it is not surprising
that there is not one in every constituency. There is a larger number
of CABs; about half have LSC contracts and about half do not. There are
other advice agencies that have LSC contracts, and there are a lot of

that needs to be resolved, but I do not think that that is the case in
any constituency. There obviously is variable demand. I mentioned the
CAB interactive maps that we probably all saw, which are good. I may
come back to them on later amendments because they show different
patterns in different constituencies. Just as I would not presume to
lecture the hon. Member for Broxtowe about her constituency, I hope she

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith referred to the early-day motion, and
indeed I do regret it if funding is being cut from a range of bodies

on either side, and the hon. Gentleman’s party does not have a

it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000076">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On
mediation, I am pleased to note that the Bar Council has said that it
is doing more work on training barristers to enable them to undertake
mediation, but it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that
Departments, quangos and primary care trusts—any bodies that, in
effect, represent Government—also play an important role in
being willing to undertake mediation. I hope more will be done on that
to ensure that they are so willing and that they do not themselves rely
on legal
representation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000077">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s comments on the willingness of Departments to engage

               <p class="tabbed">On
litigants in person, again it is important that the Government extend
the programme, which is under way, by making all those processes more

are going through. All the necessary advice should be presented in a

want to irritate members of the Committee by taking too long—I
see that many of them are keen to get on to other parts of the
Bill—I want to speak to the amendments standing in the name of
my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith. It is crucial that the
amendments are discussed thoroughly, as this is a particularly
important part of the Bill that goes to the purpose of legal aid.
<em>[Interruption.]</em> I think I am already irritating the
Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Reigate. He
said something from a sedentary position, which I am afraid I did not
hear. I want to talk about the commitment to ensuring access to
justice, which is crucial. It is my submission to the Committee that it
should be at the beginning of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000083">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for St Helens North made the point that the
Government’s plans are driven chiefly by the Treasury and by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, rather than by the Lord Chancellor. I
agree with that, because 23% cuts are happening in his Department. I am
not sure what discussions he had with the Treasury or with those in his
party, but I wonder he why accepted such a massive cut. It means that
£350 million will come off legal aid, the lion’s share of
that from civil legal aid. What is particularly bad is the fact that
social welfare will be affected the most severely, which will impact on
the most vulnerable people in our
society.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
has been said on numerous occasions that there are no votes in legal
aid. I tend to agree with that statement, because I forget how many
times I stood up for the Labour Government in court room scenarios,
speaking to colleagues and defending our policy. The reality is that we
were not profligate with legal aid. There were huge cuts to criminal
legal aid over many years—of 40%, I think. Government Members
cannot have it both ways: they cannot suggest that we were profligate,
then say that we cut legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Of
course, we did cut legal aid, but we would not have gone as far as the

then.” The Government have made a decision. I have seen it
happen in all Departments and their only priority has been to cut the
deficit. There is no other consideration. I accept that that is
extremely important, and hon. Members of all parties accept and
acknowledge that there is a need to reduce the deficit, but the problem
is that the Government’s only priority is deficit reduction. We
come at the discussion with different opinions, and we would have acted
more slowly. The cuts were bound to have happened, but they would have
happened over a much longer period. Government Members do not seem to
acknowledge
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000086">&#160;</a>

Committee thought the hon. Lady was saying. I disagree entirely with
her view, as that is not what happens. How often does she go to a
pigeon hole at chambers, pick out a brief, unwrap the ribbon, go to the
back of the brief and pick out the legal aid certificate and think,
“Hang on, there is the legal aid certificate. Game on,
let’s have a trial.”? I doubt very much whether she or
any member of chambers has that attitude when it comes to
litigation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Members
of the Bar and those in the legal profession, such as solicitors, will
advise their clients on the basis of the case. People do not run to
litigation as a first option. The national health service has a policy
that it is not prepared to settle. That is probably right, and other
organisations might well have such a policy. If the hon. Lady did not
say it, I shall take back what I am about to say, but it is unfair to
suggest that there is a tendency to run to litigation as the first
option. That is not the
truth.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000090">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman is as generous as ever in
giving way. As he knows, in criminal legal aid work criminal cases,
with few exceptions, are funded by legal aid. A person does not choose
to be prosecuted by the police. People find themselves in such a
position and are then taken to court. That is different from civil
litigation, as he knows. My point is that there has certainly not been
a tendency to settle and to use mediation in the way that it could, and
should, have been used. Law was always very expensive, and the good
side of that was that it meant that people looked at alternatives to
using it. Then there was a proliferation of legal aid, and too many
people resorted to law when there may have been other ways to settle
disputes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000091">&#160;</a>

the intervention by the hon. Member for Broxtowe, I think she would
agree that—at least this is my experience—lawyers tend to
advise clients based on the merits of the case that they are dealing
with. I suspect I may have misunderstood the hon. Lady’s point
in her intervention this morning, but it caused me some
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are some
real dangers in the Government proposals that I am concerned about. I
represent a constituency that is pretty heavily socially deprived, and
that deprivation has increased over the past 12 months. There are 27
people chasing every job vacancy and that number has tripled over the
past 12 months. That is no coincidence; it has something to do with the
policies of this Government. I mention that because the people I am
talking about are those who need access to legal services and lawyers.
Hon. Members have made the point that CABs, law centres and so on
provide a good service without using lawyers. I think, however, that it
is important for people such as I who represent a constituency with
high levels of social deprivation to bear the issue in mind. There is a
danger that lawyers will eventually close the door and I suspect that
advice deserts will occur. I can name areas near my constituency where
firms of solicitors are telling me that they cannot survive under the
Government’s plans. If that is so and those firms decide to
close the door because it is not viable economically, people will be
closed out of seeking legal redress. I am sure that is not what the
Government intend, but that will be the consequence of their
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000095">&#160;</a>

They claim that their mother was neglected. She was admitted with a
fractured hip but died from a septic ulcer. Under the provisions in the

that whoever had won the general election, there would be cuts because

pains. He went to his GP; I think he went four times in three days. He
was

			Column number: 213<a class="bkMark" name="Column213">&#160;</a>
                  </div>suffering with severe stomach pains. I think I am right in saying that
his GP prescribed him Gaviscon. He collapsed, I think on day four, was
rushed into Hull royal infirmary and died two days later. The GP was
negligent—there was no doubt about that. There was no mediation
to be done with the health authority or the NHS. There was no way of
discussing it, or getting round the table to try to resolve the issue.
The fact was that the health service was not prepared to accept
liability for that claim.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is a very personal story, but I tell it because I think that it is
important. If a constituent came to me with an issue such as that and
they were not able to seek legal redress, what would they do? Where
would they go? Who would they see to get the support they would need
with litigation? I suspect it would not be possible to get round the
table and negotiate a settlement.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000100">&#160;</a>

Hollobone, that I will not fall foul of this myself, but we have been
moving from discussion of the specific amendments and the new clauses

               <p class="tabbed">“Access
to justice” is a term that is difficult to define in any fixed
way. My understanding of access to justice is a desire among people to
seek a form of justice that may not yet be available to them, and it
brings with it a question about the validity of the system of law and
justice within which we work. Those are huge issues and I must say they
are not issues for this debate, with respect to everybody

within a limited system. It is, I think we would all have to agree, a
flawed system; it is a human system. It is a system that has evolved
over the generations, based not on a universal provision but on limited
access. I think that the term “access to justice” in the
context of this debate is unhelpful. We should be looking at the phrase
“legal needs”. It is a far more strictly defined
criterion, and in using it we are talking about a limited set of
possible actions for securing existing legal rights within our limited
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000105">&#160;</a>

about the challenges faced by the last Government and indeed the
challenges faced by all of us who work within a limited system. That
was the challenge that faced the legislators back in 1949, because the
choice for them was a stark one. They either went down the road of
creating a system of salaried lawyers who would give specific help and
advice to the poor and the less well-off, or it would be a system of
legal aid administered by private practitioners and the Law Society.
Those were the two options in the Rushcliffe report and it was the
second option that formed the basis of the Legal Aid and Advice Act
1949.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000106">&#160;</a>

the scope of the Bill, what is driving them to their decisions on the
scope and what should be limited? If he is suggesting that, perhaps the
Minister will consider it and table amendments at a later
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000109">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> There are two issues, and none of us would be
telling the truth if we said money was not part of the
consideration—of course it is, and it was a consideration of the
previous Government as well. Let us not hide from the fact that it is
more than about just raw calculations and Treasury estimates—it
is about the quality of the system that we can provide. The challenge
facing any Government coming to office in 2010 was to accept the fact
that there were limited resources and that those resources would
shrink, and to square that shrinking level of resources with providing
a system that would reach out not only to the poor but to those who are
on the margins, are vulnerable and need real help. I hope that is an
answer to the hon. Member for St Helens
North.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to return to where we were at the dawn of legal aid. Legal aid has
often been described as one of the pillars of the welfare state and
compared—rather histrionically at times, with respect, but not
by any speakers in this room although certainly elsewhere—to the
national health service, yet that comparison is ill judged. Provision
was never universal: it was limited in the 1949 Act to matrimonial
cases in the High Court. Only through the following generation or
decades, most notably as a result of the Widgery report in 1964, did we
see the roll-out of legal aid for all imprisonable offences. At that
time, defendants going to a police station who were facing a
potentially imprisonable offence would get legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the ’70s, we saw the rise of the green form scheme. A lot of
practitioners and former practitioners remember that—I think it
was the Legal Aid Act 1974 that brought in green form advice, which
solicitors used and which was an integral part of high-street
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000112">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am entirely following the hon.
Gentleman’s brief but interesting history of legal aid. I agree
that it has changed over time—I think I made that point
myself—but I do not entirely agree with him. Yes, it is not the
same as the national health service, but it is often said that the
welfare state is a three-legged or four-legged stool—I
am never sure which. Yes, we have the NHS and education, which are
largely free, although they have private components, but we also have
the social security and welfare benefits system, and I think that legal
aid fits into that. I would not like to lose sight of the fact that
access to justice—it is a constitutional principle, as well as a
facility to help people in need—is as important if not the same
as those other three legs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000113">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman’s amendments is that he is trying to enshrine
principles in legal aid legislation that were never part of the system.
In effect, with respect, he is potentially opening the door to a whole
raft of litigation on and judicial review of the true ambit of legal
aid. He might recall, in an intervention I made early on in his speech,
my concern about the true potential unforeseen consequences of his
amendments. I am sure he would confirm that neither he nor his party is
seriously suggesting that there can be a wholesale expansion in legal
aid in such troubled financial
times.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000114">&#160;</a>

with the greatest respect, the hon. Gentleman and the Opposition need
to ask themselves what the amendments actually achieve. Do they open

legal aid
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                  </strong> I shall directly address the hon.
Gentleman’s very good point about the dangers of focusing only
on the legal aid system, and forgetting about the other areas of public
life that are failing our citizens. I am thinking particularly of
welfare benefits, where 92% of decisions made by the Department for
Work and Pensions were overturned in tribunals, which is a complete
waste of everyone’s time and resources. I therefore take his
point very seriously, but I am not convinced that the amendments would
do what he wants. We might be able to deal with those issues head on
when we debate later
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to address as concisely as possible the hon. Gentleman’s
earlier point about law centres. At the beginning of my remarks, I
mentioned the decision made in 1949 not to employ lawyers to advise
poor or vulnerable people. The year 1970 saw the birth of the first law
centre, which represented a different approach in that it involved the
direct employment of lawyers to give specialist legal advice to poor or
disadvantaged people. It was a great initiative that has given birth
to 56 law centres, one of which is in my constituency, and the
hon. Gentleman referred to the support that I have given it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000121">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Both in this
House and in my constituency, I have argued for a reform of how law
centres are funded. I have mentioned block funding, and I stand by
that, because I strongly believe that it would ease the role of law
centres if they did not have to worry about whether someone who came in
was a debt, a housing or a benefits problem and could deal with them as
a legal problem through the block funding. All the law centres,
including mine, accept that their funding would probably be lower, to
return to the issue of
finance.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to make it clear that I am proud to express today the views that I
have expressed locally, and I will continue to express them in this
context. I have come to the view that arguments about scope, and
whether things should be in or out, miss the point, because we are
dealing with ordinary people who do not come in off the street and into
the law centre to say that they are a debt problem, but who come in
with human experiences and concerns and in need of legal advice. I will
continue to make my case, and I make no apology whatever for doing so.
If the hon. Gentleman thinks there is a contradiction, I disagree. I am
doing my very best to make the case for my local law centre, both in
Committee and in my constituency, and I will continue to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000123">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As always, the hon. Gentleman makes a
persuasive case, but he is advancing an alternative method of funding
access to justice, to use a phrase that he does not like. His case may
be an extension of the principles in the Access to Justice Act 1999,
which I have mentioned, in the sense that it looks at society in the
round, whether locally or nationally, and asks how we provide for what
he calls legal need. It might be that he wants to copy a system
operating elsewhere, such as the Australian one. I would be interested
to go down that route, but the Bill is not about that. We have to
address what is in the Bill, which at the moment will
disfranchise people and does not provide an 
alternative.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000124">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The
evidence of Julie Bishop was extremely compelling. She was the only
witness we heard from in the oral evidence sessions who offered a
constructive alternative. I was impressed by her evidence that more
than 200 law centres in Australia are funded by the block funding
system that I very much support. I think that model could work well in
this country. We have already seen the beginnings of a move to it, with
the announcement on Second Reading of £20 million of funding
this year. This is not a job for the Ministry of Justice alone; it is
for the Cabinet Office and other Departments to come together and
realise that where we have potential legal aid deserts, an avoidance of
duplication of service could make our public money go much further.
Swindon would be a case in point, because without the law centre we
would not have proper local housing law
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000125">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that point.
I am saying that the Bill in isolation is not enough. We all kid
ourselves in this place by thinking that Acts of Parliament can be
passed and can make the sort of changes that we claim, whether we are
in opposition or in government. I therefore caution the Opposition
about making some of their more gloomy predictions about the future of
publicly funded legal services. Although I could be accused of being an
eternal optimist, I believe that, even after the reforms, we will still
live in a country where we spend the best part of £1 billion on
civil legal aid and £1 billion on criminal legal aid. We should
not lose sight of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are many other things I would like to say, but I am conscious of time.
The truth is that when we reached the 1980s after the green form
scheme, about 80% of the population of England and Wales was eligible
for legal aid. Both parties realised that that was not sustainable, and
we saw a decline in that percentage to what it is now, aided, most
notably, by the Access to Justice Act 1999. With respect to the Labour
party, I have to say that some people thought the use of that
particular phrase to describe the Act was a contradiction in terms
because at a stroke it removed significant areas of civil work from
legal aid. It was a workman-like Act, in whose provisions none of the
grandiloquent phrases that we see in the amendments tabled by
Opposition Members appears. It contains no attempts to restate the
European convention on human rights or to give judges the opportunity
to widen the ambit of legal aid. It is carefully drafted legislation,
designed to restrict access to legal aid. That is the fact of the
matter, and therefore the Act is, in many ways, no different from the
Bill before
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will not deal with each amendment in turn, because time sadly does not
permit me, but I will say that attempts to restate general legal
principles in the context of legal aid are dangerous for the reasons
that I outlined at the beginning of my address. We need to look at
limited needs. This is a limited system, and a system within which we
as human beings have to operate. I accept the points made and the
concerns raised by Opposition Members; they are made sincerely.
However, Opposition Members forget the context in which we live and the
nature of the limited system within which we
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000129">&#160;</a>

North made the point that the Opposition are trying to save money, but
I note that earlier the shadow Minister, when talking about new clause
1(2)(f), said that they did not wish to create a financial burden and
that that was less of a consideration. The truth of the matter is that
we are dealing with public money. The Minister has a responsibility,

Member for South Swindon. He brings a great deal of expertise and
credibility to the work of the Committee. He opens up the opportunity
for me to speak to the two amendments tabled in my name, and I hope he
will agree that they are quite specific. They are not theoretical or
philosophical, but pragmatic amendments. They deal with
cost-effectiveness, value for money and ensuring that we spend legal
aid money in the best possible
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
tabling amendment 83, I seek the analysis around the debate that we
have begun to have this afternoon on the relative costs of legal aid
and the savings in the legal system and beyond it. I want it to be
properly analysed and understood before we make the kind of radical
changes to legal aid coverage that the Bill proposes. I do that very
much in the current financial context, when it is particularly
important that we understand the widest possible and long-term impacts
on public spending and the cost to the public purse. The Government
have accepted that that is the right way in which to approach
consideration of public spending. They have accepted the philosophical
justification for prevention where it is possible and that spending
money up front on preventing problems down the line is in many ways
preferable for the quality of experience of individuals. In terms of
long-term cost, it is a more cost-effective approach 
too.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
the prevention-up-front approach is missing from the whole structure of
the Bill, which simply cuts funds at the point of crisis rather than
looking at how, upstream, we could spend both legal aid and other money
more effectively to avoid that point of crisis being
reached.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In
speaking to amendment 83, I want to look at costs in two groups in
terms of the way in which I want the Government to bring forward their
analysis and assessment. The first group of costs comprises those to
which the Bill could give rise in the legal system itself. There are
several costs, which will flow and potentially increase, from removing
social welfare legal aid from scope. I look first at the administrative
costs to the legal system and the complexity, which I think the hon.
Member for South Swindon began to discuss in terms of determining just
what is in scope and what is not. I have considerable sympathy with
what he says about looking for funding approaches that can begin to
deal with boundary issues. He is absolutely right that the most
intractable problems are usually those that do not come in isolation.
They come in clusters. They come as a result of one event, which is a
catalyst for a whole train of events. Events in the categories of
family debt, employment, housing and social welfare benefits can all
follow on from, for example, a relationship breakdown. I was looking
for funding mechanisms flexible enough to respond to the clustered
nature of legal, justiciable and social problems. The hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right; it is a pity that the Government have not attempted,
through the Bill, to open up our thinking on how that could be
designed.</p>

               <p class="tabbed">Instead,
I fear that there will be added costs as a result of trying to see
where those boundaries sit and which bit of a person’s
circumstances are within scope for legal aid and which are outside.
Indeed, in its response to the Green Paper, the Legal Services
Commission suggests—I hope that I do not misinterpret its
thrust—that funding that boundary, making a proper analysis of
where that boundary sits, could cost more than the savings in legal
aid. The Government should make a careful analysis of the impact of the
administration costs to the legal system that will result from leaving
some matters within scope but taking out whole categories of
law.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am
interested in those provisions that, although they may have
merit—I look forward to debating them—require further
analysis by the legal system, which will inevitably result in
administrative costs. For example, I am sure that we can expect legal
challenges on whether an individual should be given exceptional
funding, I think under clause 9. It is important that we consider those
costs that are to be borne by local authorities as a result of the
Bill. I believe that authorities will be required to pick up some legal
costs that are currently met by the legal aid budget, and in some
instances they will be at the private rate, which will be higher than
the legal aid rate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I would
welcome the Minister’s clarifying whether my interpretation is
correct and if it is, whether he has had any discussions with the Local
Government Association about the implications for local government, and
whether an analysis of the potential knock-on costs for local
government has been made.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Where
individuals can no longer use particular categories of law because they
are now outside scope, people will look to move to other categories
that are inside scope. The classic area is the boundary between
immigration and asylum, and we can expect some cases currently covered
by legal aid as immigration cases to be transferred to
asylum.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We will find
ourselves engaging in more costly legal action and possibly legal
action in the wrong category; that, too, will increase costs. For
example, if a parent is unable to get legal aid to challenge removal or
deportation on the ground that the children are British citizens, a
human rights judicial review may be sought in the name of the children.
That, too, would be a much more complicated and costly procedure. We
would like to know what analysis has been made of the risk of
displacing current costs in some categories of law to costs in other
categories, especially inappropriate categories. There will be
additional costs for courts and tribunals as a result of dealing with
more litigants in person. I shall come to that in a moment, when I
speak to amendment 89.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
ability for the system to learn will be lost. That ability arises from
being able to deal early with categories of law under the legal aid
system and making clear judgments that can be applied in similar cases.
In particular, I refer to the possibility that some important
legally-aided test-case work will no longer fall within scope. I speak
with strong personal experience from my previous role at Child Poverty
Action Group; we were able to use legal aid funding to take a number of
test  
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>cases through the system. That was extremely helpful in removing future
cases from the system, as we arrived at a position whereby we had
absolute clarity of law.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000141">&#160;</a>

where there could be unforeseen consequences. Does she share my concern
that the general public will want a system that is fair? Does she agree
that they will have great difficulty when someone can get legal aid for
an asylum case, but not to pursue a case in the health service for a
child who has been brain damaged? I wonder what papers such as the
<em>Daily Mail </em>would make of it. The public perception will be that
that is wrong; it cannot be right that people faced with a problem of a
child with brain damage, who has been injured in hospital, will not be
able to pursue a case because their legal aid has been
removed.</p>

                  </strong> There is clearly deep disquiet about the
implications of the Bill for some of the most serious clinical
negligence cases. I know that we will discuss that point further. My
hon. Friend is right that public perception of the validity of the
system is extremely important. We do the system no favours if we open
up the possibility of people seeking to manipulate their access to
legally aided categories of law, which he is right to
highlight.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
are my concerns about the possibility of increased costs in the legal
system. I do not say that all those increased costs will arise. I
simply ask in my amendment that the Government publish an analysis of
the likelihood and potential impact of those costs before they proceed
to remove categories of law from the ambit of legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the context
of amendment 83, I also want to expand on a point first made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Stockton North. He raised the wider cost to
society when legal aid is not available and social problems are
therefore displaced to other parts of the public purse. When working
well, social welfare legal funding should create a virtuous circle. As
the hon. Member for South Swindon or one of his colleagues suggested,
part of the problem is not to resolve it by legally aiding people to
challenge bad decisions, but to get good decisions in the first place.
That is absolutely right. The example that was given of the
exceptionally high success rate of appeals on welfare benefits
absolutely makes the point. The ideal is, of course, to improve
decision making within the social welfare benefits and other systems,
and not to have to keep on relying on ratcheting up legal
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Two things
about that high figure cause me concern that costs could continue to
increase. The first is that the “polluter pays” concept
is now completely lost, but has been of interest to hon. Members of all
parties for some time. One way of encouraging Departments, such as the
Department for Work and Pensions, to improve their decision making is
to make it costly to keep dealing with legal challenges and tribunals.
Why is that concept no longer attractive to Ministers? It certainly
merits some exploration and analysis. Again, I ask Ministers to bring
forward that analysis during the Bill’s passage.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000145">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
additional challenges to decision making and the public interpretation
and understanding of such decisions increase at times of significant
policy change, such as we are about to see in welfare benefits, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 221<a class="bkMark" name="Column221">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and are currently seeing in housing benefit and policy. There is a real
question during periods of transition, when we can expect higher levels
of challenge to a new system as people test its application and
boundaries: would it not make more sense to smooth the passage of
policy changes in other Departments, while ensuring that, at least
during the transition period, the possibility of funding to make quick,
focused legal challenges is not removed? That is a view that Government
Members have expressed in the past. I would be interested to hear the
Minister’s comments on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000146">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend is right. She is going through
the different categories in which cost can be incurred or caused, even
by parts of the public sector. We also have the specific problem at the
moment that reassessment of those claiming disability benefits is
throwing up high numbers of appeals. One of two things can happen.
Either people will appeal—a high percentage of appeals are
successful—or they will not, and they will lose welfare
benefits, unjustly in many cases. I come across such cases every week
in my constituency. People do not have the means or the ability to
appeal decisions themselves; they need some form of advice and
assistance. Although I agree with my hon. Friend about the additional
costs, I fear that one way in which the Government are saving money is
by effectively making people disappear from the benefits register. That
may save money, but it is a pretty disgraceful way of doing
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000147">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am with my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton
North in trying to think the best of all hon. Members, so I do not
think that the Government intend deliberately to shut people out of
welfare benefits to which they are entitled. We are certainly seeing an
exceptionally high number of successful appeals in the social security
tribunal concerning the decisions that have been made about eligibility
for employment and support allowance and the work capability assessment
that claimants have to go through. I am sure that not an hon. Member on
the Committee has not had a constituent come to them with a tale of woe
about the work capability assessment and the difficulties of applying
for a benefit to which it is quite clear that they are
entitled.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is also of
note that Professor Malcolm Harrington, whom the Government
commissioned to provide expert advice on the work capability assessment
and employment and support allowance, has specifically highlighted how
good decision making in tribunals can be useful to the Department for
Work and Pensions in ensuring that it does not repeat process and
decision mistakes. Professor Harrington’s point is very much a
transition point. As we bring in a new system, we specifically want, as
quickly and as efficiently as possible, to get absolute clarity on the
boundaries of that new system. Access to the tribunal is a way of
enabling that to take place.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000149">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> In the yin and yang of the debate, for every
positive point that my hon. Friend makes, I have to make a negative
one. The converse of what she is saying is that, if there is no right
or ability to appeal, that depresses the level of decision making. That
may not be an automatic response, and I do not say that people are
sitting in the Department for Work and 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>Pensions thinking “Yippee, we will be able to make a high level
of poor decisions now.” I fear that it is only common sense,
however, because once people’s benefits are stopped, which
happens just like that, they are suddenly without means. I have food
banks operating in my constituency, and charitable institutions,
churches and so forth are giving people money because they have no
other means of support. A short-term gain may be made in the money that
is going out of the benefits system, but, in the long term, that will
mean a greater cost to the public purse.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000150">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend is right. That is a shocking outcome
for the individual, particularly when it involves a benefit to which
they are entitled and that they should have received. It is a bad
result for the local economy, too, because it has a knock-on effect on
wider local economic prosperity if people are not receiving the
financial support to which they are entitled. Although I appreciate
that that may stray quite far from the cost-benefit analysis of legal
aid at first blush, it is an important consideration that seems to have
been swept aside. I appreciate how difficult it is to quantify the
relationship between legal aid spending—or the lack
thereof—and social consequences for debt, health and well-being
and economic performance in the local community, but I am disappointed
that the Government have made no attempt, as far as I can see, to do
so. It is not as though there is no science available at least to make
an attempt. It its document “Towards a business case for legal
aid”, Citizens Advice tried to do so. I know that that analysis
has not been without criticism but it has at least asked some important
questions, which the Government must answer. In all fairness to
Citizens Advice, it has made strenuous attempts to build as robust a
case as it possibly can. It has worked with the LSC and the Legal
Services Research Centre to undertake that analysis. Although, of
necessity, it produces something of a theoretical answer, it is a good
first stab, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister’s
comments on it. If even a fraction of Citizens Advice’s analysis
of the knock-on costs to the social system of reduced legal aid
spending is correct, we will substantially increase expenditure to the
Exchequer elsewhere—in social spending incurred locally as well
as that in central Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000151">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A whole host
of issues is, if not causally linked, certainly correlated between
housing, homelessness, debt, and employment and discrimination
problems. If, for example, a family cannot meet bills and parents are
stressed, children’s educational performance is affected and
relationships come under strain. There are knock-on costs to child
well-being and to supporting children who
are—increasingly—in single-parent households and so on. I
ask Ministers, why has there been no apparent consideration of the
wider social costs? If there has, how has it informed the design of
legal aid in the Bill and the provision to remove all categories of
social welfare law from
scope?<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000152">&#160;</a>

other Departments that might be affected financially by the measures
have

               <p class="tabbed">I feel
strongly that a more detailed report and analysis of the
Government’s consideration of the cost consequences of their
legal aid proposals should be provided to the Committee and the House

must be properly analysed and explored.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000155">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I mentioned
one area in which we will see a risk of increased costs as a result of
the proposals. We are likely to have a rise in the number of litigants
in person in our tribunals and courts. Amendment 89 specifically
relates to that point and asks Ministers to present an analysis of the
likelihood of an increasing presence of litigants in person and, again,
the resultant costs. Considerable concern has been expressed by people
who have supplied written and oral evidence to the Committee, to the
Government’s legal aid consultation, and to the Select Committee
on Justice about the risk of increased numbers of such litigants, which
would create significant difficulties both for the court system and for
those individuals
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Litigants in
person tend to be younger and more poorly educated. They often have a
history of problems such as violence, depression, substance misuse and
mental illness. They frequently come with clusters of problems. If we
are to bring more such litigants into our courts, that very high-need
group will come with additional associated costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000157">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s literature review of litigants in person states
that<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000158">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“most research
suggested that litigants in person may experience a number of problems,
which in turn impact on the court. For instance, the research pointed
to problems with understanding evidential requirements, difficulties
with forms, and identifying facts relevant to the case… A number
of sources also pointed out that litigants in person may have
difficulty understanding the nature of proceedings, were often
overwhelmed by the procedural and oral demands of the courtroom, and
had difficulty explaining the details of their case…many
unrepresented tribunal appellants and applicants felt ill-equipped to
present their case effectively at their hearing. They felt intimidated,
confused at the language and often surprised by the formality of
proceedings.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000366">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Although
I am sure that the most vulnerable litigants in person will be likely
to experience all those consequences, by the nature of court
proceedings, particularly our adversarial legal proceedings, many of
us, when forced to litigate for ourselves with a direct emotional stake
and a potential financial stake in the outcome, would find that those
emotions are excited in us,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000159">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“problems
may also be relevant for those engaging in mediation without legal
representation.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000367">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>We
discussed the efficacy of mediation at length this morning. Again, it
is important to recognise, as was said earlier, that mediation is on a
continuum and to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 224<a class="bkMark" name="Column224">&#160;</a>
                  </div>ensure that there is access to legal advice at the right point in the
process. Petterson’s study of 2010 found
that<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000161">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“parties
in mixed representation cases (where one party was represented and the
other was not) were more likely, than cases where both or neither
parties were represented, to report feeling unprepared to
mediate”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000368">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>So
we have a real picture of the difficulties and risks of increased
litigation in person because such individuals feel that they cannot go
through mediation
first.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000162">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
also need to recognise the case-management difficulties of the courts
dealing with more litigants in person, particularly where a tribunal
has lay members, who will especially rely on the guidance of the
lawyers in court representing both the appellant and respondent. We
need to recognise the steer that such expert legal advice can give to a
tribunal.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also important to recognise that, in the more complex cases,
especially at first tribunal, a great deal of sorting out will be
needed for litigants in person. Such litigation is currently dealt with
and cut through by legal representatives, but that will not be
available if those litigants can no longer access legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The legal
adviser can, for example, look at the real substance of a case and, if
it lacks sufficient merit, possibly divert it away from legal action
altogether. That avoids claimants presenting irrelevant or
unsubstantiated facts, because, clearly, advisers can distinguish
between the points of fact and the points of law and which is
appropriate to bring to tribunal. Without such cutting through by legal
professionals, far more time will be spent in the courtroom trying to
negotiate and explain all that to the litigant in person, possibly
sending her or him away to bring back different evidence or different
arguments. So repeated attendance by litigants in person may be another
consequence that will add further costs and increase court time,
particularly in the upper tribunal, where it is far more likely that
points of law will be appealed and where it will be exceptionally
difficult for most litigants in person to make an efficient and
effective
case.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
risk of repeat applications and therefore judicial review proceedings
by those who, deprived of any legal advice and assistance, have
understandable reason to be dissatisfied with the result of earlier
proceedings might increase. In many cases, such applications and
judicial reviews might be not only understandable, but necessary if the
individual’s understanding of what was or was not relevant, or
their ability to collect and present evidence in an earlier appeal, has
meant that the appeal decision does not address the substance of her or
his
case.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000166">&#160;</a>

those risks might incur additional costs to the public purse,
specifically to the legal system. I hope that Ministers will explain
exactly what analysis they have carried out of the risks. In addition
to supporting the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends, which address
the broader philosophical questions about the purpose of legal aid and
the way in which it is or is not adequately reflected in the Bill, I

observation. I awoke suddenly when he mentioned the golden fleece,
which is a myth derived from the Georgians of ancient times. They used
to sew lamb skins together and pan for gold in the rushing waters of
the Caucasian hills. I tried the same with his speech. The muddy waters
flowed down and I filtered them with my hands, but little stuck to
them, except for two things—a general moan about finance and
something about access to justice, which went on and on with nothing
whatsoever to enlighten the Committee, unlike the hon. Member for
Stretford and
Urmston.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000169">&#160;</a>

them out himself, and they relate to finance and access to justice. I
want to make some brief remarks about those key points. I refrained
from intervening on him too much and thought it better to try to
encapsulate my remarks in a short speech
now.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000174">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The

                  <em>]</em> The hon. Gentleman

may be the Minister—I hope not—to ask for more cuts to
legal aid because tough decisions have not been made now.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000175">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
I not only heartily support but applaud my hon. Friend the Minister for
his brave decisions in putting together the Bill, which—although
one would not know it from the doom-mongering of Opposition
Members—represents a cut of 16.7% to the legal aid bill. That is
less than the cuts that most other Departments must endure during this
spending round. He has certainly defended the Bill in a way that some
other Ministers have not been willing to do for their own
Departments.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000176">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am impressed that we have managed a 16.7% cut. The question now is how
to distribute it. Within the context of the financial environment in
which we find ourselves, it is interesting and telling that the
previous Government made the choice that they did between criminal and
civil legal aid. The Minister could have made a much easier decision.
He could have said, “We’re going to cut criminal legal
aid.” After all, criminals in prison do not vote, and I am
afraid that many of the people who end up in prison do not vote when
they are not in prison. I wish that they did.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That would
have been the politically easy choice to make. It is precisely the
choice that the previous Government made, and to my mind, it was a
terrible and catastrophic choice that has meant that many people
currently in the criminal system are not receiving the representation
that they require due to the poverty of representation afforded by
current levels of criminal legal aid across the country. I hope that in
a few years’ time, when financial considerations allow, the
Government will invest in criminal legal aid before returning to civil
legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is telling that the Opposition have no ideas about civil legal aid and
how to find alternative savings. At least the Law Society attempted to
make up some figures, but the Opposition came here with nothing except
the suggestion to cut criminal legal aid: to cut legal aid from those
who are the most vulnerable, because they are about to lose their
liberty, their reputation and, in many cases, their future.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We return to
this weird canard, which is hoisted by so
many—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> Yes, you do hoist a
canard. It is hoisted many times in debates on public spending:
“We are making cuts that will cost more money elsewhere.”
It is a weird argument about public expenditure that somehow, if we
spend more money, we will save it. On that basis, if we followed the
Opposition’s line, we would be investing in so many areas of
public policy that there would be no money left at the end to spend. Do
they not understand the lunacy of the argument that we must spend money
in order to save it? That is precisely the policy that they attempted
to pursue over the last 13 years, and it has landed us where we
are.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are talking
about Government cash that must not be spent. I am afraid that the
Minister’s proposals are the only ones on the table so far.
Barring a few helpful interventions from the hon. Member for Stretford
and Urmston and my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon, no one has
offered alternative proposals or alterations of any
substance.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Then there is
the issue of access to justice, which was successfully and elegantly
blown apart by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon. We are
nowhere near the concept of what legal aid meant in 1949. The number of
marriages ending in divorce in 1949 was 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 227<a class="bkMark" name="Column227">&#160;</a>
                  </div>minuscule; now half of marriages end in divorce. What is more, we afford
legal aid to people on no income at every single stage of the process,
yet people on low incomes above the present mediocre threshold, as I
pointed out earlier, have no recourse at all to legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith says that he is not aware of the issue.
That is because tens of thousands of people across the country know
that they have no recourse to legal aid in their marriage disputes. Of
course they will not come to him, because they do not expect it, yet
that is the situation. He would know it anecdotally if his ear were a
little closer to the ground. The only people who can pursue the
dissolution of their marriage in the courts are those with no money and
those with huge amounts of money. Frankly, it is unjust to those who
earn limited amounts and who are paying too much tax to the Exchequer,
in my view, to have part of that tax go to people who are not earning
and who, if they were earning a bit of money, would not be in a
position to pursue their marriage disputes in the courts.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000183">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Then there is
the idea that somehow we are taking out of scope a whole series of
areas that have been dealt with previously through a generous legal aid
system that is almost universal, but the fact is that injustices have
been done to people right from the beginning, which could not be
answered with legal aid. I am aware that I am up against a far more
interesting speaker over in Portcullis House, so I might as well use a
topical example. It is brave of the visitors in the Public Gallery
here. It is rather like getting the tickets for the volley ball in the
Olympics when the 100 metres final is going on at the other end of the
stadium.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000184">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me use
some topical examples. Some of the people who have been victims of
hacking are in very vulnerable situations and some are on low incomes,
as we have now found out. They would not get legal aid to pursue their
injustice through the courts. Even among ourselves, there could be
instances of enormous injustices that change the nature of our
democratic process. Just imagine perforce that there were a candidate
in an election who put out entirely specious literature, perhaps about
housing, saying that a whole group of people in a constituency would
lose their houses if their opponent won that seat. That would be not
only specious but lying and mendacious and I am sure that would not
apply to any one in this room.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000185">&#160;</a>

those who felt that they had been unnecessarily frightened nor the
opponent who felt that they had been unfairly prejudiced would have
recourse to legal aid. It is rather like the case in which legal action
was taken by a Liberal Democrat loser. They were unable to use legal
aid to fight their opponent. In that case, even in the cause of
democracy, it is not possible to have recourse to legal aid in order to
fight an injustice in a hypothetical

back to the international comparisons, the point is that, frankly, most
of the time the English and Welsh system comes out top or near the top.
Importantly, because this was raised in the evidence sessions, there is
little difference between an inquisitorial system and an adversarial
system, which we have here. That was the evidence that we heard. It is
not because we are adversarial. It is not because of any difference
between us and our European partners. It is to do with scope, the cost
of lawyers—that was brought up in evidence to the Justice
Committee—and massive inefficiencies in the system. The
Government are trying to address those three main issues, and I hope
that we can flesh them out a bit more in
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000202">&#160;</a>

at wider justice costs, which is difficult for reasons that the hon.
Gentleman understands, we are somewhere in the top quartile of global
systems, but we are still high. The important thing is that even after
the cuts that the Government propose, we will still be in the top
quartile of spenders on legal aid. By the Government’s own

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman’s arguments seem to be
threefold. One is that the country is bankrupt, so that justifies any
change. That is a fair point, because the Government’s general
view seems to be that no matter what the implications they will hide
behind the fact that the country is, as the hon. Gentleman said,
bankrupt. It is news to me that the country is bankrupt. It has a
triple A rating, and it has never had a problem with raising finances,
so I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman would say
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000205">&#160;</a>

left, right and centre by different academics, so it cannot be said
whether that is the case. We heard from witnesses last week that the
comparisons used by the Government are challengeable 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman. He is making
essentially two points. The broader issue about the financial situation
of the country is that if we do not make tough decisions now, whoever
conducts the next spending review will have to make even tougher
decisions, without reverting to the discussions that I know he would
want to have in another place at greater length. That is just the
position of the Government. It is the one on which both parties in the
coalition won the last election. <em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em>
That was a completely fair intervention. To show that I am capable of
admitting that, I can say that with a combined vote the coalition won
something like over 50% of the vote, so even on proportional
representation terms we did well.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">No Government
have ever suggested, whether in defence, education or health, that
somehow these were unlimited pots, yet in the new clause there is the
provision that somehow the need for legal aid, defined in a completely
arbitrary manner as far as I can tell, trumps the resources available
to supply it. What I find odd about the Opposition’s argument is
that on the one hand they say, albeit rather quickly, that they would
agree to cuts in legal aid almost, or perhaps even, to the same extent
as the Government are proposing, yet on the other hand they are writing
a blank cheque into the first line of the Bill saying that need, as
defined completely subjectively, trumps the resource issues that
confront the Government of the time. That is why I tried to tease out
whether the hon. Member for Hammersmith had approval from the shadow
Chancellor, which he clearly had
not.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000208">&#160;</a>

it was not the professionals themselves. There are many people,

that he has a worthy trade union background. Trade unions, as typically
known, might have shown a rather greater degree of proficiency in
arguing on behalf of their members than those representing the legal
profession. The reason I call them trade unions is that over the past
10 or 15 years they have lost their regulatory function. They do not
disburse legal aid any more. Consequently, their only function is to
respond to their subscribers’ lobbying efforts to protect their
incomes and their sources of state funding. That is really the core
purpose now of the Law Society and the Bar Council; their other
functions have gone. When we listen to their submissions we should be

need to make the court process more efficient. One thing we discovered
when looking at international comparisons was that the cost per case in
Britain is very high compared with other countries. I am pleased that
the Government are, for example, introducing e-mail into all courts to
speed up the process of transferring papers. We have heard that quite a
lot of delay is caused by papers getting lost in the post or not
turning up on time. The Law Society made a good point on that

a lot. I was coming to that in greater detail, but I wanted to do so
via comments on mediation, about which the Opposition and especially
the hon. Member for St Helens North have talked at considerable length,
as did the Law Society and the Bar Council in their submissions. The
fact is that we put more marriage cases through the courts in England
and Wales than any other European country. In Sweden and
Germany—I tried to speak to witnesses about this during the
evidence sessions—almost every marriage case goes through 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 232<a class="bkMark" name="Column232">&#160;</a>
                  </div>mediation. It can be done. Not only can it be done, but it can be done

Union.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000220">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">At
the conclusion of the evidence, I received a withering look from the
hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston which upset me greatly, because I
respect her and I felt burnt by her reproach. I will explain why I was
angered by the evidence given by the women’s rights groups and
the Women’s Institute. This is a real opportunity to sort out
one of the considerable injustices in our legal system, which is
putting women and families through terrible, protracted and sometimes
vexatious legal disputes in the courts. We all know from personal
experience and constituency work that that can do more damage to
families and individuals than the original
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000221">&#160;</a>

mediation we can create a situation that is geared towards
reconciliation rather than division, which is the natural course of any
court action. I had hoped that the women’s organisations giving
evidence would have done a little more work to compare what was working
well throughout Europe and what could be suggested to the Government to
make the proposal stick so that we can take many more families out of
the courts. That was my frustration with what the women’s rights
organisations gave
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000222">&#160;</a>

high degree of conflict and a real mismatch of power in a relationship,

would like to refer to the suggestion made by the hon. Member for South
Swindon about block funding. Having worked with the Legal Services
Commission, I agree that to get rid of some of the bureaucracy would be
a good thing. However, block funding is not on the table and instead
there is the removal from scope of social welfare law. If block funding
were on the table initially, I would be happy to look at that and
possibly agree to the removal of the social welfare law. As it is not
on the table, I can deal only with what is before us.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000232">&#160;</a>

had been for help with their disability living allowance three times
was going through an appeal and had been through three appeals. I will
cite another case, which will demonstrate that it is not general advice
that is needed. In fact, a lone parent on income support was 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 235<a class="bkMark" name="Column235">&#160;</a>
                  </div>refused housing benefit because she was deemed to have a non-commercial
tenancy under the housing benefit regulations—the landlord was
her father. Without the rent, he was unable to make mortgage payments
on the property. The mortgage company started court proceedings against
the father. He had to start action to evict her, causing considerable
family conflict, as hon. Members can imagine. After the CAB had
considered the housing benefit regulations relating to non-commercial
tenancies and the facts of the case, they concluded that the
client’s tenancy was commercial. The CAB helped the client to
submit an appeal, making representations based on the case R (Mackay)
<em>v</em> Barking and Dagenham HBRB [2001] EWCA 234 (HC).<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The housing
benefit department was unaware of that case and was persuaded by the
arguments and representations the CAB made. It awarded the appropriate
amount of housing benefit before the appeal was heard. As a result, the
client could pay the rent, her father could pay the mortgage and a full
appeal to an appeal tribunal was prevented, as were court proceedings
that would have been instigated by the mortgage company. A homelessness
application for re-housing from the client and the likely allocation of
a council property and a full-scale family argument were also
prevented. I do not know about other hon. Members, but I certainly
would not have known about the case of R (Mackay) <em>v </em>Barking and
Dagenham. I do not believe that that is general
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000247">&#160;</a>

practical experience of dealing with people’s problems. My hon.
Friend is demonstrating that when people arrive at citizens advice
bureaux, they do not come with only one problem, but with about four or
five different ones. Some of them can be dealt with—to take up
the earlier point—through general advice, but it is crucial that
people have access to legal advice as well if they are to solve their
problems. What would be the result if the legal element of the advice
disappeared, people who had problems were given bad advice and their
situation ended up becoming even worse because they had received poor,
rather than good, legal advice?<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000248">&#160;</a>

The implication would be that, first, the advice agency would be sued,
leading to more unnecessary court proceedings, and, secondly, the wrong
advice would lead the person down an even worse track.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000249">&#160;</a>

detailed information about the law, and that is what the Legal Services

that point. I was working in a citizens advice bureau when the system
changed from supplementary benefit to income support. The CPAG handbook
started off being probably about an inch thick; it has now developed
and is 3 inches thick owing to how the system has developed through
case law. As soon as a new system is brought in, the number of appeals
absolutely rockets. I am sure she will agree that the system has not
got any more complex over the past year, yet the number of appeals on
incapacity benefit and employment support allowance have gone up by
167% in that year alone. What that figure is likely to be when the new
system comes in, I cannot bear to imagine. Of the appeals, 50% on
incapacity benefit and 38% on ESA were decided in favour of the
appellant. The cost of those appeals, in terms of the legal advice
provided, was £167.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000252">&#160;</a>

the legal system are those in social groups D and E, who are less
likely to have access to a mobile telephone or the internet. He said
that if we actually want to create a system that stops the people who
need it using the advice, this is the way to do
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000254">&#160;</a>

off going for face-to-face advice. She could not face picking up
another telephone to speak to somebody in a call centre. She needed
somebody to realise how distressed she was by her case and by not
receiving her benefits. Telephone advice is good in some
circumstances—I think we all want to increase access to
telephone advice—but it is totally unsuitable for a number of
vulnerable people, such as those with learning disabilities and those
who are almost at the end of their tether and suicidal, as in the

Where would those people receive advice if that were the only means
available to them? It is difficult to quantify, but some of these cases
demonstrate that the wider costs to society and to the state will
increase if we remove access to social welfare law at an early
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000259">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am conscious of the time, so I shall be as quick
as I possibly can. I want to speak to amendment 14, which is
in my name. Paragraph 49 of schedule 5 to the Bill removes sections 1
to 26 and schedules 1 to 3A to the Access to Justice Act 1999, which
would remove the duty of the Government to ensure that individuals have
access to legal services that meet their needs
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would reinstate that important duty and remove any doubt that
the Lord Chancellor will ensure that those who need legal assistance do
not go without it. As I said, such an important duty already exists in
current legislation. If the amendment were accepted by the Government,
it would put to bed any suggestion that the Lord Chancellor will fail
in his duty to provide legal assistance to those who need it. It would
ensure that our constituents continue to receive practical and
effective access to justice, which means that when people need access
to professionals and legal services, they will receive effective advice
and assistance. That does not mean a telephone call— an
opportunity to speak to someone on the end of a telephone
line—but proper, effective access to
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000261">&#160;</a>

important amendment. He was making a point that I was trying to make,
but more succinctly. Where the Access to Justice Act was
inclusive—it gave a whole raft of powers and
responsibilities—the Bill will take them away in one fell swoop.
His amendment would cleverly put back that responsibility, so the Lord
Chancellor cannot abrogate his
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000262">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That brings me
to another point. I think it has been mentioned already in the
Committee, but there seems to be a myth that publicly funded lawyers
have earned 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 238<a class="bkMark" name="Column238">&#160;</a>
                  </div>fortunes and continue to earn fortunes. The hon. Member for South West
Norfolk mentioned in an intervention not long ago what lawyers earn. I
can tell the Committee that publicly funded lawyers do not earn as much
as I expect the hon. Lady thinks they do. I am guessing—I do not
know for sure, but I suspect it is the case—that a solicitor who
has about four or five years’ post-qualification experience
probably earns in the region of about £30,000. I would not
expect them to earn more than that. They are qualified lawyers; they
have taken lots of exams and passed those exams; they are probably duty
qualified solicitors if they work as criminal solicitors; and they are
very likely to have higher rights of audience in court, so they will be
expensive for their firms to train and continue to employ. Of course,
they will need to meet the requirements of continuing professional
development points and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000264">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I make that

funded lawyers doing very well from the current system but that firms
of solicitors earn fortunes as well. It is simply not the

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It seems that
the Government are concentrating their attention on the low end of the
profession. I have great concerns. The Government have ignored
thousands of responses to the proposals. If legal aid is withdrawn from
substantial areas of law, many people will be disfranchised from the
justice system. They will be left unable to access justice and to
enforce their legal rights. Without the benefit of proper legal
representation, people will be left with no choice but to paddle their
own canoe, taking on the system on their own. Very often, law is
difficult and complex, procedurally and legally. That is why the Bar
Council very accurately described the Government’s plans as do
it yourself justice, rather than access to justice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not look
on the Bar Council—or the Law Society for that matter—as
a trade union, but there seems to be a suggestion from the hon. Member
for Ipswich that that is exactly what it is. Even if the Bar Council is
a trade union representing the interests of its members, it is not, as
I suspect he would have us believe, some left-wing firebrand trade
union. I have to say that I have not read the article that he wrote for
<em>The Times</em>—I shall read it after this Committee—but
I suspect that that is what he was suggesting in that
article.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000268">&#160;</a>

it is worth pointing out that the president of the Law Society wrote a

and balanced, and it evidently was not. That really is the position
from the

to disagree with him for the most
part.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000270">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have other concerns as well. I think that members of the Committee
would agree with me on the disruption and costly delay to the court
system that the proposals will create. That issue was raised by the Bar
Council, the Law Society and the Judges Council of England and Wales.
It worries me that professional bodies such as those that I have just
mentioned are ignored by the Government. There were some 5,000
submissions to the consultation on legal aid. It seems that the
Government did not listen to those submissions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000271">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Even worse,
the Government seem to have ignored their own research. I think I am
right in saying that they spent time researching the plans and whether
they would give rise to more litigants in person. The finding was that
they would, and that that would result in considerable delays and costs
in the system. Of course, they have chosen to ignore their research,
which is of great concern to me. I am delighted to say that I have just
come off the Health and Social Care Bill Committee. It was a
recommitted Bill Committee, because the Government spent several months
saying very little to people like me who made comments, remarks and
speeches in Committee, and decided to slap to one side the submissions
made by Labour Members and ignore them, but then, all of a sudden,
decided that they would listen. I suspect that I am going slightly
off-track, but the point that I am making is valuable. There is a need
to listen to the submissions made by professional bodies such as the
Bar Council, the Law Society and the Judges Council of England and
Wales, which made strong submissions about the consequences of the
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000272">&#160;</a>

by saying that I was pleased to hear the co-operative tone suggested by
the hon. Member for Hammersmith. I hope that we can move through the

               <p class="tabbed">We
have had many good contributions and knowledgeable comments from hon.
Members on both sides of the room. It was a lengthy debate, to be
frank, so I will go straight to addressing the amendments. The
amendments would amend clause 1 to include express reference to the
need to promote and ensure access to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 240<a class="bkMark" name="Column240">&#160;</a>
                  </div>justice. The hon. Member for Hammersmith referred to the purpose of the
Bill being ignored, but that is not the case. Clause 1(1)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The

               </p>
               <p>so
the purpose of the Bill is clear, and we do not need a purpose
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
60, 14 and 61 all seek to introduce a requirement for legal aid to
ensure access to justice for individuals. I acknowledge the vital
importance of protecting fundamental rights of access to justice. I
assure all hon. Members that that has been central in developing our
proposals for reform. Fundamental rights to access to justice are the
subject of international protections, such as those provided by the
European convention on human rights and certain enforceable EU rights.
I am confident that the plans set out in the Bill protect those
fundamental rights, both through the areas retained in the scope of
schedule 1, and through the new exceptional funding
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000277">&#160;</a>

maintain access to justice. Given that he agreed to substantial cuts in
the legal aid budget, was it not a question of fitting the new policy
and the new Bill around the money that was left after he accepted the
cuts?<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000278">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I did not say that our first priority was to
retain access to justice. I said that we took on board the fundamental
right of access to justice. The scheme will ensure that in individual
cases where the failure to provide legal aid would be likely to amount
to a breach of an individual’s rights under the Human Rights Act
1998 or European law, exceptional funding for that individual will be
available. That is a vital safeguard to ensure that no one is deprived
of their fundamental rights of access to justice. We live, however, in
a difficult time of scarce resources, as the hon. Member for Kingston
upon Hull East acknowledged, and as my hon. Friends the Members for
Erewash and for Ipswich said very plainly. It is essential that we
achieve an affordable system for legal aid that allows taxpayer-funded
representation to be targeted at priority areas. We made that clear in
our consultation paper. It is not the case, and indeed has never been
the case, that everyone is entitled to legal representation, provided
by the taxpayer, for any dispute. It is essential that we are able to
put forward reforms that establish an affordable system, while still
ensuring that no one is denied their fundamental rights of access to
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000279">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith said, “I think we know what we mean
when we talk of access to justice,” but do we? Are we talking in
absolute terms, as he seemed to suggest in some of his remarks, or do
we mean the phrase as used in Labour’s flagship Access to
Justice Act 1999? It is important to clarify that, despite its name,
that Act does not contain an equivalent duty to that put forward by the
hon. Gentleman. Indeed, there is no an express duty on the Lord
Chancellor or the Legal Services Commission to secure access to
justice—nor has there ever been. Perhaps one of the Opposition
Members will wish to advise the Committee of why that Act was so named.
That Act requires only that the Legal Services Commission establishes
the community legal service to ensure, within the resources available
and the priorities set, that individuals have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 241<a class="bkMark" name="Column241">&#160;</a>
                  </div>access to services that effectively meet their needs. That concept was
debated very skilfully by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000280">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
any event, the common-law right of access to justice does not guarantee
legal representation or equality of arms. While it is clear that a
fundamental principle of law is that every citizen has a right of
unimpeded access to a court, that does not include a right in all
circumstances to receive advice from a legal representative. A right of
access to the court means having the assistance of the court to assert
legal rights, and to obtain remedies to which one is entitled. That
means having the right to challenge a decision in the courts if one
wishes to do so. That means not preventing somebody from issuing court
proceedings because of an inability to pay the court fee. All of that
is despite the point, rightly made by my hon. Friends the Members for
Broxtowe and for Erewash, that too often people rush to lawyers and
court when they should be using
alternatives.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000281">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Hammersmith mentioned impact assessments and the
certain possible outcomes set out in the Bill’s impact
assessment. I am pleased that he reminded the Committee that we have
looked carefully at the possible outcomes in those impact assessments.
It is right and proper to consider all risks and possible
eventualities, but that does not make them either likely or probable.
All impacts will be determined by behavioural responses, which cannot
be predicted; hence we need to discuss all risks. That is called

decisions on the possibilities of policy reform. Various examples have
been given this afternoon. The main example and the main debate focused
on clinical negligence. Many hon. Members made a lot of
points on that, particularly the hon. Member for Hammersmith, and I
think the hon. Member for St Helens North also made a number of
comments. Let me go through the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000285">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Currently,
legal aid is available to those who qualify financially, and who
suffered negligent medical treatment, to seek damages from any type of
public or private medical practitioner. Those are claims for monetary
compensation, but they often raise serious issues, especially where the
damages are required to meet future needs. Some litigants will be
vulnerable because of disabilities resulting from the negligent
treatment. However, although the issues raised are likely to be
important, we consider 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 242<a class="bkMark" name="Column242">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that there is a viable source of alternative funding to legal aid in
conditional fee arrangements, which are more readily available in such
cases than for other claims. We therefore consider that legal aid is
not justified in such cases, and that our limited funding would be
better targeted at other priority areas, such as those that concern
physical safety, liberty or
homelessness.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000286">&#160;</a>

shall answer the first question from the hon. Member for St Helens
North, so that he may ask some more. He asked whether the Jackson
proposals would leave a number of claimants without representation. We
recognise that there will be particular cases where it may be difficult
to secure conditional fee arrangements, but our proposals will ensure
that individual cases of that type continue to receive legal aid where
necessary for the UK to meets its international and domestic legal
obligations via a proposed scheme for excluded cases. It is also
intended that the reform following the Jackson proposals will provide
for a tightly drawn-up power, allowing recoverability of
after-the-event premiums in clinical negligence
claims.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000287">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister seems to be ignoring the evidence that
we heard last week, which seemed to indicate that the practitioners
believe that such cases are expensive—they often have
£100,000 or £200,000 in up-front costs—and that it
is unlikely that companies will take them. Even if they do, they will
limit the number of cases that they take because of liabilities to
their own company. Will the Minister spell out what discretion there
will be for the judge, when it comes to people who find themselves
without legal redress, and who need to find a way to take a case
through the 
court?<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000288">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The reason why I will not do that today is that
we have a clause that specifically deals with excluded cases. It is a
full and particular area, and we will go through it in some detail. I
assure the hon. Gentleman that I will cover his comments carefully when
we reach that clause. Given the time, I should keep moving

               <p class="tabbed">On
the other aspects of amendment 61, it would require the Lord Chancellor
to protect and promote the public interest and support the
constitutional principle of the rule of law in carrying out his
functions. That amendment is unnecessary, because those considerations
are inherent in the Lord Chancellor’s functions as a Minister of
the Crown and they do not require specific reference here. In addition,
the Lord Chancellor has some specific duties under the Constitutional
Reform Act
2005.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Proposed
new subsections (7) and (8) are also unnecessary, as they seek a
statutory footing for a legal aid strategy. The Bill is precisely that;
the culmination of an extensive consultation and engagement exercise,
which sought to define the nature and range of legal aid services in
the future. We have been clear on the objectives of the new scheme
throughout the process. We have undertaken to conduct a
post-implementation review of the new scheme, which will be published,
and of course the House will be free to debate its findings.
Amendment 61 is therefore not needed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000291">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The practical
implications of the proposed new subsections (9) and (10) in amendment
61 make them administratively impossible to achieve. Trying to
establish 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 243<a class="bkMark" name="Column243">&#160;</a>
                  </div>what drives the cost in the wider justice system—and the links
between that, the welfare system and the reforms to legal
aid—would be very difficult. I do not think that it would
produce any meaningful results. I do not accept that there is a need to
create accounting functions; the relevant financial information in
relation to the agency will be included in the annual Ministry of
Justice report that deals with the Department’s finances. There
is no precedent for such provisions in any area of
government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
turn to the remaining aspects of new clause 1, tabled by the hon.
Member for Hammersmith, that I have not addressed. The first point
relates to the proposed principle that the constitutional right to be
regarded as innocent until proven guilty should be respected as the
cardinal principle of criminal law. It goes without saying that we
agree with the fundamental principle of being innocent until proven
guilty. It is not necessary, however, to include that principle in the
Bill. We have made it absolutely clear throughout the reform process
that we do not propose to make any alterations in respect of the scope
of criminal legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The last
element of new clause 1, which deals with the availability of
resources, is equally unnecessary. I am surprised, as was my hon.
Friend the Member for Ipswich, that the hon. Gentleman made such a
proposal in the existing fiscal climate. To answer his question about
financial accountability, Conservative Front Benchers in opposition
were expected to clear all spending commitments with their shadow
Treasury colleagues. That is known, I believe, as responsible
opposition, and I am surprised that Opposition Front Benchers can issue
uncapped spending commitments.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the issue
raised by the hon. Member for St Helens North, as we have made clear in
our proposals and the consultation document, as well as in proposing
the Bill, legal aid resources are not infinite, and we have taken the
hard choices necessary to target that finite resource where it is most
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 89,
which was proposed to clause 1 by the hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston, would require that before any changes to legal aid are made, a
full independent assessment of any likely increase in litigants in
person and the consequent effect on the deficit would have to be
undertaken. That amendment is unnecessary, because we conducted a full
review of the available literature on litigants in person and published
it alongside the consultation response.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000296">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Members for Hammersmith and for Bishop Auckland asked how claimants are
expected to prepare their own tribunal applications in this context. In
most cases, individuals will be able to appeal to the first-tier social
security and child support tribunal without formal legal assistance.
The appellant is required only to provide reasons for disagreeing with
the decision in plain language. For those who need assistance on a
welfare benefits matter, factual advice is available from Jobcentre
Plus, the benefit enquiry line and the tribunal itself, for
example.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000297">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am pleased
to advise the hon. Member for Makerfield that in the CAB example that
she gave—where the CAB gave legal advice to stop the
client’s eviction—such action would remain in
scope.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000298">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Litigants in
person are already—as the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston
noted—and have always been a feature of our legal system. We
accept that the reforms will mean an increase in the numbers of
unrepresented litigants and that that might impact on case duration.
The important point here is that significantly increased numbers of
people will not go to court at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000299">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich spoke persuasively in support of
mediation. We think that there will be at least an extra 10,000 cases
of mediation, and we will not in any way cap the numbers. That is
likely to help offset any additional burden on the courts, and they
should therefore still able to deal effectively with the cases that
they hear. I can confirm to my right hon. Friend the Member for
Carshalton and Wallington that the Government have a significant
project to extend mediation within the Government and that we are also
working with local government to extend mediation there. He is right
that the Government should lead the way, and we intend to do so.
Several Members queried the relationship between mediation and legal
advice, and I can tell them that once a funded mediation client starts
mediation, there will be legal advice at the legal help level, on a
fixed-fee
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000300">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
recognise, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith pointed out, that people
find, and still will find after the legislation is passed, the justice
system daunting and difficult to navigate. They might need help with
that. We agree that that area has been ignored for too long, and the
Government have a number of plans to simplify the system, such as
through the family justice review. A range of work is going on to
produce better guidance, simplify forms and rules, and create online
walk-throughs. There will also be post-implementation reviews of the
reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000301">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Turning
to the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston’s other amendment,
amendment 83 would require the Lord Chancellor to ensure that no areas
of law that are currently within scope could be removed until there had
been a full independent assessment of the costs, which had reasonably
established that the removal would not increase the deficit. That
assessment would have to be presented to Parliament. We therefore
believe that that amendment is also
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000302">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clear goals of our reform are to discourage unnecessary and adversarial
litigation at public expense, target legal aid at those who need it
most, make substantial savings to the cost of the scheme and deliver
better value for money to the taxpayer. We have made it clear from the
outset that a cultural and therefore behavioural change is one of the
key objectives of the reform programme. We are seeking to move away
from adversarial and litigious resolution of disputes and instead
promote greater use of alternative methods of dispute resolution and
the right provision of advice and information to empower people to
resolve their own problems. At the same time, the Bill will ensure that
legal aid is retained for the highest priority
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000303">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston. She discussed the division
between immigration and asylum cases, and I mentioned in my submission
that Government Members are concerned about some related issues.
Although asylum will remain in scope and non-detention immigration will
be taken out of scope, is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 245<a class="bkMark" name="Column245">&#160;</a>
                  </div>there not a possible problem with people suffering domestic violence who
are involved in an immigration case automatically being taken out of
scope? Would it be possible for the Government to review that area, as
they have done with domestic violence elsewhere in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000304">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The matter of
including cases brought under the immigration domestic violence rule in
the scope of civil legal aid was raised a great deal during the
consultation, and we considered the point carefully. Although we
accepted that the applicants in such cases were vulnerable, we did not
think, on balance, that legal aid was required, essentially because the
applications, similar to other immigrant applications, were
paper-based. We recognised that people might need assistance with
obtaining the required documentary evidence, but we considered that
such assistance need not be specialist legal assistance funded by legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000305">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">After
further consideration, however, we accept that such cases are unusual.
There is a real risk that, without legal aid, people will stay trapped
in abusive relationships out of fear of jeopardising their immigration
status. The type of trauma that they might have suffered will often
make it difficult to cope with such applications. We also appreciate
that people apply under great pressure of time, and access to a
properly designated immigration adviser is a factor. We intend to table
a Government amendment to bring such cases into scope at a later
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000306">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">We
recognise the concern that early advice may reduce the costs further
down the road. We consider, however, that our approach of prioritising
cases where life or liberty is at stake or there is a direct and
immediate risk of homelessness is rational and appropriate, and that it
is necessary to ensure a sustainable system for legal aid. The hon.
Members for Makerfield and for Stockton North spoke about early
intervention being essential. We have listened carefully to the points
that have been made about the importance of early advice in social
welfare cases, but given the need to make substantial financial savings
in the spending review period and to target resources on those who need
them most, we consider that debt and housing cases where there is an
immediate risk of homelessness are the appropriate priority.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000307">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Overall, we
consider that financial issues, however important to the individual,
are less important in terms of legal aid funding than fundamental
issues, such as safety or liberty. We also consider that many such
cases are about practical rather than legal problems, so although we
recognise that advice on money management is often of clear benefit to
the client, it does not necessarily require specialist legal
advice that is funded by legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000308">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We recognise
that many respondents told us that other sources of advice will no
longer be available, but on 12 February this year, the Government
announced continued funding of £27 million to maintain the

agencies across England and  Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000309">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I will come on to the other things that are
available. We need to discuss how that money will be applied and
whether it will be available for future years. I agree that many people
with disputes or grievances need early, good-quality, general advice,
and not necessarily the expertise of specialist lawyers. I understand
the points that hon. Members have made, and, intuitively, some early
advice may well have a preventive benefit in avoiding downstream costs.
Changes to legal aid alone should not undermine the provision of
general advice, however. As a matter of principle, legal aid is money
that has been intended for specialist advice, not cross-subsidising
other activities. As a matter of practice, legal aid represents only
one of several income streams for many organisations. For example, 85%
of CABs’ funding comes from other sources, and half of all
bureaux get no legal aid funding at all.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000311">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The following
question was how the Government expect the not-for-profit sector to
fill the gap left by the reforms. The Government recognise the
important role that not-for-profit organisations such as Citizens
Advice play in delivering advice services locally. We are considering
the impact of wide reductions in their funding, recognising that legal
aid represents one of several income streams for many organisations.
The Government are reviewing the likely impact on not-for-profit advice
organisations to identify the scale of the issues and to consider the
appropriate role for Government in contributing to the future
sustainability of the sector. On Second Reading, the Lord Chancellor
announced that the Government will provide additional funding to the
not-for-profit advice sector in 2011-12, which will amount to an
additional £20 million. That is, of course, in addition to the
£100 million of transitional funding made available last
December.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000312">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are also
mindful of the impact of reforms beyond this financial year, which the
hon. Member for Makerfield quite rightly mentioned, and the review will
consider the issues that that creates. The hon. Member for Hammersmith
mentioned his local law centre, which had a 100% cut from his local
authority. I am pleased to say that Huntingdonshire CABs have not been
cut; I am sure that that has nothing to do with the influence of the
local MP. My right hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington
quite rightly said that the picture was mixed across the country, and
the hon. Member for St Helens North also remarked on the issue. Across
CABs, to cite a representative not-for-profit organisation, the average
cut is about 10% across the country. That is similar to if not better
than the cuts that are happening in the public sector, although I
advise caution on that figure, because, as I have said before, most
CABs would have more funding streams than simply the local authority.
That point was made by the hon. Member for Makerfield in her earlier
remarks.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000313">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Amendment
83 asks us to predict the future benefits and costs of the reforms.
That is notoriously difficult because the extent of any systemic cost
arising will be driven by a range of factors that are difficult to
predict, including an individual’s behavioural responses to the
changes that we are seeking to make in the Bill. Nevertheless, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 247<a class="bkMark" name="Column247">&#160;</a>
                  </div>we have given careful consideration to this issue as part of the policy
development and clearance process. Extensive discussions between policy
officials of different Departments were held as part of this process.
Clearly, knock-on or downstream costs were factored into those
discussions, as well being part of the consideration given by the Home
Affairs Sub-Committee in agreeing to the proposals.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Stretford and Urmston also said that welfare reforms would
mean that legal aid must be maintained for these matters while reforms
are bedded down. Several proposals are currently being considered
across government that should make it easier for people to receive the
right provision or entitlement in welfare benefits or education. The
most notable of those is universal credit, which will help reduce the
scope of fraud and error because it makes the benefits system simpler
and easier to understand.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000314">&#160;</a>

outcome of the introduction of universal credit, but my point was
specifically about the transition to universal credit, which will be
protracted and leave people unsure about whether they are in the new or
the old system. They need to understand how they will transition
across, and I was querying whether there could be extra support
specifically in relation to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000315">&#160;</a>

exploring client and provider research that will be conducted in the

two bites at the cherry. First, he spoke movingly about his personal
experience. He argued that the Government need to address the
truculence shown by some defendants, particularly in NHS cases, and the
lack of willingness on the part of clinicians to admit fault. He
questioned whether proper redress can be had by those who have suffered
clinical negligence or indeed other injuries at the hands of the NHS or
other public bodies without

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I agreed with
almost the entire speech of the hon. Member for South Swindon,
certainly in terms of the history of legal aid, and some of alternative
solutions that he proposed. The only point on which I did not agree
with him, and again I paraphrase, was when he said that to claim that
that the proposals in the Bill would undermine our legal aid system was
a storm in a teacup. The 5,000 responses to the legal aid consultation
say different. Those responses, from a raft of engaged and committed
organisations, say that this is a profound change. I would not want to
lose that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000320">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston spoke to two very
persuasive amendments. I do not know how far they persuaded
Conservative Members. I do not think we will find out today. They make
unarguable points in relation to costs and litigants in person. We will
see how far they are true—how far the courts are clogged up, how
far justice is not done in the absence of lawyers, and how far other
parts of the state or individuals themselves have to bear the cost of
lack of representation. Even at this stage, it is unarguable that there
will be costs, delays and
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000321">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to fall out with the hon. Member for Ipswich but his speech
was a bit too clever by half. To say that one cannot spend to save in a
Bill where payment by results is at the heart of reform of the criminal
justice system is a bit bizarre. I wince slightly when hon. Members use
words such as “lying” and “malicious” in
Committee. He may want to reflect on the use of those terms. I know he
is referring to my constituency. I do not take umbrage at that; I have
been in Hammersmith politics for 30 years and those are quite mild
terms in that milieu. I take exception to the fact that he thinks he
knows better about what is going on in my constituency, where very
serious matters to do with people’s homes are occurring this
week. I will not digress by getting into that subject, but I will say
that it is not a proper place to go, either in Committee or from his
perspective of knowing very little about the area.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000322">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon. Friend
the Member for Makerfield made her points succinctly and clearly with
the use of example, and they were all the better for that. I conclude
by saying that listening to the Minister is a bit like
“Groundhog Day” sometimes. I give him points for
doggedness, which is to say that we hear the same things time and
again. I will keep trying to wear him down and maybe I will get there
in the end. He may be right that there has not been a clear statement
so far, even in the landmark Bills we talked about today. However, the
spirit and intention of the Bills were clear, certainly of the
’49 Bill—I invite him to read the Second Reading
debate—and of the ’99 Bill. We feel it is important to
put one or two of the amendments to the vote, and invite the Government
to support us, because we believe that for the first time that
consensus is being broken, and the Government are moving far away from
the spirit intended.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000323">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On finance,
the Minister understands our point. Yes, clearly, we said before as
well as after the election that we would make cuts in this area, and we
do not resile  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 249<a class="bkMark" name="Column249">&#160;</a>
                  </div>from the fact that the deficit has to be tackled, or from the need for
cuts in legal aid. What we object to about the cuts is that they are
being made irrespective and regardless of the service offered. That is
the problem. Effectively, many will have no service, but that point is
not addressed. To that extent, it is disingenuous of the Government to
say, “We are making cuts, because cuts have to be made”,
but also, “We believe in preserving a legal aid system”,
while leaving something that is not fit for purpose, to put it at its
mildest.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000324">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I feel it in
my bones that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull East is
not keen to press his amendment to a vote. I would seek to press new
clause 1, but I understand that that comes later, as does
amendment 61, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Stretford and Urmston, so the only amendment that I wish to press is
amendment
60.<a class="bkMark" name="1107205000325">&#160;</a>
