<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): First, I apologise to you, Mr. Gale, and to the Minister for the fact that our senior transport spokesman, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) is not here. He will be here as soon as possible, but he had to take a break for breakfast. That is central to the common-sense revolution.
<P>
During our previous sitting on Tuesday afternoon, the Minister made many helpful comments about the licence. However, the Hansard report for that sitting is not yet available. Although I understand the pressures that the Hansard staff are under, given the number of Committees and the recent all-night sitting in the House, that presents us with a slight problem. Can the Minister continue his remarks now? That might save us time later, and I am aware that we need to make progress.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I am happy to take up the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. As he will appreciate, I had intended to say a little more on Tuesday, but had to terminate my remarks to allow the Committee to adjourn.
<P>
I am surprised that the hon. Member for North Essex should regard arriving late for the Committee as part of the Conservative party's strategy for winning the next general election. That is an apt comment on the parlous state of the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is bad enough to have to put up with people who chatter over breakfast, rather than reading a newspaper or collecting their thoughts prior to entering the Committee, without having to face a lecture on Conservative party policy—whatever that may be?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Try as I might, I cannot relate that to the provision of safe, economical and reliable air traffic services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I will say no more, other than that I was delighted to see my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) in his place promptly at 9 o'clock, as is appropriate for a railwayman.
<P>
I am happy to go into a little more detail about the provision of the licence. With your indulgence, Mr. Gale, and that of the Committee, I shall explain more about the provisions in the licence and respond to the questions that were put by the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman began by professing concern at the complexity of the definitions in the licence. Conservative Members will be aware—because they promulgated many regulatory licences in their day—that the licence is a legal instrument, and must be precise. If members of the Committee would like a detailed seminar on each aspect of the licence, I would be happy to arrange it, having drawn on the expertise of officials in my Department and their advisers. However, the Committee is not the appropriate forum in which such a discussion could productively take place. We should focus on the matters in hand, in the Bill and in the licence agreement.
<P>
I have stressed that the licence is in draft form, and that further drafts will ensue. The consultation process, which will include people from outside the House, will ensure good feedback on this first draft. Clearly, as part of that process, we shall listen carefully to Committee members' comments.
<P>
I turn to my promised explanation, and in doing so I shall focus on the Opposition amendments. The hon. Member for North Essex suggested that the general obligation to provide core and specified services was too important to be left to the licence, and that it ought to be dealt with in the Bill. Although we have not yet discussed clause 8, the Opposition will be aware, because they have tabled amendments to it, that clause 8 sets out precisely the overarching duties on the licence holder that the hon. Gentleman wanted to include in the Bill. The Bill makes clear the obligations to develop and maintain a system for the provision of air traffic services that is safe, efficient and co-ordinated. That system must be developed and maintained so that present and likely future demands can reasonably be expected to be met. As I said on Tuesday afternoon, that constitutes a clear, unequivocal and comprehensive duty on the licence holder.
<P>
The licence holder's failure to meet that duty would be a very serious matter. In such a case, the Secretary of State could invoke special administration procedures, which we shall discuss in due course, or CAA enforcement arrangements could be invoked. Either way, we are talking about grave failure, for which provision must be made. Equally, it is necessary to provide for perhaps less serious, but correspondingly more likely, scenarios relating to service provision. The service is dynamic, and there will inevitably be changes and developments. The licence must provide for those changes when circumstances require by modifying the obligations that the CAA will be able to impose as part of its regulatory control.
<P>
Only a rash person would suggest that the current service will be provided in the same way in several years' time, or that what is an adequate service today will still so in five, 10 or 15 years. Clearly, it would be unacceptable to fail to embrace new technology and opportunities, which would enable the need for capacity to be met more efficiently. The licence condition will enable the regulator to satisfy himself that National Air Traffic Services is producing at any given time the outputs that could be expected from a world-class operation.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex made the general point that a number of conditions in the licence deal with obligations that are an inherent part of service provision or normal business practice. He questioned whether it was necessary to include them in the licence, and suggested that they constitute unnecessary bureaucracy. However, as a monopoly provider of a service that is essential to the national interest, it is necessary not only for the licence holder to embrace such aspects of service and business management, but to be seen to be doing so. It is important to establish provisions that demonstrate to the regulator that the licence holder is conducting its affairs in a way that will protect assets and other resources and maintain the system so that future obligations can be met, that it is not exploiting its monopoly status, and that it is making appropriate plans to meet service demands in the public interest. I make no apology for that, nor would I expect users or the general public to do so. Indeed, I suspect that, had the licence agreement not provided for the meeting of those standards, we would have been criticised by the Opposition for an omission in a crucial legal document.
<P>
I hope that I have explained why there should be a process through which the licence holder and the regulator can agree on material changes to the licensee's service obligations. Condition 3, therefore, sets out a framework for the licensee or the regulator to propose such changes and for them to be determined, if necessary, by reference to the Competition Commission.
<P>
It is worth considering the name of the Competition Commission and to emphasise a point made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) on Tuesday. Conservative Members seemed concerned that the Competition Commission was involved, given that the case involved a monopoly. I emphasise, as did my hon. Friend on Tuesday, that, despite the title, the commission retains the duties and obligations of the predecessor body—the Monopolies and Mergers Commission—in making public interest judgments on the matters referred to it. That is the basis on which the Competition Commission should be involved when amendments are proposed to the licensee's service obligations.
<P>
It is precisely to recognise the distinction between different levels of obligation that we have included condition 4, on the specified services delivery plan. That relates to detailed matters which are, none the less, operationally important; it may help if I give an example. One of the specified services was expected to be making available the navigational infrastructure on which the core services in part depend, However, in its capacity as overall regulator of the industry, including safety matters, the Civil Aviation Authority will need to know by what infrastructure the licence holder intends to provide those services so that it may be sure that the interests of air users are adequately catered for. It must, therefore, have available to it information on, for example, the siting of beacons that are used for air navigation purposes and plans for their removal, augmentation or relocation. Those are set out in aeronautical information publications, but do not necessarily impart any obligation on the operator to continue to provide them or to provide them in a particular way. That is because the Civil Aviation Authority is currently the owner of National Air Traffic Services, but with the separation of regulation from service provision—I believe that everyone recognises that that separation is appropriate—the regulator will need to be able to get a handle on those matters if necessary. It would be daft to enshrine that in statute. I hope that that explanation satisfies the concerns of the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
I am conscious that I have taken quite a lot of time on the important issue of service provision and I shall try to move a little faster through the remaining conditions.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that conditions 5 to 9 created a very strict business environment, but one which, nevertheless, should be enshrined in statute. It is precisely because of the apparent contradiction that we have put those matters into the licence. Statute would provide an over-rigid framework for establishing and monitoring those rules. Clearly, the regulator should be able to ensure that the licensee does not dispose of or remortgage his assets, although he needs to be involved in such operational decisions at a detailed level. He will need to see the monopoly business accounted for separately from other businesses run by the licensee in order to police the boundary between them and to ensure that there is no inappropriate cross-subsidy or other anti-competitive activity.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Is the Minister not aware that that is precisely what happens in, for example, the water industry, in which regulated and non-regulated business are accounted for separately? That is laid down in statute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I have been saying, the provision that there should be no anti-competitive practice or abuse of the monopoly position is specified in statute, but the specific accounting arrangements to ensure that information is available to enable the regulator to be satisfied that that condition is met is covered in the licence. That is the correct relationship between the two. The principle is in the legislation and the detailed provision and the powers for the regulator are in the licence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Can my hon. Friend imagine a circumstance where airlines bid for NATS and the cross-subsidy works the other direction? In such a circumstance, a non-commercial return might be taken from NATS, so that investment could be increased and delays reduced. A reduction in delays would have a significant impact on the profitability of airlines. Will that be possible?
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend's example falls within the regulated business. For NATS to continue to provide local airport services that are not subject to the licence, monopoly business, which is covered by the licence, must be separated from other business undertaken by NATS. That is crucial in avoiding anti-competitive practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I have a question that may prove helpful when we debate subsequent amendments. The Minister says that we must avoid cross-subsidy from core businesses to other activities such as air traffic services at airports. Will he confirm that his sole objection, which is also expressed in the Bill and the licence, is to cross-subsidy that may affect competition, and that no other objections to cross-subsidy are included in the Bill or the licence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. The provision will deal with the potentially anti-competitive practice of using the monopoly to generate revenue that could give the operator an unfair advantage in an otherwise competitive climate. To that end, non-monopoly activities must be excluded from the monopoly. It is equally important that the regulator be entitled to reassurance that the licence holder's stewardship of these important national assets is proper.
<P>
Perhaps I may cast some light on the darkness that seemed briefly to overcome the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) and the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), both of whom professed confusion about the relationship between the assets and the licence. They seemed unsure whether we were talking about a share sale or an asset sale, and whether the strategic partner would be bidding for the assets, a licence or both. They seemed also to confuse the sale of an interest in a company with a concession arrangement, whereby the Government would set a price for the auctioning of the assets at the end of the concession.
<P>
I can confirm that NATS will retain its assets, and that the company's regulated activities will be licensed. For illustrative purposes, we currently propose that 46 per cent. of the company's shares be sold to the strategic partner, that a further 5 per cent. be made available to employees, and that the Government retain 49 per cent. However, that is not fixed and immutable. There is no question of bidding for the licence or assets, of administered asset pricing, or of concession arrangements.
<P>
I hope that that has clarified matters. I recall that written details on the planned sale process were requested, and I shall ensure that they are provided to all Committee members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I think that that is satisfactory, as far as it goes, provided that the Minister will deal with the question of how the assets will be transferred in the event of a change of licensee. Will he also ensure that the licence's treatment of shareholdings is consistent with the Government's intention to prevent any takeover of the company that they regard as contrary to the national interest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We will seek to clarify those points, and I am sure that Committee members will do so when we consider clauses covering both issues. The matters are important and I shall say more about them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Again, that is fine. I want to be reasonable; we can deal with the two issues at the appropriate time. However, it would be helpful if the Minister told us when he thinks that will be. The Minister need not be detained now providing that we know when to expect statements about the management of transfer values and the way in which the Government would ensure that any change of ownership was consistent with their national security objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The most appropriate moment for discussion will probably be when we consider chapter II, which deals with transfers and Government controls regarding shares.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea might have added that the Minister could include in the portfolio of matters to be covered later the issue of the residual value of investment made by the strategic partner in an asset required to remain with NATS in the event of a licence change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is one element of the issue, and one reason why, during Tuesday's discussions, we emphasised the importance of a long notice period leading up to a possible change in licensee other than under procedures for rapid change where the licensee had failed to meet its obligations. The need for a 10-„year notice period was questioned. Given the hon. Gentleman's very point, he will recognise that where it is a question not of the licensee's failure to perform its duties and obligations but of an appropriate reconsideration of the licence, it was felt that there should be a very long period so that any such issue could be considered by the strategic partner, the Government and other interested bodies.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex said, with regard to the licence, that capacity and investment planning—condition 10—was a matter of good business practice. It is not excessive regulatory intrusion to require the monopoly provider to demonstrate to the regulator that its plans represent precisely such good business practice. I stress again that although some compliance burden inevitably results from the imposition of the requirements, they are designed to instil public confidence as well as to enable the regulator to enforce them. They provide in the main for regulatory intrusion only when that becomes necessary because of the behaviour or business management of the licence holder and the regulator's statutory duties.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the Bill should also cover service standards. However, that might result in an unduly rigid framework for what we expect to be a dynamic arrangement in which there is provision for regulatory oversight by the CAA and specific provision in the licence for consultation between the regulator and the licensee on the definition of standards.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the standards currently applied to NATS. Its performance is measured in terms of safety and availability. Airproxes and delays are recorded, with those attributable to air traffic control recorded separately. We can expect the CAA to wish to impose such standards on NATS under the licence, with appropriate values determined from time to time. That said, hon. Members will recognise that it is not easy to devise accurate and fair values. Much work is being done on that, about which we may say more in due course.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members will understand that we intend to include at least one important parameter attributable to the licence holder, probably related to the length of flight delays, as a factor to be built into the charge control arrangements, to which I shall refer in a moment.
<P>
I detected from his comments at our previous sitting that the hon. Member for North Essex did not want such a detailed explanation of some of the ensuing licence conditions, but I am happy to give such an explanation if hon. Members so wish. The hon. Gentleman asked about the pre-notification of changes in shareholdings. I direct the Committee's attention to schedule 3, paragraph 1(g) of the licence, which provides for the revocation of the licence where there occurs a change of shareholding inimical to the interests of national security or overseas relations, where notice of that change of shareholding has not been given, or where the change has taken place despite a notice to the contrary from the Secretary of State. I hope that that satisfies Opposition Members, although I suspect that the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea may not be so satisfied. However, the appropriate safeguard and control is in place against the eventualities that were mentioned at our previous sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> The Minister misread my expression; I wanted to apologise for being so stupid as not to have spotted schedule 3, paragraph I (g). It was staring me in the face all the time and I should have seen it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman, as a former Secretary of State, keeps his eye on a wide canvass—the big picture—and does not always focus on the minutiae, on which we more humble spear carriers, who are used to Committee proceedings, concentrate.
<P>
I welcome the hon. Member for North Essex to the Committee. He will see from Hansard that I have been responding to many of the points that he raised in our debates on Tuesday. His hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) has been following what I said closely. I hope that he will assure the hon. Gentleman that I have dealt with the matters that he raised.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): On shareholdings, the Minister said earlier that the Government were not fixed on the proportions to which he referred. Does that include even the first sale? Is my hon. Friend implying that it may not be 46 per cent. of the equity which, in the first instance, goes to the new strategic private partner, if the sale ever goes ahead? If the figure is fixed for the first sale, what is the intention for the percentages? Is it envisaged that the stakeholding will rise to about 49 per cent., or is the Minister saying that, inevitably, any change would be in the form of an increase in the private sector share of the new NATS?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I assure my right hon. Friend that no such inference should be drawn. I was merely setting out the Government's current intention and saying that that was our view of the right balance between the share held by the Government, by the strategic partner and by employees. The proportion that we envisage is as I outlined. However, I said that it was not fixed in tablets of stone; we are holding discussions with all interested bodies in the industry, including trade unions. On this, as on other matters, we are prepared to listen and to consider the points that are made. I explained, in good faith, what we believe is the right approach, but I made it clear that it is not final and fixed for all time. I assure my right hon. Friend that there is no hidden agenda involving a dilution of the Government's shareholding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> In giving full consideration to the shareholding and structure of NATS, post privatisation, will the Minister pay close attention to the Transport Committee's report on the matter, which will be published shortly? Its views may be different from his.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, we always pay careful attention to the views of the Select Committee and treat them very seriously, although we may not necessarily agree with them. We shall give proper consideration to the views of the Select Committee's report as and when it is available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It will be available shortly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have not yet seen a copy of it. The hon. Gentleman may be in a stronger position than we are to comment on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I may have a problem with my hearing as well as my mental capacity. Did the Minister say schedule 3, paragraph 1(g)? Schedule 3 appears to relate to air traffic administration orders, Northern Ireland. Perhaps I can be forgiven for not having looked for the relevant matter there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman can be forgiven, as he was looking at the Bill rather than the licence agreement, in which schedule 3, paragraph 1(g) specifically refers to the matter. If he wants me to go through it, I shall do so.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I am so pleased to be back in the fray and I am grateful tor the Minister's indulgence. Schedule 3(2)(a) of the licence states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The requisite period of notice shall be:
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) for the purposes of paragraphs l(f), 1(g) and l(h), 24 hours''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain where paragraph 1(h) is? It does not appear to be in the draft schedule, although I appreciate that it is only a draft. Will he also explain the 24-hour notice and handover in that respect? What circumstances are envisaged for such a handover and how will it work? What will happen to the assets in the ownership of the licensee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the good work of observing fine detail, as we humble spear carriers have to do. I shall look into the matter of the wayward paragraph l(h), which appears to have gone adrift. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, it is a draft; and there will be further work on it.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point was about the length of time involved. Rather than wearying the Committee by going over details that I have already covered, I shall stress the crucial point: there must be provision for an ordinary transfer—effected very quickly—when there is the risk of either a failure by the licensee to discharge its responsibilities or its financial failure. We could not possibly countenance a situation in which those crucial services ceased to be operated; there must be provision for very quick transfer.
<P>
As the hon. Member for North Essex will know from studying the proposal carefully, the revocation provisions, which allow a period of just 24 hours in certain circumstances, follow a procedure spelt out in the Bill, and in the licence, which allows for orders to be made by the Secretary of State and a full opportunity for the licensee to respond to them. There are safeguards, but it is part of the necessary provision to ensure that a vital public service can continue in circumstances in which its continuity would otherwise be threatened. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Next, in the interests of brevity, I intend to give a general description of the charge control conditions, which I hope will satisfy hon. Members and avoid my having to go into detailed explanation of the algebra, which I am prepared to do if hon. Members are not satisfied with my comments.
<P>
I start with the purpose of conditions 20 to 24, which are to set out the process by which increases in total NATS revenue from the provision of en-route services in the United Kingdom and the oceanic area will be capped.
<P>
Charges for the provision of en-route services in the UK are set and recovered through the Eurocontrol system. Condition 21 applies a revenue cap to that proportion of the Eurocontrol charges received by the UK which relate to the provision of en-route services in the UK by NATS. The basic mechanism of the cap restricts increases in revenue each year to, at most, the increase in the retail prices index for the previous year, less a factor X—a formula with which hon. Members are familiar. The effect is that any additional profits to NATS must come from increases in efficiency that reduce costs, and not from increased charges to users. It is intended that the precise value of the factor X will be set at a date much closer to the sale of the interest to the Strategic Partner.
<P>
Although RPI minus X forms the basis of the charge control, certain other adjustments are also made, in particular a service quality factor designed to take account of the extent to which NATS is successful in reducing delays to service users. There is a separate charge control on revenues from the provision of en-route services in the oceanic region, which are not recovered via Eurocontrol but are recovered directly from users. That is presented separately in the licence to allow different factors to be reflected in the level of the cap. It follows the same basic structure as the control on Eurocontrol charges, although it is somewhat simpler, reflecting the fact that it covers a simpler, more homogenous product and that charges are set at a flat rate.
<P>
The charge control conditions also make provision for the licence holder to provide certain information to the CAA each year or, where any change in the charges is proposed, to demonstrate its compliance with the charge control requirements, and for the charge control conditions to be amended or suspended, for example when directions relating to national security are in force. The charge control conditions set out the position for an initial five-year period. It is envisaged that, at the end of that period, the operation of the conditions will be reviewed by the regulator in consultation with NATS, as provided for in other regulation monopoly industries.
<P>
I hope that that gives hon. Members the information that they want. I understand that the favourite phrase of the hon. Member for North Essex is ``greater specificity''. Perhaps he will let me know if he seeks greater specificity of the charge control regime. If not, I shall deal with the issues raised in the four amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We will trust the hon. Gentleman that the algebra means what he says it means.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, as, I suspect, are most Committee members, because I have some very detailed notes on the algebra.
<P>
Amendment No. 150 is designed to ensure that an air traffic services licence is just that, and that the licence authority cannot bolt on to it provisions that have nothing to do with air traffic services. Clause 7(1), to which amendments Nos. 150 and 151 relate—I shall return to amendment No. 170—has been widely drafted, but I can assure the hon. Member for North Essex that there is nothing sinister about the Government's intentions. The provision is widely drafted to ensure that the licence authority has maximum flexibility to include in the licence the necessary provisions for the purpose of ensuring the continued financial and operational soundness of the licence holder and preventing abuses of its monopoly position.
<P>
The amendments suggest that we might try to include in the licence provisions that have nothing to do with air traffic services. We do not have the power to do that. That is covered by previous sections of the Bill, specifically clauses 1 and 2. There are no powers to include provisions in the licence that have nothing to do with air traffic services. So, however well drafted the amendment—the hon. Gentleman took a certain pride in the quality of the drafting when he moved it on Tuesday—it is otiose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Condescending!
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That was not at all condescending. I recall the hon. Gentleman saying that he took pride in the drafting of the amendment, so I was only referring to his own words. The amendment is otiose; the overriding provision makes it clear that the Government can only ensure provisions that relate to air traffic services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister explain precisely what is meant by the sentence,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and a provision need not relate to services authorised by the licence''?
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have made the point already, but I shall repeat it. The services operated by NATS include airport services, which will not be subject to a licence. They will be subject to exemptions and they will be competitive, but they will not be part of the licence monopoly. If we are to ensure safeguards against the abuse of monopoly power, it is vital that such factors are taken into account. That is why factors outside the licence must be included. I hope the hon. Gentleman understands the purpose of that.
<P>
Amendment No. 151 would prevent us including the provision of air traffic services in the licence for NATS, other than in the en-route sector. Specifically, it would exclude the safeguards against the abuse of monopoly power that I have identified. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will appreciate why the amendment would be undesirable.
<P>
Turning to amendment No. 153, as I have already explained, the significance of a ``condition'' is that it is intended to be enforceable and modifiable. Those provisions that are not expressed as conditions—usually described as ``terms''—are neither modifiable nor enforceable. That is why it is important to include the provision in subsection (4) about conditions. I understand the Opposition's objectives in drafting the amendment, but believe that they have not recognised the importance of the distinction between a condition and a provision.
<P>
A licence is a permission to do something, not an obligation. The permission extends to what the licence holder is authorised to do, where he is authorised to do it, for how long it is to last and the circumstances under which the permission may be withdrawn. Those constitute the terms of the licence, which are fixed and unchanging over time in order to provide security for the licence holder.
<P>
By contrast, the conditions are the price to be paid by the licence holder for the privilege of having the permission. They are designed to be modified, with proper checks and balances in the regulatory process, to reflect changing circumstances, changing economic or technical conditions—for example, changes in the nature of the business—or necessary developments in the legitimate requirements of the regulator and the public interest. Their purpose is to ensure that the licensee arranges his affairs so that adequate volumes and levels of service are available to users, that the business and assets are maintained in a state fit to meet those needs, that appropriate incentives to efficiency are provided, and that there are safeguards against abuse of monopoly power.
<P>
Amendment No. 170 would introduce a range of conditions that must be included in the licence. It follows the current draft outline of the licence agreement, which I take as a compliment from the hon. Member for North Essex, but that does not lessen my reluctance to list in the Bill conditions that must be included in the licence document, but which are likely to change over time. We will ask a specialist aviation regulator to exercise regulatory oversight through the licence, possibly for as long as 30 years, and none of us can predict what changes might be necessary during that time. It does not seem to be sensible or reasonable to tie the regulator's hands by being over-prescriptive.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister says ``a specialist aviation regulator''. I presume he envisages that that will be the CAA and only the CAA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Yes, most certainly. I am referring to the CAA as a specialist aviation regulator. It currently has a wider remit because there is no separation between NATS and the CAA under the current arrangement. I was emphasising the specialist skill of the CAA as a body well capable of performing that regulatory oversight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> My hon. Friend said that the revenue would be capped at inflation minus X, but will he confirm whether that cap will be on unit revenue? Obviously, overall air traffic is rising at 6 per cent. a year, so, presumably, overall revenue will rise at that level plus inflation less X. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the X would vary from year to year—after a period of years, the regulator might decide that technology was such that excess profit was being made—and would not be defined for 30 years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that he wants; of course it will not be fixed for 30 years. The X figure needs to be determined and it will vary. Provision has been made for five-yearly reviews, as I have said. The precise details and arrangements of the operation are designed to be flexible.
<P>
I have taken considerable time on this clause, the licence agreement and the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex. I apologise for that, but I hope that it has been helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> While we are still on the subject, and having found schedule 3, is the Minister satisfied that it is sufficient to rest on a licence condition that enables the licence to be revoked if a shareholding transfer strikes the Government as against the national interest? Would there not be value in backing that up in legislation? It would be disastrous if the Government faced a legal challenge because they revoked a licence on those terms and found, because there was no legislative back-up, that the decision failed in the courts. The Minister can give me an answer another time if he prefers.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is generous—he knows that this is a complex matter—but clause 26 sets out specific administrative procedures, which we will explore in more detail later. I shall, however, take further advice and if an issue needs to be highlighted, I shall bring it to the Committee's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea is significant. It will be covered in more detail when we debate the need to intervene for reasons of national security or if there is an overriding national interest to do so. But the point is made: there is no connection between the revocation of a licence and an unsavoury company or country taking control of the operation of NATS. I invite the Minister to do his homework on that, because it is of particular interest to us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that specific provision is made to enable the Secretary of State to object to proposed changes in shareholding arrangements. Concern about an undesirable change in the ownership of the operator will allow those provisions to be invoked. The safeguard is necessary to ensure that, in the national interest and the interest of probity, the operation will continue to function.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Is that not in stark contrast to the admission by the Government in our deliberations on Tuesday that the licence is to be awarded prior to a final agreement on who is to be the strategic partner? I cannot understand how the Minister's undertaking to the hon. Member for North Essex will operate when the first licence is awarded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In the nicest possible way, I point out that the hon. Gentleman is misunderstanding the process. NATS will be the first licensee. That is clear and well understood. The strategic partner will purchase shares. I said that the nature of the operation is a share purchase. That is why there is an arrangement for the licence to be issued to NATS as part of a process. The precise timing—the order of sequence of the processes—is not absolutely determined at this stage because complex matters must be covered.
<P>
On Tuesday, the hon. Member for Bath was concerned that the specific schedules that relate to the service provision will not necessarily be finalised for up to six months after the granting of the licence. That is because the licence will be awarded to NATS in the first instance, and we are familiar with NATS as an operation and with its processes. The six-month period allows the documentation to be put into the requisite shape to allow it to operate on a satisfactory basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for that response. I realise that the Committee will become tedious if we debate this issue much longer, but the Minister and the hon. Member for North Essex have been discussing the possibility of an undesirable organisation becoming involved in the operation of those activities that are covered by the licence. That can happen only in relation to those shares that are not in the hands of the Government. Therefore, we are talking about the shareholding of the strategic partner. The possibility that the strategic partner may be an undesirable organisation is of great concern. The Minister acknowledged—he has repeated it today—that a decision on the awarding of the first licence will be made with little or no knowledge of who that strategic partner is to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I keep trying to help the hon. Gentleman to understand the process. The Government will oversee the sale of the 46 per cent. of shares that will be purchased by the strategic partner. The Government are in a strong position to exercise proper control of the provision for the first strategic partner. What rightly concerns hon. Members is what happens when that strategic partner changes. It is those provisions that I was describing to the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I only want to explain that a couple of issues, which come together at this juncture, need to be clarified. The shareholding in the strategic partner could change at any time and it could be acquired by interests that are inimical to the British Government. The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham, said that the questions about transfer values and rewarding the residual value of the investment that are made pro tem by the licensee were matters for the future. But that is not necessarily the case. A change in the shareholding of the strategic partner could occur at any time. If the Government had to revoke the licence because of an undesirable change of shareholding, they would need to have a clear view about transfer values, the reward of the residual value of the investment, and so on. The Under-Secretary is wrong to say that an understanding on that does not have to be reached for a long time. It needs to be settled quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My recollection is that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary was referring to the general authority that would be granted to the CAA to govern subsequent licence awards. The first licence will be awarded by the Secretary of State, and we expect it to last for 30 years. That is why the general authority that enables the CAA to award future licences is not immediately relevant. However, I take the right hon. Gentleman's point that there could be a change in the shareholding of the strategic partner at any time and that we have to provide safeguards. Those are in place, and they will be debated later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have been looking through the Bill for the provisions, but I cannot find them. Clause 38 deals with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Directions in interests of national security''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not provide for blocking a change of ownership. Clause 47 refers to the ``Ownership of transferee companies'' that are specified in chapter II. It does cover the possibility of a transfer of shares after the public-private partnership has been established. Clause 49 is about Crown shareholding, but unless that has rights attached to it that are not in the Bill, we have no authority in statute to take the licence away on the basis of an undesirable change in ownership. We want that assurance in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about the way in which the Secretary of State can exercise the controls that are contained in various clauses and provisions of the licence agreement. We shall deal with those in due course.
<P>
A safeguard exists, as I described. The Secretary of State has the power to intervene when there is a change in the shareholding composition of the strategic partner. That is precisely the reason for the provision that we debated on Tuesday on prior notification of any proposed changes in the share composition of the strategic partner. It would enable the Secretary of State to serve the necessary order to prevent change in the shareholding and bring into play the other powers—both statutory and under the draft licence agreement. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am afraid that I am not satisfied. It might be possible for the Secretary of State to serve a notice to prevent such a change in the beneficial ownership of the licensee company, but the ultimate holding company of the operation might be a quoted company on some foreign exchange, so that he would have no say in whether it was taken over. At that point, he would need the power to remove the licence, not simply to serve a notice. All the assets of the business would need to be transferred to another company, presumably of his own choosing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I said, the Secretary of State will have the power to revoke the licence at 24 hours' notice.
<P>
The various elements in the Bill and the licence agreement interact. First, the strategic partner is required to provide information of any proposed change in the shareholding arrangement, enabling the Secretary of State to take a view on it. One of the grounds on which the Secretary of State could make an order would be failure to notify him of such proposed changes.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Make an order to do what?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> To begin the process. The relevant orders are covered by clauses 10 to 14; that is a matter of administration procedures. Subsequently, the licence might be revoked. Clauses 26 and 49 also contain relevant provisions. The arrangement for the golden share would be expanded in the shareholders' agreement, which I have already undertaken to make available to the Committee before we reach chapter II. All of those provisions provide a raft of safeguards.
<P>
The inter-relationships involved are complex, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that safeguards against what he described will exist.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> This is a hugely important matter. National security is clearly the major issue at stake. Of course we are deeply concerned about safety, but the main reason that other countries have not privatised their air traffic control is national security. My hon. Friend has explained—if I am wrong perhaps he will intervene—that the Government would not know about a transfer of the kind we are considering until it had happened; that is in the nature of those transfers. I recall what happened in the British Aerospace sale of Rover to BMW.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the Minister intervening, but I remind him that it is he who is intervening. Will he keep it brief?
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I will, and I will not pursue the point I was making, but my hon. Friend acknowledged that the Government will be dealing with any transfer post the event. Is not that deeply worrying? If, for example, the relevant company was German and then was transferred to a Chinese company, the Government would have to decide whether to revoke the licence on the grounds that it was inappropriate for a Chinese company to have such an interest in the organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can reassure my right hon. Friend. I was talking earlier about commercial considerations, but, in the matter of national security, clause 38 gives the Secretary of State sweeping powers to intervene, to revoke licences and to change arrangements. Powers and safeguards exist for that. We were discussing the rather more complex and difficult matter of commercial considerations, raised by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea and the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> How would the Secretary of State expect the Chinese—or it might be the Japanese—Government to respond to revocation of the licence on the ground that it was inappropriate for the company concerned to be a strategic partner?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not speak for the Chinese Government or any other foreign power. The Government of the day would clearly need to consider the matter. I simply wanted to reassure my right hon. Friend about the existence of the safeguards he wanted for the protection of our national interest in the event of the Government's perceiving a problem arising from change of ownership of the strategic partner. I hope that he accepts that a safeguard exists, but it would clearly be for the Government of the day to make diplomatic decisions about how others might respond to the use of those powers.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have tried to cover in some detail the provisions of the licence and the arrangements for ensuring a safe, economic, reliable and efficient air traffic service. It is true that the possible licence provisions are not limited to those that would be essential or reasonably incidental to the provision of air traffic services. However, I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex will accept my assurance that he need not be alarmed by the breadth of clause 7(1). I do not consider the amendments necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I would have intervened in the Minister's speech again, except that I had intervened so often and it might have been tedious. My remarks now will not be longer than an intervention would have been.
<P>
The Minister has spoken of the complex inter-relation between the conditions of the licence and several clauses in the Bill. He has referred the Committee to clauses 26, 38 and others. It has become clear during the debate that we are discussing something of great importance and concern to the Committee—national security. Will the Minister be so kind as to provide either in writing or orally—I do not expect it now—an explanation of how the matters inter-relate, to satisfy the Committee that if a transfer of shareholdings occurs within the strategic partner, which is regarded as inimical to the Government, the Government will have the power not only to issue a direction, as permitted under clause 38, but to revoke the licence without having to rely on the provisions of the licence alone? The Government would be in a much stronger position to defend such a decision if they relied on primary legislation in doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. Given my comments about the lack of Hansard, it has been useful to go through the points that he has made. This has been one of those debates that stray a little from the amendment because the amendment relates to many aspects of the Bill. I am sure that whatever has been discussed today will save time in future. Our greater understanding will enable us to deal more swiftly with other clauses. We must make fairly rapid progress if we are to deal with the Bill this year.
<P>
I thank the Minister for the draft licence. We understand that it is a draft and that perhaps not everything in it has been tied up, but the Opposition would rather have information with a health warning than none at all. That allows a decent debate.
<P>
The Minister explained clearly about the terms and conditions and discussed the fact that the CAA will be the regulator. Will there be a named individual, such as the company secretary or the chief executive? We often pick up our newspapers and see John Smith, say, named as the electricity regulator. Will it be vested in an individual's name, or in the body corporate?
<P>
Matters such as safety are involved and there are worries, especially about workers in the industry wanting to make their concerns known. The CAA may be well-known in the aerospace industry, but it would be clearer and easier for people concerned about safety to communicate by letter or by fax if a name was attached, either that of the company secretary or of the chief executive.
<P>
We have already discussed the length of the licence. Its detail is governed partly by its duration because major provisions must be made for events that might occur during that period. The definitions were most helpful and important one always strives to discover what people mean.
<P>
I do not have much to say about condition 2. Condition 3(1)(b), on changes to core services and specified services, covers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an actual or anticipated change in the patterns of demand for air traffic services in the Licensed Areas''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain what that means? An air traffic service must be provided to deal with the airspace en route. I may be wrong, but I would not have thought that the infrastructure for 1,000 flights was different for 1,100 flights. Will the Minister say more about patterns of demand and how they might change? I may not be able to envisage factors arising at the top end of a 20 or 30-year licence, but we know that volume will increase and that our geography will be the same.
<P>
We discussed specified service delivery plans the other day, when I intervened to ask whether the document would be public or private. The Minister said that it would be private, and that it would be given to the CAA so that it could consider, in particular, how these services would be provided. Important services are listed on pages 60 and 61 of the draft licence. We have mentioned our old friend the North sea helicopter advisory service on several occasions—hoping that it was over, rather than in, the North sea. One only needs to read through the list to realise how important these services are for the licence.
<P>
The West Drayton centre will be decommissioned, hopefully sooner rather than later, so that Swanwick can come on line. Would that come under condition 5, which deals with the disposal of relevant assets? The condition seems to give control over some assets and the property on which they stand. I do not know what NATS intends to do with the West Drayton centre, but will the Minister tell us whether it would be caught under condition 5 if it wanted to sell it?
<P>
Cross-default obligations come under condition 5(5)(c). A national air traffic service that has an en route and oceanic licence and provides services to a few of our airports, including our most important ones, may want to expand, perhaps in Europe or somewhere else, in line with the hopes and aspirations of Ministers. Will this condition control the company's borrowings regarding such expansion?
<P>
``Cross-default obligation'' is defined as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a term of any agreement or arrangement whereby the Licensee's liability to pay or repay any debt or other sum arises or is increased or accelerated or is capable of arising, increasing or accelerated by reason of a default''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The definition continues by referring to subsidiary companies, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that liability can arise only as the result of a default by a subsidiary of the Licensee . . . the Licensee holds a majority of the voting rights in that subsidiary and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the company were to expand abroad, it would, in all likelihood, be in partnership with—rather than taking over a majority control of—another company, especially if the sensitivities of foreign Governments were involved. In the same way, the United Kingdom Government is sensitive about selling 100 per cent., and about wanting a strategic partner to manage a particular entity. If the new NATS and its strategic partner wished to become involved with an organisation abroad providing air traffic services—especially if that organisation was not performing to the same standard that we were, and needed investment—the company would have to make a capital commitment. However, the bulk of its assets would be tied up in the provision of the key parts of the licence, the en-route services.
<P>
If there were limitations on cross-default obligations, that might limit the company's ability to borrow, to take over, and to engage in business abroad. Is this, therefore, a catch-all? For example, if NATS were to negotiate to take over a local company in Portugal, it might have to inject several hundred million pounds' worth of assets. It would go to its bankers, who would say, ``This is fine, but there are cross-default obligations, which means that you cannot do this because we cannot secure our loans.'' I may have got hold of the wrong end of the stick. I would like further explanation on that matter.
<P>
The Minister made it clear yesterday, on the matter of separate regulatory accounts for separate businesses, that the two regimes—oceanic and en route—will be treated on slightly different terms. We know that NATS will be given the licence in its current form, but that an option exists for there to be two licences in future. I accept that that is separate regulation. As the Irish and other Governments may be involved with the oceanic services, it is common sense to have a degree of transparency and reporting back of figures. I have no worries on that issue.
<P>
The Minister mentioned restrictions on activity and financial ring fencing. I presume that that deals with the possibility of the company using its monopoly position to take over air traffic control services, perhaps at aerodromes, and using its financial strength to knock others out of the market. With regard to availability of resources and control of dividends, the company will be set up and, under the regime, the strategic partner will manage it. Like any company, under the terms of the Companies Act, it will have to make decisions about what its dividend payments will be.
<P>
This condition provides options under which the company will have to certify to the CAA that it has enough capital left to conduct the business. Is this too heavy handed? Any sensible board of directors, especially one that operates within a more general licence regime and has obligations relating to safety, will be concerned to keep capital in the business. This measure seems to constitute a control on dividends. The CAA, as the Government's regulator, could say to the company, ``You cannot pay a dividend this year, or next year, or the year after.'' Will the Minister explain the thinking behind the measure? I may then have further questions.
<P>
The capacity and investment plan is an important aspect of the provisions. It was announced recently that Eurocontrol had added seven more layers by compressing the airspace available to aircraft, and that the turning circle for Heathrow had been reduced from 3 miles to 2.5 miles. Nevertheless, aircraft can still be very far apart. There are two options here. One can increase capacity by squeezing more aircraft into the available airspace, or by investing more. How will the provisions of the licence affect these issues? I presume that the CAA and international agreements would be involved. That would limit the abilities of NATS— beyond being consulted—because under the Bill the CAA will still provide aerospace policy in consultation with NATS and the Secretary of State. However, NATS may have an important view, in that it may be able to say, ``We have the capacity to provide a better service with more aircraft or more layers in the sky.'' Those decisions will be left firmly with the regulator, rather than the management of NATS, who will be able to say what the capacity is, but not to implement it in capacity agreements.
<P>
During a previous sitting, when we discussed service standards, the Minister referred to airprox and CHIRP. I was pleased that he said that some form of performance standards league table is to be considered.
<P>
In respect of collaboration with other service providers, collaboration with the Ministry of Defence is key. The Joint Committee examines those matters.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On secondment of air traffic controllers to the CAA, the Select Committee's recent report on aviation safety expressed concern about the fact that it is difficult to fulfil the CAA's requirement for safety regulation. That is important, because NATS is one of the few sources of personnel—in fact, probably the only source, as they train such people.
<P>
The Government's consultation document discussed the concept of the stakeholder council. So far, however, we have been given no further details about that. Various trade union organisations have said that whatever happens with the new PPP, the stakeholder council will provide the best mechanism for the consultation of trade unions and workers. The consultation document suggested that stakeholders would include airlines and many other users with views about how NATS should carry out its obligations.
<P>
When the licence is agreed, it will be deposited with the CAA in the register, which will be a public document. Those who have complaints, especially about delays or difficulties in respect of an airline, will no doubt go to the regulator, in the form of the CAA. However, they will also be able to access the document, read the terms and conditions and, on the basis of that, make representations to the CAA and NATS. I have not seen anything about the stakeholders council in the Bill or the licence. I would have thought that, as one of the means by which trade unions, airlines and others can have their say, it is an important requirement. Can the Minister tell us more about that?
<P>
As the Minister said, we pay into Eurocontrol, and the licence contains the terms of our national contribution. That is arranged by international treaty. As the Minister said, for oceanic services there is a flat rate. The regulator, through the CAA, will control the industry by agreeing an RPI, with, presumably, a minus figure for efficiency. The Government may negotiate within the Eurocontrol arrangement, and set a fee for the en-route services, which is then given wholly to NATS. Under the licence arrangements in the Bill, the regulator will investigate traffic services and, every five years, will come to an agreement on what will happen. There may be a difference between the amount of money collected by international treaty under the Eurocontrol arrangement and the amount agreed by the regulator for National Air Traffic Services. If so, what will happen to the money? Could it be siphoned off to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and be spent on the Poole harbour bridge or some other worthy project? We want an assurance that if money is available to NATS through international agreement, there will not be any attempt to top-slice fees from the Eurocontrol centre, as long as the regulator decides that the service is being efficiently delivered.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) referred to the formula and to volume. If the overall figures show the volume increasing at, say, 6 per cent., the charging regime, under the formula, could be set assuming an increase in traffic of 5 per cent. Would that be possible, or would a higher or lower volume, after the charges have been set, be a risk that falls on the company? The Minister probably gets my drift and perhaps he will say a little more about that.
<P>
I have raised a number of issues that are causing concern. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea referred to concerns about shareholding in the licence and made a helpful suggestion. The Minister offered to provide Opposition Members with a briefing on the licence. We should like to consider that, because, if it is to be the main point of economic regulation, it would be helpful. I thank the Minister for the transparent way in which we are dealing with the matter, because that is critical to our debate.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for picking me up on that point. The problem must have bedevilled him all his life—[Interruption]. I apologise to him.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That was a slightly slow reaction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee for one minute more than necessary, but I want to reiterate one or two points. The importance of releasing information has been demonstrated, and we have had a good debate on that today and on Tuesday evening. We have emphasised the importance of having the memorandum and articles of association in due course.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Poole referred to the CAA. It is established in statute as a body corporate, but a question arises if it is confined to a purely regulatory function. Her Majesty's inspectorate of railways and the rail regulator are named persons, so should that also apply to the CAA when it is no longer a ``doing'' organisation, but rather a supervisory and regulatory organisation?
<P>
The first of the two substantive points that I want to reiterate concerns condition 19 on the pre-notification of changes in shareholdings, which I have checked again.
<P>
I appreciate the Minister's assurance, and he need not deal with the matter again now, because we shall return to it when we consider clauses 26, 38 or 49. However, neither the Bill nor the licence provides specific authority to revoke the licence on a change of control of the business. That may be implied, but it is not stated. We shall consider tabling an amendment that would provide the Secretary of State with an explicit, statutory right, so that there would be no doubt. If that right cannot be included in the Bill, serious questions arise as to why. This is a very serious matter and we reserve the right to return to it.
<P>
The only point that I would appreciate the Minister explaining fully—I do not think that he has—concerns the ownership of assets on revocation or expiry of the licence, or on a change of licensee. The assets will be owned by the business that holds the licence, and if the licence is revoked and awarded to a new licensee, the assets must be transferred to that licensee. However, where in the Bill are the powers to require or compel the transfer of the assets and, indeed, the employees? I do not understand the mechanics of the process. At 24 hours' notice, the Secretary of State may, under certain conditions, revoke the licence, but might that not prove an empty threat? What is to prevent the company that operates under the licence from saying to the Secretary of State, ``I don't know what you propose to do. We've got the assets, and air traffic control cannot be run without them, so we've got you over a barrel.'' In practice, how will the licence be revoked and the assets recovered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Some very interesting and useful additional points have been made, which require answers. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea said that the Secretary of State should have specific statutory power to revoke a licence, rather than depending on the licence agreement. We believe that present statutory backing provides the safeguard that he seeks, but, as I said, I will write to him explaining the entire procedure. If, having considered that explanation, he still feels that the safeguards are inadequate and wishes to make further representations, opportunities will arise to discuss the matter as our deliberations progress.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked a number of questions, the first of which was answered by his hon. Friend the Member for North Essex. The regulator is a corporate body, although individual members of the CAA are appointed by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has a clear view and is answerable to Parliament in respect of those members, but regulatory responsibility is vested in the corporate body.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole also raised the question of the extent to which changing patterns of demand will affect the service, and asked whether, for example, a change from one aircraft to 1,000 aircraft would make any difference to the necessary infrastructure. Clearly, the arrangements will change. In yesterday's Financial Times, an interesting article, to which he referred, pointed out certain of those changes. Some will simply increase volume, and I can reassure him that the charge control arrangement will reflect changes in volume, but others will involve changes in arrangements. He mentioned height separation, but the article also refers to giving pilots the flexibility to plot their own routes, and the associated potential savings. Those are classic illustrations of the possible impact of operational changes and the need for flexibility.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole also asked whether the assets of West Drayton will covered by condition 5. The answer is yes, and rightly so; they are important. Provisions relate to the assets for the reasons to which the hon. Member for North Essex alluded when he asked about the transfer of a licence. I shall return to that point. The disposal of West Drayton's assets should be part of the regime.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole expressed concern that the controls on borrowing in condition 5 could inhibit the ability of the licensee to operate an effective service. We are not introducing a prohibition but a requirement that the CAA should give permission. That is a necessary safeguard. The CAA must be satisfied that the licensee is not undertaking borrowing on a scale that could risk the maintenance of the services for which it is licensed. If the new organisation decides to expand in an overseas market, it will have to make the case that that is a soundly based proposal. It will have to demonstrate that there will be no adverse impact on the provision of core and specified services, which are subject to regulation. The CAA, which we believe will operate reasonably, will be unlikely to block that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> One definition relates to the control of the company and the ability to dismiss a board, which is part of the regulation and powers of the CAA. That will make a difference if the shareholder has a minority stake in the company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is very much the point. It is a complex matter. We are trying to strike a balance that enables proper regulatory supervision and control without inhibiting commercial freedom. There are tensions. Inevitably, some controls will be seen as unduly bureaucratic. However, if our approach was too light, we would be open to criticism that we had not provided sufficient safeguards.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the control of dividends. The availability of resources condition does not allow the CAA to control dividends, but it requires directors of the licensed entity to demonstrate to the regulator that they have had due regard to the needs of the essential business. Without that control, we run the risk of compromising their ability to perform the key functions because of imprudent financial management. The regulator must have that control. Precise provisions apply when the Secretary of State makes or seeks an order to cover a risk of insolvency or other commercial difficulties that are experienced by the licensee.
<P>
As for the stakeholder council, we intend to make available to the Committee, before we reach consideration of chapter II, the articles of association and the shareholder agreement, which cover that in full.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for that. It means that the stakeholder council will be encompassed in the articles of association and the shareholder agreement. Will that be covered by the Government veto? It appears that, if the company wants to get rid of the stakeholder council, which is not stipulated in the Bill or licence, it could do so if the Government directors on the board were happy with that decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We will discuss the point in detail; it is a complex matter. Government-appointed directors will have specific obligations. They will have a primary loyalty to the company, but they will also have specific obligations to protect the Government's interest. How the overall composition of the board interfaces with the stakeholder council and how it will be able to influence the board's considerations will be discussed in full when the document is before the Committee.
<P>
I have covered everything except the hon. Gentleman's final point about the possible discrepancy between revenue under the Eurocontrol framework and the regulatory regime. He was concerned that funds might be siphoned off or top-„sliced to the benefit of the DETR. If he refers to the algebra that we briefly skated over, he will see that the previous years' performance is taken into account in the framework, providing for adjustment if there is a discrepancy between the original estimate and actual revenue. That can occur when regulatory decisions are made on the basis of estimates but performance turns out to be different.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex raised two fundamental points. He was concerned that the power to revoke a licence on a change of ownership or shareholding was not specific or clear. I undertook to set out in detail the range of powers that are available to cover the eventualities. I also answered the question on national security interests which, although different, require powers of intervention. I shall set out those provisions in writing. When Members have researched how they relate to the licence agreement and the statute, we can consider the matter further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister did not deal with assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is another matter that I intend to set out in full in the paper. Assets are part of the process surrounding of a change of control.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
THE CHAIRMAN, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 607, That the clause stand part of the Bill:—

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 230 in page 5, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) must give priority to the interests of operators and owners of aircraft; owners and managers of aerodromes; persons travelling in aircraft; and persons with rights in property carried in them in the managed area of the United Kingdom, rather than to the interests of users of air traffic services in any area which is outside the United Kingdom.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 231, in page 5, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(e) must take all reasonable steps to consult at an early stage operators and owners of aircraft and owners and managers of aerodromes, on any proposals and plans they have to provide, develop and maintain the system.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am pleased to see the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) in Committee. I hope that he, too, has recovered from his illness.
<P>
Opposition amendments are often at odds with the thrust of Government policy because of our fundamental difference of opinion, but sometimes we have the opportunity to move amendments that are not inimical to the policy, but follow the Government's thinking, attempting to support their proposals. The amendments, which cover different issues, were tabled in that spirit.
<P>
First, I shall speak to amendment No. 231. The Government have made it clear that they are in favour of maximum consultation on the activities of the licence holder. Paragraph 51, on pages 14 and 15 of the Government response, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government recognises that consultation with NATS is a high priority to users and, although the Government believes that NATS has greatly improved its consultative process over recent years, recognises that consultation and the provision of information will be even more important under a PPP than it is at present.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 There can be no question but that the Government are committed to consultation, which will be given a high priority. The amendment is in the spirit of the Minister's earlier remarks. In reference to another matter, he said that it was important that the principle of an issue appeared in statute, but that the detail should be provided elsewhere. Condition 16 of the draft licence makes the Government's intention clear. As the Minister acknowledged, the details should be elsewhere, but there is no reference to the important principle of consultation in the Bill.
<P>
I referred to the draft licence and the importance that the Government attach to it, but as the hon. Member for Poole said earlier, there is another vehicle by which consultation will occur: the proposed stakeholder council. We have not heard much about that during our deliberations, although the Government have set out their views on the stakeholder council in their response to the consultation document. I am delighted that, at the end of paragraph 15 of the response, there is a clear indication of the membership of the stakeholder council and of its aims and objectives. The Government response states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The purpose of the council will be to draw together the stakeholders''—
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
they are specified later—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the partnership and to provide a forum for full and open consultation on the policy and strategies of the company in addressing the issues and challenges it faces.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Members of the Committee would probably support that aim. I hope that the Minister will give some more detail about the Government's intentions for the operation of the stakeholder council.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment is simple; it would put in the Bill the principle of the importance of consultation, while recognising that the details are provided elsewhere. It is also a probing amendment because mature reflection of its precise wording reveals that it is somewhat deficient, as is condition 16. Rather like condition 16, the amendment includes the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``take all reasonable steps to consult at an early stage''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not impose on the licence holder a requitement sufficient to ensure consultation. It would be more appropriate to impose a qualified obligation on NATS to ensure that it takes into account the views of the various users of the services, that there is an absolute requirement for consultation, and to make clear that it is equally important that such consultation is completed in plenty of time before any significant decision is taken. Users inform me that although consultation with NATS on major issues has often taken place, it has not always occurred early enough for them to develop their own views on the issue and to ensure that they are passed on and NATS has had time to reflect on them before important decisions are taken. The timeliness of consultation is important too.
<P>
In the spirit of trying to pursue something to which I know the Government are committed, I hope that the Minister will respond positively, showing a willingness to consider some phraseology on consultation. Perhaps he might also express his willingness to take note of my comments on consultation when re-drafting condition 16 of the licence.
<P>
Amendment No. 230 is in the same spirit as the Government's thinking on the matter, although on mature reflection I am prepared to acknowledge that its wording may be deficient in several ways, not least in respect of our obligations to the European Union. It could be argued, were the amendment as drafted to be accepted, that there could be some difficulty in respect of European competition law. The Minister may therefore want to table his own amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): Does the hon. Gentleman think that his amendment is compatible with the agreements that this country entered in the revised Eurocontrol convention in June 1997?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I have already referred to the fact that, on mature reflection, and on advice from several people, I have realised the difficulties on basic European Union competition law. Nevertheless, it is worth reflecting that the Government are worried about the matter. I refer to their response to the consultation, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``respondents urged the Government to build in safeguards to ensure that:
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>—NATS did not lose focus on its main business, and
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>—there would be no cross-subsidy from the core monopoly business to contestable activities and any new business ventures.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The great play that the Government make of that in their consultation response suggests that it is a matter of some concern to them.
<P>
We have already heard from the Minister today, and understand entirely, that the draft licence includes reference to the issue of cross-subsidy, but that is solely with respect to the implications for competition. It does not relate to ensuring that the core functions of NATS will have priority. It is important for the Bill to specify, certainly in some other wording than I have proposed, that the core business must be the prime function of NATS.
<P>
We know, for example, that NATS already estimates that it needs something like £1 billion in investment in the next 10 years. That investment will be important in keeping NATS capable of providing the service that we expect from it. There should not be a tendency to divert some of the intended investment into new activities. The Under-Secretary several times stressed that it was important for NATS to look for other business opportunities and I am concerned that attention and investment might begin to be focused on developing those new businesses and that much-needed investment in the core business might be cut.
<P>
I have raised two rather different issues, both, I think, along the lines of the Government's thinking. However, I should prefer them to be dealt with on the face of the Bill, not merely in the other bits of paper that we have before us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have some sympathy for the hon. Member for Bath, who is not the first person to discover that a quite innocuous legislative proposal, designed to secure the interests of the travelling public in our country, falls foul of some general provision of a foreign statute that has been imposed on us and about which we have no choice. A classic example is the airport departure tax, which we argue should not, in the case of a return flight, be applied to the return journey. It is not applied to a return flight from Europe, but the European Commission has told us that a departure from Glasgow airport returning to London is another departure in the United Kingdom and that the airport departure tax must be applied twice to internal flights. That makes things difficult for the new low-cost airlines. Adding £20 to a £30 ticket makes it less of a low-cost airline. Nevertheless, that is all in the interest of some greater good that we do not really understand.
<P>
A real question arises in this vein with respect to the matter we are discussing; in whose interests is our national air traffic control system to be operated? It is called National Air Traffic Services. Perhaps the name itself will be ruled out of order by some foreign court.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> It should be not NATS but EATS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The term Eurocontrol takes on a new and more sinister meaning. The hon. Gentleman has, albeit inadvertently, stumbled on a quite serious issue, to which we have alluded before.
<P>
We should like some statutory obligation on the licence holder to consult the people affected by its services in the way suggested. I did not imagine that a stakeholder council would cover that. It is never very clear, from they way they are used, what these new words mean. I understood a stakeholders' council to be for the representatives of the staff and employees of the business. Perhaps I was wrong about that. If there is a deficiency in the amendments it is that there is no provision for such consultation. The business of NATS is greatly dependent on its employees' professionalism and full involvement.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a limit to the number of conversations that the Chairman can listen to at one time, and he prefers to listen to the hon. Gentleman who has the floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am flattered, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I understand that the Government intend the members of the stakeholder council to be the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the strategic partner, NATS management, airspace users, the airports, the Ministry of Defence and staff representatives. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that much more clarification is needed about the proposed composition of the body, not least because of confusion about why, for example, the strategic partner would have more places than NATS management?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are demonstrating the inadequacy of new Labour language, which is more to do with marketing and packaging than with policy. We need to understand the purpose of the stakeholder council. Is it perhaps just to be a mélange of people to be patted on the head from time to time? I hope that there will be an opportunity later to debate the composition of the council, which is clearly very important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I cannot see how amendment No. 230 is compatible with what this country has already agreed in the revised Eurocontrol convention of 17 June 1997. We expressly agreed an extension of the powers of Eurocontrol. That was nothing to do with the European Union. It is a free association of independent sovereign states. There was agreement on majority voting. What is the Government's view on the matter? There was a clear statement that co-operation should be extended, and that only in cases of national security would individual states be allowed to hold up the decisions of a majority of Eurocontrol member states.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The hon. Member for Bath mentioned the stakeholder council and I am slightly concerned, although I know that the Minister will provide more information. I had the impression that Uncle Tom Cobley and all were being included. I wondered why the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions needed to be on the stakeholder council.
<P>
One of the key points raised about the stakeholder council in the consultation document was the question of a guarantee of some kind of security for employees of the business. When I read this, my first concern was that the presence there of all those bodies such as airlines would dilute the employees' input. I do not necessarily want an answer today, but when we debate this later with respect to shareholder agreements that will be a relevant concern. We do not want a vast amorphous body in which everyone has their place and which discusses nothing. We want the right vehicle to provide reassurance for the employees. That might not be a broad-based body, but perhaps something more specifically designed for their purposes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the hon. Member for Bath suggested, we shall debate this later. I appreciate that matters are inter-related in any Bill, and I have tried hard to allow hon. Members a reasonable amount of leeway, but I think that we need to discuss that matter later.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had a wide-ranging debate, and I shall follow your guidance, Mr. Gale, by restricting my remarks to the amendments and clause 8. I hope that hon. Members will understand if I resist the temptation to be drawn further on the stakeholder council and shareholder agreement, which will be made available before we reach the relevant part of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 230, tabled by the hon. Member for Bath, would give the licence holder an additional duty, which would require him, in performing his duties, to put the interests of operators, owners and managers of aircraft and aeroplanes, and the passengers and property carried by them within the UK-managed area, above those from outside the UK-managed area. Although the hon. Gentleman's patriotism does him credit, I am delighted that he has had the opportunity for mature reflection on the implications of the amendment because it would be unfortunate if he were to press it to a vote.
<P>
We expect foreign air traffic service providers to provide services to UK aircraft in exactly the same non-discriminatory way as we provide services to foreign aircraft, and an international framework for air traffic must depend on that basic principle. Therefore, whether it is put forward by the hon. Gentleman for patriotic motives or put forward in a slightly more Eurosceptic way by other Opposition Members, any suggestion that we should discriminate in favour of British operators and against others would be disastrous in terms of the future of international air traffic services, which must depend on a level playing field for operators from this country overseas, with the quid pro quo for foreign operators in the area that we oversee.
<P>
Amendment No. 231 sets out a requirement for the licence holder to consult owners and operators of aircraft and aerodromes regarding plans and proposals for providing, developing and maintaining the system. As hon. Members will appreciate, those are operational matters, and the Government believe that the obligations should be made clear in the operating licence—they are covered in condition 16 and condition 10 of the draft licence. Condition 10 sets out the detailed issues that must be covered in the capacity and investment plan that the licensee must produce, which is subject to the duty of consultation. I hope that, on mature reflection, the hon. Gentleman will realise that that is thoroughly covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the Minister comment on two specific points? Does he agree that it is important that the requirement for consultation should be absolute and not qualified? Secondly, does he believe that there should be a qualified obligation to take into account the views of NATS' users in reaching any material decision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There is a clear and unambiguous obligation to consult under condition 16. Under condition 10, there is an absolute requirement that the licensee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall take into account the views of users in accordance with Condition [16]''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so I hope that hon. Gentleman wilI see that his expectation of an unambiguous and unqualified obligation to consult and to take into account the views of users is already provided.
<P>
The draft licence is a legal document—the basis on which the operation will work and enforcement will take place. If we had any doubt about the ability to enforce the document, we would not proceed in this way. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman's concerns about the commitment to consultation.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman expressed some concern—as I am also about to do—that the wording of the amendment was possibly defective. He wondered whether the phrase ``take all reasonable steps'' was adequate. I put it to him that that phrase is fundamental to clause 8. We believe that it is adequate to define the obligations, to ensure that the system is efficient and co-ordinated, and that demand for services within an area is met. That is a clear indication that we regard the phrase ``take all reasonable steps'' as a proper obligation. With any matter of this sort, if people are concerned that obligations are not being met, there is a range of remedies, including legal action and judicial review. We have not gone ahead with this lightly. We have specified the matters that should be the subject of consultation and we have required the licence holder to have regard to the views of the people whom it consults. That is more than adequate, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his responses. I am delighted that we will have an opportunity later in the debate to discuss the issues surrounding the establishment of the stakeholder council. With the wording of the amendment and the phrase ``take all reasonable steps'', the present construction does not make the duty to consult an absolute requirement—an issue on which the Minister said that he agreed with me—but this is becoming a semantic argument because the wording in condition 16 is different. On mature reflection, the Minister might agree with me about why I thought the amendment was defective, not the other way around. However, rather than asking the Committee to enter into such deliberations, which I am sure would stretch your patience, Mr. Gale, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 155, in page 5, line 40, leave out subsection (2).

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The Bill is not the easiest to understand. On occasions, one reads and re-reads it five times and asks oneself what it means. The genesis of amendment No. 155 was clause 8(2), which provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A licensed area is an area in respect of which the licence authorises its holder to provide air traffic services.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Now that we have seen the licence, that makes more sense because the licence defines the areas more closely. Initially, we thought that this was one of those parts of the Bill that said, ``This means this because this means this'', but the key element is the licence.
<P>
We tabled the amendment to give us the opportunity to discuss the specified services, and the Minister should see it in that vein. Because the matters are not in the Bill, we have had to table amendments to get more information and discuss issues more fully. We propose that there should be another schedule to the Bill, which should contain the matters to be included in the licence. The specified services are very important ones.
<P>
In the draft licence, there are core services and specified services. Within six months of the licence being granted, a specified service plan will be provided to the CAA. The new company will undertake to set out its plans for meeting its objectives, presumably with a separate plan for each service. How detailed will the plans be?
<P>
The CAA and NATS are to be integrated. Actions may be taken for no clear reason; the reasons may then have to be discovered. What protections will there be in the specified service plans for service users? Airlines and other users of a national air traffic service will expect a certain level of provision.
<P>
There is a regime for the modification of the licence. If a whole service were to be changed or transferred—we used the example of another body taking on the job of the North sea helicopter advisory service the other day—the licence would be modified. As another example, NATS might provide under one of the specified headings a service that included a telephone line, but then decided that it was unnecessary. How much detail would have to be provided to the CAA? The telephone line might not be important to NATS because of the employment cost, but it might be important to a user. Will such a matter not be covered by the modification regime, or will each of the specified service plans have to list services including key areas, stating that alterations to areas must be referred to the CAA?
<P>
There is always a question of balance about how much detail to include. Minor elements of service provision that somebody gets used to may be the most irritating for them to lose. How specific will the specified services be and what will they cover? We know what would happen if a major specified service changed—it would have to be referred to a modification procedure. Whether an aspect of a service that changed had to be referred to the CAA would depend on how core it was to the service.
<P>
In a past life, I served on a county council. One might have been able to save tuppence-ha'penny by restricting library opening hours, but letters, angst and hassle from the articulate middle class usually resulted. A minor change may often cause disproportionate concern.
<P>
I initially thought that we had the wording of the amendment right, but I think now that the Bill might be better, not only because of the question of the transfer of a service but because services that should be specified might not yet be included—they might only come into being during the term of a 30-year licence. Technology, or changes in service provision, may cause the development of an integral feature, becoming an important part of the licence only after 10 years.
<P>
It is currently possible to specify within a licence certain services that we know to be important. A service may develop gradually from being minimal and not requiring addition to the licence. A technological change might then take it beyond critical mass, making it a keystone. At what point would the CAA make it a specified service, requiring a modification arrangement? There is a procedure by which the CAA may agree a change with the licence holder, subject to the Secretary of State's approval. I presume that that would apply in such a situation. In a review of the company's operations, it would become clear that an aspect of the service had developed and become so key that a change to the licence was critical.
<P>
How detailed must the specified service plans be? What redress will a service user who felt that quality had been reduced have? Will there be performance indicators for the services? Regarding the possibility for change over 10 or eight years, at what point will the modification procedure kick off? Is that simply a matter of common sense in the regulation?

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman rightly noted, amendment No. 155 was clearly written before the draft licence was made available, and was obviously intended to seek clarity on licence issues. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for having explained that, and I hope that he accepts that it is not necessary as the licence provisions meet the need.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 167 and 166 concern new schedule 1. As the hon. Gentleman explained, they would list the air traffic services to be provided by the licence holder. As he recognised, the effect would be to enshrine in legislation many air traffic services as defined specified services. Although it might be felt appropriate so to define a service now, it might not be felt appropriate in the years ahead. Such rigidity is not appropriate in a dynamic market in which there will inevitably be changes in technology and service provision.
<P>
The problem is not simply that new services will be developed. Existing ones may not need to be so defined because they may not be appropriate to the provision of a monopoly service—only monopoly services need be defined. We are currently considering the list and discussing it with interested parties to learn whether activities may be contested and so not retained as monopoly services. One example is the production of the UK aeronautical information service. That is why we believe that flexibility, which is possible under the licence framework, is better than defined services.
<P>
A further problem is that the core services—the en-„route air traffic control, advisory and terminal approach services—would not be covered by new schedule 1. Curiously, the licensee would be required to provide the specified, but not the core, services. I cannot believe that that was the intention of the hon. Member for Poole, and I hope that he recognises that that would be an undesirable outcome. We should rely on the Bill's provision and on the licence agreement, rather than implement the proposed changes.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised other interesting questions about how precise the specification will be—he asked whether changes to a telephone line might need approval. That was an illustration of an absurd extreme. There must be a balance. The fundamental issues must be referred to the CAA, but we want NATS to be free to determine detailed matters without a complex bureaucratic framework. We are determined that matters crucial to users should be covered by the specified services delivery plan and be subject to reference to the CAA. Obviously, we cannot define that in perpetuity. The role of the regulator will be vital, given that moving field. The CAA, with its expertise, will be able to keep the subject under review.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt adequately with the points raised by the hon. Gentleman and with the weakness of the amendments and I urge him to withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I should like to raise two matters on the Government's overall approach. The first is the new Scottish centre. Condition 10 of the proposed NATS licence agreement refers to capacity and investment plans. I welcome the fact that it refers specifically to the Swanwick and Prestwick area. As my hon. Friend the Minister will know, anxiety has been expressed that, with privatisation, the new company would reconsider the need for the new Scottish centre. Technology moves forward very quickly; there will be a quantum advance in the air traffic control service when the Swanwick operation comes on stream. May we take it that the Government will ensure that anyone who becomes a strategic partner will be committed to providing a new Scottish centre and that the licence holder agreement will be part of it? A two-centre strategy was the previous Government's policy. Is it this Government's policy? The matter is important, not just in terms of safety but on military grounds, too.
<P>
My second question to my hon. Friend relates to the service currently provided by NATS to the pilots of smaller private planes who, when they go into controlled air space, are encouraged to clock on with NATS, which is a free service. I apologise if the matter is referred to in the draft agreement, which I have not seen yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith:</B> Does my right hon. Friend recognise that other air users are involved, such as microlight flyers and others who take free advantage of the air traffic services provided at present?
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There are many reasons why the aviation community is against the policy, one of which is the tremendous support and appreciation of what is currently provided by NATS. My question is whether there will be a requirement for the new NATS to continue to provide the service free—I emphasise the word ``free''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> First, I take the issue of the new Scottish centre. I say to my right hon. Friend that it has been a clear commitment of the Government that that operation will proceed on the basis of the two centre-strategy. That is an absolute commitment and I assure him that when he sees the shareholder agreement that relates to it, which I have already undertaken will be made available to the Committee before we discuss chapter II of this part of the Bill, he will understand how we are ensuring that there will be continued compliance with the two-centre strategy.
<P>
I hope that it was a slip by my right hon. Friend when he referred to his concern that, with privatisation, the strategy might be put at risk; under the public-private partnership, the two-centre strategy will remain in place. I do not know what would have happened had the Conservative party had its way with its proposals for an alternative privatisation.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I had not expected to be so well entertained, but I remember a Minister, the right hon. Member for Hamilton, North and Bellshill (Dr. Reid), who is now the Secretary of State for Scotland, referring to ``this privatisation'' when he gave evidence to the Select Committee on Transport. It was not a slip of the tongue by the right hon. Gentleman; he spoke the truth.
<P>
The Minister has given a welcome and full assurance of the Government's commitment to the Scottish centre. One reason for raising the matter now is that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh might want to ask why there is not an assurance on that matter in the Bill. In what circumstances does the Minister think there would not be a Scottish centre in the period of the licence fee, albeit that it is 30 years? The right hon. Gentleman might want to know about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have given a clear and categorical assurance to my right hon. Friend and he has accepted that. I do not see the need to explore further the question of what additional material should be in the Bill. We have discussed this morning and previously the balance between the Bill, the licence agreement and the shareholder agreement. There will be differences of opinion about that, but, as I have already stressed, we see the documents as interlocking.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members may leave their papers in the Room if they wish. The doors will be locked between now and 2.30.
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
