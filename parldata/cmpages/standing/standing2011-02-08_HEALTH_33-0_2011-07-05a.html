amendments relate to the Secretary of State’s mandate to the
commissioning board and I will address them thematically, starting with
amendments 60, 62 and 64. Amendments 60 and 62 make it clear that the
Secretary of State’s mandate to the commissioning board will be
a multi-year document, rather than be issued afresh each year. The
amendments are a response to concerns raised during the listening
exercise, particularly by the British Medical Association. We intend
the mandate to allow the board to plan effectively over the medium and
long term. Where possible, we want the mandate to cover a three-year
period, although that will depend on other factors, such as the
spending review
cycle.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000022">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
64 is about involving patients and the public. The Future Forum
emphasised the importance of involving patients and the public in
decision making, which we strongly support. We tabled the amendment to
make it explicit that, in setting the mandate for the board, the
Secretary of State must consult HealthWatch
England.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
remainder of the amendments in this group relate to financial matters
affecting the board. Amendments 61, 63 and 66 will require
the Secretary of State to specify annually, as part of the mandate, the
capital and revenue resource allocations that will be made to the board
under the amendments proposed to clause 20. Under standard Government
accounting practice, spending allocations and spending limits are
framed in terms of the use of resources, to take account of spending
commitments that fall across a number of financial years; it is
therefore the primary means by which budgets are set in the NHS. The
Secretary of State’s ability to alter those resource limits will
continue to be restricted: he will be able to alter them only with the
board’s agreement or in exceptional circumstances. If he does
so, the mandate will need to be revised and laid before Parliament,
along with an explanation for the
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments will remove the requirement for the mandate to specify the
cash allocation for the board. That is because the board’s cash
allocation in a given year will be dependent on its resource
commitments and its spending plans for the coming year against the
limits set in the mandate. The board’s cash allocation and
related limits on cash expenditure will therefore be more difficult to
predict at the time the mandate is published, and will be more likely
to change for perfectly legitimate
reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
65 and 79 reflect the revised time scale we have set for the
establishment of the commissioning board following the listening
exercise. As we set out in our responses to the listening exercise, the
commissioning board will be established as a non-departmental public
body next year in order to begin the establishment and authorisation of
clinical commissioning groups, but it will not take on its full
financial responsibilities until April 2013. It is therefore no longer
necessary to make special provision for the period up to the start of
the first full financial year in which the commissioning board
operates. Amendments 65 and 79, therefore, remove subsection (9) of new
section 13A and subsection (5) of new section 13O of the National
Health Service Act 2006, inserted by the clause, to reflect
the fact that the first mandate and the board’s first business
plan will be for the period beginning April 2013.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000029">&#160;</a>

purpose and objectives. I hope that he will be able to answer today
but, if he cannot, that he will write to me.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If we are to
have the system the Government propose—I preface my remarks with
that—it is a good idea to have the mandate that the Secretary of
State gives the board cover more than one year, to give the NHS board
and the NHS as a whole the ability to plan longer term. It is also
right that the board will consult HealthWatch on the mandate, although
we have already raised concerns about the degree to which HealthWatch
will be independent, but does HealthWatch have to agree to the mandate?
Will its view on the mandate be published and made freely available?
Does the board have to respond publicly to any concerns or views raised
by HealthWatch?<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My second set
of questions relates to when the NHS board is to be established.
According the Government’s response to the Future Forum, the NHS
commissioning board will be established part way through 2012-13, but
its first mandate and business plan will relate to 2013-14. What will
the board do in the intervening year? How will Parliament hold the
board to account? If the board’s first mandate from the
Secretary of State will be for 2013-14 but the board is established the
year before, what will it be doing and how will it be held to account
for its actions by Parliament?<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000034">&#160;</a>

questions, he will see where I am going with this.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the right
hon. Gentleman will be aware, several organisations, including the NHS
Confederation, have raised concerns about the role of the board in the
interim, before clinical commissioning groups are up and running. It
will be commissioning services for clinical commissioning groups that
are not yet ready to take on their responsibilities and it will
obviously be going through a process of authorising those groups, but I
am not clear how Parliament will hold the board to account if it does
not get its first mandate until a year after it has been
established.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What will
Parliament’s role be in scrutinising the mandate? During the
previous Committee debates, the Minister told my hon. Friend the Member
for Islington South and Finsbury that Parliament will get a chance to
discuss the mandate. Will he confirm that that will take place
annually? Will Parliament be able to vote on the mandate? Will be the
mandate be scrutinised by the Select Committee on Health or the Public
Accounts Committee? Simply publishing the mandate is insufficient;
Members of Parliament should be able to discuss and scrutinise
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My third
series of questions is about the amendments that now make it clear that
the Secretary of State has to specify capital and revenue within the
overall allocation to the board. That is standard Treasury practice, so
unless I am mistaken—which I may well be—why did the
Government not think about that the first time around? Why are they now
tabling a series of amendments to specify the capital and revenue
allocations to the board and stating that the board will have to do the
same for consortia? What discussions did the Department 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 204<a class="bkMark" name="Column204">&#160;</a>
                  </div>have with the Treasury about that? Why has it taken the Government so
long to realise that that is part of the Treasury’s standard
accounting practice?<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000039">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> To deal with the last question first, the
straightforward answer is because we spent more than eight weeks
listening and consulting on how to strengthen and improve the Bill, and
we decided in the light of that exercise that here was an opportunity
to make improvements and to strengthen the Bill. That is why we are
doing this now.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked whether HealthWatch would have to agree to what is in the
mandate. The answer is no. She asked whether the response of
HealthWatch would be published. That is not required, but it can
publish if it wishes to. She asked whether the board would respond
publicly to what HealthWatch said. The answer is no, but the standard
practice is to respond to the consultation, so one can assume that, as
part and parcel of the consultation exercise as a whole, there will be
a published response.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked about accountability, but I will leave that for now and return to
it when I discuss accountability of the commissioning board, because in
some ways it is part and parcel of the same answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked what the commissioning board will do from October 2012, when it
is set up in shadow form, and particularly what it will be doing in
financial year 2012-13 before it becomes fully established in April
2013. As she knows, the board will be established formally as an
independent statutory body by October 2012 to start to authorise
clinical commissioning groups and carry out preparatory functions. The
purpose of having the board in place in shadow form for a long period
is to provide clear leadership and capacity for the development of the
new commissioning systems. The chief executive designate of the NHS
commissioning board, Sir David Nicholson will set out how the role of
the board is developing, although final decisions will be taken by the
board itself once it is formally established. It will be accountable to
the Secretary of State for the functions that it exercises during that
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked why the Bill does not require Parliament to approve the Secretary
of State’s mandate to the board. We have discussed that before,
but let me try to reassure her. The process of setting the mandate is
already transparent and accountable and sits within the wider framework
of increased parliamentary scrutiny. For the first time, the objectives
will be developed transparently through public consultation; the
Secretary of State is required to consult the board, HealthWatch
England and other appropriate persons. We are proposing an amendment to
include HealthWatch England specifically in that consultation process,
because of the responses that we received from the Future Forum, to
ensure that arrangements for patient, carer and public involvement are
not only genuine and meaningful, but built into all levels of the
health and well-being system. The mandate may be changed only by
agreement, as she knows, or in special circumstances. Any changes have
to be published and laid before Parliament with an explanation of the
reasons for the change.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Not only must
the board publish its plans for how it intends to meet the requirements
of the mandate, but it must report at the end of each year on how it
has performed. The Department of Health then has to set 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 205<a class="bkMark" name="Column205">&#160;</a>
                  </div>out its own assessment of the board’s performance and lay that
before Parliament. To my mind, and I hope the hon. Lady agrees, that
all strengthens accountability to Parliament and to members of the
public for how taxpayers’ money is spent and what is delivered
in return.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000045">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">There
will be a significant number of opportunities within the parliamentary
process for bodies to be held to account for that information, those
actions and those duties. For example, they can be debated in
Parliament. The hon. Lady asks whether there will be a vote; that
depends on the motions and the procedures used in Parliament to debate
them. For example, the Government could—I use the conditional
tense because we are so far away that I do not know the answer
yet—have a stand-alone debate on those matters either on a
motion for the Adjournment which, as the hon. Lady knows, would not
require a vote at the end, or on a substantive motion, which
would.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
the Opposition of the day would—could—be able to hold an
Opposition day debate, after which there almost certainly would be a
vote because the Opposition would table a motion in such a way that
there would be a vote unless the Government of the day agreed with
their motion. There can be other debates which, depending on the forum,
could lead to a vote. There could be an hour-and-a-half debate
instigated by a right hon. or hon. Member in Westminster Hall, which
would not require a vote; or a debate on the Floor of the House could
be granted by the Backbench Business Committee, which, I understand, is
keen that such debates should take place on a substantive motion that
leads to a vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Other
opportunities for holding to account, either for the matter in its
entirety or for individual aspects of it, are Health questions,
Adjournment debates whether at the end of the evening on the Floor of
the House or in Westminster Hall, and other questions. The
opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny and accountability are immense
and should meet the concerns of all hon. Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me expand
on Parliament’s role in relation to the commissioning board in
2012-13, when it is in its shadow form and getting ready to perform its
functions from April 2013. The hon. Lady asked how the board will be
held to account during that period. Apart from what I have said,
because there is nothing to stop questions being asked in Parliament
during that period, Parliament will be able to hold the board to
account for its work through the usual ways that I have described. The
Health Committee, which the hon. Lady mentioned, can call anyone to
give evidence and can hold hearings on any aspect of the Department of
Health and the NHS, so, yes, it will be able to hold inquiries into
the commissioning board and call in evidence from the
relevant people on the mandate, the commissioning board and the NHS in
general.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000049">&#160;</a>

Minister has concluded, Dr Mc Crea, but at this stage I would simply
like to ask him about the money that is allocated to the board and for
which it will have responsibility during its shadow period. How much
money will the Government give the board to do its work in 2012-13 and
how much money will the board 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 206<a class="bkMark" name="Column206">&#160;</a>
                  </div>itself be responsible for? The Public Accounts Committee will be very
concerned about that, as it is responsible in Parliament for
determining whether Government money is properly
spent.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000050">&#160;</a>

that at this stage it is premature to put pound figures to those sums.

               <p class="tabbed">To conclude
on that point, Sir David Nicholson, who, as the hon. Lady knows, is the
chief executive of the NHS and the chief executive designate of the
commissioning board, will already at that stage be the formal
accounting officer for the commissioning board. He can be held to
account as such in that role, which makes him accountable for the
commissioning board.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000052">&#160;</a>

question of the money, I am right; I cannot give the hon. Lady a
definitive figure at this stage, because it is too soon. I can tell

the board will not start commissioning until the financial year

become a misnomer, for which the hon. Lady has been, at times, famous.
What I said was that it was difficult at this stage and premature to
give the hon. Lady a definitive figure. I said that she had to bear in
mind that there will be a limited budget only as the commissioning will
not commence until 2013-14. That puts the whole situation in a slightly

definitive figure. Hospitals, primary care trusts and GPs are being
given definitive figures about how much they can spend, but the
national commissioning board is not. He says that the budget will be
limited, but limited to what? Will it be £10 million, £20
million or £140 million, like Monitor? Perhaps he would like to

explain this to the hon. Lady, because I do not think that she fully

not be commissioning, so only very limited amounts of money will be
made available to it. Nor will the commissioning board in 2012-13 be
allocating funding to the clinical commissioning groups. The money in
2012-13 will continue—as it does this year, and as it did last
year—to be used to commission care through the primary care
trusts. That is why the commissioning board will not be getting the
money during that period, and why it is difficult at this stage to give

other roles will it take on? How much money is being spent on the NHS
commissioning board? It is astonishing that the Government do not have
even a rough estimate of how much that is going to cost or how they
will be held to account for delivering it by the Public Accounts
Committee. That is a major gap in the Government’s proposals. I
think the Treasury would be interested to know that they have no idea
how much the shadow national board will cost to run.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Minister wrote to me to specify the precise functions that the shadow
NHS commissioning board will have in 2012-13, how many staff it will
employ and how it will be held to account by Parliament, including by
the Public Accounts Committee, we might have greater reassurance that
the Government have got a grip on the Department’s
spending.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I should be
grateful if the Minister specified where in the Future Forum response
people are clamouring for the precise allocations of capital and
revenue for the board and the consortia. He said that the Government
did not include such measures in the previous legislation, but they
have spent eight weeks listening and that is what people told them they
wanted. I may be wrong, but I cannot remember reading in any of the
Future Forum reports that a major concern with the Bill was that the
board and consortia did not have specific capital and revenue
allocations. He might have been more convincing if he had said that the
Treasury was worried that it was not in the Bill, because it was
concerned that the Government did not have a good grip on the
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000063">&#160;</a>

beginning to make heavy weather of this. She must understand that
during the listening process it was not only the Future
Forum going out and meeting all kinds of people in the NHS and the
health economy to get their views, but Ministers as well. Ministers
continued to meet other people to discuss and reflect on how to
strengthen and improve the Bill. The hon. Lady’s point about the
finances flowed from that. We concluded that it was an area in which we
could improve the measure, and it was obvious that we should do so
after the listening process, because the Bill was to be recommitted,
which gave us an opportunity to strengthen it in a wide range of areas.
It is no big deal. It is simply an
improvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000064">&#160;</a>

it is premature at this point to give an answer. However, as she knows,
the board will be established as a special health authority later this

wonder if he can answer that question. No. The Minister is not able to
answer. He said that the board will begin to authorise clinical
commissioning groups in October 2012. If the Minister cannot
say whether any clinical commissioning groups will be
authorised before then, they will not be, so none will have any

requiring them, when exercising their functions, both to act with a
view to securing the provision of health services in a way that
promotes the NHS constitution, and to promote awareness of

That means not only would they need to have regard to the constitution
and promote awareness of it, including making people aware of their
rights, but they would need to act with a view to securing health
service provision that promotes the principles, rights,
responsibilities and values of the constitution. That may be through

CCGs and the board must consider how to build the constitution into
their work on patient and public involvement. The board could also
discharge the duty by highlighting areas of the constitution of
particular relevance to the content of the commissioning guidance that
it can issue to clinical commissioning groups under new section 14V of
the 2006 Act. The new duties will be additional to the existing duty
under the Health Act 2009 to “have regard” to the NHS
constitution, which will be applied to the board and CCGs by virtue of

about the strength of different words, such as act “with a view
to” or “with regard to”. Last week in Committee,
the Government admitted that the duty of the Secretary of State to
deliver a comprehensive health service was not strong enough in the
original Bill, so they removed some phrases such as act “with a
view to”. We still do not think that they have gone far enough,
but they have removed those words in an attempt to strengthen the duty.
Yet amendment 67 states that the board
must<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“act
with a view to securing that health services are provided in a way
which promotes the NHS
Constitution”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000335">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have to choose one way or the other—either the
wording of the Bill matters and needs to be strong and clear, or it
does not. It is a pity that the Government’s amendments are not
stronger. More importantly, there is the practical question of how we
will know that both the board and the clinical commissioning groups are
doing what they are supposed to be doing. How will we know that they
are acting with a view to securing services, promoting the constitution
and promoting awareness of the
constitution?<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to give a specific example. The NHS constitution introduces a
clear right to non-emergency treatment within a maximum of 18 weeks.
The other day, the Prime Minister made much of saying that he will not
let waiting lists rise, but we know that the number of people waiting
longer than 18 weeks for treatment has started to rise. We debated that
last week. Unfortunately, you missed it, Dr McCrea; I am sure you are
sorry about that. The Government claimed that average waiting times
were falling, but they did not address the issue of those waiting more
than 18 weeks, which is what the NHS constitution is
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Written
evidence submitted yesterday by the Patients Association outlined clear
evidence that waiting times are rising for many patients. The number of
calls to its helpline, from patients and health care professionals
concerned about access to elective surgery, has risen considerably
between 2010 and 2011. The Patients Association has reported that, in
the first six months of this year, concerns about waiting times for
elective surgery represented 18% of the calls to its helpline, which is
more than double the proportion in 2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000097">&#160;</a>

performance managed to ensure that they hit those targets? It is all
very well for the Minister to say that the constitution is enshrined in
law, but if no one is collecting the data and no one is performance

                  </strong> The hon. Lady raises both an interesting and a
rather important point. We believe, as the amendments reflect, that it
is important that patients, individuals, patient groups, and so on, are
familiar—far more familiar than they may be now—with the
NHS constitution, because we think it is extremely important.
Effectively, it has to be ensured that people become aware of it. Part
of that, I am afraid, will be an educational process, because far too
many people have been unaware of the NHS constitution since it came
into place; that is partly why the amendments would create a duty to
promote it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked how that would happen. To give the background, the amendments are
designed to place an additional legal duty on the commissioning board
and the CCGs to promote the constitution, by requiring them to exercise
all their functions, and to act “with a

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
would be a duty to promote the constitution by requiring the
commissioning board and CCGs, when exercising all their functions, to
act “with a view” to securing that health services are
provided in a way that promotes the constitution, and it would be
required that awareness of the constitution be promoted among patients,
members of the public and staff. For example, that would include making
patients aware of their right under the constitution to access services
within maximum waiting times, or the NHS taking all reasonable steps to
offer a range of alternative providers if that is not
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We would
therefore expect that if someone has waited for 18 weeks, the NHS, at
local level, will ensure that alternative providers are offered to
honour that pledge, so that patients get the treatment they require. It
could be done through commissioning arrangements with providers, and
through the commissioning board’s commissioning guidance for
CCGs. In that way, we believe that the Bill will reinforce and
strengthen the enduring values and principles of the health service. It
will fully embed the constitution in how the NHS works, empowering
patients and the public.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000109">&#160;</a>

aware of their right under the constitution to access services within
maximum waiting times, more patients would become aware of it; I

respond.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000110">&#160;</a>

operations—they were waiting more than two years for operations
in 1997. I do not want to get into a huge other debate, but I want it

national health service and its future is an important issue. I am
concerned about the sloganeering that one hears during elections, which
is repeated on doorsteps, being the basis for making serious policy
changes to the national health service. I am forced to get to my feet
because the Minister continues to bandy around such phrases as,
“We’ve got rid of politically motivated targets.”
That may sound good on the front pages of the <em>Daily Mail</em>, but
can he come up with any examples? I suspect that he knows that I wanted

It is fair to say that targets are a crude mechanism for driving down
waiting times. That can be a good thing. However, would the hon. Lady
accept that there is a problem with targets? Very often with the
arbitrary A and E waiting targets, setting a four-hour wait time means
that someone with potentially serious symptoms becomes a lower priority
than someone who is closer to that four-hour wait time. That is a
clinical experience and the reality in many A and Es because many
patients end up being bypassed from A and E to an admissions unit
without being seen by a
doctor.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000142">&#160;</a>

way of dealing with a problem, in that it directly impacts on patients

constitution; it is about a culture and working with those targets. I
do not agree with the hon. Gentleman’s evidence about A and E
waiting times. <em>[</em>

waiting times under a Labour Government in Wales are over  18
weeks and are going up significantly because they are cutting the
year-on-year funding to the health service. Returning to the point
about targets, the hon. Lady has to understand that if targets are
politically rather than clinically motivated and imposed, no attention
is paid to the outcomes. That is crucial. Politically imposed targets
are driven by politicians’ views of where the health service
should be, rather than giving clinicians the choice and the judgment to
determine how to treat
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000144">&#160;</a>

waiting times in Wales. In Wales we have retained,
not scrapped, the four-hour wait in  A and

that that is still driving down our figures in  A and E.
Equally, the King’s Fund has pointed to the fact that waiting
times in Wales—which were never  18 weeks; it was always
a 26-week target, which was adopted for clinical
reasons—continue to fall, whereas the relevant figures for
England, if we get them, are going

some examples of why arbitrary waiting times are not always a good
thing. Of course, it is important to drive down waiting times, and
having targets for waiting times can be a good thing, but it is a very
crude measure. What has happened over the past few years is that that
crude measure has prevented patients from being treated according to
clinical priorities, rather than the political ones that have been
outlined.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000152">&#160;</a>

This is an important clinical reality check on what happens day in, day
out on the front line in  A and E. Of course, it is
very easily to talk emotively about children. We all agree that it is
important for people with more serious illness to be treated first,
before those with minor conditions. Unfortunately, that does not

the four-hour wait distortion means that the patient with a stubbed toe
has to be seen within four hours, as a clinical priority, ahead of
patients with potentially more serious conditions. That happens day in,
day out. I could take members to any A and E where that will be

patients are not treated effectively due to demands on services and the
four-hour target, a lot of patients are often rushed from A and E,
almost in a by-pass mechanism, to emergency medical units. Their
“box of care” is effectively ticked, but the proper
treatment is not instigated. Patients who may or may not be admitted
are often by-passed through A and E and go on to an emergency medical
unit without necessarily receiving the important care they need,
because of the existence of a four-hour target, which distorts

the beginning. The targets are a crude mechanism for improving
standards; that is right. Targets did help drive down times waiting to
be seen; I am not contesting that. It is a good thing that patients are
seen more quickly. The problem is that an arbitrary target for the
number of patients who need to be seen within a certain
time—everyone has to be seen within four hours—affects
medical professionals’ ability to use their clinical judgment to
prioritise who needs to be seen when and where. That is the point that
we are making. Those are politically driven targets, and they get in
the way of clinical priorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000163">&#160;</a>

there is a crude mechanism whereby targets can be effective. However,
an obsession with targets developed in the NHS over the past few

obsession with process, ticking boxes and meeting targets was one of
the fundamental problems. We are not just specifically discussing the A
and E target. What matters in medicine is looking after patients; it
does not necessarily matter what the targets are. The patient needs
looking after. Far too often in health care, there is so much
bureaucracy and paperwork and so many targets that clinical priorities
are distorted. That was admitted by my hospital in Ipswich recently,
which had a poor Care Quality Commission report into elderly care, and
it meant that elderly patients were not being properly looked after.
The generic issue of targets was shown in the earlier reports into Mid
Staffordshire to be part of the problem, and I hope the right hon.

of pain. The hon. Gentleman mentions people being seen in a timely
manner, but frankly, for her to have waited for over four hours would
not have been timely, and the Labour Government were doing the right
thing by ensuring that we had a four-hour cut-off. People had to be

Government’s listening exercise, and within the context of a
Bill that seeks to promote competition throughout all parts of the NHS,
that seeks to let any willing or qualified provider come into many
parts of the system, and that currently allows Monitor to say to
hospitals, GPs or other services, “I’m afraid that you
have to let your facilities be used by the private sector in order to
create a level playing field.” The Minister will be coming to

is an extremely important issue, If I may, Dr McCrea, I will report
several conversations  I had with chief executives of NHS
trusts who were involved in the different parts of the Future Forum.
Privately, so I cannot say who they are, they raised concerns directly
with me that not only private providers, but GPs would choose to
deliver various out-patients’ appointments, dermatology clinics
and perhaps even cataracts surgery—high-volume, relatively
straightforward and cheap services—in their clinics, which would
mean that hospitals were left to treat the patients with much more
complex conditions. They explained that trusts often use those
high-volume, low-cost services to fund the more complex parts of their
hospitals, namely A and E, so they were extremely
concerned that if more such services were shifted out, either into the
private sector and/or into GPs surgeries, it would threaten the
financial stability of hospitals. Being hospital executives, perhaps
they were likely to say this, but they told me that although they
understood the need to move care out of hospitals and close to
people’s homes, they were keen for GPs to concentrate a little
more on providing out-of-hours services, so that people did not end up
at A and E in the first place, which costs the overall system
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000179">&#160;</a>

Forum and hon. Members during the previous Committee, including the

unfair advantage over the NHS. Opposition Members tabled an amendment
about training, but alas the Committee did not pass it, which was a
mistake. If we want a genuine level playing field, private providers
should contribute more to the costs of training, particularly if they
deliver more services under the Government’s plans, not only
because that is fair, but because it is vital that all parts of the
system help to provide education and training for the future NHS work
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000180">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 222<a class="bkMark" name="Column222">&#160;</a>
                  </div>look at services—in fact, I am a passionate and long-standing
champion of moving care out of hospitals and into the
community—but there are consequences of doing so. That issue was
raised with me as we listened, as we always do, during the pause.
Opposition Members still have concerns about what the Government say
they will do to prevent cherry-picking. Although we are not considering
Government amendments, I will discuss that now to explain why we have
tabled amendments 3 and
6.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000183">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
first concern is about the tariff. I am sure the Government will say,
as they did in their response to the Future Forum, that they want a
tariff that fully reflects the different costs of providing a
particular service, such as hospital readmissions and aftercare, so
that it reflects the full complexity of services, including those
provided within the community. That is the right way for the tariff to
operate, but I want hon. Members to be aware that, of the £105
billion spent on the NHS, some £30 billion—I might easily
be wrong, but the Minister will correct me if I am—is covered by
tariff. It has taken us six or seven years to develop a tariff for that
proportion of health care funding, all of which relates to hospital
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000184">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
£30 billion does not cover every aspect of hospital services,
but it covers 70% or 80% of them. We still do not have tariffs for
mental health services provided within hospitals and so on, nor for
£75 billion of health care spending on the more complex
provision. We have nothing on community services, for example, which is
where we need to shift our focus if we are to improve care and deliver
better value for money. It will take us a long time to get for all
parts of the NHS a tariff that fully reflects the care costs of people
along a pathway. It is right to say that the tariff needs to reflect
costs fully, but it will take us a long time to get there. In the
meantime, how will the Government prevent cherry-picking, as they have
asserted they will? That is the context of our
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
we will come on to this, but the Government have tabled a subsequent
group of amendments requiring providers of services to specify the
criteria they use to select the patients they are willing to accept or
treat, and to publish those criteria. The Government say that those
requirements will prevent cherry-picking, but they will not prevent
providers from selecting or choosing patients; it just means they will
have to be more open about it. Why do not the Government simply say
instead, “You have to take any patient who is referred to
you.”? That is what happens with NHS services now, so why not in
future?<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is a long way of saying that I am not convinced that the
Government’s amendments on cherry-picking will be enough. They
are not enough now, and they will take a long time to become enough,
hence our tabling amendments 3 and 6, which state that when the
commissioning board or commissioning consortia commission services,
they must have regard to what we call the interdependency of
services—the impact that any change in the provision of a
service may have on other services—in terms of their financial
and clinical viability and
sustainability<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Bodies
that are responsible for commissioning services must understand the
effect that moving provision to a different public sector, private
sector or voluntary sector provider may have on the financial
sustainability of a hospital from which the service is being moved;
they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 223<a class="bkMark" name="Column223">&#160;</a>
                  </div>need to understand the impact and implications of their decisions. A
fundamental flaw of the Bill is the lack of a requirement on anyone to
look at the health economy as a whole to understand the impact that
changing services will have, whether it is out of hospitals and
into the community or between public and private providers.
MPs need to be aware of that, because such measures will affect every
single hospital in every single constituency. Unless the
national board and clinical commissioning groups are aware of that,
changes will happen that may have unintended and very real consequences
for patients. There is no requirement anywhere in the Bill for people
to take that into account. Amendments 3 and 6 will help to
ensure that cherry-picking does not happen and that somebody has an
overview of the impact on our local health economies, which is what
ultimately matters to our
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000188">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As the hon. Lady said, these linked amendments seek
to place duties on the commissioning board and clinical commissioning
groups. While I understand the intention behind them, they would be
impractical as primary legislation. Their aim is to ensure that
decisions to extend choice about the provision of services do not
destabilise existing services in terms of their financial viability
or—perhaps even more important—their clinical safety. It
is not necessary to create additional duties, because those factors are
a key part of good
commissioning.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
underlying principle of the Bill is to require commissioning boards to
secure the best possible  care for patients. The fundamental
duty of the NHS commissioning board will be to promote a comprehensive
health service. The NHS commissioning board will hold this duty
concurrently with the Secretary of State, and clinical commissioning
groups will be required to arrange for the provision of health services
for their populations. Furthermore, the Bill creates additional duties
on CCGs and the NHS commissioning board in relation to securing
high-quality integrated care that will deliver value for money for
local communities and promote opportunities for patients to exercise
choice in relation to their care. In taking commissioning decisions,
they will therefore have to consider what will be in the best overall
interest of their patients. This would always be their primary concern.
I appreciate that concern has been expressed about how far they will
have the freedom to do
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000190">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government acknowledged in their response to the report from Future
Forum that we have not clearly enough described the role of
commissioners in leading the choice and competition agenda. We
recognise the concern that Monitor could have more control over local
services than local commissioners. That is why we have tabled
amendments to clause 56, which, as the hon. Member for Leicester West
very fairly commented, we will be discussing in detail when we come to
them. The amendments will change Monitor’s duty so that it no
longer refers to “promoting competition”, but

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 224<a class="bkMark" name="Column224">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Forum’s recommendations, we remain firmly committed to the
presumption of choice as a key part of our vision of an NHS that puts
patients first. However, we have made it clear that the commissioning
board will set the choice offer, based on the choice mandate that the
Secretary of State will set as part of the annual mandate to the
commissioning board. This would cover more than just choice provider.
As Future Forum said,<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Choice

a level playing field. Providers must be treated on a
non-discriminatory basis, and processes must be transparent. However,
the key point is that this is a commissioner-driven process, and we
will ensure that providers will not be able to cherry-pick
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000193">&#160;</a>

on the national tariff, which we will debate in the context of clause
115, and a proposed new clause requiring providers to publish their
eligibility criteria, which we will consider when we reach clause 101,
will help ensure that that is the case. We also want to ensure that the
national tariff does not tie the hands of local commissioners. That is
why the tariff could include rules, which would have to be agreed
between Monitor and the NHS commissioning board, setting out
circumstances in which commissioners could vary the specifications or
prices in the tariff.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
the amendments we will come to in clause 22 will ensure that planned
changes to local services are based on genuine engagement with the
public, and are in line with the joint health and well-being strategy.
They will, of course, also continue to be subject to local democratic
scrutiny. For the commissioners who drive the process, this is their
job as already set out in the Bill. The amendments would create an
unnecessary legislative duty with the potential to confuse their
primary purpose, which is commissioning in the best interest of
patients. For that reason, I hope that my hon. Friends will reject the

amendment were agreed. However, it is redundant. Everybody is against
cherry-picking and agrees it is a bad thing. Everybody takes the point
that the hon. Member for Leicester West made about the dangers of a
private or voluntary provider moving into high-volume, low-risk simple
services. We saw in previous years that the private sector was happy to
come into areas such as treatment centres, where it treated joints with
no real complications that had no effect on the respiratory or the
cardiac system. It did the simple work, motivated to do so by the
previous Government. We all recognise that some of the simple services
depend on back-up if things go wrong, which is provided normally by the
local district general or specialist hospitals working in the complex
fields.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I slightly
disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge, who suggested
that there could be a simple scenario in which the local DGH
concentrated on the complicated and difficult, leaving the simple and
obvious to the private sector. Although such a system could easily
function without any complications, it would have a ripple effect. I
can give a simple example: a popular field for the private sector to
compete in is dermatology. One of the complications of dermatological
problems can be cancer. A lot of the dermatological private enterprises
do not do cancer, but none the less will come across symptoms that will
require reference to a cancer specialist. One could look at a happy
scenario in which the private sector got on with the simple stuff and
the local specialist hospital got on with the more complicated stuff.
The more likely outcome, if the private sector, by whatever means,
entirely takes the simple stuff off the hospital, is that the cancer
specialists at that hospital depart, and cancer services for skin cease
to be available in a particular area. A commissioner would take on
board that consideration. In my local area, a private dermatological
bid has gone in regardless of what the hospital thinks, by virtue of
the any willing provider rule currently
applying.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000200">&#160;</a>

commissioner may take that into account, it may be difficult for them
to predict the incremental effect over time of cancer services for
dermatological conditions being commissioned in a different way in a
hospital? Does he also accept that the changes in tariff to which the
Minister referred, which are ostensibly about trying to preclude some
of this cherry-picking, increase the risk of it? Allowing commissioners
to vary from tariff—allowing them to set separate prices and
determine publicly why they have done so—is a charter for
cherry-picking and for doing simple stuff more
cheaply.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000201">&#160;</a>

pathfinder group at an open day at the local hospital. I would be very
surprised if we found commissioners worthy of  the name who did
not understand the economy, the environment and the services provided
by the local hospital. It is possible that a commissioner would not
know the potential effects of his or her decision, but that person

hon. Member for Southport said that I advocated the transfer of simpler
services from hospitals to the private sector; I actually said that,
where possible and applicable, such services might be transferred to
the private sector and to local GP practices. There are countless
examples of people who suffer from long-term medical conditions such as
asthma and diabetes—some 17 million patients—who would
profit from receiving the necessary attention for conditions from
specialist GP practices that have developed expertise and employ
specialist nurses. Such practices can provide those services closer to
home, more cheaply and often to a better standard than a hospital
service that is overrun.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000204">&#160;</a>

Essex was under considerable pressure. The spinal unit at the hospital
was under huge pressure, with the result that it could not deliver
within the waiting times and it could not deliver an adequate service.
The commissioners, who seemed an innovative bunch, resolved to cut
waiting times, improve ease of access and reduce demand on the local
spinal services by negotiating with GP practices and private providers
in chiropractic, osteopathy and physiotherapy. The result of the
exercise was that pressure on the spinal unit was reduced by
25%—a huge reduction. That will not close the spinal unit

specialist consultants in several areas to undertake a critical mass of

                  </strong> The amendments emphasise the importance of the
duties of the commissioning board and clinical commissioning groups in
relation to reducing inequalities and promoting patient choice and
patient involvement. Those points will now be separated, so that the
duties for patient involvement and patient choice will each be
contained within their own, separate sections of the National Health
Service Act 2006. The amendments also strengthen the duties for patient
involvement and patient
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000242">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Proposed
new section 13FA, inserted by amendment 70, and proposed new
section 14NA, inserted by amendment 111, would oblige the
commissioning board and clinical commissioning groups respectively, in
exercising their functions, to promote the involvement of individual
patients, their carers and any other representatives in decisions about
the patient’s own care and treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000243">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The duties
are fundamental to our vision of a patient-centred NHS, where patients
can expect “no decision about me without me”. The NHS
Future Forum strongly argued that shared decision making between
patients and clinicians needs to permeate the culture right across
health care. The amendments prove that we are committed to shared
decision making and the principle of “no decision about me
without me”. The Future Forum said, however, that the
commissioning board’s duty to<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000244">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“have regard to

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">promote
patient involvement, as it was originally worded, did not mirror the
strength of our commitment, or sufficiently encapsulate the principle
of shared decision making.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000245">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have
therefore placed the duties in separate sections to emphasise their
importance and we have clarified the language, so that there can be no
confusion about what is required from the commissioning board and the
CCGs. The language of the sections now makes it clear that this is
about involving patients in their individual care and treatment. Wider
public involvement in service delivery is covered by separate duties
created by proposed new sections 13L and 14P. If patient involvement is
to be truly embedded, as the Future Forum recommended, it needs to be
the norm for everyone—patients, clinicians, providers and
commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have also
significantly strengthened the obligation on the board and the CCGs by
removing their discretion on exercising that duty. The Bill establishes
a duty on the board and clinical commissioning groups to have regard to
the need to promote patient involvement when exercising their
functions; the amendment will establish a direct duty on the board and
the CCGs to promote patient involvement when exercising their
functions. We have also added to the duties so that, where appropriate,
the board and CCGs must promote the involvement of a patient’s
representatives, as well as any carers, which better reflects the
reality of patients’ relationships and the support that they
might need to be actively involved in their care and
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000247">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
111 will create a new power under proposed new section 14NA of the 2006
Act to provide specific guidance to clinical commissioning groups on
fulfilling the patient involvement duty, and it specifies that CCGs
must have regard to that guidance. The power provides a strong vehicle
for the board to provide the clarity that the Future Forum and others
have called for on the meaning of good patient involvement, what it
involves and how it can become a reality for patients
through

patient groups to develop its approach to patient involvement and
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Future Forum also emphasised the importance of delivering real choice
for patients and the role that commissioners should play. The
Government’s response to the Future Forum’s report builds
on that by describing how commissioners will take a lead role in
extending patient
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000249">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
70 and 111, which add new sections 13FB and 14NB
respectively, create separate and distinct duties on the board and the
CCGs in respect of patient choice. We have strengthened the obligation
on the board and the CCGs by placing a new, more active requirement on

enabling patients to make choices on the health services that are
provided to them. The board and the CCGs will need to bear in mind the
patient choice duty so that they exercise their functions in a way best
calculated to enable patient
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000250">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This
group of amendments will ensure that both the board and the CCGs take
steps to ensure that, where appropriate, patients exercise choice on
their care in line with their expectations. That could include a number
of things, such as direct payments or personal health budgets. As
recommended by the Future Forum, the Secretary of State’s
mandate to the board will set out clear expectations on offering
patients a choice mandate, which will establish the parameters for
choice and will be used by the board to develop its plans for making
choice a reality for
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
King’s Fund has welcomed that commitment to a choice mandate. We
want patients to be able to make informed choices about their health
care, the treatment they receive, where they receive it and who
provides it. The board will be responsible for commissioning and
promulgating information to support informed choices on the care and
treatment that people receive, where it is provided and who provides
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000252">&#160;</a>

only you’d listened to us last time round you wouldn’t
have got yourselves into such a disastrous position.” This has
been a wasted year both politically and, more importantly, for the NHS.
We argued strongly last time in Committee that the requirements and
duties on patient and public involvement were not strong enough. The
Minister told us many times that we were wrong and that they were
strong enough. He has now admitted that that is not the case and that
is why he has had to change the legislation and table these
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000260">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
cites Rethink as being satisfied with all the Government’s
proposed changes. Unless he popped out for a little break, he will have
heard the comments from Paul Jenkins, the chief executive of Rethink
and chair of the Richmond group of charities, and Jeremy Taylor, of
National Voices. They said that they have not had sufficient time to
consider not the Government’s response to Future Forum, but the
amendments to the Bill. Jeremy Taylor
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000261">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
need to give patients and the public a stronger voice within the NHS. I
still do not think that the Bill goes far enough. I welcome the
comments that Paul Jenkins and other members of patient groups gave in
evidence to us. They raised several points that are worth listening to.
Simply putting this duty in as it is will not transform the NHS and
give patients and the public a stronger voice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
three comments that we should consider in particular. First, there was
a strong sense from Baroness Young of Diabetes UK and the
witness from the Stroke Association that these amendments, which are
about giving individual patients a say on their treatment, are not
strong enough on the collective public voice about the future shape of
our health services. That is critical.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We will face
difficult decisions about the future of local hospital services. We
need to involve people not only as individual patients who use those
services, but as a community as a whole. There will be some very
difficult decisions, trade-offs and checks and balances. I do think
that the Government have a plan for how they will deal with this. I
raised this last week. In six months’ time, hospitals will face
a massive financial crunch. Very difficult decisions will have to be
taken. Having a much stronger and clearer sense of how we as citizens
and members of the public are involved in decisions is vital. I do not
think the Bill is strong enough in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000264">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second issue is this. As Jeremy Taylor
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000265">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
duty of public involvement still reads very much along the lines of the
old section 242 template of informing and consulting. That is still the
model of public involvement that is expressed in the Bill as amended.
Many of us here think that that is a rather old-fashioned way of
engaging and involving people, and we would like to see something a bit
stronger.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health and

               <p class="tabbed">It
is not a case of telling people what we want  to do and then
asking for their views about it. We need something fundamentally
different. The Health Foundation submitted evidence to the
Committee via e-mail yesterday. It said that if we really believe in
both the individual involvement of patients in all the decisions about
their treatment in care and the need to involve the public, as
citizens, in difficult decisions about the future shape of hospital
services, we need to define that and set it out clearly in the Bill.
Unless we do that, the NHS will not be able to make the £20
billion of efficiency savings or improve patient care. The duty is not
going to transform the way in which we do public involvement and
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
final point on the patient choice and involvement duty relates to an
issue that has been raised by both the Royal College of Paediatrics and
Child Health and the National Children’s Bureau. They also
submitted evidence yesterday and are concerned—this was
mentioned in the Future Forum report, but not in any of the
Government’s responses—that the views and voices of
children and young people are not being heard. The NHS has been poor at
making sure that children and young people have their say. It is
disappointing that that has not been recognised. It was mentioned in
the Future Forum report, but the Government’s response has not
focused on it. Those organisations took the time to give evidence to
the Committee at short notice, so it is only right that we should raise
that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000267">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to speak briefly—I hope the
Committee will indulge me—about the Scottish experience of
consultation and involving patients. Two terms ago in the Scottish
Parliament, the Kerr review looked, in part, at A and E services in
Scotland. It was decided that certain local A and E services should be
closed, with a view to offering people, in the event of a heart attack
or a stroke, better outcomes by making them travel slightly further for
a more specialist service. That was the conclusion of the Kerr report,
and it was also the view of the clinicians involved in providing
services locally. The community objected, as was its right, and that
happened to coincide with an election. A decision was then
made—we have to be watchful of whether this is populism or
genuine community engagement and involvement—and services were
retained. Subsequently, the clinicians changed their minds and decided
that that was better. We have to be clear about the processes and
enable those people whom we are trusting and empowering to make
decisions to get on with doing that
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000268">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that every member of the Committee has received submissions on
involving young people, especially those with multiple and complex
needs as a result of physical and learning disabilities. The Future
Forum was clear that those young people must have a voice, and it seeks
clarification from the Minister about where their voices will be heard,
not just as children, but as they make the transition from using
children’s services to using adult services. It is often the
case that there is nothing appropriate in the area and that only
paediatric or geriatric services are available. When we talk about
choice, it will be outwith the area, because specialist service
provision for children or young adults with complex needs may not be
available in the area where they live.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000269">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
Minister mentioned direct payments, which have been welcomed broadly.
We also have them in Scotland, so I have knowledge of them. However,
only yesterday, and as we have discussed, the Dilnot report raised
concerns about quality. Where is the quality guarantee to ensure that,
when we give patients power, the services that they access, especially
for vulnerable adults and children, are of a quality that safeguards
their
interests?<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000270">&#160;</a>

and to invite the Minister to clarify a particular issue. I had hoped
to make an intervention, but I could not catch his eye. My point
relates to a statement that the Secretary of State made to the House on
14 June about the NHS Future Forum after it published its report. He
made a point about co-operation and competition, in which he said that
it was the Government’s intention to place the
“Principles and rules for cooperation and competition” on
a statutory footing. I presume that those are the elements that we are
dealing with now. <em>[</em>

miss out on consulting and getting involvement from young people and

               <p class="tabbed">The amendments
strengthen the duty on the NHS commissioning board and CCGs to obtain
appropriate clinical advice. Clinically-led commissioning is at the
heart of our vision for the NHS. We want decisions about local services
to be taken by those who are best placed to work with patients and the
public to understand their needs. The NHS Future Forum endorsed that
vision, but it was correct to say that the Bill did not fully reflect
that ambition.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000291">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
particular, we recognise that everyone who has a role to play in
developing better services for patients should be able to do so. There
are non-legislative ways in which we propose to strengthen the
opportunities for that, such as extending clinical
networks—bringing together experts to provide advice on distinct
areas of care, such as cancer or maternity services—and
establishing clinical senates, which will bring together a range of
multi-professional experts across particular parts of the country to
provide cross-cutting advice on strategic commissioning
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
proposals prompted a lot of debate in our last session, so let me make
a few points clear. Networks and senates will not be new organisations
or new forms of bureaucracy. Their purpose is to embed clinical
expertise at the heart of the board and to provide both clinical
commissioning groups and the board itself with access to a broad range
of expert clinical input, to support and inform commissioning
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000293">&#160;</a>

               <p>The
Royal College of Physicians and Bliss, the special care baby charity,
have also welcomed our commitment to strengthen critical networks and
give them a role in advising commissioners. In addition, the NHS
Confederation has said that setting up clinical advisory bodies to
support consortia could be a positive way forward. However, the Future
Forum also recommended that we strengthen the legislative duties on NHS
commissioners to seek a wider range of advice in performing their
functions. That was something that the BMA also called for, and the
amendments do exactly
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000295">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
71 and 112 change the wording of the duties of the commissioning board
and the clinical commissioning groups, under proposed new
sections 13G and 14O respectively, to “obtain”
appropriate advice. Rather than being required to make arrangements
with a view to obtaining advice, the board and the CCGs will be
directly required to obtain advice, which is a much clearer and
stronger
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000296">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
72 and 113 place a more direct duty on the board and the CCGs to obtain
advice appropriate for enabling them to discharge effectively their
functions from a broad range of professionals with expertise in the
prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illnesses, and in the protection
or improvement of public health. That applies to the exercise of all
their functions—including, for example, obtaining advice when
making commissioning decisions and when the commissioning board designs
NHS pricing structures.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000297">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 114
introduces a new power for the board to issue guidance to CCGs on the
discharge of their duty to obtain advice. It parallels the power
already in the Bill in proposed new section 14P(3) for the board to
issue guidance to CCGs on the discharge of their public involvement and
consultation functions. It is  also consistent with the new
powers, introduced by amendment 111, for the board to issue guidance on
the discharge of CCGs’ duties regarding patient involvement,
which we have just discussed. In each case, CCGs are required to have
regard to the board’s
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000298">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Future Forum also recommended that clinical commissioning groups be
regularly assessed to ensure that they have made robust arrangements
for obtaining clinical advice. Amendment 135, therefore, requires the
board to include in its annual performance assessment of CCGs an
evaluation of how effectively they have fulfilled their duty to obtain
advice. The annual assessment will also be required to include an
evaluation of how well a CCG has discharged its patient and public
involvement duties under amendment
136.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000299">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Taken
as a package, the amendments are intended to strengthen the potential
input of clinical advice to the board and the CCGs, and to allay
concerns raised by the Future Forum and other
stakeholders.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000300">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Members on both sides of the Committee will
hopefully know that in the previous Committee, Opposition Members
strongly argued that the board and the commissioning consortia should
not be the preserve of just GPs but should take advice and input from a
range of health professionals. The Government said that that was not
necessary, and now they admit that they got their initial proposals
wrong. They insisted, in fact, that our amendments were not needed;
there are no groans of support about that comment in this Committee
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000301">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have four issues to raise about what the Government now propose. The
first of them, which was rightly raised by the NHS Confederation in its
briefing on the re-committed Bill, is the degree of complexity in the
system. The confederation makes it clear
that:<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000302">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
establishment and running of these multiple networks and senates
alongside health and wellbeing boards, the National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and Public Health England has the
potential to become extremely complex and
confusing”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000347">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
board and the consortia are required to take clinical advice, and new
clinical senates are also being set up. The Minister said that the
senates are not new organisations, but if he can point out a clinical
senate in every area of the country, I will be surprised, to put it
mildly.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000303">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I understand
that clinical networks exist in many places, but the Minister has
failed to understand the difference between what those different bodies
are doing. The first question is: can he simply explain how the
clinical advice that the commissioning consortia will get from a
clinical senate and from a clinical network will be different? If he
can, it will be
surprising.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000304">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second issue that I want to raise is, again, a point rightly made by
the NHS Confederation. In the Government’s response to the
Future Forum, there is no reference to community health services and
community health professionals. We spend £11 billion a year on
community health services and they employ around 250,000
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000305">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 236<a class="bkMark" name="Column236">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The key to
improving patient care and delivering better value for money for
taxpayers is absolutely about what happens in those community health
services. It is about how those services help patients stay fit and
healthy and live independently, so that they do not end up having to go
to their GP or into hospital and A and E. Those patients are not
mentioned in the Government’s response to the Future Forum or in
the amendments. That is a significant gap and a big mistake because it
means that the Government will not be able to get the NHS to achieve
what they want it to. I urge them to look again at
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000306">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
third issue is also critical. We have absolutely no idea how any of
this stuff will be funded. How will the clinicians advising the
consortia or commissioning groups, working on the clinical
senates or working in the clinical networks be funded? Even if their
roles are unpaid in that respect, what degree of senior locum cover
will we
get?<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000307">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is talk of there being 30 clinical senates across the
country—goodness knows how many clinical commissioning groups
there will be. How will the Government fund them? What calculation has
the Minister done on that? Will that be in the health impact
assessment? A large expense will be created. When the NHS is under huge
pressure, it is only right that the Government spell out the costs of
their plan as they have claimed that they will save a huge amount of
money. The sums do not stack
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000308">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Fourthly,
I would like the Minister to tell the Committee what the status of the
advice provided by these different groups is. What if the people giving
the advice to the board or the consortia give advice different from
that of the clinical senates or the clinical networks? Who has the
final say? Will they be the same people or will they be different? As
my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield said, it is a dog’s
dinner. I could not have put it better myself. As always, I am looking
forward to the Minister’s answers to all four of those
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000309">&#160;</a>

say, this is not creating additional bureaucracy. The changes that we

benefits for
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000315">&#160;</a>

between 14 and 17 of what he refers to as “health

                  </strong> Okay. The hon. Lady did not ask that question, so I
can save the Committee’s time by not answering it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000324">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also asked who will have a say and what legal force the senates will
have. As Dr Kathy McLean said in her evidence, commissioners hold the
statutory functions, so they have the final accountability for
decisions. Senates and networks are there to advise them. They do not
have statutory responsibilities—they are advisory
bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000325">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With
that, I will conclude so that we can finish debating the amendment
before the break. I urge my hon. Friends to support the amendments,
which the hon. Lady started to support until her rhetoric veered her
away from
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000326">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The Minister has not answered my question about
what the difference is between a senate, a network and the people who
will give advice to the clinical commissioning groups. He has not
answered the question about their costs, how they will be funded or the
local cover. He has not answered my point that there is no mention of
community health services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000327">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am always
careful with my words. I ask questions that are designed to get to the
facts, and I hope that the Minister will now respond to those three
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000328">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> On funding, we come back to the same old
question—the hon. Lady will have to be patient and wait for the
new impact assessment. She knows when it will be published, so I do not
have to repeat that. On community health services, the exact point of
senates, as I have already said, is to bring together professionals
from different parts of the system to discuss how to provide joined-up
services for patients. Those working in the community could play a key
role in senates, and we hope that they
will.<a class="bkMark" name="11070566000329">&#160;</a>
