<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 6, line 40, leave out `is not possible or'.
<P>
The amendment is a simple one. It deals with the supply of information under clause 7(1)(c)(ii). The Committee debated such information this morning. We now agree that it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any information available to the data controller as to the source of those data''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 8(2)(a) relates to the obligation imposed under clause 7(1). It deals with the supply of a copy of the information to the data subject, and it states that the obligation would not apply if the supply of such copy would involve disproportionate effort. The Opposition understand that. The obligation would also not apply, however, if the supply were not possible.
<P>
I am perplexed about why it would not be possible to supply the information as to the source of the data. A claim that such a supply was not possible would imply that the controller did not know where the data came from. That would be worse than the proposition that I put this morning about the data being obtained third hand by way of gossip. The Opposition understand the reference to disproportionate effort. However, I do not clearly understand why it might not be possible to supply the information.
<P>
The Minister and his team may have concluded that circumstances may arise in which supply is impossible, and that the Bill should cover every eventuality. Will the Minister explain the circumstances that the government foresee in which it might not be possible to supply the information? It should be borne in mind that the information being sought by the data subject relates to the source of the data.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): The right of the individual to access his or her information underpins the Bill. Under the 1984 Act, the individual is entitled to a hard--or paper--copy. Even Members of Parliament are now so computer literate that we know the difference between a hard copy and one contained on disk. Even I know that. The 1984 Act is inflexible, and takes no account of developing technology. The Bill maintains the individual's right to gain access to his or her data, but it also takes into account recent technological developments. It recognises that individuals will not always wish to receive a paper copy.
<P>
Clause 8(2) achieves that by requiring data controllers to provide a copy of personal data in permanent form, unless one of two exceptions applies. The first applies if the data subject does not insist upon a hard copy. If, for example, he or she were to agree to receive data by e-mail, a possibility discussed this morning in a different context, the controller may provide the information in that form.
<P>
The second exception applies if the provision of a hard copy is impossible or would involve disproportionate effort. In such circumstances, it would be entirely reasonable not to insist that the controller provides a hard copy. The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) suggests deleting the words ``is not possible''. A reference simply to disproportionate effort is not enough, but that is what we would be left with. No effort at all might be involved because it is impossible to provide the copy.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman talked in his opening remarks about the source, but that is dealt with in clause 7(1)(c)(ii) not (i). I thought that I should correct him.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the words in the clause are needed because they follow on logically from the situations with which we are trying to deal. If he does, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not want to begin the afternoon on a discordant note, but I do not think that the Minister gave us an explanation. I am left wondering why it might not be possible to supply a copy of the information about the source of the data. I understand the points about the information being in permanent form and about hard copy.
<P>
This is not a major issue, and we shall not press it. It is, however, almost a contradiction to say that information about the source of the data has to be supplied but that a circumstance might arise in which it was not possible to do so.--[Interruption.] I see that the Minister has some other suggestions as to the answer to my question.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> This has nothing to do with the sources, but relates to the data. It might help the hon. Member for Ryedale if he envisaged circumstances in which the provisions might apply. A good example is that it might not be possible to provide a hard copy because of a computer malfunction. Information might be stored on the computer, but the connection between it and the printer might have broken. I am loathe to develop the point further because everybody is looking at me with great interest, and I wonder what the source of that interest might be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor (Esher and Walton)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I was not issuing an invitation, but I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I never refuse non-invitations.
<P>
It was in my mind subsequently to raise the year-2000 problem. Given that we cannot forecast how computers will malfunction when they do not recognise the date change, data could be corrupted, disappear or be transformed into something else. That will depend on what they think the year change is; if they think that it is 1900, the whole process could become random or they could simply shut down. I could not resist the opportunity to mention that when the Minister made what was a serious point about what will happen if data are lost or corrupted. We know that as the year changes on 31 December 1999, many computers will simply fail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I raised the possibility of that intervention through my observations. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was responding to a non-intervention or whether we should term it gatecrashing. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that a large exercise is under way in the Cabinet Office to deal with the consequences of the problems that he described. The registrar has issued guidance about the year 2000 and the so-called millennium bug, and a great deal of work is under way on it. I recently attended a meeting on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. I know from the progress reports that Government Departments--especially where they interface with the business community--are making a tremendous effort to identify problems in systems and how to deal with them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) raises a good point, although I am not entirely sure that it is relevant to the debate. However, I hope that he will support his hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale, who appears about to withdraw the amendment, albeit reluctantly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> With good grace, I admit that I made a mistake. The Minister is right: clause 8(2) specifies section 7(1)(c)(i) not 7(1)(c)(ii). The discussion was worth while but, given the contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton, perhaps I should refrain in future from saying that the point I want to make is small.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 7, line 4, after `interval', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and in any event not less than three months.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we might take amendment No. 106, in clause 24, page 15, line 28, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`As soon as practicable after'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert `Within three months of'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The amendments are intended to clarify the Government's intentions about timing. Clause 8(3) attempts to give data controllers some protection from persistent data subjects who request information too frequently. I shall resist the temptation to draw an analogy with people who come to our surgeries, but I am sure that hon. Members know what I have in mind.
<P>
Clause 8(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where a data controller has previously complied with a request made under section 7 by an individual, the data controller is not obliged to comply with a subsequent identical or similar request under that section by that individual unless a reasonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 38 proposes a gap of not less than three months, with the aim of getting some idea of the Government's notion of what would constitute ``a reasonable interval''. Surely a person who returns for information that he received less than three months previously is being mischievous and persistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): If someone applies for a mortgage and is refused by one lender because of a previous bad debt, he gets the relevant information and corrects it. If, when he applies to another mortgage lender, he is turned down again, is it not reasonable for him to try and find out why? Would not that option be negated by the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That rather suggests that clause 8(3) is a waste of time. The hon. Gentleman's example suggests that no interval would be reasonable. However, although the same credit reference agency may be involved, would not there be a different data controller if the person went to a different mortgage lender? For example, if the source of the original rejection was the Halifax bank, that, rather than the credit reference agency, would be the data controller under the terms of subsection (3). I hope that the Minister will explain that point.
<P>
Amendment No. 106 relates to clause 24, which requires the commissioner to submit to the Secretary of State his proposals for the provisions to be included in the first notification regulations. We shall debate that in detail later, but for now I simply want to ask about the time scale that the Government have in mind. The amendment suggests three months from the enactment of the Bill. From the progress that we are making, one assumes that Royal Assent will be given within the next couple of months. When will the Data Protection Commissioner tell business what is likely to be in the first notification regulations? Business needs to know, and it is not unreasonable for us to try to provide a signpost in Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> It is not a matter of providing for no period--we must decide what constitutes a reasonable period. Clause 8(3) provides that a data controller who has already granted a subject access need not respond to a similar request from the same person unless, as the hon. Member for Ryedale said, a reasonable interval has elapsed since the first request.
<P>
What constitutes a reasonable interval will vary from case to case, but the issue does not rest on those words alone. The Bill, like the directive and the 1984 Act, does not specify ``a reasonable interval''. Instead, clause 8(4) lists three important indicators--the nature of the data, the purposes of the processing and the frequency with which the data are changed--to which controllers must have regard. They will help controllers judge what is and what is not reasonable.
<P>
The amendment would establish three months as a minimum reasonable interval between the first response and the subsequent request. It would thus build in an undesirable rigidity. Three months may be an inappropriately long period in some circumstances. In others, it may be too short, given the nature of the information and the processing.
<P>
The Government's approach--designed to retain flexibility--is better. It allows the right period to be determined in the light of all the relevant circumstances. It does not risk depriving individuals of the chance to exercise their right in an arbitrary way. That is key to our objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I accept that this is an open question, but given the three conditions, do the Government and their officials feel that if the data has not been altered or are unlikely to have been altered, that would be a reasonable ground for refusing another request? It would be extremely helpful for data controllers to know that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I cannot give a direct answer to that. Under the proposals three factors have significance at different times, including the nature of the data and the purposes of the processing. It is therefore difficult to give a clear answer. The third factor is whether the data are changed, which is what the hon. Gentleman talked about. But that is only one of the three circumstances. I do not want to get tied down with that.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, amendment No. 106 takes us to clause 24. It contains a carefully constructed mechanism for making notification regulations, which play an important role in the legislation. The scheme reflects the fact that the Secretary of State, Parliament and the commissioner will all have an interest in the form of the regulations. They are important to the commissioner because she will have to operate them. They are important to Parliament because they will place obligations on data controllers and, by that means, help to ensure transparency for the benefit of data subjects.
<P>
There needs to be a process for making such regulations. Effectively, clause 24 provides that the first proposals shall come from the commissioner to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State must consider them and in turn consult the commissioner. Only then can the Secretary of State make regulations.
<P>
Clause 63(5), in turn, provides that notification regulations shall be subject to negative resolution by either House of Parliament. So the commissioner, the Secretary of State and Parliament will all have a role to play. I think that that reflects the right balance of interests.
<P>
I should say, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Secretary of State's interest in this will be to help ensure that the notification regulations are fit for their purpose and that the burdens they impose are necessary. The regulations could not, and perhaps should not, dot every ``i'' and cross every ``t'' of the scheme, but they should, after appropriate consultation, set out a framework within which the commissioner can operate.
<P>
Amendment No. 106 deals with timing. Both the Government and the commissioner are working hard to bring the new regime into force as soon as possible. But, as members of the Committee will appreciate, there will still be a lot of work to be done even when, if I may anticipate, the Bill receives Royal Assent. A number of statutory instruments will have to be prepared and brought forward, including, of course, the notification regulations. The comissioner is already considering these matters and is in exploratory discussions with Home Office officials. But there are complex legal and operational issues to be sorted out.
<P>
We need to be clear, in particular, how detailed the notification scheme must be to comply with the requirements of the directive. We must also be satisfied that the comissioner has a technically workable scheme--that in itself involves designing and testing new software. It is more important that we get it right than that we commit the commissioner to making proposals within a particular period after Royal Assent.
<P>
With those assurances on the amendments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that his points are covered by other parts of the Bill or by plans that are in hand between the commissioner and the Home Office to make the working arrangements in a technically proper manner for delivery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> There are two separate issues. We have clarified clause 8(3) as well as we are likely to in our debate, and shall be seeking leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
As for the timetable for clause 24, I accept the Minister's comment that it will take time. I agree with him about the need to do it on a proper basis, which will be sustained over time. We were trying to get some idea of when the Data Protection Commissioner would submit the draft notification or proposals to the Secretary of State. It will clearly be several months--from what the Minister said, probably more than three. However, I think that we have made the point as best we can. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 7, line 12, at end insert `or intellectual property.'
<P>
This is one of the few occasions on which I shall need to refer to an issue that was debated in another place. On that occasion, it was not resolved entirely to their Lordships' satisfaction. Concerns remain about the provision of information under clause 7(1)(d). The information that the data subject is seeking to obtain might include not only trade secrets, which are covered by the definition in clause 8(5), but intellectual property. Lord Williams said in the other place that, in the Government's view, trade secrets include intellectual property.
<P>
As I am sure the Minister is aware, the Confederation of British Industry--it is amazing who one can pray in aid from opposing sides of the Committee--has lobbied to the effect that it is not satisfied that intellectual property should be included in a definition of trade secrets. Who has advised the Minister that intellectual property should be left out?
<P>
We must balance two possibilities. Either we put intellectual property into the Bill, so that the position is clear--the Minister will no doubt warn us of any unforeseen side effects--or we do not put it in, and leave the matter open to doubt. In the latter case, it would not be for the Commitee or the House to decide whether intellectual property should be covered; it would be decided by a court.
<P>
I shall not prolong my argument, because the Minister knows that the arguments have already been well-deployed in correspondence to officials over several months during the consultation process. Opposition Members cannot see what would be lost by including the phrase ``intellectual property'' in the Bill, as the amendment proposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the issue was debated in another place. It was an interesting debate, as is often the case in that House.
<P>
Clause 7(1)(d), which the Committee has already discussed, creates a new right for data subjects to be provided with information about the logic involved in decision-making by automated means. That right is restricted to decisions to which clause 13 applies.
<P>
Clause 8(5) protects the data controller from having to reveal any trade secrets when complying with requests for information about the logic of automated decision-making. The amendment would add a reference to ``intellectual property'' to sit alongside ``trade secret''. Information about logic would not have to be provided if, and to the exent that, it constituted a trade secret or intellectual property. The Committee may be aware that the matter was debated in another place both in Committee and on Report. However, some issues still remain to be addressed, and I shall try to do that.
<P>
I understand why the hon. Gentleman has returned to the matter, which has been raised by some of the organisations that he has prayed in aid. However, the Government's view remains unchanged, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand if I give him the same response as was given in another place. We take the argument seriously, but the advice that we have received means that our position remains unaltered.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The safeguard for trade secrets in clause 8(5) is drawn from recital 41 of the directive. It says that the right to information about the logic involved in automatic processing of personal data
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must not adversely affect trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Recital 41 is a comment on the third indent of article 12(a) of the directive. Does the hon. Member for Ryedale still have the necessary material to follow the argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have just read the recital. Which article is it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It is article 12(a). In general terms, it allows the provision of information about the logic involved in automatic processing to be confined to fully automated decisions of the kind dealt with in clause 13 of the Bill. Clause 7(1)(d) takes that more limited option, so we are already narrowing right down the scope for the provision of information about the logic underlying automated processing as far as the directive allows us.
<P>
The Committee will note that recital 41 refers in particular to the ``copyright protecting the software''. That has no application to the limited right conferred by clause 7(1)(d). That right is limited to information about the logic involved in decision-taking. That does not include details for the software that may be instrumental in the application of the logic to the decision-taking process.
<P>
In the context of the limited right established by clause 7(1)(d), clause 8(5) gives full effect to the purpose of recital 41. Clause 8(5) limits the right provided by clause 7(1)(d). Clause 7(1)(d) creates a right to be given information by a data controller. It confers no rights to obtain copies of anything that the data controller has, nor does it confers any new rights on the data subject to use the information that he receives It is simply requires the data controller to produce some description of the factors and weightings involved in the decision taking.
<P>
It therefore leaves intact the law of copyright and other issues of intellectual property. As recital 41 says, the right that the Bill creates does not adversely affect intellectual property rights per se. The only legitimate concern that data controllers can have about that right is that it could force them to disclose information that is not generally known and that has some commercial or other value by virtue of that fact.
<P>
That is what we understand to be the essence of a ``trade secret'', whether or not the information is in copyright form or the subject of other intellectual property rights. It is information that needs protection from disclosure. Clause 8(5) gives it that protection from the requirement to disclose in accordance with clause 7(1).
<P>
Intellectual property law is not concerned to provide protection from disclosure per se. Information subject to intellectual property rights is, after all, generally in the public domain. The information is known, but its reproduction and use is restricted.
<P>
I hope that that explanation gives the hon. Member for Ryedale the reassurance that he seeks. Several examples of that approach are already on the statute book. For instance, the term ``trade secret'' has a clear pedigree. It is used in section 39 of the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 where it imposes a requirement to give public access to certain documents, except in so far as the disclosure of any such document would involve the disclosure of, for example, a trade secret.
<P>
Similar provisions apply in the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Environment and Safety Information Act 1988, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the Food Safety Act 1990, the Water Industry Act 1991, and so on.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): That was beautifully read. I was moved to tears.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) is often moved to tears, although he is very restrained about it. I read out that list partly because I got carried away, so scintillating was the prose, but partly to demonstrate that the concept has a long pedigree. With all the information to hand, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to withdraw the amendment as being unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> With all that information to hand, and notwithstanding the Minister's claim to the intellectual property rights on his comments in Hansard, we want to think about the matter again in the light of his complex answer. I do to mean that as a criticism--they are complex issues.
<P>
It is extremely likely that we shall want to return to this issue on the Floor of the House. In all sincerity, I must say that I am not entirely convinced by the Minister's point, but I promise that I will read Hansard--as, doubtless, will others outside the House who are concerned about the matter--and see whether the hoo-hah is about nothing or whether it involves something more substantial.
<P>
I take the Minister's point about the narrow definition in clause 7(1)(d). I cannot for the life of me see why the words ``and intellectual property'', which the Minister reminded us are in the directive, cannot be included. However, we shall leave it at that, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in clause 8, page 7, line 15, leave out from `received' to end of line 18 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6A) The data controller shall also supply the details of any amended information of which he is aware at the time the information is supplied regardless of the information or data existing at the time the request was made.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is an interesting amendment. Clause 8(6) is very much a supplementary provision and provides guidance and definition regarding the data subject access provisions in clause 7. It deals with how up to date the information should be. From my reading of the provision, the information to be provided in pursuit of any request under clause 7 should be supplied by reference to the data in question at the time that the request is received. In some respects that does not seem unreasonable. However, between the time when the request is received and when it is complied with, the position may change. The same conditions would apply under the amendment, except that the information supplied would include any amendment or deletion made between that time and the time when the information was supplied. The Bill provides the following caveat:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``being an amendment or deletion that would have been made regardless of the receipt of a request.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is obviously important because the making of a request could cause a data controller to look at the information and recognise immediately that the request has been made because the data subject thinks that the record is not accurate. It may result in the information being changed to make it accurate or, I dare say, complete, which is another matter that we shall come to later.
<P>
When I thought more about it, I could not see why the data subject should not be supplied with the up-to-date information, regardless. What is the information available at the time that the request is granted? The subject wants up-to-date information. Amendment No. 40 suggests a slightly different scheme in which the data controller would also supply the details of any amended information of which he is aware at the time the information is supplied. In other words, that would be an additional requirement. Given that he has the information, I cannot see what objection there can be to his supplying it.
<P>
In summary, we are suggesting--if my interpretation of my own amendment is correct--that the information should be up to date when it is supplied. It should not simply be left to the data controller to reach a judgment about whether to supply the information that was on the file when the request was made even though it might have changed in the meantime. I should be grateful if the Minister explained why he thought that approach as better.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> With your indulgence, Mr. Welsh, I want to refer to the hon. Gentleman's closing remarks on the previous amendment. He made the valid point that our proceedings would be read with great interest elsewhere. I am sure that I am slightly out of order, but if you will allow me 30 seconds, I will spell out--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If it is a quick point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If the CBI has continuing concerns about the issue, it would be sensible for representatives from the CBI to meet Home Office officials. They could then discuss their concerns--if they still have any after my explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sure that that invitation will be warmly received.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> On that cordial note, I shall reject the hon. Gentleman's amendment in respect of clause 8(6) and the precise information that is to be provided in response to a subject access request.
<P>
Data in active use might frequently be changed, and we have discussed the technological and other possibilities involved. There has to be a rule to determine which data are supplied, and it is in clause 8(6). It makes identical provision to that in the 1984 Act.
<P>
Subject access is a snapshot; it is not intended to be a history as that would be extremely burdensome for data controllers. If we use our imaginations, we realise that in many cases it would also be totally impractical.
<P>
Clause 8(4) provides that regard must be had to the frequency with which data are altered in considering what constitutes a reasonable interval between requests. We discussed that in a slightly different context earlier.
<P>
The data subject is entitled to a series of snapshots, but not to a small-scale account of variations. That is made clear in the directive.
<P>
A technical issue is involved in when the data controller must take the snapshots, and the rules are designed with an eye firmly on what is practical. The starting point is that the data subject is entitled to the information that is being processed at the time the data controller receives the request. That is the effect of the first part of clause 8(6).
<P>
In real life, however, things will evolve, and we seek to recognise that in the second part of clause 8(6), which allows the response to reflect any amendments and deletions that have been made while the response was being prepared, provided that they would have been made anyway. It makes it clear that the information is not to receive special treatment so that the response provides the data subject with an artificial picture. That safeguards the individual's right to full transparency.
<P>
If I understand the amendment correctly, it takes a slightly different tack, although I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong. It appears to require a two-part response. The first part would include the information that was being processed at the time that the request was made; the second would supply any amended information that was known to the data controller at the time the response was provided.
<P>
If that is the effect of the amendment, I am not sure that I agree that it is an improvement. The Bill's arrangements are easier to use and will be more informative in the long run about matters in which people are interested.
<P>
The amendment would undoubtedly place additional burdens on the data controller, as he or she would have to provide two sets of information--one as it was when the request was received, and the other as amended by the time the response was sent. It would not bring any significant benefits to the data subjects--it would give them more than they had asked for and probably more than they wanted. Would they want two apparently similar sets of data, and would they understand why they had received two separate sets? It would be burdensome to explain why they had ended up with two sets of information when they had requested only one.

<P>
In the Government's view, clause 8(6) takes the better course by following the system that has operated without any apparent difficulty throughout the life of the 1984 Act. It is probably better to stick with the tried and tested system, given that it seems to have worked well and we have no knowledge of complaints about it, rather than running the risk of adopting the hon. Gentleman's amendment. Given those assurances, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Saying that it has worked all right for 15 years--``If it ain't broke, why fix it?''--is always a compelling argument. I am sure that I and my hon. Friends have used it in the past. However, in the great majority of cases, the information will not have changed.
<P>
We need to decide whether the proposal to give the information as it stands when the data controller completes the request, rather than giving it as it was on the date when the request was first made, would put a great onus on him. As to whether it would involve additional work, given our earlier debate about frequency and the prospect of information changing at various intervals, the data controller would be left--even under the Government's scheme--with the choice of supplying the up-to-date information under the ``may supply'' or ``shall supply'' provisions. He may well conclude that the cheapest option is to supply the information immediately rather than wait for the data subject to make another request.
<P>
It is not a crucial point, but notwithstanding the fact that the system has not been a problem in the past, our proposal would make an improvement. However, we have listened to the Minister's explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 258, in page 7, line 28, leave out `on the ground' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`upon proof to the satisfaction of the Data Protection Commissioner.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We had a detailed debate just before lunch about the issue that lies behind the amendment. I explained the credit card industry's concern that fraudsters would use the opportunity to seek information as a means of circumventing the industry's anti-fraud arrangements. I am afraid that I gave my notes to Hansard, so this is entirely from memory.
<P>
If I understand the situation correctly, people can request information simply because they allege that it could potentially cause them damage or distress. Any implication in the file that the individual might be involved in fraudulent activity could cause distress. It would give fraudsters an opportunity to make mischievous allegations in order to block the whole process of the credit card industry's anti-avoidance procedures. The credit card industry sees the solution as providing a disincentive or discouragement to such action.
<P>
That is why the Opposition propose that rather than the matter standing on the ground specified, reference should be made to another authority. Amendment No. 258 proposes that rather than being on the ground that the data subject insists that he is suffering distress or damage, the matter should rest on the proof of the Data Protection Commissioner's satisfaction that that claim is true.
<P>
I am told that such provision would satisfy the interests of the credit card industry with regard to anti-avoidance procedures. As the matter is so important, and as I appreciate that the amendment was tabled only on Tuesday night, just in time for the Committee to debate it today under the two-day rule, I appreciate that the Minister may well want to go away and consider the amendment. He shakes his head, but a solution must be found. The Opposition are simply being helpful and constructive by suggesting one.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will agree that a solution must be found. We will consider another option when the Committee considers amendment No. 259 in a few minutes. The amendment proposes a solution that would meet the requirements. Satisfying the requirements of the Data Protection Commissioner would not be an unnecessary hurdle for someone with a genuine grievance or complaint. It would, however, be a disincentive to people involved in fraud, who are trying to circumvent anti-avoidance procedures, which are data-reliant, as the Minister knows. That is the objective of amendment No. 258.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Clause 9 introduces a new right for data subjects, in conformity with article 4(a) of the data protection directive.
<P>
The amendment seeks further restriction. Such restriction would be wrong because it would affect the right established in the directive, and because it would be counter to the spirit of the directive. I hope to demonstrate to the hon. Member for Ryedale that the amendment is unnecessary in terms of the concerns that he expressed.
<P>
The right in question entitles individuals to require data controllers to stop--or not to begin--processing their personal data in specific circumstances. The clause provides that the right may be exercised ``on the ground'' that the processing would cause unwarranted substantial damage or distress either to the individual or to another person.
<P>
Amendment No. 258 would substitute a reference to the need for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``proof to the satisfaction of the Data Protection Commissioner''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for the simple expression ``on the ground''. On reading the amendment, it was not immediately clear to me whether the intention was that individuals should have to go to the Data Protection Commissioner and make their case to her before they could exercise their right. That would be an unwieldy way to exercise the right, and a significant impediment to individuals' ability to exercise the right that the directive requires us to to give them.
<P>
The amendment would introduce a type of prior checking requirement for data subjects. That would be a serious restriction on their ability to exercise their right. It would also impose wholly unnecessary additional burdens on the Data Protection Commissioner. If that is not the Hon. Gentleman's intention--and I am sure that it is not--then he must reflect on the amendment's consequences.
<P>
The way that the clause works at the moment is that it is open for any individual to write to the controller making his case for stopping the controller processing the data. The controller is not required to stop the processing unless the ground mentioned in clause 9(1) is satisfied. In the first instance, it is for the controller to take a view on that.
<P>
If he agrees, he will stop the processing or make such adjustments to it as he sees appropriate to meet the objection. Clause 9(3)(a) requires him to write to the data subject within 21 days, saying that he intends to do so or has done so. If he does not agree, he is required by clause 9(3)(b) to respond to the data subject within 21 days explaining his reasons. It is then open to the data subject to go to the Data Protection Commissioner asking her to make an assessment under clause 41.
<P>
At that point, it will be for the Commissioner to take a view on whether clause 13 was being complied with. She would have then to take a view as to whether the ground for requiring the controller to stop processing was satisfied, so, effectively, we come to the same point as would be achieved by the amendment, albeit by a slightly different route.
<P>
I should also add that, if individuals do not want to involve the Data Protection Commissioner, they will be able to go directly to court seeking an appropriate remedy. Although that is not the ideal solution, it is their right in law.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment is open to objection on two grounds. It is undesirable because it would put an additional and unnecessary obstacle in the way of data subjects exercising their rights; at the same time, it would impose additional and unnecessary burdens on the Data Protection Commissioner.
<P>
The clause therefore already achieves the aspirations that the hon. Member for Ryedale articulated when he tabled the amendment. I hope that he feels that the amendment is unnecessary, given that the Bill covers the point in an intelligent and workable way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are grateful to the Minister for his explanation and his contention that matters could end up with the Data Protection Commissioner anyway.
<P>
In the intervening period, the data controller--in this instance a credit card company or a data processor working on its behalf--must decide whether any refusal to supply the information is unjustified. As I understand it, what concerns such companies is that a mere allegation of damage or distress is all that is required of the data subject. Those who are concerned about that will now have the opportunity to read about the Committee's deliberations. If, having done that, they feel that the matter has not been entirely resolved, we can doubtless return to it again.
<P>
We can perhaps conclude our consideration of this matter during the forthcoming debate on amendment No. 259. For the moment, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 7, line 31, leave out `substantial'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 43, in page 7, line 32, leave out `substantial'.
<P>
No. 207, in Clause 32, page 20, line 22, leave out first `substantial'
<P>
No. 208, in Clause 32, page 20, line 22, leave out second `substantial'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Amendment No. 42 is a probing amendment regarding the meaning of the word ``substantial''. The word ``substantial'' was added to certain parts of the Bill in the other place. Clause 9(1)(a) refers to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``substantial damage or substantial distress''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
test. What do the Government mean by the word ``substantial'' in this context? The test is important, because it relates to whether data controllers believe that a request made by a data subject under clause 9(1) is valid and genuine. In many respects, that goes to the heart of what we have just discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall be brief in my response to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Clause 9 follows article 14 of the directive, which requires member states to allow individuals to object to the processing of their data if they have ``compelling legitimate grounds'' for doing so. That is a very high test, and I think that it is therefore unnecessary to proceed further. We can, if the hon. Gentleman so wishes, debate all the consequential amendments about what is, or is not, substantial. However, given that the test is the crucial issue, I hope that he accepts that we are setting a good and high test, which is consistent with the directive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) wants to make a point about this.
<P>
Is the Minister saying that, because article 14(a) of the directive refers to ``compelling legitimate grounds'', the word ``substantial'' should be interpreted as a hurdle of that degree of seriousness? If so, that will come as a substantial--if I may say so--reassurance to those of us who are concerned about the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I should like to emphasise that point. Article 14 of the directive states that the individual must be able
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds related to his particular situation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill is more limiting than the directive, and the addition in another place of the word ``substantial'' makes it even more restrictive. There may be good reasons for that in terms of business costs, but the word ``substantial'' is very subjective: what is substantial to one person is not substantial to another. In addition, the note from the Data Protection Registrar points out that the original directive did not require
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``substanital damage or substantial distress''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to be a reason.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Members for Poole and for Ryedale are right: the word ``substantial'' amounts to a high test when applied to unwarranted damage or distress. The words ``compelling legitimate grounds'' are also a high test. It is hard to think of examples, but those words convey an especially strong message. They are consistent with the directive. We are trying to be as constructive as possible and I hope that the Committee will accept that the Bill uses the best available forumla.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> If we could have thought of a better expression we would have been more original than to use the old technique of seeking to delete the word ``substantial''. I say that in the best possible spirit: all our debates are about trying to ensure that the Bill's wording is right. We are in the peculiar position of having to implement a directive that cannot be adopted as law because we have to produce a legal framework. In addition, we must take into account the 14 years' experience of the 1984 Act.
<P>
We are content with the Minister's response. I am reassured that the test is as high as the use of ``compelling'' in the directive requires.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 259, in page 7, line 35, after `4', insert `and 6'.
<P>
We come back for the third try at satisfying the requirements of the credit card companies. I hope that this proposal might bear some fruit, so long as it does not fall foul of the directive.
<P>
Clause 9(2)(a) states that conditions in paragraphs 1 to 4 of schedule 2 describe exempitions to the requirement to provide the data subject with information. Schedule 2, paragraph 1, deals with circumstances in which the data subject has given his consent; paragraph 2 deals with circumstances in which the processing would be necessary in respect of a contract; paragraph 3 deals with circumstances in which the processing would be necessary for compliance with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, other than an obligation by contract'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and paragraph 4 covers circumstances in which processing is necessary
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps we shall debate what ``vital'' means when we reach schedule 2, but there are two additional conditions. We can leave to another day consideration of processing necessary for the administration of justice, but paragraph 6 describes circumstances in which the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that were included in the exemption in clause 9(2)(a), it might provide comfort to the credit card industry and, I dare say, the entire financial services industry. Trying to deal with fraud in a real issue, and the industry is nervous about fraudsters finding out that the way around this is to make an application and allege that the processing is causing damage or distress, as provided for in clause 9(1).
<P>
There is a public interest aspect to this. Credit card companies believe that the anti-avoidance processing in which they are engaged is carried out for the purposes of their legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of all or us. When fraud is committed we all pay for it. That is a suggestion. I appreciate that we tabled this amendment on Tuesday night--it may have come as a new idea, and the Minister may want to go away and think about it. I shall be looking for some pretty compelling reason why adding ``and 6'' in clause 9(2)(a) would not be considered sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Again, I can be brief in responding to the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but unfortunately I cannot be positive. Clause 9(2) provides that individuals' right to object in clause 9(1) does not apply where the processing in question is based on any of the first four paragraphs of schedule 2. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that point.
<P>
Schedule 2 sets out six conditions, any one of which must be met to permit processing. The amendment would extend the exemption to cover the sixth paragraph as well as the first four. Again, the hon. Gentleman was quite clear about that. That would mean that clause 9 applied only to procesing that relied on paragraph 5 of the schedule--very broadly, it would involve only the public sector. In terms of what the hon. Gentlemen is trying to achieve on behalf of the credit control industry, it would certainly have that effect. However desirable that may be, unfortunately it falls outside the scope of the directive. I think that the hon. Gentleman feared as much in his speech.
<P>
The directive permits us to limit the right to object to cases in which the processing is based on the fifth and sixth paragraphs in schedule 2. Those broadly cover processing that is necessary in the public interest, and that which is necessary to balance the interests of the data controller and the data subject. In this context, the latter is paramount and, indeed, unbridgeable in terms of the amendment.
<P>
We have taken full advantage of the scope of the directive for permitting exemptions, but I am afraid that we cannot go any further. Whatever the desirability or otherwise of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, it would put us in contravention of the directive. For that reason, it is impossible for me to accept it.

On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Despite the progress that we have made, I am bound to say that I am not entirely satisfied with the Minister's response. In an earlier debate on a matter that affected an outside organisation, the Minister said that it might be possible to arrange a discussion with officials if that organisation remained concerned after it had reflected on his comments. I am sure that he would agree to a similar meeting in this case, because the matter before us is important.
<P>
We shall have another opportunity under clause 28 to consider activity by data controllers that is designed to ensure that their anti-fraud, anti-crime efforts are not frustrated by the Bill's subject access provisions. As the Minister will have observed, we have tabled amendments to clause 28, so we are not quite at the end of the road. This is an important matter and if we cannot reach a resolution, the Minister might want to consult his officials and the law officers about the correct interpretation. If need be, these weighty matters could then be addressed on the Floor of the House.
<P>
On the basis of the Minister's comments thus far, however, I do not want to press the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment--for which I am grateful--I should make one point. He is particularly concerned about those in the credit industry who will be affected by the provisions and who might still be unhappy. There is, however, the overriding problem of the directive and the fact that we do not want to breach its terms. That said, I am more than happy for those involved to meet Home Office officials to discuss their concerns and, I hope, to be reassured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 192, in page 8, line 25, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5) The provisions under subsection (2) shall not apply in any case where the individual has indicated by choice that he would not wish to receive such notice.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am glad to have the opportunity to sing from the same hymn sheet as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam and his friends for once. He will be aware that if the Committee is overpowered by our eloquence and by the force of our arguments, his amendment will become technically redundant.
<P>
Amendment No. 116 would remove a provision that was added to the Bill by a Government amendment on report in another place as part of a general set of requirements for notices, introduced for data subject protection reasons, applying across clauses 9, 10 and 13, where there is a formal exercise of those new rights.
<P>
As it stands, clause 10 allows individuals to require data controllers by written notice not to process their personal data for direct marketing purposes. Subsection (2) requires controllers to respond to each notice in writing within 21 days. The Government proposed that addition following a suggestion that was made in another place, so as to strengthen individuals' rights. Paradoxically, it could have the opposite effect.
<P>
We have received strong representations about the provision from the direct marketing industry. It says that it would be difficult to comply with the provision, that it would greatly increase costs and that it would lead to the withdrawal of opt-out boxes, which would be a retrograde step for data subjects.
<P>
Although I suspect that most members of the Committee will be aware of them, I should explain what opt-out boxes are. They are the boxes that we are invited to tick on various forms, as when, for example, we buy mail order goods. A tick shows that we do not want to receive junk mail. Forms that contain ticked boxes would be notices in writing for the purposes of the clause. Such boxes are very convenient for individuals and, no doubt, for direct marketeers. Having to respond in writing to each one received would be prohibitively expensive for controllers. To avoid that extra cost, they would feel obliged to withdraw the facility. That would mean that individuals who do not want to receive junk mail would have to write a letter, which would be much less convenient for them.
<P>
We have listened carefully to people involved in direct marketing. We find their arguments persuasive. We also note the willingness of the Direct Marketing Association to amend its code of practice to achieve a comparable outcome in a more flexible way. If voluntary regulations are possible, it makes sense to adopt them.
<P>
Having said those few words, I hope that the Committee will feel that the amendment, which the hon. Member for Ryedale and I arrived at--perhaps by some of the same means--is sensible, and that it will support it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As we have discovered before, although with not quite the same degree of unanimity as now, some issues upon which the Oppostion amendments touch are appreciated by the Minister, and he sees that they relate to matters that are still to be resolved. The amendment relates to one of those matters. I declared my involvement with the incentive and self-promotion industry during consideration of the sittings motion. Unamended, the clause would create a logistical nightmare for the direct marketing industry. When thinking about the matter, I concluded that no great benefit would be served by tabling a convoluted amendment that tried to define what ``in writing'' meant. The arrangement is voluntary, and could be jeopardised by the clause. The sensible approach was to suggest the deletion of the subsection. When I checked the book of amendments, I found that my amendment also had the Minister's name on it. I am extremely grateful to him for his forbearance and agreement, as I am sure that the Direct marketing industry is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): By tabling amendment No. 192, the Liberal Democrats were seeking to achieve a similar objective. We especially wanted to address the issue of opt-out boxes, having received representations from charitable organisations such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which gave the example of a mail shot involving 100,000 in coming donations of which 10,000 may have the check box ticked. In such circumstances, the organisation would have a duty to send out 10,000 letters, directly contravening the purposes of a charity.
<P>
Amendment No. 192 sought to provide an ``opt-in'' box, with which a person could opt in to ask for written confirmation. The Minister's positive response has rendered that change unnecessary. We sought to draw a distinciton between people who have used an opt-out box and those who write specifically and explicitly to either a charity or another direct marketing organisation asking to be removed.
<P>
Aside from the issue of opt-out boxes, we hope that if somebody writes in specifically, the industry will recognise that and respond in some way according to its own code of conduct. The matter concerns the odd individual who writes in, rather than thousands of people. Some form of acknowledgement would be appropriate, even though it has been taken out of the rather clumsy statutory framework.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer (Broxtowe):</B> I should like to take this opportunity to respond to the Minister's remarks about the voluntary code, and to ask whether, when he next has discussions with the Direct Marketing Association or other groups that are interested in the clause, he could draw attention to a practice that seems to be on the borderline of subsection (1).
<P>
Some companies require customers to send their opt-out ticks to a different address from the one that they normally use. They say, ``Send an order for goods from us to point X, and if you do not want hundreds of letters from our friends, send this note to address Y''. That is making it as inconvenient as possible. I have already written to the Department about that, and I hope that it can be taken up for discussion at some point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful for those observations. It is nice for the Committee to be in harmony. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) made his point well, but I had not considered it before. I shall reflect on it and hope to get back to him either later in our proceedings or in writing. I hope that the Committee accepts the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This might be an appropriate moment to ask the Minister a question. Although I do not require an answer now, the Committee should try to address it at some point. It concerns the growing practice of unsolicited e-mails.
<P>
I am told that the first thing that many employees have to do on arriving at their office in a morning is clear their computer system of all the unwanted e-mails that been sent to them. I understand that some of them offer services or contacts that are not thought to have any serious commercial benefit--
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> In Beeston.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Indeed--particularly in Beeston. Given that this is the one clause that deals with unsolicited information, it seemed a good point at which to raise the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock </B>(Wyre Forest): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the receipt of unrequested faxes is a similar problem? Not only do they jam up one's fax machine, but they use one's own paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I agree--and they use up a limited resource in terms of the office costs allowance. It has happened to all of us. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I do not want to delay the Committee and I do not have a solution, but I thought that we should put the issue on the record. I am sure that we will all apply our minds to ways of dealing with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I draw his attention to clause 10(4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In this section `direct marketing' means the communication (by whatever means) of any advertising or marketing material which is directed to particular individuals.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would take that to mean e-mails.
<P>
As regards the general problem of unsolicited e-mails, I believe that an e-mail preference service is being planned--or perhaps it already exists. We shall have to wait and see whether it can deal with our concerns.
<P>
On unsolicited faxes, my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Lock) would receive enormous sympathy from my wife, who last week complained bitterly when a fax was sent to me at 2 am by an office equipment supplier. She was woken up and had difficulty getting back to sleep. I am sure that she would be grateful to my hon. Friend--if not to me--if I retailed the Committee's proceedings to her.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Just to wind up the debate, I can trump that experience: an unsolicited fax once set off my burglar alarm. After that, we reduced the sensor's sensitivity.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 8, line 26, after `damage', insert `whether financial or otherwise'.
<P>
There is an important point to consider about the entitlement to compensation when data controllers fail to comply with certain provisions of the Bill. The amendment is intended to clarify the exact meaning of the word ``damage'' in the opening line of the clause. Does it mean damage to reputation, or loss of opportunity? Does it refer to financial damage, such as loss of profits?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will clarify that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Clause 11(1) provides individuals with a right to compensation for any damage caused by a data controller contravening any of the Bill's requirements. That is in line with the requirements of the directive. This provision represents a strengthening of individuals' right to seek compensation. Under the 1984 Act, individuals have the right to seek compensation only for damage caused by inaccuracy, loss or unauthorised disclosure or destruction of their data.
<P>
That is a limited right. The one in the Bill goes much wider. It applies to damage caused by any breach of the requirements of the Bill, including the data protection principles, but it follows the 1984 Act in using the simple terminology of ``damage''.
<P>
The amendment is a probing amendment and seeks to explore the nature of the damage that would trigger the compensation provision. He wishes to know whether it includes compensation for both financial and other damage. I can assure him that it does. The term, used here and in the 1984 Act, is sufficiently broad to cover compensation for financial loss and injury to property or persons. I hope that that assurance satisfies the hon. Gentleman, and that he can withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister's response clarifies the point that the Bill is more widely drawn than the 1984 Act. I am sure that that explanation is helpful.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 8, line 30, at end add `unlimited'. Clause 11(2)(a) deals with a person who suffers damage as a result of the data controller's contravention of the requirements of the Bill. The amendment is intended to clarify the extent of compensation to which a person may be entitled in respect of distress suffered as a result of the circumstances described in clause 11(2)(b), which is when.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the contravention relates to the processing of personal data for the special purposes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I read that to mean that, whereas damage must accompany the distress in any other circumstances, in this case there need only be distress in respect of a contravention relating
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the processing of personal data for the special purposes,''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which we debated under clause 3.
<P>
It is important to get the matter in perspective. I suspect that we shall deal with clause 31 at some length next Thursday, so I hope that the Minister will confirm that there is no limit on the compensation, thereby rendering the word ``unlimited'' unnecessary. A court would decide the extent of the damages, but an important quid pro quo is at stake. The Bill grants extremely wide exemptions for artistic, literary or journalistic purposes, but the compensation for a data subject who suffers distress from processing for which the test of public interest is not met could be very substantial.
<P>
I hope that the Minister recognises that the clause appears to give the data subject significant potential for compensation when distress is caused by improper processing of special purposes information.

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> If this amendment were agreed, the Bill would explicitly state that there was no maximum on the amount of compensation payable for distress. The addition of the word ``unlimited'' is unnecessary and could cause confusion. It is for the court to assess the amount of compensation to reflect the damage or distress in respect of which it is to be paid. We are satisfied that the normal rules which courts apply in determining levels of compensation should apply here.
<P>
There is not artificial upper ceiling on the amount that may be awarded. There is a risk that the addition of words that do not change the meaning may be misinterpreted. For example, it might be suggested that the word was intended to influence the court, perhaps to award a greater sum than would have been appropriate as genuine compenstion.
<P>
As there is no upper limit to compensation, I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale accepts that the amendment is unnecessary and would cause unintentional confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am happy to accept the Minister's reassurance. For the Committee's benefit, I asked the Library to prepare a detailed note about the matter, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The broad effect of clause 11(2)(b) will be that if a newspaper story about an individual breaks the Press Complaints Commission's code of practice and is not consistent with the Bill, the individual will be able to apply for compensation in the courts if the story caused him distress, whether or not he is able to prove that he has also been damaged by the story.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a significant addition to the individual data subject's rights. It is important to put that on record, and I am grateful for the Minister's confirmation that there is no limit to the level of compensation and that it is entirely up to the court. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 8, line 39, after `inaccurate', insert `or misleading'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 51, in page 8, line 43, after `inaccurate', insert `or misleading'.
<P>
No. 52, in page 9, line 17, at end insert `or misleading'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The amendment deals with inaccurate data. Later, during the debate on clause 12(5), we will discuss a more precise definition of the word ``inaccurate''--that is, unless amendment No. 50 serves that purpose. I am not sure whether it does.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am informed that it does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It does not cover it. The relevant amendment appears in another group, therefore we will have a more detailed debate later. This group of amendments would add, where the word ``inaccurate'' applies, the phrase ``or misleading''.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I think that I can provide the hon. Gentleman with the reassurance that he seeks. The clause refers to inaccurate data. His amendments would add the words ``or misleading'' after the word ``inaccurate'', wherever it appears. We shall need to examine clause 12(5) to determine the meaning of inaccuracy in the context of the entire clause. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``data are inaccurate if they are incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that the hon. Gentleman will accept that that is sufficient, at least for the time being, to address his concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I am happy to leave the matter there and return to it when we discuss a later group of amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 117, in page 9, line 20, leave out from `destruction' to end of line 22.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Goverment amendment No. 122.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Clause 12 deals with the court's powers in respect of inaccurate personal data, about which we have just had a brief skirmish--or rather, an exchange of words. The amendments focus on clause 12(4), which relates to data subjects who, having been damaged as a result of a breach of the Bill, are entitled to compensation. If there is a substantial risk of further similar breaches, the court is empowered to order the ``erasure, destruction or blocking'' of the personal data.
<P>
The amendments are aimed at circumstances in which personal data that is ordered to be rectified, blocked, destroyed or erased has previously been disclosed to third parties. Clause 12(3) establishes the general rule that a court may order such parties to be informed of the data's subsequent rectification, blocking, erasure or destruction. However, subsection (4) contains no equivalent provision, allowing the court to order the data controller to notify those to whom the data had been disclosed of that rectification, blocking, destruction or erasure, where it is reasonably practicable.
<P>
New subsection (4A) in amendment No. 122 makes that provision, which is subject to the provision in new subsection (4B). The latter establishes that, when determining whether it would be reasonably practicable to notify third parties, courts must have regard in particular to the number of persons to be notified. That provision is currently found in subsection (3). Amendment No. 117 deletes it from there and the new subsection (4B) applies to both subsection (3) and to the new subsection (4A).
<P>
The changes are complex, but I hope that I have explained the amendments sufficiently for members of the Committee to understand their purpose. They make desirable improvements to the Bill and I therefore commend them to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 118, in clause 12, page 9, line 24, leave out from first `of' to `of' in line 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any contravention by a data controller of any of the requirements'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may consider Government amendments Nos. 119 to 121.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Like the previous group, these amendments relate to clause 12(4). Amendment No. 118 makes a simple drafting change to bring it into line with clause 11.
<P>
Clause 12(4)(a) currently refers to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``failure of a data controller to comply with the provisions of the Act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 11(1) is slightly differently worded. It refers to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any contravention by a data controller of any of the requirements of this Act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 118 substitutes the wording from clause 11 into clause 12(4), thus achieving greater consistency.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 119, 120 and 121 clarify clause 12(4). As it stands, it is not clear to which data it applies. Subsection (4)(a) does not refer to the data, but simply to the data controller's contravention of the Bill. Although the final words of the subsection refer to the erasure, destruction or blocking of the data, it does not establish to which data that applies. Amendments Nos. 119, 120 and 121 are intended to do just that.
<P>
Amendment No. 119 provides that the data controller's contravention must be 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in respect of any personal data''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To put it more simply, it establishes the particular data to which the subsection applies. Amendments Nos. 120 and 121 are consequential on that.
<P>
As with the previous group of amendments, the changes made by this group are largely technical and simply improve clause 12(4). I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I think that I understood what the Minister said. The amendment seems entirely sensible and clarifies the Bill. The Opposition have no objection to it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 119, in page 9, line 25, after `Act' insert

No. 120, in page 9, line 27, after `failure' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in respect of those data'.<P>

<P>
No. 121, in page 9, line 29, leave out third `the' and insert `any of those'.
<P>
No. 122, in page 9, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) Where the court makes an order under subsection (4) it may, where it considers it reasonably practicable, order the data controller to notify third parties to whom the data have been disclosed of the erasure, destruction or blocking.
<P>
 (4B) In determining whether it is reasonably practicable to require such notification as is mentioned in subsection (3) or (4A) the court shall have regard, in particular, to the number of persons who would have to be notified.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 9, leave out lines 30 and 31.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 53, in page 9, line 31, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or misleading as to any matter of fact'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`as to any matter of fact or misleading'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If the hon. Member for Ryedale hopes that amendment No. 123, which would delete clause 12(5), means that I have changed my mind about the definition of ``inaccurate'', which we debated earlier, I am afraid that I am going to disappoint him.
<P>
The amendment needs to be read with Government amendments to later provisions of the Bill, principally amendment No. 133, which relates to clause 64, and amendment No. 136, which relates to schedule 1. I am sorry to have to make hon. Members jump around in the Bill. Together, they make a series of purely technical changes that simplify and thus improve the Bill's structure.
<P>
As the Committee has seen, clause 12 makes provision for inaccurate data to be rectified, blocked, erased or destroyed. The fourth data protection principle in schedule 1 requires personal data to be accurate. Clause 12(5) contains a definition of inaccurate data. Paragraph 7 of part II of schedule 1, which interprets the fourth principle, contains an identical definition. That repetition could be confusing and it would be better to have a single definition. The purpose of the amendments is to achieve that.
<P>
Government amendment No. 123 makes the first of that series of changes by deleting clause 12(5). The later Government amendments will delete the corresponding definition in schedule 1 and replace them both with an identical definition in clause 64.
<P>
I apologise for the technical nature of that explanation. The changes are, however, necessary for consistency and I hope that they are acceptable.
<P>
I said all that I wanted to say about the terms ``inaccurate'' and ``misleading'' in our earlier debate on them. Amendment No. 53 raises that same point, and I have nothing to add. The Government prefer the existing formulation, which is drawn from the 1984 Act has worked well.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Two points need to be made. First, the Minister tells us that, on reflection, he wants just one definition of ``inaccurate'', with a reference to it in the schedule. I have no objection to that entirely sensible approach; it is a belt-and-braces job. It is not necessary to have both definitions, and we have discussed similar issues on other amendments.
<P>
If the Minister accepts my argument on amendment No. 53, he will have to reconsider the wording of amendment No. 133 to clause 64; if he does not, we might have to return to the matter on Report if we want to persist with it. I am sure that we cannot technically seek to amend an amendment that has been moved, although we could table an alternative.
<P>
The Minister said that the existing provision had worked all right for 15 years. Given the increased use of computerised records, however, there is an argument for including the concept of incompleteness in the definition of ``inaccuracy''. As we have already mentioned, a person could have information on his file that was accurate as far as it went. However, it could be misleading because it was incomplete. For example, it could include a record of a county court judgment, but the reference would be incomplete unless it noted that the judgment had been discharged. Its incompleteness could make it misleading, which is why amendment No. 53 is phrased as it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that records could be incomplete, but when system analysts have tried to define data over the past 15 years they have been warned to take into account the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1984. It is unnecessary to add to the 1984 Act, which has worked well in obliging people to ensure that data comply with requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As I have said already, the approach to the 1984 Act for a long time has been, ``It's worked alright up to now, so why change?'' One of the benefits of the Bill is that it allows us to try to improve the regime. My point is simply that there must be many instances in which inaccuracy--that is, that which misleads--results from incompleteness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> One problem is that the information available to the data controller may not indicate whether a judgment, for example, has been discharged. How would the amendment comply with the fourth principle of schedule 1, which requires that data is accurate, if the data controller has only half the picture because of circumstances beyond his control?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> the hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The corollary is that we must strike the right balance when we are discussing giving data subjects rights when inaccurate data cause damage and distress. The amendment is intended to clarify what might be misleading, and I think that incompleteness is one aspect of the problem.
<P>
However, as the Minister is about to delete the line to which my amendment would add the words, I see no point in persisting.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
