Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The clause introduces the principle that, in normal circumstances, there should be only one appeal to the courts in relation to any matter. The Bowman review found that many cases reaching the civil division of the Court of Appeal had already been considered on appeal by a lower court and concluded that that was inconsistent with the principles of certainty and proportionality which are at the heart of the wider civil justice reforms. It will of course remain possible to appeal to the Court of Appeal, but under more restricted circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> One of my concerns is that under the new civil justice procedure, a number of decisions made by district judges should perhaps be considered by the Court of Appeal. Looking ahead, am I right that under clause 43, leap-frogs would be allowed on points interpreting the new civil justice rules? Under the old rules, we had terrible trouble with, for example, order 17, rule 11, which could be sorted out only by mass appeals to the court of appeal. If that is the case, the clause is a welcome development.
<P>
I do not know whether my hon. Friend has seen the column by Marcel Berlins in The Guardian today; he points out the anomaly of appeals from Scottish courts of appeal to the House of Lords not having to be on points of public importance. Perhaps he could examine that at some stage, although there might not be time today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Clause 41 allows permission to be given only by the Court of Appeal. In many instances, the High Court judge acts as a preliminary sieve, and I wonder whether the Government are restricting the courts unduly. The High Court judge often refuses leave to appeal; he has confidence in his judgment and says in effect, ``If you think I've got it wrong, go to the Court of Appeal and ask for leave because the Court of Appeal should be allowed to control access to itself.'' Might the Government leave open the possibility that the High Court judge should be the first trigger, because the frequent refusal by that judge to grant leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal dispenses with any further thoughts about an appeal? The Government may retain that discretion to the High Court judge because they do not want to open the floodgates to appeals. I appreciate the Government's intention in regard to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I confirm to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon that clause 43 anticipates the leap-frog appeals to which he referred although they would not be related only to the Woolf provisions. I hope that they are not the cause of many appeals, but there may be a number of them. My hon. Friend has a considerable advantage in Scottish matters. I am exceedingly reluctant to get involved in the issue that he raised, but if he will be patient, I am sure that an answer can in due course be found and I will write to him accordingly.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, he is right in what he said about the High Court judge.
<P>
The purpose of clauses 40 and 41 is to establish two of the principles that were at the heart of the findings of Sir Jeffery Bowman; that there should be only a single appeal in principle, not the multiplicity of appeals that can occasionally occur, and that there should generally be leave to secure an appeal. That need will generally be granted by the judge or court that is the next step up in the various levels of the appeal process. Under clause 40, the High Court judge will play a part in that.
<P>
The provision is therefore designed to provide a more up-to-date appeals process. Sir Jeffery Bowman found many problems with the backlog of cases in the Court of Appeal criminal division and set out in his review a number of suggested solutions that are incorporated in that part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Clause 41(2) takes out criminal matters; we are talking only about civil matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That is right. We will deal with criminal questions in a few moments. Essentially, Sir Jeffery Bowman concerned himself with civil procedure and the importance of ensuring that the civil division does not face the backlogs from which it currently suffers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> In broad terms, I welcome the provisions in the clause, but I would like clarification on a number of matters. I am particularly concerned about the mechanism of appeal in administrative cases that often start in the magistrates court. For example, I occasionally dealt with street market cases, particularly in respect of one local authority in the east end of London. Those cases would commence at the market tribunal or the market committee of the council. From there, appeal would go to the magistrates court, then to the Crown court, then to the divisional court and then to the Court of Appeal. In one case, an application was even made for leave to appeal to the House of Lords.
<P>
Will the Minister explain how that process will slot into the Bill's framework? The Bill mentions county courts and the High Court, but does not deal with an area of administrative law which, although it is clearly under civil jurisdiction, starts in the magistrates court. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I have set out the proposed framework and the principles that underpin the Bowman review. We shall deal with another principle proportionality when we discuss clause 42. Essentially, the purpose is to provide only one level of appeal from whatever particular court exercising whatever particular jurisdiction. As we shall see, in the light of reforms to procedure and to different jurisdictions, appeals may be made to bodies that are different from those presently constituted. The provisions in the Bill will empower that  process.
<P>
In answer to the question raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, there will be an appeal from each stage. Generally, the appeal will be by leave of the next stage in the appeals process, subject to the power of the civil division of the Court of Appeal to deal with matters of public importance. Clearly, the extent of appeals will be interpretations of the law or procedure. That was Sir Jeffery Bowman's precise recommendation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I understand the Minister's point.  I was particularly exercised by the example of a magistrates court that deals with a civil jurisdiction issue such as administration of street markets. For example, it might be felt unusual for lay justices to determine whether a right of appeal lay to the Crown court, and for the justices to withhold their consent. I appreciate that the matter is very different when it arises in respect of a district judge or county court judge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I apologise if I have not made matters clear. Permission will be granted by the tier above the decision-making body. With regard to the hon. Gentleman's example, it would not be the justices who would give leave but the level above them in the appeals process.
<P>

<H4><center>Power to prescribe alternative destination</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> As I said, the clause will introduce a further principle, proportionality. The civil division of the Court of Appeal has in recent years experienced a substantial increase in its work load, resulting in significant delays in the hearing of appeals. The Bowman review concluded that the Court of Appeal was being asked to deal with a number of appeals that were of insufficient substance for consideration by the country's most senior judges. One of the principles at the heart of the civil justice reforms is that of proportionality. In other words, the system should offer appropriate procedures as a reasonable cost. An effective system of appeals is a vital part of the civil justice system, and the principle of proportionality is equally applicable to it. Appeals should be heard at the level that is most appropriate to the nature of the case.
<P>
To address the current problems, therefore, it is necessary to take away from the Court of Appeal those cases which do not need to be heard there. That will release resources to allow the Court of Appeal to reduce its current backlog and ensure that it is better placed to deal with the further increases in its work load that are anticipated from the implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the introduction of the new civil procedure rules.
<P>
To do that, it is necessary to amend the existing routes of appeal. However, these changes are occurring at a time of significant reform in the civil justice system as a whole. What is required, therefore, is the flexibility for systems to be adapted to ensure that the procedures in place are responsive to this continuing programme of reform and make the most appropriate use of the available resources in each part of the system. That will be achieved by introducing an order-making power enabling a Lord Chancellor to determine appeal routes in secondary legislation.
<P>
An effective system is of great importance to any civil justice system and there may be concern at the prospect of appeal routes being determined in subordinate legislation rather than being set out on the face of the statute. In response to those concerns, I draw the Committee's attention to the way in which the clause has been drafted. Although it allows for a Lord Chancellor to change current appeal routes, it does not allow him to remove any existing right for a case to be appealed. The intention of the clause is to ensure that appeals are heard at the level that is appropriate to their weight and complexity. It is not intended to deprive litigants who can demonstrate sufficient justification for an appeal of the right to have a higher court consider their case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I do not have much quarrel with the intention behind the clause, although I am concerned about the way in which it is drafted. It was not easy to anticipate what the Minister would say. Words such as ``proportionality'' do not jump out from clause 42, albeit that it is entitled:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Power to prescribe alternative destination''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of any given appeal.
<P>
The Minister said that the backlog in the Court of Appeal is addressed by the Bill and the Bowman report, which we debated as long ago as November 1997 I am sure that he remembers that day. The Government need to control the flow of cases by turning the tap one way or the other. All I ask is that we should have an idea of how the Lord Chancellor envisages using the orders that are presaged in clause 42(1). I see what the Bill says, but I should like some examples to take home with me tonight to help me sleep more easily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I apologise to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough and other Committee members if, in an effort to keep our proceedings as brief as possible, I did not go into enough detail. The hon. and learned Gentleman has prompted me and I shall provide him with some examples. I recognise that it is important to give an idea of how the Lord Chancellor envisages using the order-making power.
<P>
In July 1998, the Lord Chancellor issued a consultation paper, ``Reform of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Proposals for Change to Constitution and Jurisdiction'', which set out his proposals for implementing the recommendations of the Bowman review team. The intention is to introduce the routes of appeal identified in that paper for civil non-family cases. Appeals will, in general, be heard by a judge who is immediately superior to the judge who heard the case at first instance.
<P>
Appeals against fast-track cases that are heard by a district judge will be made to a circuit judge, and those that are heard by a circuit judge, to a High Court judge. As for multi-track cases, it is proposed that appeals of interlocutory decisions that are made at first instance by a district judge, will be made to a circuit judge, by a master or circuit judge to a High Court judge, and by a High Court judge to the Court of Appeal. It is also proposed that in multi-track cases, appeals of final orders, regardless of the court of first instance, will be to the Court of Appeal.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Again, I have no reason not to welcome the proposals, which will do a great deal to streamline the system of appeals. I hope that they will shorten the time that people have to wait before appeals are heard. I assume that some thought will be given I appreciate that this may fall outside the Minister's remit as to how the development of our common law will be affected by precedent and the reporting of cases as a result of the proposals.
<P>
This is an important issue. The trend of recent years has been to move cases from the High Court to county courts. Cases that involve important legal decisions and which have a bearing on subsequent cases are not being reported. Unless a system is established to get round that, the problem will become more acute. Where will the important appeals that are heard by a High Court judge appear in the hierarchy of reported decisions on which people subsequently rely? I hope that the Minister will give that some thought. No doubt the Lord Chancellor will also consider it in conjunction with the judiciary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman is identifying one aspect of the problem. Potentially important cases may go unreported because they are dealt with too low in the system. However, he should concentrate on the other side of the problem. Too many cases that are of no great legal significance are reaching the Court of Appeal. The most distinguished judges are dealing with matters that should be dealt with lower down the system. Sir Jeffrey Bowman reached that conclusion. The recommendations are designed to filter out the cases that should be dealt with at an appropriate level and, consistent with his concerns about the development of common law, should be reported to provide appropriate precedent in our system. However, it follows that cases that should be dealt with lower in the system should be kept at that level and should not provide the illumination in the law that concerns the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>Assignment of appeals to Court of Appeal</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Consistent with what I have said, it is important that appeals should be heard at a level that is most appropriate to the nature of the case. The principle of proportionality runs through the civil justice reforms. Proposed changes to the routes of appeal and the introduction of the principle of one level of appeal aim to achieve that proportionality. Some cases that previously would have reached the Court of Appeal will no longer do so. However, it is not the Government's intention to prevent individual appeals, which, due to their weight and complexity, require the attention of the Court of Appeal, from reaching that court.
<P>
The clause allows flexibility by enabling appeals to be directed to the Court of Appeal even where they would not normally lie to that court the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. That will be achieved by permitting the court that made the decision that is being appealed, or the court to which the appeal would usually lie, to refer a case up to the Court of Appeal. The clause provides for that procedure to be governed by rules of court, which will ensure that there is a framework for the exercise of the power so that only cases that merit the consideration of the Court of Appeal are directed to that court.
<P>
The clause will also invest in the Master of Rolls the authority to call up certain appeals to the Court of Appeal. It is envisaged that the Master of the Rolls would exercise his authority to settle a point that is giving rise to a large number of appeals or affecting a large number of cases. The Court of Appeal would therefore be able to set a precedent to be filtered down to the lower courts or to call up appeals so that they can be heard together. It may also be appropriate, perhaps because of the publicity that is generated by a high-profile case, for a Court of Appeal judgment to be requested.
<P>
The provisions of the clause ensure that the drive for proportionality does not result in an appeal system that compromises the fairness and quality of appellate decision making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Again, briefly, how much time will be spent on this administrative exercise by the Master of the Rolls, who, as head of the civil division of the Court of Appeal, spends a great deal of time listening to arguments and giving judgments? Will it increase the time that he is out of court? Will he be doing the job of the registrar of civil appeals, which is abolished by clause 47? What will happen under clause 43(1)(b) if a lower court decides that a case should go before the Court of Appeal, because it represents a matter of legal or public interest, and the Master of the Rolls decides that it should be heard by a lower court instead?
<P>
Let us take the example of a district or county court judge saying that a case should go before the Court of Appeal, and the Master of the Rolls responding that similar cases have been dealt with 115 times before and that it could be speedily dealt with by a high court judge in chambers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Obviously, I cannot quantify precisely how much time the Master of the Rolls might spend on these provisions, but I believe that such circumstances will be relatively exceptional. Problems may arise, especially procedural ones, and a number of cases may build up which require the Court of Appeal's judgment on points of law or procedure. This is a means of ensuring that those cases reach the Court of Appeal as quickly as possible.
<P>
However, I expect that that will be a relatively exceptional occurrence, like a reference to the European Court of Justice, and not one that will involve the Master of the Rolls day to day in determining which cases should move quickly to the Court of Appeal. It is not suggested that the Master of the Rolls should replace the functions of the registrar, who will continue to have a distinctive position within the system.
<P>
On the final point, paragraphs (a) and (b) are alternatives, in the sense that it will be open for the court from which an appeal is made to direct the case to be heard instead by the Court of Appeal. However, the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has put his finger on a matter of potential difficulty. What would happen if the Court of Appeal were to decide that a case before it did not warrant such a high degree of consideration on what may be a routine point? We shall look into that matter.
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 154 to 156.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendments are minor, technical and, I hope, uncontroversial. They correct defects in the drafting of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. The changes have been identified, in consultation with the Law Commission, as being necessary to facilitate the consolidation of certain enactments relating to appeals against sentence. They will be needed before a consolidation Bill can be introduced in a future Session of Parliament.
<P>
The amendment to section 8(1)(b) will make it clear that the Court of Appeal has power to set aside the order for retrial when directing the entry of a judgment and verdict of acquittal. This was clearly the intention of the legislation.
<P>
The amendment to section 9(2) is to correct a defective consequential amendment in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. That Act amended the 1968 Act to enable the Court of Appeal to deal with appeals against Crown Court convictions for summary offences related to indictable only offences transferred to it. The proposed amendment would correct the omission of a reference to the relevant paragraph in schedule 3 to the 1998 Act.
<P>
The amendment to section 10(4) is to correct a missed consequential amendment when youth custody was introduced, so as to include a reference to ``detention'' in addition to ``imprisonment''. Section 10 provides a right of appeal against sentence in the case of Crown court convictions for summary offences and subsection (4) deals with two or more sentences passed on the same day or forming substantially one sentence.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Except in limited circumstances, it is presently the case that the Court of Appeal must hear appeals in courts of three or more judges. This somewhat restrictive provision prevents the Court of Appeal from making the most efficient use of its resources because the court is not given an opportunity to match judicial resources to the weight, importance and complexity of each individual appeal. The clause will enable the civil division of the Court of Appeal to hear appeals in courts of one, two or more judges. The flexibility that that will introduce will help to ensure that valuable judicial resources are not wasted on cases that have no real need of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I have a brief question. We have found that High Court judges often sit in the Court of Appeal to make up the numbers. Will it continue to sit as a one-man or two-man court the judges happen to be men rather than women and will lord justices of appeal rather than High Court judges sit on such occasions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Our intention is that the clause's greater flexibility will reduce the need for three-judge courts to hear every appeal. It follows that the tendency to use High Court judges will not be as great, although I should not rule it out entirely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sure that the Minister recognises that, at least with regard to interlocutory matters, the Court of Appeal often sits with only two lord justices. He referred to backlogs and to the need to make the best use of judicial time. In view of his comments on the clause and on the clauses that immediately precede it, does he agree that more judges should be appointed to the Court of Appeal and to the High Court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The purpose of our reforms is to identify what is wrong with the court's present administrative operation and to ensure that judicial resources are used as effectively and flexibly as possible. The clause will achieve those ends. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman agrees that we should give the proposals an opportunity to work before reaching any conclusions about the number of judges. If we continued with the present arrangements, his conclusion would be inescapable. However, greater flexibility should mean that we can constrain the number of additional senior judges and therefore avoid additional expenses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am sure that the Minister is right but, if I can personalise in this context, one of the great unsung heroes of our invisible earnings in this country is the way in which foreign litigants use English jurisdiction to resolve commercial disputes in particular. I have heard that the New York jurisdiction is increasingly frequently used to litigate commercial disputes and that contracts can contain a provision stating that disputes under a given contract or charter party should be resolved in the courts of New York rather than of England, although that is a separate matter. Foreign litigants or foreign commercial parties may believe that they will not get speedy justice or access to a sufficient number of judges of sufficient quality in arbitrations or disputes in our courts. The Minister may presently therefore have to increase the number of judges on the benches to ensure that we do not lose that valuable source of foreign earnings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman. The United Kingdom should remain an attractive place in which international legal disputes can be resolved. As he said, it is important that the United Kingdom's procedures are perceived to be fair and speedy. If there is a temptation to specify other jurisdictions for the resolution of such matters, that may be because our procedures are considered to be too cumbersome and slow. That is precisely why we want to introduce major reforms to the process and to the civil division of the Court of Appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): I have a short question for my hon. Friend the Minister. What effect will the Human Rights Act 1998 have on the clause? It is expected that a considerable amount of work will go to the Court of Appeal. The second point is that many decisions at that level of the judiciary are finely balanced. A number of notable historical cases, including the landmark Donoghue v. Stevenson decision, were determined by an uneven in terms of numbers but finely balanced bench. Does the Minister accept that split benches may cause difficulty, especially in relation to Human Rights Act 1998 decisions?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I can assure my hon. Friend that the clause is not intended to prevent cases that merit consideration by a court of three or more judges from receiving it. All Committee members know that the Court of Appeal plays a significant role in clarifying and developing the law and must continue to do so. The clause provides for the Master of the Rolls, with the Lord Chancellor's agreement, to give directions about the minimum number of judges who may hear particular categories of case or cases with particular characteristics. Subject to those directions, the Master of the Rolls or a designated lord justice will have the power to determine the number of judges that will hear a particular appeal.
<P>
I recognise my hon. Friend's concern about Human Rights Act 1998 cases. As those cases come for interpretation, especially in the early years after implementation, they will set important precedents for the rest of the legal system. I anticipate that at least three judges will be employed in such cases.

<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General (Mr. Ross Cranston):</B> It may help the Committee if I explain briefly that the clause replicates the effect of section 58 of the Supreme Court Act 1981. The effect is set out in the explanatory notes. The types of matters that will be covered will be applications for the extension of time for the setting down of an appeal and security for costs. Such matters are plainly unsuitable for consideration by the House of Lords and it is extremely unlikely, at present, that such leave would be obtained. The clause will maintain the existing requirements for the review of such decisions.

<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I shall be brief, as this matter was referred to earlier by my hon. Friend the Minister. The Bowman review of the Court of Appeal concluded that, while those working in the civil appeals office were hard-working and dedicated, the structure of that office was not best suited to efficient and effective case management. A single administrative head of civil appeals has therefore been appointed, as recommended by the Bowman review. He will hold line management responsibility for the staff of the civil appeals office and will be accountable to the chief executive of the Court Service.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I shall be brief, as this and the succeeding two clauses aim to allow judicial resources to be targeted on the most complex cases, which require a divisional court. At present, criminal appeals that go directly from the High Court to the House of Lords must have been heard by a divisional court, regardless of the complexity of the case. The aim of the new provision is to allow judicial review, and appeals by way of case stated in criminal matters, to be routinely heard by a single High Court judge. Rules would be made to give the single judge a discretionary power to allocate matters to a divisional court if that were the most appropriate forum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I rise to ask a simple question, which the Solicitor-General can answer quickly. Do clauses 48, 49 and 50 imply that the divisional court will cease to exist? It might not matter because, whatever the court is called, the judges in the divisional court can carry out its function.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> No, that is not the intention. The divisional court will concentrate on the most complex cases.

Clauses 49 and 50 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 51</center></H4>
<H4><center>Cases stated by Crown Court for opinion of High Court</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I should explain that the provision was recommended by the Law Commission in report 2.26 on administrative law. It will rectify a small lacuna in existing statutory provisions that relate to sending cases to the High Court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I wonder whether the Solicitor-General would amplify his remarks, because they relate to a matter that I had intended to raise on clause 48, but which might more appropriately be raised here. Cases stated by the Crown court usually go to the divisional court for two judges to pronounce upon. What does the clause actually achieve? Is its purpose to replace the divisional court, or is it simply intended to relate to the few categories of cases that are stated directly to  the High Court?
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I said that the intention was to recognise a small lacuna. That lacuna developed accidentally when the courts of quarter sessions were replaced by Crown courts, so it is a small change. It confirms, on an express statutory basis, the High Court's power of disposal of cases stated by the Crown court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful. It is a small lacuna, but one that I expect is frequently invoked. If one goes to the Crown court, usually on appeal from a magistrates court, and the Crown court judge reaches a decision with which one disagrees, the system of appeal means that one must go to yet another single judge for a determination in the High Court. I understand  that the leave provisions that we were considering for civil appeals will not apply because the quarter sessions matters to which reference is being made include civil jurisdiction of the Crown court. Am I right? It would be helpful if that could be clarified, because I find it difficult to follow.

<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> The hon. Gentleman might be assisted by the explanatory notes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am trying to follow the explanatory notes, but with difficulty.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> They are fairly detailed, but perhaps it would help if I explained that this replaces section 28A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 with a new provision that has been widened to incorporate cases stated from the Crown court, as well as from magistrates courts. Perhaps it will help if I write to the hon. Gentleman.

Clause 51 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 52</center></H4>
<H4><center>Vice-president of the Queen's Bench Division</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> The clause follows on from the intention of the previous Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay. It was always his intention that the appointment of a vice-president of the Queen's bench division should be put on a statutory basis when the opportunity arose. The Government have now adopted that proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> That is a good idea, if I may say so, but I shall now reduce the level of our debate by discussing the sordid subject of coin. Do the Government envisage that the vice-president of the Queen's bench division will receive an enhanced salary, or will he enjoy the office on his salary as Lord Justice of Appeal?
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I would have to take that question on notice. I anticipate that there would be some sort of salary enhancement, but I cannot commit the Lord Chancellor to that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 53</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reporting of Proceedings Relating to Children</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> The clause will make a modest change to the law on access to and reporting of court proceedings involving children, but I believe that it will be a useful one. It prohibits the publication of any material intended, or likely, to identify a child who is involved in proceedings under the Children Act 1989, not only, as at present, when the case is proceeding in a magistrates court, but also in the High Court or in a county court. That will unify and clarify the restrictions on reporting of Children Act cases at all levels of court, and it will remove the present need, in the higher courts, to apply separately for an injunction restraining publication.
<P>
The Government acknowledge that open justice is, of course, an important feature of our legal system, but there are special considerations when children are involved. Children need to be protected from harmful publicity. The clause will achieve that aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Is the prohibition under section 97 of the Children Act 1989 mandatory or discretionary? Does the judge retain a discretion about whether to prohibit the identification of children? I ask that because similar concerns have been raised in relation to another Bill that is currently passing through the House, the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill. Members of the press and others who are interested in the freedom of the press are concerned that judges will be required willy-nilly to prevent the identification of children, although the circumstances of a case may mean that that is not necessary for the child's protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I echo the query of my hon. and learned Friend. During my years at the independent bar I specialised in child protection and family law, and I agree will the Solicitor-General that this is an important and welcome proposal. I am glad that the Government are unifying the law in this context.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those remarks. As I understand it, this is a mandatory requirement. However, I should point out to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that the proposal is solely concerned with proceedings under the Children Act 1989 and that, in that sense, it has a narrow ambit.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I point out to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon that the proposal is the result of a new clause that was proposed in another place by Lord Phillips of Sudbury. We have already made changes to youth court procedures to achieve greater openness, and the clause will extend that process. Lord Phillips was concerned about the promotion of a sense of citizenship, and he wanted children to be able to witness our criminal justice system in action.

<H4><center>Petty Sessions Areas</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The clause will have two main effects. First, it will redefine petty sessions areas in terms of commission areas. That will give a magistrates court committee the freedom to decide the most appropriate and efficient petty sessions structure that best suits its local circumstances, and it will be free of the constraints of local government boundaries. Secondly, the distinction between a petty sessions area and a petty sessions division will be removed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 40, line 28, leave out `in relation to' and insert `appointed by'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 160 to 165.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The amendments introduce drafting improvements to the clause and introduce a replacement schedule 10. The clause describes the role of justices' chief executives, their responsibility for making arrangements for the efficient and effective administration of the magistrates courts and their powers to delegate duties to staff.
<P>
Amendment No. 165 will insert a new subsection in section 40 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. It will confirm that the justices' chief executive, who is appointed by a magistrates court committee, is the chief executive for every magistrates court for the committee's area, and for every petty sessions area for which the magistrates court committee is the committee. It will also confirm that the chief executive is the chief executive to the justices acting for all such petty sessions areas.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 159 and 162 to 164 are minor drafting amendments that improve the presentation of the relevant subsections. Amendment No. 160 further describes the functions conferred or imposed on justices' chief executives. It will confirm that the functions referred to constitute `all of' the executives' functions.
<P>
Amendment No. 161 will remove `administrative' from the description of responsibilities that may be allocated by a justices' chief executive, and makes it clear that the justices' chief executive will be able to allocate all responsibilities among the staff of the committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 166 will introduce a replacement schedule 10 and lists the many provisions that require amendment in order to transfer responsibility for administrative functions from justices' clerks to justices' chief executives.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 160, in page 40, line 37, after `of', insert `all of'.<P>

<P>

(a) the justices' chief executive for every magistrates' court for the committee's area,
<P>
(b) the justices' chief executive for every petty sessions area for which they are the committee, and
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Having rather tediously explained the amendments, I should explain the purpose of the clause. It defines more clearly justices' chief executives' responsibilities and makes it clear that they are responsible for ensuring that all magistrates courts within the magistrates court committee's area are managed efficiently and effectively.
<P>
The justices' chief executive is the chief officer for the area and is directly accountable to the magistrates court committee. He or she is responsible for the administration of the courts, including all functions exercised in the area, excepting the legal functions carried out by the justices' clerks.
<P>
The clause will transfer responsibility for allocating staff duties and determining staff procedures from the magistrates court committee to the justices' chief executive. The magistrates court committee will set the strategy, budget and standards for the area and should not be involved in day-to-day administration. The clause clarifies the relationships between and functions of the committee and its officers. Clarity of responsibility is one of the foundations of better management and improved accountability in the administration of magistrates courts. The clause will make that improvement.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Successive Governments have taken the view that warrants against fine defaulters and those who breach community sentences would be executed more efficiently by magistrates courts than by the police. The Government are now putting that proposal into action. Warrant execution is not core police work and the transfer of that responsibility will enable them to concentrate resources on their main task of fighting crime. Placing that responsibility on the courts will provide a sharper focus, while the application of administrative targets will ensure that this work is given a higher priority than is possible at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I have received a letter, as my other hon. Members, from Mr. Philip Evans, secretary of the Certificated Bailiffs Association, in which he raises concerns about clauses 71 to 75 and makes some important points. He reports that the Minister of State has stated that it is sufficient for the clauses simply to give civilians responsibility for execution of warrants. The Certificated Bailiffs Association disagrees and raises four important concerns, with which I agree.
<P>
First, an arresting officer should be able to protect himself or herself and other prisoners by searching the person being arrested for offensive weapons or hypodermic syringes, which are even more dangerous.
<P>
Secondly, Mr. Evans states that an arresting officer should have a status appropriate to the task. Throughout Europe, including Scotland, civilians with that responsibility are either officers of the court or state officials.
<P>
Thirdly, Mr. Evans maintains that a defaulter should not be beyond arrest simply by remaining on private property during the day. Even if civilians cannot force entry, they should be able peacefully to enter private property to make an arrest in the same way as they can seize goods.
<P>
Fourthly, Mr. Evans wants clarification of the power to use force to restrain a violent prisoner for example, the use of handcuffs when appropriate. I agree with him that that is particularly important.
<P>
Under the provisions, civilians will inevitably and increasingly become responsible for arresting defaulters who fail to submit to, among other penalties, community service or probation following a criminal conviction. Mr. Evans argues that the provisions are flawed because they fail to give the civilians concerned either the status applicable to the task or powers of arrest. He is worried that the provisions may bring enforcement of the criminal law into the same disrepute as some controversial methods of civil law enforcement.
<P>
Mr. Evans suggests that the move from police to civilian enforcement will foster a culture change. Although the provisions may work well for the first six months or a year, there will come a time when people who are subject to the powers realise that civilians do not have the same powers that the police had. Mr. Evans states that civilians already make arrests in some areas of the country, but, unlike the police, civilian enforcement officers do not have the same holding facilities and must arrest a defaulter when the court is open. Unlike the police, civilians cannot enter private property to make an arrest and defaulters can escape simply by walking away.
<P>
Mr. Evans points out that under the provisions civilians will make arrests only during office hours, in public places and with the consent of those being arrested. As the police, understandably, give low priority to such arrests, it follows that many more defaulters will face arrest under the new arrangements. Shrewd defaulters will slip through gaps in the law, bad publicity will follow and we all know that hard cases make bad law. Nothing generates sympathy more than a good tale of woe at the hands of despicable bailiffs or officers. We all know that the press, rightly, are largely indiscriminate when reporting perceived abuses.
<P>
Mr. Evans believes that the Lord Chancellor's Department is confident that an undertaking from the Association of Chief Police Officers to provide assistance to civilian officers will overcome the problems, but his organisation doubts that. ACPO accepts that its current enforcement responsibilities are, perhaps inevitably, far down the list of priorities for the police. Few arrests are made and, consequently, little time and effort is required. If civilians enforce more warrants than previously, the police may find that they need more resources to react to requests for assistance. I do not know whether the Minister, in the compliance cost assessment, which all Government Departments must now make, has made any enquiries of his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer or whether his right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will go cap in hand for more money arising from the Lord Chancellor's new provisions in the Bill and I wonder whether those implications have been examined.
<P>
The Certificated Bailiffs Association says that Ministers believe that it would be too controversial to give private sector enforcement officers powers of arrest, and perhaps the Minister will respond to that. Mr. Evans is surprised that when court enforcement officers, precisely the same group that is covered by clause 72, and private and public sector bailiffs are covered by provisions and regulations, the Government cannot confidently give civilian enforcement officers adequate powers.
<P>
Will the Minister respond to those matters and specifically state whether he and officials had meetings with Mr. Evans or his association's executive council, or with any practising enforcement officers before introducing these controversial proposals? If he has not had such meetings, perhaps he would consider amending the provisions on Report if he cannot undertake to do so today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not want to repeat the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath, because that is unnecessary. I met the Certificated Bailiffs Association and its comments gave me cause for slight concern.
<P>
I wholly endorse the main thrust of the proposals. It is clear to me that the transfer to a new agency is necessary, because the police no longer have the resources to make arrests, so they pick up defaulters only when they pick them up for another offence and then see from their computer that they need to be brought to court. That is unsatisfactory and should be dealt with.
<P>
I am mindful of the helpful letter that the Solicitor General wrote to me after my intervention on Second Reading. He outlined the Government's view and said that the powers that civilian enforcement officers should be given will be reviewed in 2000. However, there is still a problem. It may be a sign of the times, but the evidence of people using violence to resist arrest is a growing problem. A difficulty that certificated bailiffs face is that they cannot use reasonable force in such cases and must call on the services of the police. We may be in danger of substituting for a ponderous system that has not worked well an even more ponderous system that will work even less well. Certificated bailiffs will try to effect an arrest but will have to back off the moment there is a problem. They will then have to request police resources to intervene and the police may feel under a greater obligation to do precisely that when the incident might have been prevented in the first place. The matter merits serious consideration. I also appreciate that there is a civil liberties angle. Having read the Bill, and listened to the comments of the Solicitor-General, I was struck by the fact that the Bill gives far wider powers to civilian enforcement officers, because they will no longer be restricted to a single area. I hope that this subject can be dealt with during our debate on this clause.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I understand the system, having witnessed it myself in court, certificated bailiffs are under the jurisdiction of the court. It is aware of their activities, knows who they are and can remove their certificate. However, a system is being proposed in which the bailiffs may be operating far from the local court where they are known, which might cause problems in ensuring that high standards are maintained. The Government need to deal with that question when it comes up for review.
<P>
We seem to be moving towards the establishment of a parallel service, other than the police, for routine arrests. If that is the case, we may have to accept that the existing structures may not be sufficient to ensure that standards are maintained although, in my experience, bailiffs usually have the highest standards or that the bailiffs have sufficient power to do their job. I do not want a reduction in civil liberties. However, it would be undesirable to have a system in which people could play a cat-and-mouse game, having cottoned on to the limited power of the bailiffs, and in which the police had effectively washed their hands of the enforcement process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I was sorry to hear the hon. Member for Surrey Heath describe the proposals as controversial, as they are proposals that the Government inherited from their predecessor. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield fairly pointed out that there is, therefore, no party political controversy.
<P>
I say to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath that Philip Evans is a member of a warrant enforcement liaison group established by the Lord Chancellor's Department, which consists of representatives from the magistrates courts community and others who will be affected by this transfer of responsibility. They met for the first time on 11 January 1999 and have met three times so far. They will continue to meet regularly with the aim of examining and resolving practical questions. Therefore, Mr. Evans and his colleagues in the liaison group have regular opportunities to put forward the sort of  concerns and anxieties that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath expressed today.
<P>
In addition, there was a formal meeting last year between officials in the Department and bailiffs, and my officials remain available for a further meeting should that be necessary. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that every effort has been made to involve those who will be affected by the measures in examining the practical implications that he has mentioned.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's reassurance. Mr. Evans clearly still has concerns, as his letter to me and perhaps to some other hon. Members is so recent. However, in the light of what the Minister has said, if outstanding issues remain I hope that the Government will give them further consideration between now and Report.
<P>
<B> Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his observations. I should like to point out this may also deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that the Department will shortly carry out a review of the law governing the activities of bailiffs.
<H4><center>[MR. PETER ATKINSON in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
The review will cover execution by county court bailiffs in relation to civil court judgment debts and by private bailiffs in relation to parking penalties, and distress for council tax, community charge, non-domestic rates, rent, income tax, VAT and child support maintenance. In addition, the Government have decided that the review should examine the powers of bailiffs and civilian enforcement officers levying distress in criminal cases. The review is due to report in June 2000 and the practical issues that have been raised by hon. Members today can be dealt with as part of that process.
<P>
I want to deal with the questions of principle raised by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, especially that of the use of force to make an arrest. It has been argued in representations that civilian enforcement officers who are directly employed by the court should be able to use reasonable force when seeking to execute a warrant. The Government do not believe that a special provision to that effect in the Bill is necessary. Section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 already provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In cases where the question of reasonable force was an issue, it would be for the courts to determine whether or not appropriate force had been used. That is a question that regularly occupies the courts, and the Government do not feel that any change to the law is required. In relation to the other matters raised by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, the Government are also content that existing powers available to civilian enforcement officers are sufficient and that there is no need to write any specific powers into the proposed legislation at this stage. The purpose of establishing the liaison group was to identify any problems that might arise. If any practical difficulties arise as a result of the transfer, the Government will attend to them in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> That is the real point. If the new regime does not work, the Government must change it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government take the view that if any aspects of their responsibility are not successful, appropriate changes will be necessary. Careful consideration has been given to the representations that have been received--to which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath has referred and the Government are content that existing powers are sufficient.
<P>

<H4><center>Approved enforcement agencies</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I shall make a few points about the clause, as that may help to anticipate any questions that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield might raise about civil liberties. The explanatory notes set out clearly the intention behind the clause. I shall make three points in relation to the proposals to increase the powers given to private enforcement agencies.
<P>
First, the clause empowers the Lord Chancellor to make regulations governing the conditions that must be satisfied by a person if he or she is to qualify as an approved enforcement agency.
<P>
Secondly, the clause will require each magistrates court committee to keep a register of all the enforcement agencies that it authorises. If necessary, the magistrates court committee will be able to remove an enforcement agency from the register, thus stripping it of the power to execute warrants.
<P>
Thirdly, the clause stipulates that where a warrant has been executed by an approved enforcement agency, a written statement must be shown to the person against whom the warrant was enforced, on demand, and as soon as practicable. That statement must give the name of the person by whom the warrant was executed and his position in the agency, and must indicate that the agency has been approved by the relevant magistrates court committee.
<P>
The clause empowers the Lord Chancellor to make regulations, subject to the negative resolution procedure, governing the conditions that must be satisfied by a person if he or she is to qualify as an approved enforcement agency. Those conditions might include: being a fit and proper person; possessing a sufficient knowledge of the law governing warrant enforcement; not carrying on or being employed in any business that involves buying debts; providing satisfactory references; providing a certified copy of the results of a search of the register of county court judgments; supplying photographs to accompany the application; swearing an oath that the statements in the application are correct; publishing a notice of the application in three separate editions of local and national newspapers; and lodging a bank bond or deposit, or providing other guarantees, to protect the committee from financial loss.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`125B (inserted by section 72(2)' and insert
<P>
`125C (inserted by section (Disclosure of information for enforcing warrants)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendment No. 168.
<P>
Government new clause 29 Disclosure of information for enforcing warrants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I welcome you to our proceedings, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
The amendments and the new clause are designed to help to track down a missing fine defaulter or community service dodger by enabling the court to check whether other Government agencies hold a more recent address for the offender in their records. Barriers to information sharing are among the biggest obstacles to effective enforcement of fines. More than 50 million of fines were written off in 1997--98 alone and it has been estimated that the inability to trace offenders could account for as much as 30 per cent. of the total. It is unacceptable that offenders are able to get away with their offences while the taxpayer foots the bill. New clause 29 will enable courts to obtain basic information about offenders from relevant public authorities for the purpose of warrant execution.
<P>
The information that may be obtained will be set out on the face of the statute. To strike an appropriate balance between the privacy of the individual and the requirements of effective enforcement, it will be tightly limited to those details that will allow the offender's whereabouts to be traced the name, address, date of birth and national insurance number where it is known to the court and will help to identify the defendant. To prevent abuses, the information will be disclosed only to court employees and those who are entitled to execute a particular warrant. It may be used only to enforce a warrant. It will be an offence to disclose the information, whether intentionally or recklessly, to any other person or for any other purpose.
<P>
New clause 29 also empowers the Lord Chancellor to designate by order any relevant public authority from which the courts may request the information. Such an authority may be the police, the Department of Social Security, the Inland Revenue, local authorities, the Passport Agency, the Home Office immigration and nationality directorate and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise.
<P>
However, the courts may find it helpful to approach other agencies, which may be the subject of additional designation orders. We intend to begin discussions on the necessary administrative arrangements as soon as possible so that the courts are able to benefit from the new arrangements when the transfer of responsibility for warrant execution takes place.
<P>
The Government believe that it is not acceptable for offenders to be able to disappear, seemingly without trace, when an up-to-date address is held on other Government records. New clause 29 and amendments Nos. 167 and 168, which make minor and consequential adjustments to the numbering of clause 74, will give the courts the ability to follow several leads to trace offenders. Improved information sharing will result in more cost-effective warrant enforcement, as well as helping to restore public confidence in fines and community penalties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> How prepared are the courts' information systems to carry out those tasks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It is not envisaged that the court will hold large amounts of information. The problem in too many cases is that someone who is fined before a court and ordered to pay that fine, pays the first instalment and then disappears without giving a current address. This provision will allow the court to go to another Government agency that may have an offender's name and address. There should be no need for courts to retain large amounts of information. The information that they secure will be for the limited purpose of enforcing the fine. They will need to retain the information only briefly, for that purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> If I may expand on my question. One difficulty is that the information systems that are available to local courts are so poor that simply moving out of an area and departing to a different precinct often leads to the evasion of a fine. The provision sounds like a useful addition to the armour.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Although there is considerable discrepancy between the level of technology that is available to different magistrates courts committees and despite the fact that there is a signed agreement to provide a nationwide system the Libra system to the magistrates courts committees, it is not intended that those courts will retain large amounts of information. The essence of the provision is to ensure that fines are enforced in individual cases.

<H4><center>Clause 76</center></H4>
<H4><center>Justices and clerks: immunity from costs</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> It may be helpful if I explain that the previous Government consulted widely on the protection of judicial officers against costs orders. The clause inserts a new section into the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 to protect justices of the peace that is, magistrates against costs orders in proceedings arising from the discharge of their functions.
<P>
Over a number of years, justices have become increasingly anxious about the possibility of personal liability and costs arising from a decision made on the Bench. The Government take the view that it cannot be right for that fear to be in the mind of anyone making a judicial decision; nor can it be right for a volunteer undertaking an important civic responsibility and acting in good faith to face the risk of costs, however small that risk might be.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 76 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 77</center></H4>
<H4><center>Justices and clerks: indemnity</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> Again, it may help the Committee if I explain that the clause strengthens the protection which is given by providing immunity against costs orders, except when bad faith is proved and excluding criminal cases to which a justice or clerk is subject. However, despite that protection, there will be circumstances in which a monetary order could be made and in which protection, if appropriate, will continue to be provided by way of indemnity. An example might be costs incurred by a justice or clerk in defending an action which, although prohibited by the provisions of sections 51 or 52 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997, is brought but is then struck out by the court. Another example might be amounts incurred by or ordered against a justice's clerk which are not covered by clause 76 that is, they do not arise from the clerk exercising the power of a single justice.
<P>

<H4><center>Clause 79</center></H4>
<H4><center>General Commissioners: immunity from action;</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> Yet again, it may help the Committee if I explain that the provision is directed at general commissioners of income tax, who are unpaid, lay volunteers and play a key role in the tax appeal system. They operate under section 2 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 and determine appeals and other matters arising from decisions of the Inland Revenue. They are appointed in England and Wales by the Lord Chancellor and in Scotland by the Secretary of State for Scotland. There are more than 3,000 general commissioners sitting throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>
There is a right of appeal against a decision of the general commissioners by way of case stated at the High Court, and their decisions may also be challenged by way of judicial review. However, there is no law preventing an action against individual general commissioners for example, by an aggrieved taxpayer in the event of a higher court adjudging that a decision was wrong. The Government take the view that general commissioners, who are unpaid volunteers, should not have to face the possibility of such an action being taken against them. General commissioners have expressed anxiety about their vulnerability in such circumstances. The purpose of the clause is to deal with the problem and I am sure that the Committee agrees that general commissioners of income tax should be given immunity against such action.

<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> This clause amends the Coroners Act 1988, which does not currently make any provision for reimbursement of any costs incurred by coroners who are respondents in judicial review proceedings. The aim of the provision is to provide clear legal authority for coroners to be indemnified by their local authorities if legal proceedings against them arising out of their duties result in costs being awarded against them. The clause also places a duty on councils to meet the reasonable costs which coroners may incur in connection with any such legal proceedings. The new provision does not require councils to indemnify coroners who institute proceedings.

The amendment strikes out clause 88(2), which was inserted because of their Lordships inability to raise money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> We need a little more from the Solicitor General. Clause 88(2) states:

<P>
That is an important subsection and it is not good enough for the Solicitor-General to brush it past us by saying that it was put in by the other place because it has no powers to raise money.
<P>
The Solicitor-General is not doing himself justice in confining his explanation to that. If the other place is not entitled constitutionally to raise money, it would not have dealt with the matter. I should be grateful if the Minister or the Solicitor General, when they have received instructions, will provide us with an answer. The subsection is an important part of the Bill and is about to go out of the window. Before it does, perhaps the Solicitor-General will give us the real reason
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The purpose new clause 30 is to insert a new subsection into section 62 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 in order to give the Lord Chancellor power to direct a magistrates courts committee to implement a recommendation made by Her Majesty's magistrates court services inspectorate. Magistrates courts committees MCCs are responsible under statute for the efficient and effective administration of the magistrates courts for their areas. They are made up almost entirely of lay magistrates and, supported by the justices' chief executive, provide local management of the magistrates courts. The Government values their work and intends to preserve that.
<P>
Under the Act, consistent with his ministerial responsibility for magistrates courts, the Lord Chancellor currently has certain powers to require MCCs to act in accordance with his directions. He can set performance standards, make regulations requiring committees to produce reports and plans and also make regulations requiring them to keep prescribed accounts. If an MCC fails to discharge a statutory duty, the Lord Chancellor has the default power to remove one or more members of the committee and, if the failure continues, to remove the whole committee.
<P>
MCCs are subject to inspection by the magistrates court services inspectorate. If an MCC is failing in some way, the inspectorate will invariably be asked to make a special report. All inspectorate reports include recommendations for improvement. In most cases, MCCs take steps to improve. However, there have been cases in which action has been inadequate.
<P>
The new power will give the Lord Chancellor a means of dealing with such cases by his direction that a recommendation must be complied with. The default power to remove members of the MCC will be available if the direction is not complied with. 
<P>
The new power will fit into a graduated response to an MCC's failure. It is not intended to be used as a matter of routine. It will be used only to require the implementation of important recommendations where an MCC has had the opportunity to take action but has failed to do so.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 180, 182, 184, 171 and 172.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Paragraph 1 of schedule 3 to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 contains provision for regulations to be made by the Attorney-General about the service of evidence where a person is sent without committal proceedings to the Crown court. The intention is to set a fixed timetable for the service of the evidence so as to speed up the progress of such cases.
<P>
The existing formulation has led to practical difficulties since the regulations can only set a single period within which, in all cases, the evidence must be served. Plainly, some cases are more complex than others, and require  more preparation time. The result has been that the regulations made for the current pilots have prescribed a date one year after the case is sent to the Crown court, in order to ensure that the requirement can be satisfied even in the more complex cases. That extended length of time is not necessary in the majority of cases.
<P>
New clause 31 amends paragraph 1(1) of schedule 3 to the 1998 Act, to qualify the requirement so as to allow a judge a discretion to extend, or further extend, the period set by the regulations. It also amends paragraph 1(2) so that regulations may stipulate the manner in which such applications to extend are made. This will allow, for instance, applications to be dealt with by way of written submissions where the parties are agreed, subject to the views of the judge, on the need for a hearing.
<P>
Subsection (2) of the new clause amends section 13 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 so as to provide for the time when the prosecutor must disclose unused material in cases where a person is sent for trial without committal proceedings. Amendments made by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to deal with this are deficient and are being repealed.
<P>
Subsection (3) of new clause 31 amends section 22 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 by adding cases sent for trial under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 so as to allow the Crown court to extend time limits in the preliminary stages of proceedings.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may consider Government amendments Nos. 157, 158, 169 and 173 to 176.
<P>
8.45 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendment No. 157 is one of several amendments that make provision for the operation of the youth courts in response to other changes in the Bill. The amendments are, in general, technical, but I shall seek to explain them in turn.
<P>
Schedule 2 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 contains detailed provisions relating to the constitution of the youth courts both in the metropolitan area that is, in inner London and the City and in the rest of the country, including the rest of Greater London. Outside the metropolitan area, much of the detail is set out in rules namely, in the Youth Court (Constitution) Rules 1954, as amended. They provide for specially qualified justices to be appointed to the youth panel, and to chairmanship in youth courts by the local bench. In the metropolitan area alone, the relevant provisions are set out in primary legislation in part II of schedule 2 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. That provides that justices shall be nominated to the youth panel by the Lord Chancellor, who also nominates youth court chairmen.
<P>
Under the Bill as it stands we have introduced amendments in schedules 7 and 8 to preserve the existing provision so far as possible, but also to take account of the changes to the geographical organisation of the courts and of the unification of the stipendiary bench which the Bill will introduce. However, there may be difficulties preserving a distinction between inner London, including the City and the rest of the country. In particular, two different youth panel regimes would apply in the area of the single magistrates courts committee, which will be set up for Greater London and which will be known as the Greater London magistrates courts authority. There would also be difficulties describing the dividing line between the two ``regimes'' if boundaries were to change in the future.
<P>
We believe that there should be a uniform approach to the youth courts. However, there are arguments in favour of both approaches. We wish to take the views of the Greater London magistrates courts authority and to consult in detail on the future arrangements with all parts of the magistrates courts community before final decisions are made.
<P>
With the agreement of the magistrates courts community, therefore, we are seeking to remove the distinction that is contained in primary legislation between the metropolitan area and the rest of the country. We propose to have a single framework in primary legislation, and to deal with the more detailed provisions on appointment to youth panels and the constitution of youth courts in rules. That will permit, so far as necessary, different provision for appointment to youth panels or constitution of youth courts in different areas only for an interim period. That is what the new clause and the associated amendments will achieve.
<P>
District judges, magistrates courts, will be able to sit in any youth court. We are also re-enacting the current separate provisions to make it clear that when such a judge formerly a stipendiary sits in the youth court, he or she need not sit with lay justices. That will be achieved by amendment No. 158.
<P>
Amendment No. 169 makes transitional provisions, and amendments Nos. 172 to 176 restructure the schedule of repeals to take account of new clause 32. Amendment No. 157 is simply a drafting improvement.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> With this, we may discuss the following: new clause 2 Abolition of indemnity principle 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`A party to a proceeding shall not be prevented from recovering from another party an amount in respect of costs by any rule of law which limits the costs recoverable by a party to proceedings to the amount which he is liable to pay his legal representative.'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`A party to a proceeding shall not be prevented from recovering from another party an amount in respect of costs by any rule of law which limits the costs recoverable by a party to proceedings to the amount which he is likely to pay his legal representative.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> New clauses 2 and 23 will abolish what is known as the indemnity principle of costs, and Government new clause 35 will restrict the operation of the indemnity principle through the operation of rules regulating costs.
<P>
New clause 2, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon and others, and new clause 23, which was tabled by the Opposition, broadly duplicate an amendment that was proposed in another place by Lords Kingsland and Phillips of Sudbury. In response to that debate, the Lord Chancellor said that, while consideration would be given to whether the indemnity principle should be abolished, its central position in the way in which costs are assessed means that any alteration to it would require detailed consideration. In addition, the Lord Chancellor undertook to carry out a consultation exercise before deciding what, if any, rules of court would be required to retain the beneficial effects of the indemnity principle. Given the Lord Chancellor's assurances, the amendment was withdrawn.
<P>
We shall shortly issue a consultation paper seeking views on the impact of abolishing the indemnity principle. In addition, we and party counsel have given consideration to the terms of new clauses 2 and 23. Having considered the matter, and with the benefit of party counsel's advice, I think that the wording of the new clauses would not have the desired effect, because they do not properly encapsulate the operation of the indemnity principle. The indemnity principle limits recovery to a strict indemnity for each item of work that is being claimed from the paying party.
<P>
However, the amendments purport to abolish a supposed rule of law that the totality of costs awarded to a successful litigant cannot exceed the amount that is liable to be paid to a lawyer. There never was such a precise rule of law; litigants have always been able to recover disbursements made personally that do not take the form of payments to lawyers.
<P>
The wording of new clauses 2 and 23 suggests an intention to allow a successful litigant to profit by charging his opponent more than he will pass on to his lawyers. That is not what is proposed. The intention is to allow the successful litigant to recover from the opponent all payments to his lawyer that have been actually and reasonably made, without imposing the further test that he must have been legally liable to do so. The Government wish to abolish any presumption that a successful litigant may not recover from his opponent more than would have been payable to his lawyer if he had lost. That is a corollary of the provisions in the Bill on conditional fee agreements, but it is not addressed by new clauses 2 and 23. Therefore it is doubtful whether the new clauses would have the intended effect of abolishing the principle of indemnity at common law.
<P>
It is for that reason Government new clause 35 takes a rather different course. From a date yet to be determined, the clause will widen the rule-making powers under section 51 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 that regulate the manner in which costs are awarded. That would retain the indemnity principle, but would allow rules of court to be drawn up that would significantly limit its operation, thereby allowing the beneficial aspects of the indemnity principle to be retained where appropriate. Responses to the current consultation exercise will inform the extent of those rules.
<P>
The Government recognise the general concerns about the continuing relevance of the indemnity principle, and I welcome the objectives behind the new clauses. However, I hope that I have demonstrated to the Committee that the issue is not straightforward, and that the new clauses would not necessarily provide the right solution.
<P>
In the light of my comments, I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon and Opposition Members to withdraw their new clauses and support new clause 35.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I listened with care to the Minister's comments on new clause 35, and he has restated an undertaking given by the Lord Chancellor in the other place. I was also interested to hear that, although the Minister does not approve of the wording, he understands the principle behind new clauses 23 and 2. Given that a consultation paper will be issued, we shall not press the matter further. However, I should like the Minister to outline the contents of that paper, and to tell us when it will be published and to whom it is likely to be sent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his comments on new clause 2, but I should be grateful if he would explain the likely timetable. He will know that this thorny problem has become an urgent one for practitioners. In recent cases, insurance companies have repeatedly tried to get behind the indemnity principle. In trying to establish the position in various cases that have gone through the appeal process, there has been one step forward and one step back.
<P>
The indemnity principle is a restrictive practice that we could well do without. It inhibits lawyers who want to set up deals that would enable them to tell clients that a case will genuinely cost them nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to both hon. Members for their comments. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon referred to the indemnity principle. One of the first difficulties faced by members of the Committee and, I suspect, many lawyers, is defining that principle. It may sound straightforward, but my personal researchers tell me I do not claim to be an expert that there is a wide range of views on what is meant by the indemnity principle. When there is no clear agreement on the meaning of something, abolishing it will always be fraught with difficulty.
<P>
With regard to the points raised by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, I said in my opening remarks that the consultation paper will be published shortly. I can now tell him that ``shortly'' will be as soon as tomorrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Yet again, powerful and searchlight opposition has borne fruit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I was clearly put under so much pressure that I had to concede an early publication date. Given the late hour, tomorrow was the earliest that I could manage. I shall ensure that all members of the Committee receive a copy of the consultation paper, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, whom I anticipate will read it and, in the light of my earlier remarks, understand it. The Government propose a consultation period of about seven weeks. After appropriate discussions, the rules to which I referred will follow.

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> You may recall, Mr. Atkinson, that I said on Second Reading that the Government intended to introduce an amendment that would allow the Lord Chancellor's Department to recoup the full cost, including overheads, of administering the annual competition for the rank of practising Queen's Counsel. The clause will provide for the Lord Chancellor to introduce a fee to meet that cost, which will be payable by all applicants for the rank of practising Queen's Counsel.
<P>
Currently, the only power to charge a fee in respect of Queen's Counsel relates to the Crown Office and its costs. Those costs which, in 1999, were about 10,000 are limited to the grant of letters patent to successful practising Queen's Counsel. However, the majority of the work and the competition costs relate to the processing of applications before the award of practising Queen's Counsel to successful candidates. Most applications are unsuccessful. Indeed, during the 1998-99 competition, only 69 of 553 applications were successful. Handling them many of which are from applicants who have applied before, and who will no doubt apply again is time consuming and costly. The cost to the Lord Chancellor's Department is approximately 120,000 a year. That is contrary to the Government's full cost recovery policy and constitutes a public subsidy for a promotion system in a profession that does not particularly need it. Therefore, the Government believe that the introduction of an application fee for the rank of practising Queen's Counsel is highly desirable.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 195 and 196 would amend clause 86 by allowing new clause 37 to be introduced on Royal Assent. As you know, Mr. Atkinson, the Bill's other provisions will take effect two months after Royal Assent or on a date appointed by the Lord Chancellor. It is a convention that such orders do not normally appoint dates within two months of Royal Assent. However, the annual competition for practising Queen's Counsel begins in September. As Royal Assent may not be given until July, new clause 37 could not apply to this year's competition unless it came into effect immediately. It will ensure that the full cost of the competition is borne not by the taxpayer but by individuals who apply for it. Amendments Nos. 195 and 196 will help to ensure that it will be possible to apply the fee to the next competition.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I can happily say that having successfully passed this hurdle a few years ago, I can speak with complete disinterest.
<P>
I understand from the chairman of the Bar that the Bar Council does not object to applicants for silk having to bear some of the application costs. I ask [Interruption.] I wonder whether the Minister will allow me to catch his ear if not his complete attention. Given that the number of applicants for silk far outreaches the number of successful candidates, it is likely, if the Government are not careful, that the system will unfairly milk hopeless applicants of their application fee time after time. However, I accept that we cannot pass a law saying, ``Barrister A, B or C may not apply'', because it is up to the individual to decide whether to apply for silk.
<P>
Lord Chancellors, in particular my noble Friend Lord Mackay when he was in office, say that their door or the door of whoever deals with applications for silk is open to allow barristers to discuss their career prospects, either as potential judges or applicants for silk. I do not know how often that offer is taken up, but if applicants for silk are going to have to pay the Minister has given no figure of how much it will cost it is incumbent on the Lord Chancellor to ensure that before people formally apply, they are given an indication of their chances of success. If a hopeless applicant makes a hopeless application, he will lose money for no good purpose. It might be better for a Lord Chancellor, or someone who is deputed by him, to put the hopeless applicant out of his misery before the money is taken off him.
<P>
There is a long list of consultees from whom the Lord Chancellor takes advice when he considers applicants for silk. All those consultees give their time free. They do not charge for going through the list and explaining whether an applicant is or is not worthy of the honour of becoming one of Her Majesty's counsels who is learned in the law. May I have an assurance that either those consultees will benefit by having an honorarium for taking part in the exercise or an undertaking that the Government will not cost [Interruption.] I shall come on to the Solicitor-General in a moment. I want an undertaking that the Government will not cost consultees' time and build it into the amount that the applicant will have to pay.
<P>
I understand that honorary silks are awarded and therefore are not covered by new clause 37, but I should like the Minister to make that clear. There is no greater admirer in the House of the Solicitor-General than me. He recently overtook me in seniority by becoming Solicitor-General and, I am happy to say, joined me on what is pompously called the front bench of the Bar and was awarded silk, on which I congratulate him. As he was awarded silk by virtue of his office rather than his practice, I suspect that he did not have to go through the application process. I do not think that he applied for silk in the usual round last year, but was awarded it on becoming Solicitor-General. There is nothing wrong with that, but will someone who is appointed either Attorney-General or Solicitor-General and made a silk on that appointment have to pay the applicant fee, or will the Government or the appointee's chambers pay? As we are being frightfully modern and fair, it is only right that Government-appointed silks should pay the same costs as civilian applicants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): We have heard a great deal about the independence of the law, but when it comes to dishing out honours that great tradition of independence disappears and the law behaves like a spaniel that likes its tummy tickled. The fact that the office of Queen's counsel is conferred by a Minister does not, despite puristic feelings, deter public defenders from being appointed by the Crown. Apparently, it is perfectly all right for a QC to be appointed by Ministers.
<P>
The history of the office bears no relation to an honour. It was established to provide legal advice to the Crown and did not become an honour until much later. Up to the beginning of the century, a King's or Queen's counsel had to seek permission before accepting a brief against the Crown. Although the position had by that time degenerated into an honour, it still carried the original sense of being the King's or Queen's counsel. Since about 1920, it has been an honour and no more.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon made the point that there is no Queen's dentist, so why should there be a Queen's counsel?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I think the hon. Gentleman will find that there is a Queen's dentist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I was about to make the same point. Clearly, the Queen will have a dentist who may carry the honour of being ``by appointment'' in the same way that there is a Queen's greengrocer, haberdasher or, indeed, in this day and age, herbalist by appointment, but those are real jobs. They have an obligation to deliver goods to Buckingham palace, and the Queen's musician is required to write music for royal occasions, but a Queen's counsel has no duty. The appointment simply confers more money. It is what the Legal Action Group describes as a public honour for private gain. A later amendment will allow us to discuss how the office of Queen's counsel automatically confers more money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman help the Committee? Does he believe that it is wise to differentiate between a consultant doctor and a less experienced doctor?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I shall come on to that. I have no objection to professions wishing to adopt their own quality marks, such as a kite mark, to distinguish different grades. That is their right. Some people within a profession may find it elitist, but it is open to a profession to do that and no one could object unless the law and the Crown are involved.
<P>
The system adopted for Queen's counsel creates an automatic higher payment for someone who is a QC. According to the Legal Action Group, the only function of the post is to create
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a market within a market which ensures that senior barristers have a chance of increasing their earnings substantially.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One can understand why so many people are springing to the defence of that argument. The office now has all the characteristics of an honour. There is no public system of appointment candidates are appointed by means of private soundings. There is no retirement date once one is a QC, one is always a QC.
<P>
I agree with the sentiments of new clause 37. Why should the Lord Chancellor's Department bear the cost of this honour, when it should be borne by the legal profession? The Department has never covered itself in glory in performing that task. In 1993, two barristers of the same name applied for the position of QC. They were both sent letters, one of rejection, one of acceptance. Unfortunately, each was sent the letter intended for the other. Something similar may have happened with the appointment of our Government. There is no reason why the Lord Chancellor's Department should perform this arduous bureaucratic task. The legal profession should undertake it, if it so wishes.
<P>
I am worried by the way in which the Lord Chancellor's role in appointing QCs has been described. David Pannick, a QC who writes in The Times, describes the title ``Queen's counsel'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a mark of expertise that assists solicitors and clients to identify those barristers who are capable of handling the more difficult cases'' <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as though describing an objective kite mark or quality mark that one should accept despite the fact that it has been awarded by the Crown 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and that helps the Lord Chancellor's Department when assessing candidates for judicial office.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is certainly an example of a logical circle, because the Lord Chancellor's Department appoints the QCs in the first place. Having made a sterling defence of the position of QCs, David Pannick then points out:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Bar values its independence. It is, then, difficult to justify a system by which promotion to a senior status is dependent on the advice of civil servants and the decision of a politician.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He thereby demolishes his own case with great aplomb and comes to the inevitable conclusion that the Bar Council should bear the cost of any distinctions it wishes to bestow within its profession and should make its own decisions on the matter.
<P>
I agree with the proposal that there should be a charge on applicants, if responsibility for appointing Queen's counsel is to remain with the Lord Chancellor. However, a far better solution would be to abolish the title of Queen's counsel and to allow the Bar Council to create a post of senior counsel. It could then establish an appointments commission, which could choose its own candidates for that post with some semblance of professional expertise and impartiality.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> May I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he has discussed his views with the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor? If so, what did the Lord Chancellor tell him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> No, I have not discussed the matter with the Lord Chancellor. I have discussed it with several Members of Parliament who are QCs. The tenor of their views was overwhelmingly that the position was an anachronism, and that it would be better for the marking of such distinction to be in the hands of the legal profession. New clause 37 makes it clear that that is the direction in which the Lord Chancellor is moving.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I welcome new clause 37, for which I claim a minor victory, because it was probably my parliamentary questions that flushed out the cost of the QC system. I should remind the Committee that more than 100 hon. Members signed my early-day motion calling for the abolition of QCs. In addition, I have received many letters in support of my campaign from people both within and outside the profession. It has also generated a considerable amount of press interest in support of what I have been trying to do.
<P>
The starting point for our debate should be to ask why we need QCs. As my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) said, one might ask why we need Queen's counsel any more than we need Queen's plumbers. We must consider the public interest. I read an interesting article by Sir Gavin Lightman, an eminent High Court judge, in The Times on 8 June 1998, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``To the public, the grant of silk is tantamount to the grant of a licence to print money.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must ask whether it is a public service or whether it is simply a restrictive practice, which results in barristers receiving more money, because they are paid extremely handsomely.
<P>
I tabled some parliamentary questions on the matter. If one considers the current batch of QCs who have just been appointed, of those who were successful, one earned 550,000 in the previous year before his appointment, and the average previous salary of those who were appointed was 250,000. Indeed, one person who was unsuccessful earned 790,000 in the previous year. Those people do not apply to become QCs to take a pay cut, so we can assume that they will expect to receive substantially more money as QCs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that, despite the argument that he has advanced, there are many well documented cases of barristers applying for silk only to find that their incomes drop substantially. That is because, although they were successful as senior junior barristers, they were not able to command the same high fees once they took silk. Some cynics have suggested that the circuit bench was increased by allowing some people to take silk, even though the powers-that-be expected them to fail to increase their earnings as silks, so that they would then be more inclined to apply for judicial appointments. I have no idea whether those cynics are right, but will the hon. Gentleman recognise the well known fact that some QCs suffer a substantial drop in income, and that it turns out to have been unwise to apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> On the hon. Gentleman's last point, on the basis of statistics that I have received in answer to parliamentary questions, I can say that the link between QCs and judicial appointment is to some extent a popular myth. On his more substantive point, I may be able to offer an answer to that problem when I speak to new clause 5. It is true that the earnings of some juniors fall, but I believe that those cases are exceptions to the rule. I have no doubt that, in the long term, QCs earn substantially more.
<P>
That leads me to my next point, which is whether the distinction and a few letters after one's name make any difference. I received a letter from a barrister who put it this way:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in one conference recently I was teased as to when I would apply for silk. I merely replied by asking whether they would be happy to pay 30 per cent. more for the same advice just because I had the initials `QC' after my name? Not surprisingly the answer was a flat `no'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is essentially the point. One would receive exactly the same advice from the same lawyer, whether he or she had the letters ``QC'' after his or her name. It simply enables QCs to charge more money for doing exactly the same job.
<P>
However, it does not end there. The problem with the QC system is that it allows those who have the money to hire a QC to gain an unfair advantage in court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am concerned that the hon. Gentleman's concentration on the financial aspect of the matter might reveal the old Labour view which, as a new Labour MP, I am sure that he would disclaim of the politics of envy. Will the hon. Gentleman make it clear to the Committee whether, should his efforts in this Committee and elsewhere result in his promotion to Minister, he intends to forgo a ministerial salary, and say whether he believes that the same arguments about seniority should apply to parliamentary life. Surely, to be consistent, he should say that if he is ever appointed to the position of Minister, he will never accept a higher salary as a badge of his achievements and his achievement of office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I can say that when I had the good fortune to be elected a Member of Parliament, my earnings dropped substantially.
<P>
I agree that people should be paid the correct rate for the job, but that rate should not be distorted by the artificial distinction of two post-nominal letters. I shall return to that issue later.
<P>
I referred to the imbalance that is created in court if a QC is instructed. That imbalance goes beyond the advocacy skills of the people involved. Again, I refer to what Sir Gavin Lightman said about this. On proportionality, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It must be a matter of serious concern if leaders of the first rank charge fees beyond the range reasonably affordable by ordinary litigants, but fees that their wealthy and powerful opponents can afford.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the matter goes beyond fees. The QC also has preferential treatment in court. He is allowed to sit in the front row, putting him ahead of all the junior barristers in court. He is allowed to use a lectern for some reason, although barristers are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Perhaps, on this one occasion, my learned junior would allow me to take precedence, although we are on the same Bench.
<P>
The remarks of the hon. Member for Hendon are most amusing, but if he is to reduce his argument to the level of discussing lecterns, he might as well get it right. I have never appeared in court with, without or against a junior who has been denied access to a lectern. Can we try to lift the level of debate a little higher?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I would only say to the hon. and learned Gentleman that I have been in court when that has happened. I was just giving examples of the privileges enjoyed by silks. Also, QCs wear additional fancy dress. The reasons why that is important were given by Sir Gavin Lightman. In his article, he says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This is calculated to give litigants the impression that silks are closer to the ``ear'' of the judge and are treated by him or her with greater respect, that their clients accordingly have an unfair and perceptible advantage in the trial process.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That puts pressure on the person who has not instructed a QC to try to level the odds by hiring a QC as well, thus perpetuating the restrictive practice, leading to additional costs in court.
<P>
Another problem is double manning, which was theoretically abolished many years ago, but is still rife in practice. I do not have to rely on my own experience to tell me that, because a judge wrote to me on that issue. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The market is even further distorted because should a solicitor select a counsel on merit who is not in silk, then once it becomes apparent that the other side has a QC, the junior first selected will insist himself on being ``led''. Not only does junior counsel get as much if not more by way of fee for sitting behind leading counsel (as opposed to doing the case himself) but most of the `powers that be' on every circuit regard it as `bad form' for a junior to oppose a leader.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That substantially increases costs as a result of double manning. He goes on to say,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``You only have to read The Times Law Reports to realise that at first instance and in the Court of Appeal, junior counsel are being led at great public expense in short cases, when two counsel cannot possibly be justified. Imagine a GP referring a patient to a specialist and then insisting on being present for a fee on all consultations with the specialist and/or as an observer during all surgery.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That emphasises my point about double manning. Even stranger, when I was in practice I recall instructing a QC who wanted to have a junior on the case. I was quite robust and said that he could not have a junior. In the end, a compromise was reached, whereby the QC paid for the junior out of his own fee so that he did not look stupid in court appearing without a junior. That is the sort of ridiculous situation that results from double manning.
<P>
 We must also consider the cost to the public purse, not merely the cost to private litigants. I recently tabled several parliamentary questions on the issue to establish the Government's policy on instructing QCs. Despite the Government's enormous purchasing power they must have one of the biggest shares in the market there has been no attempt to negotiate fees with the Bar or to obtain standard rates for a bulk purchase. I asked officials in 19 Government Departments in what circumstances they would use a QC, how often in the past they had used one and how much they had spent. Not one of those Government Departments had any real guidelines as to when a QC should be used, and only four had the remotest idea of how many times they had used QCs and how much they had spent on them. I was interested to hear about the restrictions proposed for the use of QCs in legal aid work, which I welcome. The same restrictions will apply to the use of QCs by the Crown Prosecution Service, to ensure savings on prosecution as well as on legal aid. The QC system is an expensive racket, which is not in the public interest. I am pleased that at least the public will no longer have to pay through the nose for that racket by also funding the QC appointment system.
<P>
The arguments against abolition fall into four categories: the kite mark of excellence argument, the guide to the choice of barrister argument, the market forces argument and tradition. I do not dismiss the last of those, but it may be the last refuge of the QC scoundrels.
<P>
The kite mark argument is a relatively new one, and I shall address it on that basis. A kite mark means something nowadays, so I asked the Library if they would research what constitutes a kite mark in terms of personnel accreditation arrangements in the outside world. I found that a personnel-type kite-marking process comprises a series of elements. The first of those, unsurprisingly, is objective appointment criteria. I am pleased to see that the Lord Chancellor has published the appointment criteria on the website, but all of those criteria are subjective, and appointments are still based on the secret soundings taken from judges and leaders of the profession. That perpetuates the old-boy network a look at the names of those consulted proves that. That creates considerable favouritism, especially on the circuit and to a lesser degree in London. In his article, Mr. Justice Lightman states that within the profession, there is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a perception that no consistent or uniform system of selection is applied.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am also worried about the extent of discrimination, in relation to which I have tabled parliamentary questions. The Lord Chancellor has worked hard to try to appoint more women and more members of the ethnic minorities. Of the 69 successful applicants in this year's silk round, however, there were only nine women and five members of ethnic minorities, which is probably the best score for a long time. Age discrimination is also an issue only one of the successful applicants was under 38 and only one was over 50. The successful applicants included only one solicitor.
<P>
An old-boy network decides who should and should not be QCs, and the most important people the public, and especially the clients of QCs are never consulted. Clients are never asked what they thought of the service that they received from the applicant QC, and neither are the solicitors who instruct those QCs. The judgment is based simply on the pinnacle of advocacy skills in court. Whether the QC has a good bedside manner or can explain complex legal terms in layman's language to clients is of no relevance whatever. If the right people are to be appointed, such important considerations must be taken into account.
<P>
There is nothing in the system to prevent unsuitable applications or repeat applications, although that would be expected in a normal kite mark arrangement. In response to a parliamentary question, I was told that, in the present round, the average number of applications made before success was 3.7, and the highest number of unsuccessful previous applications was 26. When I asked about that matter last year, I was told that the highest number of unsuccessful previous applications was 25 presumably, the same person is still trying but he has obviously not got the message. However, the financing arrangements may sort him out.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I was fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the importance of consulting instructing solicitors of clients about a QC's bedside manner. I am reminded of a story that I heard a week ago when I was campaigning for a prospective councillor who, I am delighted to say, beat Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates and won a council seat. He said that on occasion he had instructed the Minister's boss, the current Lord Chancellor, whom he regarded as having the worst and most arrogant manner of any barrister he had ever met in his life. If that solicitor had been consulted, I do not suppose that the Lord Chancellor would have attained silk.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I have never instructed the Lord Chancellor, but I have instructed QCs, some of whom have good bedside manners and some of whom have atrocious bedside manners. Such matters could be considered before making someone a QC, and similar considerations could apply to juniors.
<P>
One would expect a kite-mark arrangement to involve an appeal mechanism against refusal, but in relation to QCs none is available. If one wants, one can have an interview, at which one might be given general advice about why one might have been turned down, but the secret soundings on which the decision was made remain secret.
<P>
A kite-mark arrangement would involve a quality appraisal system, which would be achieved by: fixed-term appointments, subject to requalification; on-going appraisal mechanisms; and a probation period for new appointments, although I take the point that was made earlier about the differences between juniors and QCs. Most personnel appraisal arrangements have continuing education requirements they even apply to judges but they do not apply to QCs. In relation to the age of retirement, a person could continue in post indefinitely and remain theoretically accredited even if he fell below the high standards that we have been encouraged to expect from QCs. Last but by no means least in relation to quality appraisal, there should be a proper complaints procedure, which could ultimately lead to the withdrawal of accreditation if complaints were serious and justified. I understand from responses to parliamentary questions that that has not happened in recent living memory.
<P>
Such proposals could be achieved in the legal profession. Committee members should consider, for example, the Law Society's specialist panels. I used to be an assessor for the personal injury panel, which includes some of the features that I have described. Those mechanisms ensure that people who are designated by the Law Society to be competent injury lawyers will remain so and that they will be subject to the various appraisal arrangements.
<P>
Finally this may be the icing on the cake I recently wrote a piece in The Guardian, which some Committee members may have seen, in which I challenged the Bar to submit its procedure to the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, which is responsible for accrediting those who issue kite marks. I suspect that the kite-mark procedure would not obtain a kite mark because, frankly, it does not meet the relevant criteria. In my article, I bet a Member of Parliament's earnings for a day against a QC's earnings for a day that the Bar would not get accredited, but, so far, it is yet to take up my challenge.
<P>
With all due respect to my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General and to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, I suspect that my hon. and learned Friend was made a QC not because he was good, bad or indifferent as a barrister I am sure that he is an excellent barrister but by virtue of his position. There are good, bad and indifferent QCs, just as there are good, bad and indifferent solicitors, junior barristers and doctors, for example. The QC system has more in common with the application procedure to join a gentleman's club in Piccadilly or the Marylebone cricket club than it has with a properly accredited system. Occasionally, the former groups deign to let in women and members of ethnic minorities who can get past the club committee procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree with some of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, which I shall discuss later, but in this context, he is wrong. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the number of women and ethnic minorities who take silk is growing. Increasing numbers of women and ethnic minorities are able to make a career at the Bar, and the figures are likely to continue to grow. The hon. Gentleman made a bad point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I simply go by the figures. Increasing numbers of women have been joining the profession for a long time, and there may be more female than male solicitors. However, the statistics speak for themselves, and little progress is being made. The process is not a kite-mark procedure but a licence to print money. Good barristers do not need the office to prove that they are good. It is an outdated system of patronage and, yet again, I pray in aid Mr. Justice Lightman, who described it as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a form of patronage which can make or break careers. A totally unjustified slur is perceived to be cast on those who cannot achieve favour.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The other judge who wrote to me stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``those lucky enough to be chosen will be officially marked out as `superior' to those who are not. And with all systems of patronage, in every local centre there are those who have access to the source of patronage and, therefore, whose favourites will be advanced at the expense of others.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being very coy about telling us the name of the judge on whom he is relying. He mentioned Mr. Justice Lightman, who was a distinguished QC, but he seems unable to tell us the name of the other judge. Who is he?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman. The judge is so terrified of victimisation within the profession that he asked for anonymity because he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would upset a lot of colleagues and friends by attacking the system in public.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I must respect that position, but it emphasises the nature of the old-boy network that we are up against. That dismisses the kite-mark argument.
<P>
Another argument is that the system guides the choice of barrister. That is nonsense. I have instructed juniors and QCs and the last thing that has guided me has been the letters QC. I have been guided by my personal experience and observation of court skills. I have been guided by the recommendation of professional colleagues whose judgment I trust. I have even been guided by good lawyer guides. I have been guided by barristers' clerks on availability and the chance of a brief being returned at the last minute. I have been guided by price and my clients, views. But I have not been guided simply by the letters QC after a barrister's name, and I do not know any solicitor whose experience is different.
<P>
Barristers flatter themselves if they believe that the letters QC guide the choice of barrister. The quality of a barrister is not determined by whether he is a QC. If I were instructing a barrister from the Opposition Front Bench, based on our experience in the Committee, I would instruct the one who is not a QC rather than the one who is.
<P>
The letters QC distort the market and the Government should use their purchasing power to rein that back. Good barristers are worth what people will pay. They do not need the QC label to jack up their fee. Let us open the market and widen it. If QCs were abolished, the pressure of making an all-or-nothing decision would be removed from juniors. They could ease themselves into advocacy and out of paperwork.
<P>
Finally, tradition should not be allowed to get in the way of a modern judicial system. There may be an argument for retaining the QC system for honoris causa cases, but the effect of the QC system on the market does not justify the arguments in its favour.
<P>
New clause 5 is an alternative to outright abolition and would level up the market in terms of the appointment of QCs. I made a number of suggestions in the new clause. First, the list of applicants should be published so that we know who wants to be a QC. That would have a number of beneficial effects. It would discourage unsuitable people from applying prematurely and the same chap would not apply 26 times because he would know that he would be laughed at. That problem would therefore be substantially eased. More importantly, publication would allow clients or instructing solicitors to comment on whether a particular junior barrister is good enough or not. Such people may have reservations or they may want to provide an excellent reference, but if we have to have such a system it should be open and above board. That would also allow the appointments system to be monitored for discrimination, as the race and sex discrimination legislation is still not applicable to it. That is primarily because of the secret soundings method of appointment, which would clearly be in breach of the sex and race discrimination legislation if it applied. There is no reason why privacy should be maintained QC is, effectively, a public office, and should be dealt with openly in the same way as other public offices.
<P>
Applicants' pro bono record should also be monitored. The QC title is a licence to print money they will make a substantial amount of money from the public as result of their appointment and we should appoint people with a track record of putting something into the community through pro bono work. Successful applicants should continue to do so after appointment.
<P>
Queen's counsel should also be appointed for a fixed term. That will allow proper appraisal and probation from time to time. It will also allow those who are unsuccessful as QCs, as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath suggested, to revert quietly to junior practice without having to burn their boats forever, rather like a footballer dropping down the divisions if he cannot meet the premier league standard.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> He will not quietly be able to burn his boats because he will have been seen by all and sundry to have failed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I think that he will be, because of the reapplication procedure. At present, if a QC fails he has had it. Alternatively, he may end up as a junior judge. The system that I propose will allow people to decide whether they want to do paperwork or keep trying. It will also allow us to consider whether certain QCs have gone on for a little too long. That is not age discrimination in my experience of instructing barristers and seeing barristers in court, there are some who, in their day, were very good, but who eventually did not realise that it was time to hang up their wigs.
<P>
My preference is for the abolition of QCs, but if we do not do that we must open up the appointments procedure. My amendment flags up some ideas that would lead to a more open procedure and to methods of accreditation that would begin to resemble a kite-mark arrangement. That would be much more in the public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall try to be brief. I suppose that I have an interest to declare, although I am not sure which it is. It may be the hope that I might one day obtain silk, or, by dint of the hon. Member for Hendon's proposals, the hope that I may be spared the anxiety of making such an application and of being a QC. I might thereby live happily ever after without ever taking silk.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman's proposals were accepted, I assume that it would be necessary to deprive all existing silks of their titles. If not, they would produce the iniquity of a number of people enjoying such a title and rank while no one else was able to aspire to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am happy to confirm that my amendment would achieve exactly that objective. We should get rid of all of them, including the hon. and learned Member for Harborough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As for the Minister's suggestion that those who apply should pay a fee, I have no dispute at all. It is a good idea. I would be interested to hear an estimate of that fee, but it seems right that the costs should be borne by those who make the application.
<P>
I want to speak briefly about the proposal that the office of QC should be abolished entirely. The hon. Member for Hendon made a powerful speech and made some good points. There has always been slight divergence on what taking silk is all about. Is it about the kite mark, or about identifying the leaders and those who are most competent in a particular field? Alternatively, is it a more general honour or accolade accorded to barristers and, now, solicitor advocates who have established a reputation for respectability, probity, trust and participation in their profession, and who would, therefore, merit the honour irrespective of their earnings?
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman may wish to discuss this privately afterwards, but I believe that over the past few years the trend has been in the latter direction. I welcome the abolition of the two-counsel rule. There have also been changes in the way in which barristers are instructed, and there is now a more open market for the publications available to give advice as to who is competent in which areas of expertise. Some of those publications are very good. Those changes appear to have diminished the way in which silk is associated with the razor-sharp end of a niche in the profession.
<P>
However, to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Hendon, there is much to be said for professions having systems of merit that are not necessarily dependent on financial success. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman's opinion that financial success and silk go hand in hand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can help me. I have instructed counsel although only on non-contentious matters and I have invariably found that the designation ``Queen's counsel'' has been the mark of an experienced and competent barrister. Moreover, a Queen's counsel's fees are negotiable, just as they are for any other barrister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. He identifies the qualities of experience and competence. One has only to consider the Lord Chancellor's published criteria to see that the award is given to those who fulfil a range of criteria. Being a fat cat does not seem to be one of the criteria involved I say that in all kindness to the Lord Chancellor.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon mentioned that he had asked for the breadth of earnings of those appointed. He focused on 250,000 as the median point, which I found interesting, as the highest figure was over 500,000 at the date of appointment. The implication, therefore, is that a number of people were appointed whose earnings were relatively low. I am not sure that taking silk these days signals the arrival on to the gravy train that the hon. Gentleman suggested. I have gained the impression, through anecdotal evidence, that there are many juniors for whom there would be no financial reward in taking silk.
<P>
The decision to apply comes from a desire to have the accolade and the status which the title confers. Aspirations to status in professions or, more generally, in the honours system are not necessarily bad, if they raise standards at the same time.
<P>
<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead </B>(Southampton, Test): I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments. If he is correct, would it not be an acceptable alternative for the Bar Council to have an annual awards ceremony as do many other professional organisations at which luminaries were awarded gongs? Everyone in the profession would therefore know that they were good people. In many other professional organisations, that is enough to make people feel that they have done well, and that they are well known. Honour is thereby satisfied, and everyone is happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a possibility that I would not dismiss as foolish. What he suggests would be one solution.
<P>
The issue has arisen partly because lawyers have been involved with the administration of justice which, historically, was seen as a royal and, subsequently, Government function. The bestowal of the honour of the office of taking silk and becoming a Queen's counsel is part and parcel of that process which allows High Court judges to be knighted upon appointment.
<P>
I am the first to accept that there is a system, which the hon. Member for Hendon outlined, that draws people into it by conferring honours on them. However, I would not describe it as a club. The system encourages people to participate and maintain the status, standing and professional integrity of a profession that plays an important part in the vital public function of administering justice. That is the greatest justification for the system. Beyond that, I have to accept that there is no good reason for it, although there is a kite mark of respectability and general competence.
<P>
I have difficulty sharing the concerns of the hon. Member for Hendon about the disorders that be believes flow from the institution, which I find more innocuous than he does. As a junior barrister I am, perhaps, in a better position to be able to say that than my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough. I do not share the hon. Gentleman's anxieties, which he presented at some length. I think that the system can be left alone. Further tampering is not necessary. The institution will evolve with time. Indeed, there are clear signs that that is happening.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon talked about women and ethnic minorities. One of the greatest encouragements is that those groups are increasingly taking silk and participating in the professional life of the Bar. We would be foolish to abandon the benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I want briefly to draw my hon. Friend's attention to something that the hon. Member for Hendon said. Having lauded his own judgment by telling the Committee that his choice of counsel had never been influenced by the letters QC after a barrister's name, he then told us that he had instructed QCs who were far too old and, although once good QCs, had lost their ability. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman's judgment is more flawed than he cared to admit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I take my hon. Friend's point. In fairness to the hon. Member for Hendon, he may simply have been making the point that some QCs pass their sell-by date and it would be wise if they ceased to practice. I came across such QCs in my professional career, but the fact that they were in silk was not the problem. Silk is an honour that is conferred on people for the rest of their lives. My father died last year. He was a silk but he had not practised for a number of years.
<P>
I do not think that such barristers were instructed because they were QCs. The solicitor who instructed them probably failed to recognise the extent to which age was taking its toll. I think that they would have been instructed even if they had not been in silk. To that extent, the hon. Member for Hendon is mistaken. There are not such distinct advantages to be gained from being in silk as he perceives and, in so far as there have been advantages, they are diminishing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> We have had a lively debate about the respective roles of junior and senior counsel. As hon. Members listen to my observations, they will recognise the respective roles of junior and senior Ministers.
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough made some observations about Government new clause 37. The level of fee will be an interesting test of the elasticity of demand for this position. As the price rises, it should be anticipated, according to normal economic theory, that demand will fall. However, we are not clear about that because the system has not been in operation.
<P>
In answer to the question raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, we anticipate that, initially, the likely fee will be about 200.
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough asked whether those who were consulted would receive an honorarium. Such an award would increase the cost for those who apply, so that may not be the most sensible of suggestions. Honorary silks do not practise and do not fall within the provisions. Given that neither the Solicitor-General nor the Attorney-General apply, it would be difficult for them to pay a fee for that purpose. I hope that that deals with the points raised on new clause 37. 
<P>
I turn to new clause 3, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. He knows that the rank of Queen's counsel has existed since the end of the 16th century, when it was first bestowed on Francis Bacon. Since barristers took over the position formerly held by serjeants-at-law, QCs have been the leading advocates. Since 1993, solicitors have also been eligible to exercise rights of audience in the higher courts and to be appointed as QCs.
<P>
We are a reforming Government and we would not be afraid to abolish an institution whose only value is as a relic of the past. However, the Lord Chancellor takes a positive view of the value of Queen's counsel. By identifying the best advocates through a tough system of peer and judicial assessment, the award of silk is a kite mark of quality. The rank of Queen's counsel enables lawyers and clients to identify the leading members of the profession and to make more informed choices. It also provides an incentive to achieve high standards of advocacy and integrity.
<P>
It has been suggested that the Bar should not allow its promotion system to be controlled by the Government of the day because that might compromise lawyers' independence. However, it is entirely proper that a system that identifies at an early stage likely candidates for the Bench and other forms of public service should be conducted under the Government's auspices. That ensures that the selection process is accountable to Parliament in a way that it would not be, were it operated by the profession.
<P>
As I said, it is not for the Government to meet the cost of the appointment process. The Government also believe that silks should receive higher payment not because of their status, but only when their work merits higher fees. Powers already exist to provide, through rules of court, the considerations that courts should make in assessing costs. Such provisions are best dealt with through rules of court, not least because litigation is an uncertain business. If the court is to act justly and equitably, it must inevitably retain discretion in fixing the final costs.
<P>
However, that is not to say that the appointment system cannot be improved. The Lord Chancellor's Department will continue to ensure that the system operates in the public interest by safeguarding its thoroughness, scrupulousness and impartiality. The Lord Chancellor is particularly concerned to ensure that it does not discriminate in any way against those from particular backgrounds. We are confident that we shall see an ever increasing number of women silks, ethnic minority silks and solicitor silks.
<P>
The purpose of new clause 5 would appear to be to improve the transparency of the silk appointment procedure and the quality of practising silks, and is based on the idea that the present process is neither open, nor fair, nor accountable. First, the process is open. It is carefully explained in a guide that is sent to applicants with the application form, which is also available to anyone who asks for it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said, it is published in full on the Lord Chancellor's Department's website.
<P>
Secondly, the process is fair. The Lord Chancellor will be guided only by the views of those who know the applicants best, and who can make a detailed assessment against the relevant criteria on the basis of recent, first-hand experience.
<P>
Thirdly, the process is accountable to Parliament through me and the Lord Chancellor and would not be so accountable if it were run by the legal profession. More importantly, it is accountable to the applicants. Unsuccessful applicants are welcome to ask for feedback on their application and they indeed do so.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon made several other points, particularly concerning pro bono work. Certainly, a commitment to undertake pro bono work can contribute to a high professional standing. Such work can often be difficult and of a high quality, helping an applicant to demonstrate a high quality practice. The Lord Chancellor already applies those criteria.
<P>
Subsection (3) of new clause 5 would introduce fixed-term renewable appointments for Queen's Counsel. I assume that the intention is to ensure an element of monitoring and appraising of Queen's counsel. However, as I said, the law is an independent profession and its practitioners are constantly appraised by market forces.
<P>
I invite my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon not to press his new clause too vigorously, and I hope that members of the Committee will support new clause 37.
