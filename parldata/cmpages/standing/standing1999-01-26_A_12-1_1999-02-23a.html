<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 818, in page 77, line 38, leave out "prepare and adopt" and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consult the Assembly before preparing and adopting".--[Mr. Burstow.]</ul></font>
<P>
4.30pm
<P>
</UL></FONT>Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 819, in page 77, line 41, leave out from "and" to end of line 42 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall consult the Assembly before making any revisions".
<P>
No. 608, in page 77, line 42, at end insert "after due consultation.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr Paul Burstow (Sutton and Cheam):</B> I was concluding my remarks about the Government's response to our suggestion that the mayor should consult the assembly in respect of the drawing up and revision of guidance. The Minister for Transport in London told us that that was part of the Liberal Democrats' usual approach to such issues, and that the amendment was a further attempt to undermine the mayor's authority and power. That is a good debating point, and one to which I am sure that we will return on numerous occasions, because we will continue to advance similar arguments.
<P>
However, we need to provide a mechanism for consultation. I note that there is such a procedure in clauses 158 and 174. Clause 158 provides for the London Transport Users Committee to be consulted, and clause 174 provides that the committee must report to the assembly. So the Bill already provides a mechanism--albeit a fairly circuitous one--by which the assembly will be consulted. On that basis, although I would much prefer to have a more specific, direct provision in this clause, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and Westminster):</B> I want to dwell on one matter, to which we may return later. As the Minister knows, the clause makes provision for those bus services which are not covered by the bus service network as set out in clauses 146 to 148. The subject on which I want to dwell for a moment is round-London sightseeing tours. Every member of the Committee will be familiar with both the buses and the congestion that surrounds the places where they stop. I allude to the congestion caused by large numbers of round-London sightseeing tour vehicles in traffic, and to the fact that the number of passengers on each vehicle appears to be low.
<P>
Visual intrusion is caused at terminals and stops by vehicles waiting unnecessarily, and by buses and adjacent pavements being used as sales offices. There is also lengthy waiting away from authorised terminal points, including at London Regional Transport bus facilities; noise from commentaries, as most buses are open-topped; exhaust emissions; and pavement activities such as ticket touting, leaflet and A-boards, some of which are aggressively competitive to the point of violence.
<P>
I paint a general picture of what goes on around such spots. At present, such matters appear to be left entirely to the market--in some respects, that is to the Government's credit. These matters obviously relate to tourism in London, but they fall heavily on certain central London authorities. Will the Government contemplate including in the Bill some degree of consultation with interested parties, including central London local authorities, about a series of issues that we discussed in relation to other clauses--which I can recite if necessary? In other words, will the Government ensure that there is not simply an open market, in which a mayor anxious to increase tourism would not be placed under any compulsion to restrict these activities in central London areas? I speak as someone who uses the buses often, so I am conscious of the nuisance in question. Will whichever Minister replies tell the Committee whether the mayor will be under some obligation to consider the issues that I have mentioned when preparing the guidance document?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> I assure the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) that the round-London sightseeing tours to which he referred are operated by bus companies that wish to provide a local bus service in Greater London that is not part of the London bus network and which will accordingly be required to obtain a permit granted by Transport for London, along with other such companies. Other local services whose operators may require a permit include cross-border services not provided under agreement with TfL, some express and commuter coach services that allow passengers to get on and off within 15 miles within Greater London, services provided for special events and some shuttle services.
<P>
Many express and tourist coaches are not covered by the provision because they are not local services as defined by clause 146. However, it will be within the remit of the clause to require such vehicles to meet published criteria and to follow a guidance document, produced after wide consultation, before the granting of a licence would be allowed.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the implications of the issue for the boroughs. The Government have been at pains to point out that the implementation of the 705 706 
<P>
mayor's transport strategy will in many instances depend upon the boroughs' implementation of their own transport strategy plans. Such plans will, in a sense, have to operate within the overarching framework of the mayor's strategy. It will be entirely in the realm of the boroughs to be part and parcel of that strategy, certainly as far as deciding where the vehicles in question may park.
<P>
I trust that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's questions, and I ask the Committee to agree to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> I shall make one of my occasional interventions, having been unsuccessful this morning in endeavouring to say a word about buses. Perhaps I can do so now under the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman was prevented from making remarks about regions other than London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I would not wish to test your patience, Mr. O'Hara. However, although I say it with great humility, it is just possible that an example in Birmingham might be useful to hon. Members considering the best interests of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound (Ealing, North):</B> Never.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> London is after all the second city.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Neville Chamberlain is dead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Long live Beaumont-Dark
<P>
I am struggling, Mr. O'Hara, and I may reach a point when I need your protection from the Committee.
<P>
I have had experience of being leader of a passenger transport authority. I have had a continuous mandate as a representative of the people of Solihull, as a borough councillor, a metropolitan county councillor and as Member of Parliament for 28 years. It is a great honour to have represented the people of Solihull for 28 years.
<P>
My point is instructive, and bears on a criticism made of my party during its 18 years in government. When I became a Member, I kept a sort of dead reckoning top of the pops of my case load and of the most frequently raised issues--other Members and councillors may do so with their regular surgeries. In earlier times, housing, education and health matters vied with each other and clustered at the top of the list. Occasionally, there was a planning or a tax matter. In those earlier years, when I first represented the people of Solihull--it is in a critical position between a great city and the countryside--buses were always in among the big three issues. Constituents' complaints about buses always vied on equal terms with housing, education and health, and sometimes they prevailed. The significant point is that, as I stand here today--still, I hope, active with my constituency case load--I simply cannot remember when anyone last came to me with a complaint about buses. Everything the Conservative Government did in 18 years cannot have been bad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for what she said and for the manner in which she said it. Earlier, I had to tax her colleague, the Minister for London and Construction, for the legislative cover for something that he had said. I would feel a great deal easier about the general reassurance that the hon. Lady sought to give me when she referred to the guidance document that the mayor was due to bring out if the words "after consultation" appeared in the Bill.
<P>
I understand that the Minister will reply by saying, "Of course the mayor will consult"--everyone expects him to behave reasonably. The things for which I ask are also reasonable. It is sensible that we maintain the environmental fitness of central London. We should not allow the tourist industry to despoil it. It would be unfortunate if the considerations to which I referred were not an explicit part of the mayor's duties.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr.Taylor) for telling us about his experiences in the deregulated regime that the previous Administration introduced. As regards the comments made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, what will be new under the mayor are the London service permits. They relate to the services to which I have referred and currently come under the title of London local service licences. The mayor will have more control. He will have the power to set the criteria. He may want cleaner, greener, more accessible vehicles on the streets of London. That could be part and parcel of the criteria that he sets.
<P>
As regards issuing permits, the mayor will have power over the issues to which the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster referred--congestion, misuse of London transport and designated areas. There will be a change in the issuing of permits, and the criteria will be somewhat tighter than at present. There will, therefore, be a requirement on the mayor to consult. The requisite requirements are in clauses 158 and 159. Given the spirit in which the right hon. Gentleman made his contributions, however, I will ask for further advice. If there is any concern that the desired outcome cannot be delivered, I will write to him.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
 Clause 152 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B> Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> (Southwark, North and Bermondsey): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. We had an exchange this morning about the clause that deals with London Regional Transport. Depending on how late the Committee sits, we could in theory get as far as clause 167, which is short and which deals with public-private partnerships. Amendments for discussion under clause 167 and schedule 10, and the new clauses relating to chapters I to VI of part IV all deal with that subject. You will be aware, Mr. O'Hara, that in essence, the Government have already tabled new clauses to replace clause 167.
<P>
In the light of this morning's debate, it seems that the Government have new proposals for this general family of subjects--namely, the interrelationship between the continuing existence of LRT and the public-private 707 708 <P>
sector partnership. Will the Government therefore confirm that they will not take the Committee tonight beyond the end of chapter V--this is clause 166--which deals with rail services? That would give them the chance to table amendments--potentially with your leave, Mr. O'Hara, because they might have to be starred to be considered on Thursday--in time for Committee members to study them.
<P>
One last matter, Mr. O'Hara. I have just been informed that there is to be a meeting of the Business Sub--Committee on Thursday morning at 11 o'clock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury):</B> Who told you that?
<P>
<B>Mr Hughes:</B> I have been told that that is the date that its chairman offered and that it has been agreed--[Interruption.] It seems that it has not been agreed. A proposal was certainly put to me that the Business Sub-Committee would meet. I was offered three dates and indicated my availability. I have since been told that one of those dates has been accepted. Other hon. Members may not have received their messages.
<P>
The point is that if we are to meet on Thursday morning as a Business Sub-Committee, that is clearly the logical time to consider how best to manage the debate. Will the Government confirm that it would be completely nonsensical, for reasons that the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) and Liberal Democrat Members gave this morning, for the Committee to start a debate tonight on a matter that will be subject to further, linked Government amendments which no one has yet seen? If the Government accept that proposition, at least we know that we can plan for later today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway (Croydon, South):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I take further points, I should say that I do not regard the intervention of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) as a point of order for the Chair. I was indulgent and let the hon. Gentleman state the situation for the benefit of the Committee--it saves me having to go through it. However, it was not a point of order for the Chair. It is a matter for the Committee's business managers and for the Business Sub-Committee.
<P>
I have been advised that there is a meeting of the Business Sub-Committee on Thursday morning. If that meeting indeed takes place, these matters can be discussed there. It the, business managers of either side want to discuss with one another whether we go beyond clause 167 tonight--it is up to them--I imagine that they will have the opportunity to do so during the dinner interval. I do not think that we will get that far before dinner.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey saves me stating at length that Committee members might bear in mind in the course of debate that the new clauses following clause 167 and schedule 10 on the selection list in effect replace what comes before. It is for hon. Members to judge how they deal with that situation in debate.
<P>
The presentation of business to the Committee is not for me; it is for the business managers. It is for me to conduct the business that is presented to me by them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. You are quite rightly bound by precedent and you have guidance from "Erskine May" and the Standing Orders of the House of Commons in deciding what is or is not a point of order. I believe, however, that we are entering entirely new territory. The reason that you do not have a precedent is because a Committee has been set up to debate something that has not been put before it. I cannot believe it.
<P>
The new clauses relating to part IV concern a public-private partnership for London Underground, but there can be no such partnership unless the provisions of chapter III are in place. It is like trying to run a 10,000 metre race, but running only the last lap and not using a starting gun. The Committee will be engaged in a meaningless debate. We registered our contempt this morning by not debating certain clauses, because there was no point in doing so. There would be no point in debating the subsequent new clauses either.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I cannot add much to what I said this morning and earlier this afternoon. I do not regard the hon. Gentleman's point as a point of order for the Chairman. We have already, in effect, had the debate on whether there should be an adjournment, and all the issues were set out then. I listened carefully to what the Opposition and the Government said, and I understood the Government to be saying that chapter III is not redundant--there is more detail to be presented, but the chapter itself is not redundant. Therefore, I cannot see that a point of order is involved for me in terms of whether I regard the business of the Committee, as it has been presented to me, as awry. In my judgment, it is not awry. There may be refinements to be made: if so, they are for the business managers to present, and for me to conduct.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> With your permission, Mr. O'Hara, it may assist the Committee if I make a short statement about the issues that have been raised.
<P>
Opposition spokesmen both seem to be confusing two separate processes in the procedure of the Committee and the consideration of the Bill. The discussions that we had this morning related to clause 142, which brings London Regional Transport to an end so that it can be replaced by Transport for London. As with many changes in the structures of Government, the actual implementation and timing of that change is subject to subsequent clauses which will determine the pace at which abolition takes place. Therefore, it is not material to the consideration that we will undertake later today or on Thursday, when the Committee reaches the relevant clauses that deal with the substance of the public-private partnership.
<P>
As the Bill is currently drafted, that provision is in clause 167. The Government propose to replace that with a series of new clauses that have already been tabled, thus providing the opportunity for a full debate and full and proper scrutiny of the principles on which the public-private partnership will be established. There is no reason, therefore, why the Committee should not 709 710 
<P>
proceed with whatever timetable is appropriate. It would be wrong to set an artificial deadline on our discussions. When the Committee reaches the new clauses, they can be considered in full and thoroughly.
<P>
I have already discussed with the official Opposition spokesman the possible merit of withdrawing clause 167 and schedule 10 in order to allow full discussion of the new clauses rather than an unproductive debate on amendments to clauses that are to be withdrawn. That may assist the Committee's progress and, if Opposition Members are happy with it, speed our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Liberal Democrat members find the Minister's last suggestion to be entirely acceptable, and it seems sensible to proceed on that basis. As a final point, can the Minister indicate by which date we are likely to see the presentation of chapter III?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am not in a position to provide the hon. Gentleman with that information, but I or my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London will write to him with it as soon as possible.
<P>
I repeat my earlier point that the phasing of the abolition of London Regional Transport and its replacement by Transport for London does not affect the substance of the public-private partnership negotiations that we shall be debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. John. M. Taylor:</B> Further to that particular point, in which the Minister has endeavoured to help the Committee, could we follow the practice whereby, if the Minister undertakes to write to any member of the Committee, the letter is copied to all other members? I am sure that that would not be bad practice--in fact, it would be good practice
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is for the Minister to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am happy to give that undertaking.
<H4><center>Clause 153</center></H4>
<H4><center>Grant of London service permits</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 576, in page 78, line 8, leave out "(b) and (c)" and insert "(a) and (b)".
<P>
This morning on clause 143 stand part, the Minister told me that the amendment that I did not move, to change "vest" to "vested", was wrong. I did not move it as a protest at the undemocratic nature of chapter III. Nevertheless, I hope that I will have more luck with a technical amendment on this occassion. I believe that where clause 153(2)(c) refers to Transport for London charging a fee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for both (b) and (c) above",
<P>
it should had read "(a) and (b)".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: the phrasing in the Bill is incorrect. We are grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his perspicacity in spotting the error, and are happy to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> Anorak!
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Government Whip--probably quite rightly--describes me as an anorak with regard to the amendment. Nevertheless, I am delighted by the Minister's response.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 821, in page 78, line 23, after "affected" insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", the London Transport Users' Committee".</ul></font>
<P>
The clause requires Transport for London to send notice of the grant of a London service permit to the London Transport Users Committee. The amendment would link clause 153(4), which requires that the LTUC is consulted on applications. However, clause 153(5) does not place a similar requirement on TfL to notify the LTUC of the outcome of such applications
<P>
This point may be covered by clause 158 but, given that the clause provides for a mechansim of notification at the stage of starting the process of making an application but does not then go to notify the users committee of the outcome, it seems to us that the point could be taken on board in this clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I start by saying how pleased I am to see the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) in the Committee. As I arrived at the House for this afternoon's sitting, I saw a large refuse cart from his local authority. It was a green vehicle--very green indeed, both in colour and in its use of liquid petroleum gas rathan petrol for fuel. I had a sudden moment of apprehension that the hon. Gentleman, who I know takes a serious interest in green matters, might have disappeared into the entrails of this strange device out of admiration for his borough's green policies. I am very pleased that that was not the case, and that he is here with us this afternoon.
<P>
I regret that I am unable to accept his amendment, however, and hope that I can persuade him of my reasons. Unlike the consultation process which is covered in clause 158, where there is an important role for the London Transport Users Committee and other bodies, the granting of permits is a different matter. It is essential that permits should be notified to local authorities and the police, who may be affected by the traffic implications. That is why there is provision for a notification to those bodies.
<P>
As far as wider notification is concerned, it: is for the mayor to decide who best should be informed and consulted. We did not believe it appropriate that the LTUC should be specifically mentioned as a recipient body. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the amendment is not necessary and withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am still dwelling on the vision of a London borough of Sutton refuse freighter driving around the borough of Westminster. I shall be asking the relevant officers whether they are sub-contracting vehicles to Westminster council.
<P>
I have listened to what the Minister has said. I take the point and shall reflect on it further. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have another question of a technical nature in relation to the London local service licences. It is again a case of the Husteron and Proteron club. Even though we shall be debating this point under the next clause, I think that I should raise it at this stage.
<P>
The Bill proposes that Transport for London will determine the permit applications for London local service licences in line with guidelines prepared with the mayor, which we have already discussed, after consultation with a number of bodies, including local authorities--the ones set out in the clause. Applications for service permits will be subject to consultation with the local authorities, police and others, but there will be no right to a hearing of any objections made. The only right to a hearing will be to allow an operator to appeal against a refusal to grant a permit. Even then, the appeal will normally be dealt with by papers only.
<P>
I recognise the possibility of a read-across into planning. Those who are affected by a planning application could be resentful, if the application is granted, that they do not have a right of appeal, whereas if it is not granted, the applicant does have a right of appeal. I realise that this may well be quoted back to me. It seems desirable that if those people who were consulted have an objection to the application, they should have the formal right to say so. There should also be the opportunity for a hearing of objections, using the mechanism described in the Bill for operator appeals, which we shall come to in clause 154.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting issue. I am delighted that he is talking about appeals against the award of permits rather than the adoption of the London borough of Sutton's refuse disposal vehicles in his borough.
<P>
The process of considering and awarding permits is very open. It is predicated on the mayor developing criteria and issuing a guidance document so that prospective local service operators know exactly what is expected of them. It is a straightforward and clear procedure, and we believe it proportional to the issue concerned. If an applicant were aggrieved by a refusal to grant a permit, the applicant could still have recourse to the courts. In the unlikely event of a mayor not referring an appeal to a panel or ignoring the panel's recommendation, the applicant would certainly have an arguable case.
<P>
We therefore believe that the approach is appropriate, effective and fair, and that there is no case for a more cumbersome, quasi-judicial appeal procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I hesitate to say this to the Minister, but it is conceivable that he has read out the wrong brief. I was alluding to the people who were to be consulted--to the fact that they might want to object to a particular planning application, and should have an opportunity to appeal.
<P>
I am a bear of very little brain, and I may have missed the relevance of what the Minister was saying to my question. I would be perfectly happy to be told that--obviously, I will have the opportunity to return to the matter on Report to try to attack it by a different route.
<P>
I have another question that I want to ask the Minister. If it would help him, while he considers his reply to what I have just said, I will ask it now. On the other hand, if he is ready to reply, as it is a separate issue, I shall return to it later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is certainly not a bear of very little brain; he is a bear of considerable brain and wit. I am sorry if I have confused him by my response.
<P>
The point that I was trying to stress is that there is already a procedure to ensure that the mayor will consult extensively before the award of any permits. Before a decision to grant a permit is taken, the London Transport Users Committee, the local authorities affected, the police and any other people considered appropriate by TfL must be consulted, so there is an extensive consultation arrangement. Of course, there is nothing to prevent objectors who dislike the idea of a permit being granted making their objections widely known--including to the mayor as well as to Transport for London.
<P>
I repeat that the procedures are appropriate and proportionate to the operation, and that a more cumbersome, quasi-judicial appeal procedure would be inappropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Minister for Transport in London was gracious enough in response to my observations on the previous clause to say that she would go away and think about what I had said. The least that I can do is to say the same to the Minister for London in response to what he has just said.
<P>
I have a separate question. I am rarely a proxy for the Liberal Democrats, but I notice that their amendment, which added to the list of people who should be consulted the British Transport police and the Royal Parks police, was not regarded as in order. In no way do I query that ruling, but I am curious as to why those bodies were omitted from the Bill. As I said in response to the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) in a previous sitting, the city of Westminster is itself subject to the problem that the Royal Parks police can do things within the city of Westminster that override the council's actions.
<P>
On behalf of the Royal Parks police, which is in my constituency, I ask why it has been excluded from the list of consultees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> On this one the right hon. Gentleman has certainly stumped me. I undertake to examine the matter further and write to him. On the face of it, I cannot envisage circumstances in which the British Transport police would be affected--there is no proposal to change its powers. The role of the parks police would not necessarily be directly affected by changes in arrangements for permits for transport operators. That may well be the reason for those exclusions, but I do not want to give the right hon. Gentleman a definitive answer now. In the spirit of our proceedings, I undertake to consider the matter further, to write to him and to circulate copies to all members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I regard that as a handsome offer by the Minister; the Liberal Democrats will get a copy as well.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 827, in page 79, line 4, at end insert "(a) the Mayor,".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 58, in page 79, line 7, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(d) any officer or employee of a company in which Transport for London is interested".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 582, in page 79, line 7, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(e) any officer or employee or member of a company having business with the Authority or with Transport for London, or any company in which Transport for London has an interest, which generates revenue in any twelve month period (measured according to generally accepted principles of accounting) in excess of &#163;10,000, or any officer or employee of any company under the control of such a company.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The amendement attempts to address a concern raised by a number of outside bodies that have been considering the Bill: the potential for a conflict of interest in the office of the mayor in exercising his responsibilities as the appeal body in respect of licenses and permits, because the mayor will also be a member--indeed, the chair--of Transport for London. Where he takes up the option of chairing the board of Transport for London, he could conceivably be taking decisions against which he will subsequently have to hear appeals. We believe that that would be wrong and that it could give rise to conflicts of interest. It would certainly lead to the mayor sitting in judgment on his own decisions, which raises some public concern. one has only to consider the way in which most other public bodies--and private companies--would deal with such matters; they would try to separate those who deal with a matter on appeal from those who hear the matter in the first instance. It seems a natural part of the process that they should be kept separate.
<P>
As drafted, the Bill could give rise to such conflicts of interest. Amendment No. 827 would exclude the mayor from the appeal panel for that reason, although if the mayor does not sit as a member of Transport for London, clearly he could sit as a member of the appeal panel. We are interested to know whether the Government recognise that potential conflict of interest and whether they have a way of dealing with it.

<P>

<B>Sir Sydney Chapman (Chipping Barnet):</B> I intended to try to catch your eye, Mr. O'Hara, on the stand part debate for clause 154, but I believe that the brief intervention that I want to make may be more relevant to the amendment by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam.
<P>
Where a permit is turned down by Transport for London, the applicant has the right to appeal to the mayor. That is written in the Bill; there is no doubt about it and I welcome it. What I am less clear about is the exact power of the mayor. I know that he can appoint a panel of people to advise him on the merits of an appeal--the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam addressed that specific point--but am I right in concluding from subsections (2) and (3) of clause 154 that it is entirely within the mayor's discretion either to refuse an appeal without further ado or to accept an appeal without further ado, as well as having the right to set up a panel to advise him, presumably, on whether to accept or refuse an appeal?
<P>
If, as I suspect from subsections (2) and (3), the mayor has the right immediately to reject or accept an appeal, I query that rather arbitrary right; I put it no more strongly than that. It is different with the planning system, because per se an applicant has the right of appeal if his application is rejected, but that planning appeal is to be made to the Secretary of State, who will decide either by written representations or by holding a public inquiry how to deal with it. I feel that if my interpretation of clause 154 is correct, we are giving a little too much arbitrary power to the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I speak to amendments Nos. 581 and 582, which have been taken with amendment No. 827. Clause 154(4) sets out three criteria of persons who should be disqualified from being members of an appeal panel. It seems sensible also to consider disqualifying a company with which TfL has a close relationship. The amendments are pleaded in the alternative, as it were. Amendment No. 581 would prescribe a general disqualification of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any officer or employee of a company in which Transport for London is interested",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
while amendment No. 582--if the former amendment is too pernickety--rules out officers or employees of a company whose revenue with TfL is in excess of &#163;10,000. It seems to us that the anti-croney measures must be kept in place in the legislation. People with vested economic interests cannot necessarily judge the decisions of TfL.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): The amendments are significant and bear further scrutiny.
<P>
I should like to emphasise a point that has not been made in this short debate. The clause contains a potential conflict of interest with the mayor himself. The amendments demonstrate the paramount necessity of the mayor having no commercial interest. Providing for the mayor to be the ultimate appellate person in dealing with appeals against the non-issuing of a permit involves a serious risk of malpractice. The mayor will have 715 716 <P>
discretion to issue a direction to enable an operator's licence to be issued. He could have commercial interests linked to the company seeking to obtain an operator's licence.
<P>
Similarly, the mayor will choose the appeal panel. If any one of the people on that panel were to have commercial connections with the mayoralty, his independence would be prejudiced.
<P>
Finally, the clause's list of people disqualified from appointment to membership of the appeal panel is noteworthy. A person will be disqualified if he is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an Assembly member ... a member of staff of the Authority, or ... a member of, or a member of staff of, Transport for London."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The list does not, however, include a person who is on the mayor's staff or who has a commercial connection with the mayor.
<P>
I recommend that the Minister looks hard at the amendments. She should judge whether it is appropriate for Londoners to have a mayor who has commercial interests or shareholdings that could conflict with his responsibilities, which, in the clause, relate to his being the ultimate person to whom an appeal is made and to whom requests are made for the issuing of an operator's licence.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam and, most recently, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) have spoken to the amendment. It is worth outlining again the clause's effects. The mayor will have the power to set criteria after wide consultation. Many considerations will be involved, some of which were mentioned by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. They will include the integrated transport strategy, congestion on the streets of London and the concerns of the boroughs. When wide consultation has occurred and the criteria have been defined, application for a permit will be made to Transport for London. An appeals procedure should be in place to deal with denials of such applications. The clause provides for the mayor to set up an appeals panel.
<P>
At the very best, the amendment is entirely unnecessary. I cannot believe that the mayor would have the time to examine every single appeal in the proposed manner. As the hon. Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Sutton and Cheam pointed out, if the mayor was his or her own appeals panel, there would be justifiable criticism. He or she would be open to accusations of bias, and from the very first the panel could be discountable as an appeals panel because it could be argued that it was grossly and apparently unfair. The amendment is therefore completely unnecessary. Everyone whose appeal is turned down will also have final recourse to the courts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) was concerned about the possibility of the appeal being made directly to the mayor. However, that is not what we are envisaging. An arm's-length appeal panel will be set up by the mayor. There will be a final recourse to the mayor and, if the mayor continues to deny the appeal, the individual will able to turn to the courts.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> My reading of clause 154(3) is that the mayor has two choices, the second of which is to refer the appeal to a panel, but the first of which--I refer to subsection (3)(a)--is to issue to Transport for London
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"such guidance or directions, if any, as he considers appropriate having regard to the appeal".</ul></font>
<P>
By that, I understand that the mayor can give guidance to Transport for London by saying, "You've turned down this application for a permit--think again because you may not have looked at A, B and C, which I think are quite telling points." However, he also has the power to give a direction. He may say, "Yes, no further action--I accept that this appeal should be dismissed", or he can actually grant the appeal. I should be happy if that were not the case, because it gives the mayor too great and arbitrary a power. I am not a lawyer, but subsection (3)(a) appears to mean that the mayor will have the power to overturn Transport for London and say, "I grant that permit, full stop."
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Ms Jackson:</B> We have been at some pains to point out that there will be criteria upon which the mayor will inevitably have to consult before they are defined. These powers are somewhat stronger than those that are currently at the behest of London Buses. Part and parcel of that consultation and definition of the criteria will be the issuing of a guidance document so that all would-be applicants will know before they apply for a permit whether they are within the criteria guidelines.
<P>
It is highly unlikely that the mayor would refuse to refer an appeal about the denial of a permit to the panel, which will be an arm's-length panel set up specifically for this purpose. If the mayor did so refuse, the person who had been denied that right to a hearing would have a justifiable case to take to the courts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood referred to the potential commercial bias that a mayor might have in this situation. The people of London are acute in their ability to ask the right kinds of questions. There would be no doubt that the mayor, as with anyone else who stands for high office, would be expected to declare any commercial interests because the powers of the mayor are very wide and strong. It is highly unlikely that any mayor would not have publicly renounced any such possible adverse links.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am glad that the Minister understands the potential risks and is sensitive to the possibility of an accusation of bias in cases of this kind. Would it not be much better for the Government to exclude the possibility of any such bias on the part of the mayor by stipulating in the Bill that he will be required to relinquish all shareholdings and all commercial interests? There would then be no question about the exercise of his appellate duty, which involves the possibility of giving a direction on the issuing of a permit for the operation of transport licence.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Where would the hon. Gentleman draw the line as far as potential mayoral candidates are concerned? Clearly, we will consult the Neill committee about the ethics of anyone who stands for high office and there will have to be consultations with other political parties. I find it ludicrous, however, that we should, in the Bill, preclude anyone from presenting himself as a 717 718 
<P>
potential mayor given the Opposition's forceful arguments about requirements for business to be strongly represented in the mayor's consultations. It has been argued that any mayoral candidate should demonstrate wide experience of business.
<P>
I repeat: the mayor's powers are very wide. They do not relate exclusively to transport; four other functional bodies must answer to the mayor and will help him to deliver the integrated strategies that will improve London and the life of Londoners. It is extremely hard to believe that the voters of London would not scrutinise any potential candidate to ensure that there was no improper link between the mayor's functions and powers and a commercial interest. That is beyond the bounds of possibility.
<P>
I return to the points that I made earlier. The mayor will appoint an appeals panel, which will be at arm's length. Should he refuse to refer an appeal to it--I have already said this to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood--the individual applicant will have a strong case for taking his concerns to the courts.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 581 and 582 would disqualify the officers and employees of companies that have some commercial involvement with TfL from being appointed as members of the panel. The hon. Member for Croydon, South referred to a baseline of &#163;10,000 for any company as regards the appointment of any officer or employee. That is unnecessarily restrictive and disproportionate. It would be entirely possible for someone to be employed in a company in a comparatively minor capacity, but to have specific and direct personal experience of, say, the difficulties of getting on and off buses. Equally, he might have a specific interest as a result of the impact of local service buses on his life. It would be quite disproportionate to deny an employee of such a company the right to serve on an appeals panel, particularly given the wide range and number of companies with which TfL will deal.
<P>
As regards adding subsidiaries of TfL to the list of organisations under clause 154(4)(c) whose staff and members will be excluded from membership of the appeals panel, it is worth taking the issue away to consider. I hope that we will table an amendment to deal with that issue. In the light of what I have said, I trust that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet has, I hope, drawn the Committee's attention to the way in which the clause works. Subsections (2) and (3) make it clear that the mayor is, in the first instance, the person who deals with appeals. He may, however, dispose of them by setting up an appeals panel. I agree with the Minister that the mayor is unlikely to want to trouble himself with the process and will want to establish the panel to deal with it. However, subsection (3) provides a clear procedure under which the mayor can issue TfL with guidance and directions. The key phrase is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or ... refer the matter to a panel of persons".
<P></ul></font>
The panel is an option; it is not necessarily something that the mayor will always turn to.
<P>
The Minister rightly went on to say that the mayor would want to avoid the possibility of litigation. All I would say, is that the Minister could offer the Committee the possibility of tabling a further amendment, after she has had a chance to reflect on the issue, to avoid such litigation. The clause as drafted leaves the mayor open to such litigation because it provides for the mayor to conduct appeals without reference to a panel. All we are saying is that that leads to a conflict of interest. We hope that that can be recognised and acknowledged and that an amendment can be tabled at a later stage to address the problem and avoid unnecessary litigation of the sort that the Minister mentioned. At the moment, the Bill provides for that possibility of unnecessary litigation, but we want the Government to amend it to preclude such unnecessary litigation. We will withdraw the amendment now, but hope that the Government will consider the issue further.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> It is certainly not my understanding that that is the outcome of the Bill' s wording. However, as I assured the hon.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I want to return briefly to the point that I made earlier. I am grateful to the Minister for trying to deal with it. If I understood her correctly, she is going to think again and come back to us. If that is the case, I will not press her further. To be helpful, I wonder if a way around the problem might be to delete subsection (3)(a) and substitute the word "will" for "may" in the beginning of subsection (3), so that it would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where an appeal is made to the Mayor under this section he"
<P>
will
<P>
"refer the matter to a panel of persons".

<P>

"other than a requirement to provide concessionary fares to particular groups of people.".
<P>
No. 592, in page 80, line 6, at end insert--

"or that the condition in question contains or requires features which are neither essential nor reasonably incidental to the purpose of providing a safe, economic and efficient bus service for passengers.".
<P>
No. 593, in page 80, line 16, at end insert--
<P>
"provided that the contravention in question does not relate to matters which are neither essential nor reasonably incidental to the purpose of providing a safe, economic and efficient bus service for passenger.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The clause sets out the basis on which TfL can attach conditions to a London service permit. In my judgment, the use of the word "conditions" is very wide indeed. We have tabled the amendments to focus conditions on the purpose of providing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a safe, economic and efficient bus service for passengers."
<P>
I expect the Minister to say that of course we are going to provide for safe, economic and efficient bus services for passengers, but in my judgment that is all we should specify. There is a danger that a certain amount of political correctness could be imposed on bus operators. We should stick to the matters in hand and keep to a narrow definition. Amendments Nos. 592 and 593 make the same point, although amendment No. 593 relates to clause 157.
<P>
Amendment No. 590, which you rightly grouped with these amendments, Mr. O'Hara, is a slightly different proviso in that it would prescribe a condition for a maximum level of fares. The mayor ought to consider that as one of his conditions.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 828, which raises, perhaps for the first time in this Committee, the concessionary fares scheme. We will return to that in some detail in due course, so I do not propose to detain the Committee for long.
<P>
The clause as drafted precludes any reference to fares, but there is something to be said for explicitly including in such conditions the power to place requirements on companies in respect of concessionary fares. I suspect that the Minister will tell us that the clauses that deal with concessionary fare schemes will include such obligations anyway, and so they do not need to be dealt with as a separate condition. The amendment is really a probing amendment to seek that confirmation from the Minister, so we have no intention of pressing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is quite right to anticipate that we will not be able to accept his amendment. I hope that he--and the hon. Member for Croydon, South--will understand once I have responded that the amendments are inappropriate and unnecessary.
<P>
Clause 155 carries forward into current legislation certain provisions made for attaching conditions to London local service licences. It applies equivalent conditions to London service permits. TfL will be able to attach such conditions only for reasonable purposes. That is the first point to stress.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 589, 592 and 593 seek to limit the imposition of such conditions. In doing so, they would make it impossible for the mayor to impose perfectly reasonable conditions relating to local traffic congestion or parking conditions, for example, which may well be germane to the issuing of a licence. It would be wrong to undermine the mayor's transport strategy by imposing such highly restrictive conditions.
<P>
I hear and understand the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Croydon, South about entirely inappropriate conditions. As I have already stressed, the mayor will be required to act reasonably, and the conditions that he or she may choose to attach must satisfy the test of reasonableness.
<P>
Amendment No. 590 would give the mayor the power to cap fares on London service permit services. Such services are not part of the bus network; they are outside the control of the mayor and will be operated entirely commercially. As is the case with existing legislation--passed, of course, by the previous Government--operators of such services should be free to set their own fares without any interference.
<P>
Amendment No. 828, to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam spoke, would give the mayor the power to require the operators of permit services to provide concessionary fares. As I have already explained, they are commercial services, and it will be for their operators to decide whether they want to offer concessions to any particular group of travellers. If the hon. Gentleman is thinking specifically about participation in the general concessionary fares scheme, I should explain that the London boroughs whose scheme it is will have the power to make arrangements with permit operators to provide travel concessions, if the boroughs so wish. As they pay for the scheme, it should be their decision, rather than one imposed on them by the mayor.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will accept that his amendment is inappropriate, and agree to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister draws attention to the fact that the mayor will be obliged to behave reasonably. Will he point out where the reasonableness test comes from, because it is not apparent in clause 155?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Throughout, the Bill places certain obligations on the mayor. It is an understanding of the whole basis of administrative law in this country that an authority that acts in a way in which no reasonable authority should act is open to judicial challenge. That is an underlying principle that applies to all public authorities, not just the mayor, and which would allow a legal challenge if an operator felt that an unreasonable imposition was being made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It may well be that I am pre-empting my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, but if the Minister could cite half a dozen places in the Bill where that provision gives him legislative cover, we would be greatly reassured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I was explaining to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, the principles of administrative law, which have been the subject of immense debate and discussion for many years, spell out the tests that authorities, public bodies and Ministers have to satisfy. I do not wish to expand on them in great detail, because I am not a lawyer, but they include taking into account relevant evidence and not immaterial or irrelevant matters. They also include acting in a manner in which any reasonable authority should act.
<P>
I was thinking of that test of reasonableness when I told the hon. Member for Croydon, South that the mayor will be expected to act reasonably in all matters and will be open to scrutiny. The Committee has discussed in detail the many opportunities for scrutiny by members of the assembly, by the press and media, by individual Londoners at the people's question time and by challenge through judicial review if any individual were to seek to make such a challenge.
<P>
The amendments would impose a very restrictive limitation on the conditions that the mayor could set. That limitation could work against the interests of the mayor's transport strategy by making it impossible for him or her to take into account entirely germane considerations relating to traffic conditions, parking and other relevant matters. We do not believe, therefore, that the amendments are appropriate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was wondering how long it would be before our old friend, the reasonable man, turned up in the Committee--the man on the Clapham omnibus is where the concept originates.
<P>
I hear where the Minister is coming from, but there is a difficulty. What if the mayor decides to make it a condition that the consumption of chewing gum should not be allowed on his buses? Would that decision survive the reasonableness test, or would it be unreasonable, and how would the courts react?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am tempted to give an immediate and personal response. A previous occupant of my place in the Room has attached a piece of used chewing gum to the underside of the Bench, and I have managed to get a nasty mark on my trousers. I feel unsympathetic towards people who chew gum and leave their excrescences in places that they should not. The banning of chewing gum is not a matter for me to judge--I am responding personally in the immediate circumstances.
<P>
Reasonableness will be assessed. People who believe that the mayor has acted unreasonably can go to a member of assembly, go in person to question time at the new Greater London headquarters --wherever they are--contact the media or seek legal advice on opportunities for challenging the mayor through judicial review. Many remedies are available, and I will not be drawn into making any judgment on the issue of chewing gum, despite my personal loathing of the person who has caused me to stain my trousers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Minister has troubled me about my past. When I took the Connecticut driving test, I had to answer 20 multiple-choice questions. For each question, two answers were obviously sensible and two were not, and the test was based on whether one got the right answer out of the sensible two. One of the questions that 1 recall answering was the only question that I got wrong. It asked, "As a driver in the state of Connecticut is it your principal duty to avoid killing somebody or to avoid making an unnecessary noise?" The correct answer was the latter. The Minister's remarks suggest that I would have had grounds for obtaining judicial review against the Connecticut transport authority if it had failed me in the entire examination on the basis of that answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We could talk about the amendment for a long time. I shall abstain from cracking puns about walking and chewing gum at the same time. I think that there are bigger fish to fry, but we have made our point. Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
5.45 pm
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am not seeking to revive amendment No. 591, which my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South has, very judiciously, not moved. However, the issue that I want to raise relates to the same matter. Amendment No. 591 would have required due notice to be given, and due notice would have covered the contingency of which I am thinking.
<P>
We were discussing who had to be consulted under clause 153(4). Why should not the local authorities affected, provided for in subsection (4)(a), and any other person whom Transport for London considers it appropriate to consult, provided for in subsection (4)(d), be consulted before the conditions are varied, which is what this matter is about?
 <P>
If I may say so, the Government are to be congratulated on setting the conditions, which has a beneficial effect on the regulation of operators whose behaviour might be less than perfect. That is to the good. As we have this opportunity, our concern is to make them as good as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a very fair point. I can only reply by recourse to the principle of proportionality. The variations in permits may be very minor, relating to temporary circumstances caused by road works affecting stopping places, temporary changes in routes and other matters of that nature might impose an unreasonable burden on Transport for London if there was a specific legal requirement to consult in every circumstance.
<P>
I think, therefore, that the consultation provisions in the Bill are broadly right, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that to extend that obligation to 723 724 <P>
local authorities and other persons in all circumstances where there are variations, even of a very minor nature, would not be proportionate. I hope that he will accept that and be happy for the clause to stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am certainly happy for the clause to stand part--I can give the Minister that immediate reassurance. I shall, as on previous occasions, think further about what he has said. I think that again he was relying on the general principle of consultation rather than on any particular reference in the Bill. That leaves me slightly concerned, but I am quite happy, at this stage, to take the Minister's comments away with me.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 594, in page 80, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5) Any person adversely affected by the operation of this section may appeal in writing for a determination to the Secretary of State within six months of the date of revocation or suspension of the relevant London Service permit.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment to ascertain the Government's view on whether a right of appeal should be available to an improper revocation of a permit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a perfectly valid concern. We believe that there is merit in the thrust of his amendment. Having said that, we are not entirely satisfied that the wording of the amendment is appropriate. We will consider the provision of a right of appeal to the appeals panel for people whose permits have been suspended or revoked. We do not believe that the Secretary of State would be the appropriate final body for such an appeal, and I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. Nevertheless, we accept the principle that there is a case for a right of appeal and we will give the matter further consideration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Chapter IV was on the buses, and now we are on to the trains.
<P>
Important matters will arise in the Committee's consideration of clauses 163 to 166. As I indicated to the Minister for Transport in London during a previous sitting, one of the Bili's welcome aspects is the introduction of a structure that will take account of the railways in conjunction with London's other modes of public transport. I hope that we will have a good-natured and constructive exchange about the matters on which we and other hon. Members have tabled amendments.
<P>
The amendments divide into three types. The first group covers the relationship between the authority--that is, the mayor and the assembly, although I accept that under the Government's proposals it will be predominantly the mayor--and the franchising director or the franchising director's successor, which will be the strategic rail authority. That is very timely, because on Thursday we expect not only a rail summit--which the Minister will, I know, be attending--but also the announcement of the shadow strategic rail authority. Things are moving on that front, and Liberal Democrat Members welcome that. The amendments explore how the two bodies will interrelate in London, where the 725 726 
<P>
circumstances will be different from those that apply anywhere else in England because there will be a citywide authority and a strategic rail authority.
<P>
The second set of amendments relates to the fact that while the authority will have a geographical jurisdiction in London, some railway services clearly go beyond the London boundary and some of the services that affect people in London start and finish outside London. We would suggest that some small changes would make the law clearer and the Government's policies better. The remaining matters in the first group of amendments are minor and technical.
<P>
The amendments in the first group--Nos. 867, 870, 872, 873 and 875--suggest that "guidance" should be replaced by "direction". I should flag up at the outset that the clause starts by stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Authority may give guidance to the Franchising Director".</ul></font>
<P>
The normal understanding of the word "guidance" is that it means advice and suggestions, but not the power to enforce them and make them obligatory. The provision is, however, countermanded by clause 163(3), which states:
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"The Franchising Director shall exercise his functions so as to implement any guidance given to him by the Authority.</ul></font>

<P>
The Bill, therefore, states that the authority has the option of giving guidance--it is not compulsory. If guidance is given, however, the franchising director in Greater London has to implement it. That is unnecessarily confusing. The Bill should set out a clearer relationship between the two bodies.
<P>
I hope that the suggestion that we make in Amendment No. 867 accords with the direction of the Government's thinking. The Amendment proposes that we start with the authority preparing its plan for the rail service in London--we have called it the
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"Greater London Franchised Rail Network Service Plan",</ul></font>

<P>
but I am sure that there are more beautiful names. There will be a plan because somebody in the mayor's office will want to make one. From the plan, the authority will produce the direction to the franchising director. Amendment No. 871 would then require the plan to take into account impact on services outside Greater London. That trespasses into the second area to which I shall turn in a moment. We would then make it clear that "guidance" referred to directions.
<P>
We want authority to lie with the Greater London authority and the mayor rather than with the franchising director. I understand, of course, that there will have to be exceptions. We have taken that into account, as have the Government in the way in which they have drafted the clause. Clause 163 (5) states that the franchising director has the right not to give effect to the guidance and sets out three criteria. One criterion is that there would be a conflict with the Secretary of State's "instructions, guidance or objectives". The second is that there would be
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"an adverse effect on the provision of services ... outside Greater London".</ul></font>

<P>
The third is to do with money. I shall come back to those in a second because they are important.
<P>
Let us draw back for a second. It would be beneficial to suggest in the Bill that there should be a plan because the Government will want to flag up--we certainly want to do so--that one of the key duties of the GLA is to have a plan for the railways. One of the obvious points is that if we had a plan for the railways, there should be a proper mix of local stopping services, inter-urban commuter services and express services. We must make sure that we do not have services that merely allow Railtrack to fill its coffers with large amounts of money.
<P>
I hope that the general proposition that we can alter "guidance" to "directions" is accepted in principle. I will be quite happy for the Government to say, "We want to redraft the clause." I will listen to the what the Minister says in that regard.
<P>
The second set of amendments, which includes Nos. 869 and 871, relates to the difficulties of linking London services that go as far as the boundary and those which go beyond it to logical places linked to London. For example, Heathrow is effectively in London, although it is right on the boundary. Gatwick is not, and neither are Stansted and Luton, the other airports that serve London and the south-east. A 15-mile ring around Greater London includes such important and heavily populated commuter towns as Watford, St. Albans, Dartford, Sevenoaks, Woking and Slough, for example. Does the Minister agree that in relation to the area immediately outside London, the authority can at least have an input that will help to structure and formulate the services that go beyond, serving all the people who use London's railways?
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I gather that the only major airport that would need to be specified is Stansted. Gatwick is 10 miles outside the boundary, so is already covered.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Luton, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman is quite right.
<P>
Thirdly, my understanding is that all people with a regular, professional campaigning interest in these matters, such as Transport 2000 and others, argue that doing what we suggest would make the GLA's Transport for London responsibilities much more like those of the passenger transport authorities in the other six metropolitan areas of England. They, too, have a responsibility that takes in the immediate urban area, but there is also an input into the services that spill out beyond.
<P>
Amendment No. 871 requires the plan to take into account the fact that an improvement to services in London, by definition, may have an impact on services outside London. That is an obvious point; it may not need to be legislated for in the way suggested, but it seems an appropriate point to make.
<P>
The very important final group of amendments starts with Liberal Democrat amendment No. 876. I hope that the Minister can come along with me on this amendment too. With regard to subsection (5), if we restrict the ability to give a direction or guidance--we hope that it 727 728 <P>
will be a direction--such that any which has an adverse effect on the provision of services outside greater London is excluded, we get into difficulties. We ask that the significant test is added in with regard to services outside London, and also that "significantly" comes into the payment test in subsection (5)(c). We seek the same qualification for both provisions, so that there can be a flexible and effective input.
<P>
Let me give an example. If the franchising director were allowed, as we proposed in amendment No. 876, to ignore the guidance if it would signficantly increase the amount of payments, but not if it would only increase the amount of payments, it would allow extra services to be provided in a way--because the GLA insisted on it--that does not currently happen. At present, the franchising director can ignore guidance if it would result in additional payments from him to train operating companies. Unless there is a significant variation, he should still be able to be directed by the GLA. I should like to give one or two examples, which exist already, of what the benefit would be. They are supported by others outside this place. London First has argued for it and I am sure that the London Traveller would want such a power.
<P>
I am told that in the late 1980s, the borough of Kingston underwrote a self-financing service improvement which increased the frequency of the direct service from Kingston to Waterloo. The improved service more than covered the cost and brought in revenue, and British Rail was never required to call in the revenu guarantee from the local authority. We want the GLA to have the flexibility to be able to say that it wants additional services or service variations, even if they might cost more, because then the flexibility is given to raise the money to do that.
<P>
My three propositions are, first, can we have a plan--or at least a plan that can be the subject of direction and not guidance? Secondly, can we have a link so that the franchising director can receive guidance or directions on services up to 15 miles outside Greater London--which would incorporate the airports--and not the current limit? Thirdly, can we ensure that the franchising director's right to say no applies only if there would be a "significant" increase in payments? That would allow new and innovative services to be introduced into the London rail network. I hope that the Minister can be as positive as possible towards all those requests.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was at pains to point out, the amendments would widen the mayor's power in respect of surface rail in a way that would be at odds with the careful balance that we are striking between the need for the mayor to have a strong voice in rail and the need to take account of the wider strategic transport issue.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the same issue in a different format in our previous sitting. I said, as reported in column 650 of the Official Report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is the Government's clear, stated and desired aim for the mayor and the franchising director to work in partnership."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The mayor will be able to give the franchising director binding guidance an passenger rail services in London within the constraints that I have already detailed which relate to the wider strategic transport issues. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman touched on some of those issues. When he spoke about services outside the GLA boundary, he mentioned certain towns and cities that are serviced but neglected, in that part of his speech, to highlight the fact that local authorities, business consortia, interest groups and community groups are already devising plans to improve the railway services of their communities.
<P>
Therefore, the mayor cannot speak only to the franchising director--although the powers are clear and extensive and we want there to be a proper partnership between them. It is not possible for the franchising director to have an exclusive relationship with the mayor because of the complexities of London with regard to our railway system. The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed those out. He also touched an the powers of the passenger transport authorities and passenger transport executives, but as I am sure he would agree, the rail network serving London is infinitely more complex than the services and networks run by PTAs and PTEs. Twenty of the 25 train operating companies serve London and it has more than 300 stations.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the rail summit to be held on 25 February, which is the second stage of the Government's process of ensuring that there are year-on-year improvements for passengers. There will be opportunities for the train operating companies, rolling stock companies and Railtrack to lay out their stalls. Passengers will be given opportunities directly to voice their criticisms of the service that they are receiving that is below the levels that they and the Government wish to see. We are asking the industry to demonstrate how it proposes to deliver year-on-year improvements.
<P>
In this pursuit of excellence, it is vital for the mayor to have a central and contributory role. Any incoming mayor will be cognisant of the importance of rail services into and out of London--not only those that directly service the area within the GLA boundary, but those that reflect London's importance to the wider transport network. He or she will, therefore, begin to formulate a plan, as the hon. Gentleman described it--his title was somewhat clumsy, and I cannot remember it in any great detail--for the improvement of surface rail services and their integration with the other transport services that will be directly and exclusively within the mayoral remit. That plan is for the mayor to define and devise, and it will be represented in the strategies that mayoral candidates will present to the people of London. The importance of surface railways to the people of London is too well documented for anyone to be in any doubt that that will be a central consideration for the mayor.
<P>
The mayor and the franchising director--eventually the strategic rail authority--will work in partnership. There is a desperate need for more investment in the railway infrastructure and rolling stock, further improvements to railway stations, a better integrated national ticketing system and an infinitely better information service. It would therefore be improper for there to be an imbalance with regard to the national requirements and the requirements on a mayor serving the people of London within the GLA boundary.
<P>
During our debates last Tuesday, we touched on the powers that the mayor will have in relation to the financial ability to buy in services. As I said then, the situation is too complex for the simple presupposition that additional services can be bought in in that way --because of the current inadequacies of the infrastructure, because of the failure to achieve a real increase in modern rolling stock and because of train paths. I touched on the national requirement, which will also be a requirement on the mayor, to increase the movement of freight on our railways.
<P>
The mayor will have real powers and there will be a genuine partnership. It will be central and essential to the mayor to consider how surface rail services can best slot into a strategic transport plan. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to withdraw the amendment, secure in the knowledge that the Government are cognisant of the mayor's importance not only in improving services within the GLA boundary, but in being a powerful force in improving surface rail services generally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall push the Minister one more time. She gave a perfectly adequate general explanation of the Government's plans, but I should like her to answer the specific points that I put to her. First, it is odd that subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Authority may give guidance to the Franchise Director"
<P></ul></font>
while, five lines later, subsection (3) states:
<P><ul>
<font size=-1>"The Franchising Director shall exercise his functions so as to implement any guidance".</font></ul>
<P>
Why could the wording not be, "The authority may give instructions"? According to the Bill, the franchising director has to implement it, so it is not guidance. That may sound like a semantic point, but anybody who read the clause would say, "You don't have to follow guidance, but you do have to follow instructions." The drafting suggests that the franchising director has to follow the guidance in London, not outside.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, I understand exactly and agree with the Minister's point about complexity--the issue is not straightforward. It will take a lot of work to get things right. Does the Minister at least accept, however, that the Greater London authority should be one of the bodies that has an input into the services that we are discussing? The bulk of people will use them within London, although some services stretch outside London--I am thinking particularly of the airports at Luton, Stansted and Gatwick. If the Minister accepts that proposition, I am sure that we can find a way of saying that in the Bill at a later stage.
<P>
My next question is perhaps more crucially important because it concerns funding. Is the Minister willing to take advice on amendment No. 876, which would insert the word "significantly" in clause 163(5)(c)? Under the amendment, we would not not prevent the authority from issuing guidance or instructions where that resulted in an increase in payments under the Railways Act 1993 which was not significant and which both sides either accepted on a partnership basis or for which the money came from somewhere else, such as a local authority that said it would pay for an extra station or stop. I am trying to see whether there is a way forward so that we can go from the general to the particular.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall start with the final particular, which related to finance. The word "significantly" was central to the hon. Gentleman's argument. A significant increase would be a justifiable reason for the franchising director to discount guidance. It would constitute the unfair subsidising by the entire country via the taxpayer of services that could be experienced exclusively within the GLA boundary.
<P>
 The increase might, however, not be significant. The hon. Gentleman touched on improvements to a station. A minor improvement might be made to a station, but it might transform passengers' experience of it. The mayor may not have to finance the whole operation. He may have an agreement with a local authority, with whoever owned the station or with the train operating company, and the financial requirements could be met. In that case, the issue would not be exclusively about finance. In a sense, it would be about the strategic operation of improvements along that stretch of line. That takes me back to the point that not only London but the whole country desperately needs a strategic rail authority that can begin more actively and accurately to target investment to improve infrastructure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I think that we are getting there. I included the example of something that would result in a payment to Railtrack, as the operator of the line--namely, a little extra use of the line. As the Minister rightly said, however, the funding would come from somebody else. I just want to make sure that the power of a borough to pay for an extra train to run or for trains to run more frequently is not excluded by overly tight drafting. I think that I hear the Minister accept that we may be able to negotiate the drafting if the increase is less than significant.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No. In the particular example that the hon. Gentleman gave, the difficulty was not necessarily finance. It could have to do with an existing franchising agreement or with the existing passenger service requirements. That takes us back to the point that I made earlier about available train paths. The mayor would have no power--nor should he have--to break up an existing contract. Of course, the power will he there for him if it is possible for the relevant pieces to be slotted into place and if the finance is available to buy additional services. There is no question about that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman gave an example of the mayor's powers and spoke about the airport at Stansted. He mentioned the fact that Gatwick is outwith the GLA boundary and he knows that the mayor has no direct powers regarding the day-to-day running of airports. The mayor will, however, have a direct say in and responsibility for matters relating to the improvement of the environment and to spatial development, The hon. Gentleman used an example involving Stansted, but other voices will express opinions about what should
 731 732 <P>
constitute the long-term plan for their area, given that within the Government's integrated transport strategy, issues such as surface access to airports have to be prime considerations.
<P>
The amendment proposes a change from "guidance" to "direction". Because of the points that I have made and the complexities that are inherent within our railway system, and as we are taking some pains to improve it, the amendment would impose an additional burden upon the franchising director, or it would at least not contribute to the sense of real partnership that will grow up between the mayor and the franchising director. For many of the practical and technical reasons that I have given, I can conceive of circumstances in which it would be impossible for the franchising director to act upon such directions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I absolutely understand that point, and I am perfectly happy not to conclude the debate today. Does the Minister accept, however, that it is illogical to state in one line that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Authority may give guidance",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 and to stipulate a couple of lines later that if guidance is given,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Franchising Director shall exercise his functions so as to implement any guidance"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Guidance does not usually have to be implemented. The Committee should ensure that the drafting is not confusing but clear and that it sets out the exact nature of the partnership.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am not a lawyer, and I am prepared to ask for advice in this matter, as I have already done. The Government have issued objectives, instructions and guidance to the franchising director. The words in the clause have meaning--they are not merely plucked out of the air--and they will have specific outcomes. As I said, our railway infrastructure is not as we wish or intend it to be. I refer to my initial point about guidance and direction. The amendment seeks to place direction upon the franchising director or the strategic rail authority that would in some instances not be deliverable, and is therefore not the best way to ensure the working partnership between the mayor and the franchising director that we believe to be essential and achievable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister's response was moderate and helpful. I am not trying to trip her up because she is not a lawyer, or suggesting that guidance is not appropriate in specific cases. There may, however, be some need to re-examine the way in which parts of the Bill have been put together. Terms of art may have been taken from other documents or from transport legislation, and they may need to be revised. I hope that I, my colleagues and people who work with us can persuade the Minister and her officials that reconsidering the wording would be beneficial. I am not pretending that "significantly" is the perfect word to insert, but the wording should allow other funding to come in in a way that does not undermine all of the other strategic plans.
<P>
As the amendment was intended to open up the debate, and as hon. Members have plenty of opportunity to discuss the matter--which is not straightforward--in both Houses, I am happy not to press the amendment. I should, however, be grateful for the opportunity to talk to the Minister about the matter when my colleagues have done a little more preparatory work and to see whether we can reach a greater level of agreement. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> This is the other group of amendments that addresses the same issues. Two of the other amendments that you, Mr. O'Hara, and your colleagues have selected in this group--amendments Nos. 830 and 103--have been tabled by me and my hon. Friends. As it happens, one amendment that was not selected amendment No. 557--was almost identical to that tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. Again, I hope that we can approach agreement as a result of discussing the amendments.
<P>
First, the lead amendment is straightforward. It would require the authority when considering train matters to consult the London Transport Users Committee before giving what the Bill calls guidance. I understand that there is no provision in the Bill as drafted to include any consultation with the Committee on the content of guidance. I am sure that the Minister does not disagree that there should be such consultation--that the 733 734 
<P>
passengers, the fare payers, should be consulted before a plan is drawn up by the authority and given to the franchising director. I hope that that is common ground, and that all that we must work out is how to provide for that.
<P>
Secondly, I turn to what is probably the most important amendment that we have tabled to this clause--amendment No. 830, which would amend subsection (5)(b). The Minister for Transport in London is quite entitled to tell me that she needs to take advice about the word "significant", but I hope that I can persuade her on the merits of the case. The franchising director should be able to ignore what is currently described as the guidance, which we want to call directions, relating to the effect inside the London boundary only if the adverse effect on services beyond the boundary is significant, not minimal.
<P>
We have taken advice, and there is a great desire outside the House for the provision to be amended. The passengers Committee says that we need the amendment to put the position in London on a similar basis to that obtaining elsewhere in the country. I have not checked the position, but the Committee tells me that the amendment--or something along the same lines--would put us on all fours with the position elsewhere.
<P>
Examples make the case better than does the theory. For example, if an additional one--minute stop at Surbiton station, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), were to be included on the Waterloo to Basingstoke line, that would clearly adversely affect the journey time of those passengers who got on at Basingstoke and got off at Waterloo. We would argue, and I hope that it would be generally accepted, that that would not be a significant adverse effect. The commuter from Basingstoke to Waterloo would not regard his journey's being one minute longer as a huge problem. However, that stop would have a hugely beneficial effect on the people of Surbiton--the clientele, if you like, of the authority--who could then get on the train.
<P>
At present, my advice is that the Bill would rule out guidance from the authority to the franchising director that said, "Please add an additional one--minute stop at Surbiton", because that would adversely affect--if in only a small way--the service to Basingstoke.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn to an example from the constituency of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell). The hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong on the facts, but my recollection from when I last passed through a station in his constituency is that, with the new Heathrow rail link, Hayes and Harlington is a station at which most trains do not stop on the Heathrow to London journey. The GLA might he interested in working with the borough of Hillingdon to add a stop at Hayes and Harlington I am advised that the borough's plan is for Hayes and Harlington station to become one of the gateways to Heathrow. If we are trying to reduce commuter traffic to Heathrow, the opportunity to get on and off at Hayes and Harlington might be regarded as an advantage. But if trains stop at Hayes and Harlington, which is within the Greater London boundary, there might be an adverse effect on those coming from further afield--although perhaps only in the order of seconds, or a minute.
<P>
For instance, people travelling from Reading might suffer such an adverse effect. At the moment we could not allow the authority to give that directional guidance, although it might benefit the hon. Gentleman's constituents, people in Hillingdon generally and others wanting to use Heathrow--because technically, it would, by definition, have an adverse effect on people coming in from Reading.
<P>
I hope that those two examples illustrate the point, and that the Government are willing to concede that there might be a way forward that would allow London to have an input.
<P>
Our third amendment, No. 103, which is also uncomplicated, would require the franchising director to consult the authority--that is consultation in the other direction--before he or the new strategic rail authority decided not to implement guidance given by the authority. Thus, if a decision is made which, using the power given by law, is not to be implemented, we think that there ought at least to be consultation and an explanation. I accept that subsection (6) requires notification of such a decision and the reasons for it, but in the spirit of what we and the Minister want-- a partnership operation--that dialogue between the franchising director or the strategic rail authority and the GLA might produce some agreement. That might happen anyway, but it would be helpful to set down a step on the road.
<P>
Finally, we share the view of Conservative Members--although we do not share the views behind other Conservative amendments tabled to the clause--that the Greater London authority ought to have the power to issue guidance or directions, even if that would increase the sum to be paid under the Railways Act 1993. There ought to be the power to require not only additional services but a variation in services. I am sure that it is consistent with what I have heard the Minister say before, and what other Ministers have said, to want the system, as far as is technically possible, to be as user friendly as possible for Londoners and others who come in and out of London, and thus to maximise the number of people who travel by train. 
<P>
This is an important group of amendments, which relates to a hugely important new opportunity for the Greater London authority to bring more people and more revenue into the railways, and to make more parts of London accessible by rail. I hope that the Minister accepts the amendments in the spirit in which they were tabled.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Clause 163 is essentially a failed effort to rectify one of the Bill's main weaknesses, as outlined in the White Paper. When we debated the White Paper, we pointed out to the Government that it was all very well to put the underground, buses and roads in the mayor's hands, but what about the railways? As a result of that pressure, this chapter has appeared, but it fails to 735 736 <P>
rectify the situation. As envisaged in the White Paper, the Secretary of State would still have been overseeing the role of the rail authority.
<P>
The clause provides for the Greater London authority to give guidance to the franchising director, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey explored in some detail a few minutes ago. The franchising director is then obliged to exercise his functions to implement any guidance given to him, except when the Secretary of State disagrees with it. That is where we started: anything can be done, so long as the Government agree. That is not what I call devolving power to the people of London. I call it keeping power at the centre, where it is now and will remain.
<P>
The amendment would delete the franchising director's powers of veto over the assembly. The net result of the amendments would be to allow the people of London to elect their own representatives, who could then decide what the strategy for the railways should be. If the Government are serious about setting up an authority for the people of London, the best thing would be to let the people of London have the last word. We see the way that things are going in Wales and Scotland, so can London not be spared from those centralising instincts?
<P>
We know that the Secretary of State takes a keen interest in the railways. We have a railway summit on Thursday--although as I understand it, the Prime Minister has decided that he would be a better person to front it than the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State's intervention here would be unwelcome, and I urge the Committee to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want briefly to underline one or two points in the amendments. We support the proposition in the Bill that the mayor will take forward development of an interim transport strategy for London. We are concerned that the clause does not provide the mechanism by which that strategy can be adequately delivered. I accept that there are difficulties because the network is integrated with transport to and from the rest of the country. London has the most complicated network of any of the conurbations that have PTAS. That all goes to make it much more difficult to resolve the situation and put in place a mechanism that would enable the GLA to exercise substantial control and direction over the surface rail network in London.
<P>
The clause does not achieve what the Government wish to achieve in enabling the GLA to put in place strategies and policies. In outer London in particular, and in some parts of London that are less well served by other parts of the transport system such as the underground and bus networks, the Bill must put in place the powers to ensure that a mayor can stand on a platform of improving the surface rail network in London, and be able to deliver those improvements.
<P>
The Minister rightly said earlier that mayoral candidates, or those who aspire to become mayoral candidates, need to turn their minds to those issues, and to their vision for the surface rail infrastructure of greater London. As things stand, there is no real mechanism by which issued involving infrastructure investment can be addressed, and no mechanism by which the mayor can intervene to secure the investment that will be needed to deal with the capacity issues that undoubtedly exist, in relation to the lack of pathways, and all the other constraints that currently apply.
<P>
Within the current round of franchises is a set of performance measures that allows the train operating companies to get away with murder. All too often, they secure bonus payments for themselves even when their performance is declining because the benchmarks against which they are being judged were set at a very low level against the performance of British Rail. I hope that our amendments may make it possible for a different set of benchmarks to be put in place in terms of the guidance that is issued by the GLA in developing the next round of franchises.
<P>
I represent an outer London constituency, where most of the people who catch rail services into central London know that they will spend large sums of money every year on season tickets for the joy of being shoulder to shoulder with someone else for the whole of their journey, during which they will very rarely have the prospect of a seat. I am sure that mayoral candidates will wish to campaign to end the cattle-truck nature of Greater London's rail system. However, overcrowding is likely to continue on commuter services that come from outer London--for example, trains from Horsham into Victoria, which stop at Sutton in my constituency. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey pointed out, such issues will not be susceptible to influence by the mayor's guidance, because their effect is felt outside Greater London.
<P>
I accept that a PTA is not a directly comparable institution in terms of the complexities of Greater London. However, I hope that the Government will look again at the clause and perhaps table similar amendments to ensure that the GLA and its strategy for an integrated transport system in London can be achieved in relation to surface railway systems.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam talked about the inadequacies of our current railway infrastructure, the need for greater investment to increase capacity and the problem of overcrowded rolling stock. He seemed to feel that those were areas where the mayor's voice will not be listened to by the franchising director or by the train operating companies because services run outside the GLA boundary. In fact the mayor will have something very powerful to say about those issues, and he or she will have to be listened to. The franchising director or strategic rail authority will be automatically precluded from carrying out the guidance that the mayor presents to them only if that guidance is outwith the national integrated transport strategy and will have an adverse effect outside the GLA boundary. What would be adverse about improving conditions for commuters so that their trains are not like cattle trucks? What would be adverse about ensuring greater reliability and punctuality?
<P>
I do not wish to delude the hon. Gentleman, just as I did not wish to delude the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. It would be foolish to pretend that the improvements that we wish to see--inside London, outside London and nationally--involve 737 738 
<P>
merely having a big enough wallet or a large enough handbag and going to the nearest shop and buying the service off the shelf. That is not what the creation of a high-class, properly integrated railway system is about, The mayor of London, who will be directly elected and will have a mandate from millions of people in London, will be a hugely powerful political force with powers that will be exercised by virtue of the provisions of the Bill. It would be wrong to suggest that he or she will not be a force to be reckoned with in improving services both inside and outside the GLA boundary.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South mentioned the Government's railway summit, which will be held on Thursday this week. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is launching the summit as an indication of the Government's total commitment and cohesive nature as regards highlighting three issues: the inadequacies of the system that was left to us by the previous Administration, which was drawn from the hon. Gentleman's party; the importance of getting things right; and the co-operation and support that are exercised throughout the Government. That is in marked contrast to the hon. Gentleman's party, which members of the European Parliament have left to start their own Conservative party. Support for the leader of that party is at an all-time low and every day we read of potential alternative leaders, who are all being proposed by members of the Conservative party.
<P>
The situation that we are committed to rectifying--we have little doubt that the directly elected mayor will play a major part in this--is the appalling shambles in which the previous Government left our railway infrastructure. The people of London know about that shambles--they suffer it every day. They will have the last word because their voice will send the mayor to whichever of the potential sites will house him and the assembly. They will do that in the clear knowledge that he will be as committed as they are to improving the surface rail system and incorporating it into an integrated transport strategy for London.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made his argument--in the particularly helpful way that he tends to do when we have such exchanges--using specific scenarios. He referred to the possibility of a train stopping for one minute at Surbiton on the Waterloo to Basingstoke line. He did not perceive that that would have an adverse effect on the present timetabling and signalling structures that service that line. For the hon. Gentleman's scenario to arise, we would have to be talking about extremely speedy people who could get on a train in one minute, or else there would have to be absolutely no people waiting at the station. It would take a great deal longer than a minute for a train to come into Surbiton, for passengers to disembark, for the people waiting there to get on and for them to be carried to the terminus at Waterloo. I should also tell that the hon. Gentleman that the terminus is a destination for dozens and dozens of services, not just for the trains that run from Basingstoke to Waterloo.
<P>
The situation that the hon. Gentleman presented was simplicity itself--it was just a one-minute stop. As regards the actual complexities, I return to the point that I made earlier. London's surface rail infrastructure is inordinately complicated. There are more train paths and more train movements in and out of London every day in the rush hours than there are in the whole United Kingdom.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey also touched on the proposals for the development of the gateway at Hayes and Harlington. A great many people have been engaged in that development for a long time. If the relevant technical requirements are met, there will be a major difference. I underline again the point that I will consistently make to the hon. Gentleman. Even if the relevant powers ran totally and exclusively one way and the mayor had total and absolute control over the whole surface rail system exclusively within the GLA boundary, it would not be possible to deliver the improvements that the hon. Gentleman seeks. The only way in which we will deliver the improvements in our railway system that we all seek across the whole country is, as we have made abundantly clear, for there to be strategic--infinitely more so than we have seen so far--and targeted investment in our infrastructure. I mean that in every sense of the word--track, signalling, stations and rolling stock.
<P>
All those who want our railway system to improve must also work together. That means not just the train operating companies, the regulator, the strategic rail authority, the rolling stock leasing companies or Railtrack; it means the mayor working with the franchising director, and local authorities outside the GLA boundary working with the mayor so that they too can work with the franchising director.
<P>
As the Government have said, essential to what we intend to deliver is that companies that have received vast amounts of public money to provide rail services in Britain should be cognisant of the fact that their services are not at an acceptable level, either for the people or for the Government. Equally, people who use railways or wish to see them used more will have to work in partnership.
<P>
Preserving that balance is central and essential to the structure that we have put in place to enable a genuine partnership between the mayor and franchising director to bear fruit.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> By intervening, I have put the Minister off dealing with two easier points relating to consultation. She may wish to return to them, both in terms of the London Transport Users Committee and the franchising director working with the authority before he says no, if he is minded to say no.
<P>
I should like to find out whether my understanding is correct. The Minister is defending the drafting without being willing to open it up to any amendment. Train services cross the GLA boundary in my hon. Friend's constituency of Surbiton, where they run beyond the boundaries of the borough of Kingston, and in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, where they run beyond the boundaries of the borough of Sutton and into Surrey. Is the Minister saying 739 740 <P>
that in respect of those services, and as the drafting appears to suggest, the new GLA and the mayor would have no authority to impose any requirement on the franchising director?
<P>
Not many railways stop at the boundary. Intervention could apply to inner orbital lines such as the Hackney-Chelsea line or services that go only as far as Kingston or Sutton, for example, and terminate there. It could not, however, occur with any other service. If Londoners were to want intervention in the services to Woking or to Basingstoke, which go through commuter stops and could stop more frequently at intervening stops, they would have no authority. Is the Minister accepting such limitation on the power and opportunity for influence? We accept that there is potentially a big influence, but there is not much power.
<P>
We believe that Londoners would want a power to exist, other than when a significant effect was at stake. I accept that 10-minute delays for people coming from Reading, Woking or Basingstoke would be a big deal. If a change were to add a small amount to the journey, however, but benefit a new load of passengers in Hayes and Harlington, Surbiton or Sutton, for example, Londoners would say that the body has got to be given such power. Is the Minister into influence or power?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall try yet again to make points that I have attempted to make more than once when the hon. Gentleman and I have engaged in such debates. I mentioned aspects that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam regarded as adverse. The examples that he gave would be an improvement for passengers. Clearly, they would also have to involve signalling and track improvements.
<P>
Increasing services in the way suggested will mean making such changes. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke about varying services. The Government have made it abundantly clear that if such change is part of the mayor's integrated transport strategy and if the mayor has the finance to do so, he or she will be in a position to buy in additional services. Variations in existing services would have to involve negotiations with train operating companies and the franchising director, as long as those variations did not impact on or reduce passenger service requirements. Iunderline the fact there can be no diminution of passenger services requirements. Before the hon. Gentleman nods too much I shall add another caveat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have put a tick on my amendment paper.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should have let his hand hover a little before I finished my remark.
<P>
I have mentioned the number of trains that go in and out of London terminuses every single working day. I have pointed out that we are in desperate need of increased track access. That cannot come in the short term. We need better rolling stock, but again that will not happen in the short term. In some places we need longer platforms and station improvements. Signalling improvements will certainly be needed. I make all those points simply to underline the fact--the hon. Gentleman may regret ticking his amendment paper--that improvements on one line which seem entirely reasonable, which the mayor can afford and which will not impact on the train operating company's own passenger service requirements--in fact it will have no direct influence on them at all--could have an adverse effect on another service. In those circumstances, such improvements may not be possible.
<P>
With regard to consultation, in particular with the London Transport Users Committee, I cannot conceive of the LTUC not being regarded as the clear, concentrated and direct voice of the passenger. It is regarded as such now, and that is what we would want it to be once the mayor and the GLA are established. Moreover, it will have a wider influence because we regard pedestrians and cyclists as valid forms of transport and we would want the LTUC to be cognisant of their needs, too. As it will undoubtedly have opportunities to present its concerns--which are in essence the concerns of passengers--directly to the mayor, an overt requirement on the face of the Bill for the mayor to consult LTUC directly would probably be unnecessary. I cannot think that he or she would not do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sure that any mayor would do it. But given that the Government accepted earlier that a requirement for consultation with the business community should appear in the Bill--we await the drafting of that provision--and given the long list of bodies required to be consulted on other subjects, it would be helpful if the Minister considered including this requirement in the Bill, so that it did not look as if transport users, who are a pretty influential and important group of people in London, were excluded from being named when other categories of Londoner were being clearly included in other parts of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I recall giving the commitment that we would return to the question of which categories of people should be consulted. I equally well remember saying that I was not going to get into the list business, although I may have put it another way. I do not envisage endless and ever-growing lists of people appearing in the Bill.
<P>
As I said, I do not believe that we need formally to underline the importance of the passengers' voice as enshrined in the LTUC. It will of course have access not only to the assembly; it will be a statutory body, so in a sense the mayor will have to listen to what it has to say. It seems unnecessary to require overt consultation over and above that. However, I am prepared to think about it. I have regular meetings with the London Regional Passengers Committee and I will be interested to hear its view on this.
<P>
In the light of my comments, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Before the Minister's last but one sentence I was going to say that if we needed to, we could let the London Regional Passengers Committee loose on her and it would beat a path to her door. However, she said that she would he happy to think about the issue anyway.
<P>
I am happy that we have had our first canter round the course. These are complex issues but we have flagged them up, and the Minister indicated in the previous debate that there will be an opportunity outside the Committee to consider whether we can make some improvements that fit in with the technical requirements. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall be much briefer on this stand part debate, as I am sure the Committee will be delighted to hear. For some of us, paradoxically, railway issues matter more than anything else. I am the Member of Parliament representing London Bridge, which is, I think, the busiest commuter station, and my constituency is bisected by railway lines, arches and bridges--there was a railway accident only the other day at Spa road--so these things matter a lot. I take the Minister's point that an improvement in one place may result in adverse consequences elsewhere.
<P>
7 pm
<P>
I want to make one point, and then pose a set of questions to flag up the issues. We hope that when guidance is given to the franchising director, there will be a new way of evaluating the costs and benefits--the advantages and disadvantages--of proposals. I have a current example. What appears to be a wonderfully advantageous scheme has been proposed to develop Thameslink north-south through London. I am sure that it will be a wonderful scheme for people who live in King's Lynn who want to to Brighton--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B>  Why would anyone want to do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound), who is now being repressed, asks why anyone would want to go from Kings Lynn to Brighton. I am told that there is a pent-up group of people who are desperate to go from places such as King's Lynn to places such as Brighton, which is why they all need to come through London on that route. The only disadvantage is that it has been decided that to enable that, a wider set of lines and viaducts is needed in the centre of London--coincidentally, at London Bridge and at Borough, in a conservation area and at the risk of knocking down one of the remaining special bits of inner London.
<P>
There are always such complicated debates, and I welcome the fact that we will now get a body that can consider the balance of interests. Blackfriars station is to be extended, so that it will have an exit south as well as north of the river. Clearly, that is generally to be welcomed. The only adverse consequence will be if trains are parked there overnight, so that people who live along the river have trains blocking their view. However, that problem can be resolved, and there will now be a forum for doing so.
<P>
I now turn to my list of questions. I think that the Minister answered yes to the first and then asked me to temper my enthusiasm. May we assume that there will be at least the possibility of extra services being added--because the GLA will put in more money--and of rail services being modified? I am asking not just about additional services but about modified services.
<P>
Will the mayor and assembly, through Transport for London, be able for services that do not go outside London to set service levels, fares and standards in a much more restrictive or effective manner than the franchising director may require? If Londoners wanted a more frequent service than the franchising director proposed, would they be able--subject to all the complications of paths and route--to buy in such a service?
<P>
For example, could they ensure that the timetable brought some lines up to the frequency of others, which might benefit the Minister's constituents? London Underground runs trains roughly every eight to 10 minutes--that is the normal frequency. However, the north London line, for example, often runs only half-hourly services. I gather from friends who work at the Royal Free hospital in the Minister's constituency that it would be greatly advantageous to have a 15-minute service passing the Royal Free for workers--especially those coming off duty late at night or going to work early in the morning. I hope that the Minister will say that that is exactly the sort of thing that the Government hope that the GLA will do. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood should go back to sleep for another two minutes.
<P>
Will there always have to be consultation on timetables, even if the changes that are wanted by London affect only services within London?
<P>
Lastly, will it be possible for packages of services for London lines to be bought by the GLA, if it has the money--to return to the point of the hon. Member for Croydon, South--without the permission of the Secretary of State? If the GLA says that it wants to have three times as many services on the Hackney-Chelsea line, would it be able to secure that without any interference from Government outside London, provided it consulted the franchising director?
<P>
I hope that the answer to all questions is yes. The more the Government say yes, the more Londoners will think that they are getting a good new service. If the answers are no or maybe, the prospect may be less exciting than Londoners had hoped.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am getting distinct signs that the Committee is in need of refreshment. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] It is likely that the hon. Gentleman will get the most considered ministerial response that we have heard so far.
