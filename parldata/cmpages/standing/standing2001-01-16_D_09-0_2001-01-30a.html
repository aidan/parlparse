</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. This is a short Committee stage, but it is fraught with news and developments. I congratulate the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake). He is presumably still finding it all a bit much as he is not in his place&#151;he was a moment ago. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) on his well-deserved elevation to Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the new Whip, the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes). My joy would have been complete had the Minister for Housing and Planning been transferred to the role of Whip&#151;but one cannot have everything in life. With great sincerity, I congratulate all and sundry on their various promotions, new arrivals and so on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Further to that point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Mother and child are doing extremely well and my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington hopes to be with us this afternoon. I pass on his apologies to the Committee; he has had to go to a Select Committee to discuss the issue of water. Much more importantly, I join the hon. Member for Eastbourne in passing on to the Under-Secretary of State my heartiest congratulations. It has been a great deal of fun dealing with him as the Government Whip. I emphasise that all alleged deals are now off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love (Edmonton):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Stevenson. In case it is misconstrued that there is a lack of enthusiasm among Labour Members, I congratulate the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and, perhaps more importantly, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East on his elevation to the circle of Ministers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that all members of the Committee would enthusiastically endorse those sentiments. It has been a good time for births. We have had the excellent news of the arrival of the baby of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and of the birth of what I am sure will prove to be a most successful ministerial career. Can we now get on with our business?
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 10, line 35, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the availability of housing advice within the district'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am delighted to move this amendment in the knowledge that the new Under-Secretary will respond to the debate. He is getting an early outing in Committee, which is always a good thing&#151;although I admit that we are giving him a bit of a dolly one as an opener. We will come later to an amendment tabled by some of his hon. Friends on the similar issue of housing advice by local authorities. That is rather more taxing, and it will be interesting to see how the Minister responds to it&#151;no doubt in a friendly and polite way.
<P>
The amendment proposes that, as part of the homelessness review, there should be a review of the advice offered to homeless people and those in danger of becoming homeless. I suspect that the Minister will tell us that the Government intend that the advice services offered by local authority housing departments should form an important part of the review, but that the amendment is not necessary&#151;using the now infamous argument A as justification. I am prepared to accept that that argument has some validity, but only if the Minister gives a strong assurance that the issue of advice will be taken seriously in the guidance that is offered to local authorities.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that the availability of advice tends to vary widely throughout the country. Under the Housing Act 1996, local authorities are required to provide advice, but, sadly, there is clear evidence from Shelter and other organisations that the advice is variable. If the Minister tells me that the guidance will provide local authorities with a detailed explanatory note on how they are expected to deliver advice and that it will give examples of best practice throughout the country from which other local authorities can benefit, I will be reasonably happy.
<P>
The Minister for Housing and Planning has already provided us with an early draft of the guidance notes and unfortunately they make little or no mention of advice. If the Minister looks at the notes, he will see that the pages are unnumbered, but in the suggestion box that refers to the review of activities that prevent homelessness, there are the two words: ``advice services''. No details are offered.
<P>
I may be prepared to accept a suggestion from the Minister to withdraw my amendment, but only if I am given a clear assurance that there will be much greater coverage of advice in the guidance that is provided to local authorities and that the guidance will specifically include examples of existing good practice throughout the country. I hope that the Minister will take that point on board. We look forward to his response.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Mr. Robert Ainsworth): I thank you, Mr. Stevenson, and other Committee members for the good wishes that have been offered to me in my new position. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North has assumed my previous position and is riding shotgun on the Bill. I am sure that he will do a better job than I ever did and I congratulate him.
<P>
Before I deal with the amendment, I want to let the Committee know that I have had a brief conversation with the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. I told him that we had been updated constantly on progress at home. He said not to believe a word that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said, because he was told nothing. That may give us an insight into how the hon. Member for Bath approaches other things&#151;I do not know. He said that we would come later to a more taxing amendment tabled by my hon. Friends. It does not surprise me that Labour Members are capable of tabling more taxing amendments than the Liberal Democrats&#151;that comment should totally ruin our old relationship and let us make a new start.
<P>
I am grateful that the hon. Member for Bath has raised the important issue of advice, but he has anticipated my response. It is our intention that the provisions should not only address the consequences of homelessness, but help to avert it. Prevention through advice, assistance and multi-agency working will be an important aspect of all homelessness strategies and reviews. The availability of housing advice, its quality and extent, should and will have to be considered as part of homelessness reviews.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, we are on the well-trodden path of argument A. We are not persuaded that every issue addressed in the review should be listed in the Bill. We take the view that housing advice falls clearly under clause 17(1)(b)&#151;the requirement that reviews should look at the activities carried out for purposes relating to homelessness and its prevention. We will, however, ensure that that is fully addressed in the revised code of guidance.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman says that he has seen the code of guidance and that it does not make the appropriate references. I accept that it might have helped had the pages been numbered, but under homelessness reviews, halfway down the page, the first part of the suggestion box says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Sources of data on homelessness . . . &#151;evidence from advisory services (eg Housing Advice Centres, Citizens Advice Bureau).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Of course I have seen that section. That is the section for the provision of data to help the authority develop its homelessness strategy. The issue that we are dealing with here is a range of advice, not only to help those who are homeless, but to help prevent homelessness. That is why I referred to the box headed:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Review of activities which help prevent homelessness''
<P>
</UL></FONT>which specifically refers to ``advice services''. My point is that we need much greater guidance for local authorities about how they go about that, together with some examples of good practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainsworth:</B> The suggestion box reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Review of activities which help prevent homelessness''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Many services, both statutory and non-statutory, contribute directly or indirectly to the prevention of homelessness. We think that the point is covered. To avoid a confrontation with the hon. Gentleman, I can tell him that we will try to ensure that it is. I therefore ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We appreciate that this is the Minister's first outing and well done to him for making a good fist of it following very much in the style of his predecessor. In the spirit of complete friendliness, I should point out that having the words ``advice services'' in the guidance does not give guidance to those advice services. The point that I was hoping that he would be prepared to address was the need to give housing authorities guidance on how best to provide those advice services.
<P>
Some local authorities provide that advice themselves; others use voluntary agencies. Many subcontract the work to citizens advice bureaux. Some of those who provide advice tend to provide it to only certain categories of people. Others have addressed an issue that worries Help the Aged and have tried to ensure that elderly people, who could also be vulnerable to homelessness, are provided with a full range of advice. Some others seem almost to miss out that category. There are examples of good practice. I hope that we can expand the guidance notes to local authorities so that we can give them greater guidance about how best to provide that advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainsworth:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the notes will be incorporated within the existing code? I understand that the advice he mentioned will be incorporated within that document, but I shall check it, and perhaps he will do the same. If we are still in dispute we can talk about it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's helpful suggestion. To make life easy for the Committee, perhaps he will circulate the guidance. If we do not have the document when we discuss the amendment tabled by his hon. Friends, perhaps we may return to the issue later. I am delighted that we will discuss it.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's helpful assurances and pleased to know that he accepts the spirit of the amendment. We will find a way of ensuring that local authorities' housing departments provide the best possible advice to homeless people and those who may become homeless in the future.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I beg to move amdt No. 62, in page 10, line 43, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) providing for the welfare of animals under the control of homeless persons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 63, in clause 18, page 11, line 18, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) providing for the welfare of animals under the control of homeless persons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
These probing amendments relate to the esoteric but not insignificant issue of the welfare of animals in the charge of homeless people. There is no reference in the Bill or in the notes to the way in which local authorities and housing bodies deal with pets.
<P>
This could be described as a double-edged sword because the problem has two aspects. Many rough sleepers have dogs, as anyone who walks along the streets in the evening knows. Often, a dog is their only companion, which helps them through difficult circumstances. The less attractive side is that many people who sleep rough and beg on the streets have dogs because they are good for business and help to bring in the money; members of the public tend to be more sympathetic to the pet than to the person sleeping rough.
<P>
In the 1990s, my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir G. Young) was a housing Minister. He did much good work&#151;it was a bone of contention last Thursday when statistics became available&#151;in taking many rough sleepers off the streets by providing hostel accommodation for them. Many hostels refused to take the dogs, which meant that people were reluctant to leave their patch on the streets. However, one of the new hostels, in east London, catered for rough sleepers with pets. That hostel was a great success. There may be other such hostels, although I am not aware of them.
<P>
Has the Minister considered rough sleepers being offered alternative accommodation where they are allowed to take their pets&#151;provided of course that they are not just stringing a dog along for the sake of extra takings? In addition, if families or single people who own a dog become homeless, their choice of alternative accommodation might be greatly restricted. All hon. Members will know of constituents who are facing homelessness, perhaps because they are in arrears with their rent and are being ejected, thus becoming priority homeless for the local authority. If only bed-and-breakfast accommodation were available, they would be unable to take their pet with them.
<P>
If such people were lucky enough to be offered a flat or other accommodation, it might be at the top of a tower block, where it would be wholly inappropriate to keep pets, even if doing so were allowed under the housing association or local authority byelaws. It is generally the case in high-rise accommodation that pets can be kept only if their owners inhabit the ground floor. That can cause problems. People often flout the rule and it is difficult to enforce, but many people are concerned about the welfare of pets&#151;perhaps a big Alsatian dog&#151;kept on the 10th floor of a tower block where there might be, at best, only a balcony to provide outside access, because that is unfair on the animals and does nothing to help their welfare. It can also have an adverse impact on neighbours who have to put up with dogs barking. We all know the consequences.
<P>
That is not a small, but a significant issue. I have encountered several cases of single elderly people whose spouse has recently died and the dog, which has been part of the family for many years, is all that they have for companionship. Such people might face a choice between bed-and-breakfast accommodation, a high-rise flat or a small house in an area where the housing authority will not allow pets. It is a real problem&#151;after all, we are a nation of dog lovers. There are two questions to be asked: should there be better guidance for people in that position; and what measures should be taken to dissuade them from having pets, especially when they face difficulty acquiring accommodation for themselves and their family, let alone their animals?
<P>
It is difficult when the dog is such an important part of people's everyday lives, but we must take cognisance of that and find a way of accommodating such people. Those given a choice between giving up their dog or taking bed-and-breakfast accommodation without it might well end up as rough sleepers on the streets. The amendment is a preventive measure for people in those circumstances. These are probing amendments. Will the Minister explain how the Government's guidance to strategic partners dealing with homelessness strategies will deal with the issues that I have raised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth:</B> This is an important issue, and local authorities should endeavour to ensure that those placed in temporary accommodation are able to keep their pets, whenever that is possible and reasonable. The matter is of particular concern to many elderly people, and it is important that local authorities make proper provision and deal sensitively with it. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) said, the problem might be a barrier to helping rough sleepers off the streets.
<P>
We must recognise, however, that it will not always be possible for local authorities to make provision for animals in all circumstances, especially when the animals are many in number, dangerous, or in poor health. Not all accommodation can be made suitable for pets, and circumstances vary a great deal. Authorities should consider carefully their arrangements for dealing with the welfare of animals and review the facilities available for accommodating them, but they will also have to balance such a demand on their resources against other important claims. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman says that the amendments are only probing amendments. Circumstances vary so much that it is inappropriate to place a requirement in primary legislation or to make the issue more prominent than others that local housing authorities will have to address when reviewing or drawing up their strategies.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned rough sleepers. Attachment to pets is often a substantial barrier to helping people off of the streets and local authorities often make specific provision to deal with the problem by reducing numbers in their area, for example, by providing kennels within night shelters, or removing the ``no animals'' clause from registered social landlord agreements. We are aware of specific provision made for pets in hostels and move-on accommodation in Leicester, Manchester, London and elsewhere. Some provision is made in England for pets to remain with their owners when they come off the streets into hostels or permanent move accommodation. The rough sleepers unit actively encourages local authorities and hostels to be flexible, so that they can provide accommodation for couples and pets when having a pet might be helpful in encouraging people off the streets. Local authorities have made such provision in Cambridge, Leicester, Manchester and in other hostels across England, including the rough sleepers unit rolling shelter programme in London.
<P>
The Government's position is that local authorities should cover this issue, along with others, in the guidance that they draw up as part of their strategy. It should not be built into primary legislation because of the rigidity that that would impose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's comments. As I said, these were probing amendments. It is right to treat the issue with sensitivity. I shall not press the amendments, but I regard the Minister's examples of hostel accommodation with kennels attached as good, but patchy. I agree about the dangers of building a requirement into primary legislation, but we need stronger guidance to encourage local housing authorities to take the matter into consideration. It should be left to local authorities to assess local circumstances and requirements, but the profile of the issue should be raised up the ladder in the guidance.
<P>
There may be a case for treating animal welfare charities&#151;the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other smaller organisations&#151;as potential strategic partners, especially in city centres where the rough sleeper problem is rife. How local authorities deal with pets in high-rise accommodation is an enormous grey area, about which the Government should give guidance. The problem cannot be pushed under the carpet and ignored. Tenants need clear guidelines to explain what they can and cannot expect; they must then weigh up within that equation the likelihood of their securing acceptable accommodation if they keep their pet or buy a new one.
<P>
I am glad that the Minister has acknowledged that the issue is an important one and I shall withdraw the amendment. However, I make a plea for the issue to be given greater priority in the Government's guidance to local authorities on homelessness strategies. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 79, in page 11, line 45, after `organisations', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`local people, including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 95, in page 11, line 45, after `organisations', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`people living within the authority's area including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 90, in page 11, line 46, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to include organisations recognised by the Secretary of State as specialist in representing people with physical and mental disabilities.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 70, in page 11, line 46, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) Before adopting or modifying a homelessness strategy the authority shall consult any guidance given by the Secretary of State in relation to best practice with regards to housing and persons with mental health needs.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We move back to familiar territory. Subsection (8) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before adopting or modifying a homelessness strategy the authority shall consult such public or local authorities, voluntary organisations or other persons as they consider appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That raises the question of who the Government believe are the right organisations and persons to be covered by that provision. The amendments, which are similar to those moved by the Conservatives, propose that three categories of people should be considered: the first is our now familiar friend, the registered social landlord; the second is local people, including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness; and the third is people with mental health needs. The Conservatives' amendment No. 90 adds an additional category, which I welcome, of people with physical disabilities.
<P>
We have dealt in some detail with the argument in respect of incorporating registered social landlords. The Committee acknowledges the growing importance of RSLs as the holders of an increasingly large stock of affordable or social housing. As we know, by 2004 they are likely to be the majority owners of such accommodation and they therefore merit specific reference in any consultation agreements. Another category, with which amendment No. 69 deals but which we have not discussed in detail, is that of tenants groups. I hope that the Minister will at least acknowledge the importance of consultation with such groups.
<P>
I am delighted that the Minister's draft guidance has picked up the category of local people, in particular those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. A paragraph in the section entitled ``Duty to formulate homelessness strategies'' states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before adopting or modifying a strategy, the authority must consult any local or public authorities, or voluntary organisations, as they consider appropriate.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>However, a paragraph in a later section states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before adopting or modifying a strategy, the authority must consult any relevant organisations. This should involve those who are participating in the strategy and those affected by its provisions. Where possible, homeless people, people who have experienced homelessness, and those at risk of homelessness should also be consulted.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am delighted that, since the tabling of the amendment, the Minister has given us a clear assurance that that category of people will be consulted. However, it would be helpful to place on record today&#151;or, if he does not have the information to hand, later&#151;examples of good practice of how that could be done.
<P>
I have talked to representatives of a number of local organisations who, while they acknowledge that it is important, sometimes have difficulty finding appropriate people to assist them. Shelter carried out a consultation exercise with such people, who were pleased to be consulted and provided valuable advice. I hope that that experience and that of other successful local authorities can be passed on so that all local authorities can benefit from it.
<P>
The final category, which comes in amendment No. 70 and is touched on in Conservative amendment No. 90, is people with mental health needs. This is a particularly important area that is not mentioned in the guidance notes. I hope that the Under-Secretary can respond to it positively. We are all well aware that people with mental health needs sometimes get themselves into difficulties with their landlords, be it the local authority, a registered social landlord, a housing association or other landlord. Some of them may simply have a phobia about opening documents and consequently do not respond in due time to their landlord's requests.
<P>
People with mental health needs can sometimes, to use the vernacular, go walkabout, without informing their landlord that they will be away from the property for some time. There are many examples&#151;I am sure that many members of the Committee experienced it in their surgeries&#151;of people who have fallen foul of their landlord in that way. I hope that the Under-Secretary can acknowledge the importance of consulting such people and the organisations that represent them such as Mind and many others. I hope that he will look favourably, if not on the words, at least on the spirit in which the amendment is moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> This group of amendments includes two tabled by Conservative Members to which the hon. Member for Bath has already referred. Amendment No. 95 is similar to Liberal Democrat amendment No. 79. I will not repeat many of the comments that the hon. Gentleman made in support of that. It just seems common sense and obvious that homeless people should be added to the list of important bodies involved in the consultation exercise. The hon. Member for Bath is right; Shelter carried out an interesting study entitled ``Closing the Gap'', which provided a lot of interesting information taken from people who are at the sharp end of the problems dealt with in the Bill. I cannot see how bringing such people into the net could damage arguments A, Z, Q or whatever the Under-Secretary might like to throw back at us.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 is important. As the hon. Member for Bath mentioned, it goes further than Liberal Democrat amendment No. 70, which does not take into account the need to consult strategic partners with expertise in mental health and physical disabilities. I speak as the chairman of the Conservative disability group and my constituency includes Worthing, which contains the highest number of elderly people in the country, if not in the universe&#151;and I am delighted that it does. Long may it continue.
<P>
Of course, physical and mental disabilities especially affect older people. Statistics show that more than 40 per cent. of homeless people, including those who sleep rough, are over the age of 50, and there is evidence that older people are more vulnerable to the mental and physical ill effects of rough sleeping and unsatisfactory home conditions.
<P>
Elderly people and those with disabilities tend to lack access to mainstream services and accommodation because they are easily overlooked, although not as much as they were. Since 1995, welcome legislation on people with disabilities has, rightly, raised their profile. However, there is still some inflexibility between funding streams and a failure of collaboration between specialist teams in social services and voluntary groups and so on.
<P>
Suitable accommodation for physically disabled people must take into account their use of wheelchairs, for example, and the fact that they may be able to walk only a short distance. Doors must be accessible and easily opened and there must be ramps and rails to allow people to get into and around their homes. People with disabilities should not be housed on the third or fourth floor of tower blocks because of difficulties if the lifts are out of order and the type of flooring used must be considered when housing frail people who are not steady on their feet. Those are clear, physical conditions to be considered when housing a homeless disabled person.
<P>
There are social considerations, too, especially when the person involved has mental health problems. It is not enough merely to adapt a house or to have houses suitable for people with physical disabilities without considering their surroundings. We must ask questions such as, ``Who are they living next to? Is there someone who can keep an eye on an elderly, disabled person? What companionship can be offered to people? Are sheltered warden schemes available?'' The community around them matters a great deal to disabled people. It is no good putting people with mental disabilities next door to young families, for example, who may have a lower understanding of their difficulties and who may not appreciate the circumstances of a person's mental disability and its effects. That will make life more difficult for the family living next door and for the vulnerable disabled person who needs a bit of a leg up. The social and geographical aspects of appropriate housing for people with physical and mental disabilities must be considered.
<P>
I support the proposals made in the Local Government Association report ``No Place Like Home'' for dealing with people with disabilities. They include the following recommendations:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Social services and, where relevant, health authorities, should be involved in the allocation plan for households deemed to be in particular need of settled accommodation on medical grounds or welfare grounds in order to ensure that the need for support is assessed and provided as part of the allocation process.
<P>
 Housing, social services and health authorities should jointly agree hospital discharge planning arrangements.''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>we discussed the problems of bed blocking&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Local housing authorities should maintain a register of wheelchair-adapted properties in the council and housing association stock and, when feasible, in the private sector.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>As a key part of its housing strategy, a local authority in my constituency in Worthing, has transferred to Worthing Homes&#151;a registered social landlord&#151;some well-adapted bungalows for disabled people that are especially suitable for those in wheelchairs. My constituency has more than the average number of people who are not as mobile as others.

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the reverse situation, especially with regard to some mental disabilities? There have been some disturbing cases in my constituency involving people with mental disabilities who did not take their medication or who were placed in flats in small blocks. They caused enormous distress and nuisance to the other residents in the block, many of whom were elderly. I urge my hon. Friend to remember that there is another side to the problem, especially when flats and houses are close together.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That is absolutely right. It does not serve people with low-level mental disabilities or their neighbours if accommodation is offered without any sensitivity about its suitability, both for the disabled person and those who live nearby. Both sides are losers unless those factors are taken into account; putting people with mental problems in high-rise blocks, for example, is not a good idea.
<P>
The issue should be given greater prominence in the Bill as it involves a broad range of people. The amendments are not prescriptive; they want the authorities to have regard to the needs of people with disabilities. In view of the legislation on disability rights, it is appropriate that living accommodation, which is such an important part of the lives of disabled people, should be given greater prominence in a Bill that deals with that subject.
<P>
The amendments go further than the recommendations in ``No Place Like Home'', which we support, by stressing the need to involve specialist charities, which bring their expertise and experience to the sector's work. I commend the amendments to the Committee, especially amendment No. 90, which, as the hon. Member for Bath will agree, goes further than the Liberal Democrat amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth:</B> Once again, we sympathise with the amendment's aim, but differ from Opposition Members about how to achieve the desired outcome.
<P>
The Government have been consistent in putting people at the centre of our policies. We expect local authorities to seek the views of tenants and residents, including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, to inform the homelessness reviews and to help in drawing-up the strategies. We expect local government to engage with people in the area, to work in partnership and to be customer focused.
<P>
It is not necessary, or desirable, to put every detail in the Bill, but we will ensure that the matters are addressed in the code of guidance. It will be important for the Secretary of State to offer clear guidance on best practice in respect of housing and persons with mental health needs. Local housing authorities should tackle those needs directly through their homelessness strategies. The Secretary of State will give guidance on best practice in respect of other vulnerable groups. It would not be appropriate to view one deserving group as more worthy or important than another. To include one group in the Bill would imply that its needs were necessarily more pressing. I share hon. Members' concerns about the welfare of those with mental health needs. We will ensure that they are carefully addressed in the code of guidance.
<P>
I shall deal with the need to include those affected by local authority strategies. The Government have been consistent in placing people at the centre of our policies. We expect local authorities to seek the views of tenants and residents&#151;including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness&#151;to inform the homelessness reviews and to help to draw up the strategies. Again, it is not necessary to place every detail in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath asked whether we would make a commitment to spread examples of good practice. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is carrying out research into best practice in developing homelessness strategies, the results of which will be available later this year. I hope that that covers his concerns.
<P>
The hon. Member for&#151;[Interruption.] I will get the constituency right one day. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised various issues. The Housing Act 1996 specifically includes as a priority need category homeless people who are vulnerable as a result of mental illness. Any homelessness strategy should include provision for that client group.
<P>
The supporting people strategy is the Government's new approach to providing housing with support for vulnerable people. The guidance recently issued on supporting people states that there needs to be an integral link between the homelessness strategy and the supporting people strategy in any area. The latter strategy will draw in links with the appropriate specialists to which the hon. Gentleman refers in amendment No. 90, so his point is covered.
<P>
Having given those assurances, I ask the hon. Member for Bath to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am delighted that the Minister has assured us that those issues will be addressed. More important, in a sense, is the news that the DETR is carrying out research into best practice, which will be published and widely publicised.
<P>
I noted the new Under-Secretary's difficulty in coming to terms with the constituency of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. He said that he would get there one day. Unless things have changed and there is a different arrangement under the new Whip, we have but one day left for him to get it right, so I suggest that he practises hard over lunch.
<P>
I have another gentle point for the Minister. He referred to the Government's new supporting people strategy and the importance of an integral link between it and the homelessness strategy. The Minister for Housing and Planning has already told us that there will be a similar integral link with the council's housing policy. I suggest that we are in danger of over-burdening local authorities with the requirements to produce a wide range of different strategies.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will be aware that, during our deliberations some months ago on the Local Government Bill, we considered the requirement for local authorities to produce a community plan. The Government gradually but reluctantly agreed that, by making it a duty on local authorities to produce a plan, we were able to bring a large number of other plans within a single plan. Now that he has his new position, I hope that, with his hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning, the Under-Secretary will be prepared to consider again whether there would not be great merit in finding a way to require local authorities to produce a single plan that integrates those various issues. I assure him that local authorities would warmly welcome that in preference to the scattergun approach involving a range of different plans.
<P>
However, that is a side issue to the main point, which was to ensure that very clear guidance will be given to local authorities telling them that the range of people that they must consult includes registered social landlords, tenants groups, local people including those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, persons with mental health needs and, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham rightly adds, people with physical disabilities. We have had a clear assurance from the Minister that we are going to receive that, and with that assurance I intend to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I appreciate the comments made by the hon. Member for Bath. We will not press our amendments, but I do have a couple of points to raise with the Minister. We are encouraged by his assurance that these matters will be addressed in a code of conduct and best practice, especially with regard to provision for disabilities, with which I am most concerned.
<P>
Mencap has produced some interesting literature on the problems and the resettlement needs of people with learning disabilities who remain in long-stay hospitals, in part arising from the absence of suitable accommodation for them on coming out of hospital. A lack of housing alternatives is forcing many adults with a learning disability to continue to live at home with elderly parents, which can result in considerable pressure. Like anyone else, such people are entitled to move away from family accommodation and to make their own way in life, but Mencap estimates that there is a shortage of at least 5,000 homes a year to give people in that position equal access to their own home. That is a serious problem.
<P>
It is not only a question of giving a certain group of people priority. The people affected are a large contingent of the population&#151;far larger than any other special interest group that may want to be singled out. Therefore, I do not go along with argument A. Housing accommodation must to be tailored to people with physical disabilities in particular; otherwise there may be a surplus of housing accommodation that is no good because it is completely inaccessible to someone in a wheelchair. Special provision has to be made or accommodation will not be suitable for people with physical disabilities.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 is not designed to gain priority treatment for anyone. Its wording purely asks that disability organisations should be included as specialists who should be consulted. Therefore, even after an authority has consulted those organisations before adopting or modifying a homelessness strategy, it may decide that disability requirements are a lower priority within that area. The amendment should not be read as giving priority to people with disabilities; it merely would include in the framework a provision that such people and the specialist organisations that know such a lot about them should be consulted as part of a homelessness strategy. The Under-Secretary is wrong to suggest that the amendments would give priority in allocation to people with physical or mental disabilities. I appreciate the recognition that he has given to the fact that people who fall under those titles have special requirements. That was the reason for tabling the amendments. [Interruption.] The Under-Secretary looks as if he wants to rise before I have finished; he may want to intervene rather than make a speech after me.
<P>
I am not giving undue priority to the problem; there remains a case for including disability organisations in the Bill, though we shall not press the amendment to a vote. Will the Under-Secretary give an assurance that he acknowledges the importance of the issue?

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth:</B> Hon. Members have raised some important points. I hope to give the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham some assurance. I am grateful to him for not pressing the amendment. Section 189(1)(c) of the Housing Act 1996 specifies categories of people in priority need of accommodation so we are not ignoring the problem: the categories are already listed in the Act.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the appropriateness of accommodation. I assure him that good practice guidance will include suggestions from the LGA report, one of which was that local authorities keep a register of properties suitable for people in wheelchairs or others with disabilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That was one of the recommendations that I highlighted. I do not dispute what the Under-Secretary says, but we are talking at cross-purposes. Section 189 of the 1996 Act refers to definitions of priority need for accommodation, but we are debating clause 18, which is about authorities drawing up homelessness strategies. If priority needs had been recognised within the strategies in the first place, there would be no need for a preventive measure. Citing the 1996 Act does not address my central concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ainsworth:</B> People in priority need must be taken into account. They are already mentioned in the 1996 Act so they will be at the front of consideration when local authorities draw up their strategies. [Interruption.] It is already covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I hope that you will agree to a short stand part debate, Mr. Stevenson. Clause 18 deals with homelessness strategies, so it might be more appropriate to adopt a strategic view of what it says rather than pass rapidly on through it. We have already debated what should be included in the strategy and which bodies or organisations should be consulted.
<P>
Local authorities will face problems in formulating strategies. They will not be dealing with an ideal world, but with real problems faced by authorities today. Strategies will vary dramatically. It is almost possible to draw a line across the country and create two wholly different worlds of homelessness and housing&#151;those who have a demand problem and those who have the opposite problem. I have already mentioned how long people must wait for housing in my constituency.
<P>
It is quite clear that the Government are panicking about rising homelessness figures. In last week's debate on the Bill&#151;I do not want to rake over old coals&#151;the Minister for Housing and Planning was forced to admit that homelessness had risen under this Government. In a spectacular own goal, having risen to correct the figures that I had quoted, he produced even higher figures. The figure for total priority homeless acceptances in 1997-98 was 102,650. The latest figure produced by the Minister was a staggering 108,000&#151;a rise of nearly 6,000.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Mr. Nick Raynsford): Will the hon. Gentleman now put on the record the number of priority homeless applicants who were accepted by local authorities in 1996, the last year in which the Conservative party was in power, rather than suggesting in this preposterous way that the Labour party inherited a figure after already being in government for a year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It is no good the Minister throwing around $10 words like ``preposterous''. The figure is rising under his stewardship, and it is rising even faster than we thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Answer the question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister is making a different point, which he is perfectly entitled to do, and more than capable of doing when he has his bite at the cherry. There is nothing he can say to contradict my figures, which show that during his stewardship there has been an increase of nearly 6,000. Consequently, the Government have panicked and only yesterday announced an extra &#163;25 million to assist local authorities to house homeless households. Ministers have belatedly woken up to their failure to tackle homelessness.
<P>
It is quite instructive to look at the press release published by the Minister yesterday. It is headed:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Raynsford welcomes extra money to help homeless''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>It talks about the &#163;25 million being made available from April 2001 to assist local authorities and interestingly talks about local authorities being under increasing pressure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in part due to the increase in homeless households who are asylum seekers given leave to remain in Great Britain, or former-asylum seekers.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Clearly, despite some of the rhetoric that we heard in earlier sittings, asylum seekers remain a significant problem. They are a problem in London, of course. The hon. Member for Regents Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) and I have crossed swords on this before, but we both agree that it is a factor. The Association of London Government seems to consider it quite a significant factor. There is also a knock-on effect. There is a major problem on the south coast in places like Eastbourne, which no one has yet addressed. Increasingly London boroughs, which we accept are under great pressure, are entering into private arrangements to accommodate asylum seekers in small guest houses and holiday lets. I have raised this more than once with the Home Secretary and his fellow Ministers. It was supposedly to be addressed by a consortium approach through the LGA, but so far nothing has happened to resolve it.
<P>
<B>Ms Karen Buck </B>(Regents Park and Kensington, North): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Let me just make this point. It is absolutely disgraceful, and I am sure that the h Lady, would agree that despite all the understandable pressures on some London boroughs&#151;Newham is a good example, or a bad example, depending on how one looks at it&#151;they are still following that course without taking the preliminary and essential step of informing the recipient borough or council. That puts an unfair burden on the range of services available in that area.
<P>
<B>Ms Buck:</B> I just want to return to the point about asylum seekers. I wholly accept that the increase in the number of asylum applicants with whom local authorities are dealing is a factor in the demand. However, the accommodation problem in London and the south-east is caused by a long-term and sustained collapse in the supply of social housing. If he accepted that&#151;and the fact that it is a responsibility that goes back for the best part of 20 years&#151;we might have scope for common ground and a reasonable discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We are debating the issues in the fourth year of a Labour Government. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and I have quoted the falling figures for new social housing produced under the current Government. Those figures make the situation clear and I do not need to dwell on it.
<P>
It is interesting that the first point that the departmental press release makes relates to the problem of asylum seekers. The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North is right to say that there is a problem with supply of social housing. The good briefing from the ALG also covers that point. I see the hon. Lady waving at me&#151;I assume that she wants to intervene.
<P>
<B>Ms Buck:</B> I was actively involved in pressing the Government to provide local authorities in central London with some form of assistance with asylum seekers. The reason that it is an issue is that local authorities are in many cases accommodating asylum seekers in the private sector, where we face an escalating problem of cost. That is why we need additional assistance. The Audit Commission has been actively involved in helping us to identify that the issue of rental accommodation in the private sector is the core of our problem. We need to recognise that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Lady is describing, probably unwittingly, the fault of a market. It is certainly not the fault of Conservatives that this country has a record number of asylum seekers&#151;more than 75,000, and if one adds dependants the figure is heading towards 100,000. That is the result of a plain lack of so-called joined-up government&#151;a phrase of which, funnily enough, we have not heard much of late, probably because it has so manifestly failed to be provided. It is no earthly good the Minister trying, with the best intentions in the world, to solve the problems of homelessness, particularly in large cities and such places as Eastbourne, if his right hon. and hon. Friends in the Home Office are simply not doing their stuff.
<P>
I make no apology for mentioning Eastbourne; I use it as an example. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a deprived inner city area, yet the latest figures, which were debated with great concern by my local council only the other day, show that since April last year, 171 families or people have been housed in bed and breakfast accommodation, compared with 76 the year before and 50 the year before that. That is an enormous rise for a modest-sized south-coast resort, leaving aside what may be happening in other parts of the country.
<P>
If homelessness strategies are to mean anything, the Government must have a proper strategy of their own. Under the current Government, the supply of social housing has gone down while the homelessness figures have gone up. As the current edition of Housing Today reports, in an article entitled ``Labour's minimal impact on empties'':
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``New Labour's record on reducing the number of empty homes has been dealt a serious blow after figures showed practically no movement four years after coming to power.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am expecting the Minister to leap up at any moment and challenge the DETR figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I challenge the hon. Gentleman to read the rest of the article.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I will not read the whole article, unless the hon. Gentleman insists. However, he is welcome to borrow my copy if he wants to read it all out.
<P>
DETR figures show that the total number of empty homes fell by just 4,300 to 762,700 between April 1997 and April 2000. The article goes on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the number of empty properties owned by councils and housing associations actually increased during the period.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>If the Minister will not accept my arguments on the issue, will he accept those of Mr. Ashley Horsey, the chief executive of the Empty Homes Agency and a person well known to all of us? He is quoted, I assume accurately, in the article as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Over the four years that the current Labour government has been in power, and with speculation of a spring general election rising, the end of term report from the Empty Homes Agency on the government's efforts to tackle empty homes would have to be `has shown some promise, but only limited progress to date. Must try harder'.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>We therefore have a strategic picture of falling social housing provision, growing homelessness, growing numbers of asylum seekers&#151;which the Minister accepts as a major, if not the principal, factor in many areas&#151;and a failure to tackle the problem of empty properties. It is no earthly good the Government lecturing individual councils and local authorities about implementing strategies if they are so wholly at sea in terms of their own strategy&#151;or lack thereof. When the strategies start to emerge, it will be extremely interesting and instructive to see how varied they are and whether there are dramatic differences between those of councils in the north and in the south. Such differences are, again, based on supply and demand as much as anything else, as the hon. Lady confirmed in an intervention.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We welcome homelessness strategies, as I think does every organisation involved. I hope that good councils already have a form of strategy, for their own consumption, which will just need to be dusted off and revamped to comply with the Minister's requirements. However, we must remember the situations that councils face as a result of the blatant failure of the Government's homelessness policy at almost every level.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman on one point: strategies will vary enormously from area to area. He slightly oversimplified the matter by saying that one would be able to draw a line between north and south and see fundamental differences between the two regions. He would be the first to recognise that areas in the south have problems of low demand; one example is Hastings, just along the coast from him, which has had well-publicised problems of that nature. Equally, some areas in the north have considerable pressures. However, I agree in general with his analysis that there will be significant variations between strategies in different parts of the country. That is all to the good and it is why we are encouraging strategies so that local authorities can develop an approach to homelessness that is appropriate for the needs of their area.
<P>
I hesitate to take us back into the territory of statistics but two statistical points must be made. Despite the best efforts of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, the DETR figures that he was so pleased to quote show clearly and conclusively that when his party left office, local authorities had accepted 110, 000 homeless people in priority need categories. The latest figure is 108,000. I have said many times that that is too high and that we have much more to do in tackling the problem. It is simply untrue that we have more homeless households now than we inherited from the previous Government. That is a straightforward statistical point.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham fell into a similar trap in trying to interpret the figures on rough sleepers that were issued last week. I hope that he will not mind if I put the record straight. He quoted a figure of 286 rough sleepers in London at the end of the previous Government's term and implied that because there are now 546 rough sleepers in the capital, the number had, in his words, almost doubled. He is confusing unlike with unlike. The figure of 286 was based on head counts of people sleeping rough in a few selected parts of central London and did not cover the whole of the London area. Under the head counts instituted in June 1998, as a result of the Government's policy on rough sleepers, the number in London at that time was 620, which in June 2000 had reduced to 546. On a comparable, like-for-like basis there is therefore evidence of a reduction&#151;not enough and there is still a great deal to be done, but it is a reduction. There were no comparable figures for London or, indeed, the whole of Britain. That was one of the reasons why, when in opposition, the Labour party wanted a more comprehensive strategy on rough sleepers. We supported the previous rough sleepers initiative, which did good work, but it was targeted at a limited number of selected areas. We take a more comprehensive approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am not sure what the Minister's point is. Is he claiming that this Government are more efficient at counting the number of rough sleepers? If so, that is not a great step forward. Otherwise, does he accept that, however one approaches the counting of rough sleepers, there is a substantial margin for error, even in the figures that he claims are more reliable?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have had ample opportunity to place their different figures on the record. I hope that, having done so they will move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall happily move on, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
I found an aspect of the speech made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne slightly surprising. In all his comments on yesterday's announcement about additional help for authorities that are meeting the needs of and accommodating homeless people, including asylum seekers, in private-sector accommodation, he did not acknowledge that it was a good thing that an extra &#163;25 million had been secured to help local authorities. It was rather extraordinary that he referred to it and made party-political points, but could not bring himself to say that it was a good thing to provide extra help for authorities that have been under pressure.
<P>
That shows the difference between our two parties. The Conservatives are only too happy to identify and talk about problems, but when it comes to practical measures to deal with them, their party&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Surely the Minister would agree that it would have been even better to have given that &#163;25 million three years ago, rather than three months before a likely election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If the hon. Member for East Shoreham&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham wants me to run through the investment figures since the election, I will happily give them to him and point out the increased investment that the Government have made through the capital receipts initiative, then the spending review and now the spending review 2000. However, I will not rise to that, as I fear that I would be out of order if I did so.
<P>
<B>Ms Buck:</B> Does my hon. Friend remember that the first additional support for inner London authorities that were coping with those pressures was announced, I think, in June 1997? A number of different initiatives have helped the boroughs of Kensington and Westminster in my constituency over the past four years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I well remember the Committee stage&#151;it may have taken place in this Room&#151;of the Bill that released capital receipts and honoured our election commitment to increase funding for local authorities. That was an early indication of our commitment to tackling the problems. We have made substantial progress since then and increased spending by a series of different measures, culminating in the spending review 2000, which has added substantially to investment for both the improvement of existing stock and a new generation of social housing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne made perfectly fair points about the increased number of people in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We recognise that that is a problem, which is why we have acted through the additional financial help that I have described. We have also recognised the need for a more strategic approach by local authorities with more emphasis on the prevention of homelessness. Clause 18 is about a multi-agency approach to ensure that there is more effective preventive work as well as more effective help for those who become homeless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I hope that the Minister will deal in some detail with the point that I made about asylum seekers. In his multi-agency approach, does he include his colleagues at the Home Office, who seem to be a major factor in a major part of the problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not given me an opportunity to get into my stride; I am trying to answer the various points. Of course I take my right hon. and hon. Friends at the Home Office very much into account. We work extremely closely with them, and they are fully aware and supportive of the measures announced yesterday. Equally, we have been in close contact with them about the measures that they have taken to tackle that serious problem.
<P>
There is no secrecy about the figures, which I am happy to put on record. In 2000, there were 76,000 new applications from asylum seekers&#151;up by 4,800 from 71,160 applications in 1999. It is a large number, but not as high as the figure suggested by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. My right hon. and hon. Friends at the Home Office had to tackle the appallingly inefficient system inherited from the previous Conservative Government, which had resulted in a huge backlog. The number of decisions taken by the Home Office increased from 33,700 in 1999 to 110,000 in 2000. The Government have taken action to speed up the processes, ensure that initial decisions can be taken quickly and reduce outstanding applications.
<P>
All that evidence demonstrates that the Government are tackling the problem with determination. We do not pretend that all the problems have gone away; we acknowledge their existence, and we are working to deal with them. The same applies to empty homes: yes, there are too many, but if the hon. Member for Eastbourne had quoted Mr. Ashley Horsey more fully, he would have revealed that the Empty Homes Agency warmly welcomed the Government measures. In common with any pressure group, the Empty Homes Agency rightly says, ``Can do better; should do more'', but it recognised that the Government had shown some promise. The hon. Gentleman missed out various passages, so neglected to mention that the Empty Homes Agency welcomed the changes in the rules on capital allowances for flats over shops to help to bring them into greater use. The reduced rate of VAT on properties being converted to residential use is another example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the Minister quantify those two examples: how many flats will be brought into use over the five-year period, and how many houses derelict for more than 10 years will qualify for VAT exemption?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> This is not a Finance Bill debate and the announcements to which I referred were made only recently. These are early days. The Conservative Government could have taken those measures, but did not. The present Government have taken them and they will make an impact, as the Empty Homes Agency acknowledges. The Opposition spokesman chose not to cite that passage in his selective quotation from the newspaper. It is typical of the Conservatives to use selective quotes to give a pejorative impression about the Government's performance rather than any attempt to establish the truth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Perhaps I can selectively quote the Minister's colleague, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who quantified the flats-above-shops relief as likely to affect no more than 5,000 properties over five years and who was unable to provide a figure for the 10-year derelict VAT exemption because its impact would be negligible. Before trumpeting those great measures, should the Minister not admit the truth that they are tiny scratchings off the tip of the iceberg?

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The Opposition spokesman quoted Mr. Ashley Horsey of the Empty Homes Agency, who did not refer to ``tiny scratchings'', but welcomed Government action to tackle the problem. As I said, we expect pressure groups to encourage the Government to do more. We understand that: it is politics and life. It is wrong of the Opposition, however, to pretend that the Government are doing nothing. That is simply not the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I divine that the Minister may have moved on from asylum seekers, but I remind him of the widespread practice of London boroughs placing people in places such as Eastbourne without reference to the local council or other local agencies. How does the Minister propose to deal with that problem, which is certainly not being dealt with by the Home Office or the LGA? Will any sum from the &#163;25 million find its way to places such as Eastbourne, which has a secondary asylum seeker problem, as I have described?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Obviously, it is important to encourage good working relationships between the different local authorities involved when people are referred from one area to another. Not all of the areas that face less intense pressure than some of the London and south-east authorities have been wholly supportive or encouraging in helping their colleagues in London and the south-east&#151;I am not talking about Eastbourne. I hope that the Opposition, like the Government, believe that there should be a co-operative approach throughout the country and that authorities should try to help, especially if those that have supplies of housing that are not in great demand. I pay tribute to some authorities that have been especially good at identifying low-demand properties that might be available.
<P>

<P>
The &#163;25 million package announced yesterday is not ring-fenced for any one particular area. It relates to the cost of accommodation, and although it is likely that the bulk of it will be for the benefit of London authorities, because that is where the pressures are greatest, there is no reason in principle why Eastbourne should not also benefit.
<P>
The Government accept entirely the other adage used by Mr. Ashley Horsey of the Empty Homes Agency: must try harder. That is what we are doing&#151;the Bill and the clause are all about ensuring more effective work to tackle the problems of homelessness. I hope that hon. Members will recognise the good sense of the clause and that they will agree that it should stand part of the Bill.

<B>Ms Buck:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 12, line 20, after `intentionally', insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(i) for subsection (2) there is substituted&#151;<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment returns to the question of advice, which we discussed in connection with an earlier amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. In particular, it deals with standards of service in respect of advice to people who are in non-priority need and to people in areas of higher demand who are unlikely to be able to gain access to accommodation. The amendment is designed to strengthen the current duty, which at present can be discharged according to what the authority considers to be appropriate; it would introduce a greater consistency into the standards of service across the country; and it would bring the worst up to the level of the best by setting a basic standard.
<P>
That is important: non-priority applicants are wholly dependent on the quality of advice and assistance that they receive from local authorities and other advice agencies, because there is no realistic prospect of them ever receiving a tenancy from a local authority or housing association. I have received many letters in respect of constituents in the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea and from Westminster carrying the chill words ``We are unlikely ever to be able to consider you for an offer of accommodation.''
<P>
The sort of people we are talking about are those who do not fall into the categories of vulnerability that currently give them priority. They are adult children who are being forced out of overcrowded accommodation; or people living in private rented accommodation that they can no longer afford&#151;that recalls our earlier exchange about the cost of accommodation in the private rented sector, which has become wholly unrealistic for anyone on an average income; or people in the private rented sector coming to the end of their assured shorthold tenancy whose landlord is unwilling or unable to renew it. That demand is one of the principle sources of applications to housing assessment and advice in my own area. Such demand also commonly arises from family breakdown. One of the partners, usually the man of the family, leaves home after a relationship breaks down and wants, rightly, to stay within the location so that he has access to the children, but has no means of being able to do so.
<P>
Such people are dependent upon the quality of the advice and assistance that they get. They comprise a large group; it accounted for about a quarter of all applicants to housing assessment and advice last year, or around 55,000 people. Of course, that is likely to be a huge underestimate, because the overwhelming majority of people in that category in London and the south-east would not even consider approaching their housing department, because they know the pressures. However, despite the importance of the advice service to such people, quality of service varies greatly across the country.
<P>
I pay tribute to the staff in the housing assessment and advice units in the two boroughs that I represent because. They have a tough job. However, in practice, the advice that people in the categories I have listed usually received is about as much use as a chocolate teapot. In Westminster, it usually consists of a piece of paper listing local bed-and-breakfast accommodation, or a note suggesting that they look in the Evening Standard or Loot. That is the sum of the advice that they are given. In addition, extreme pressures on the paucity of other advice services in central London, such as citizens advice bureaux and law centres, they are left extremely vulnerable.
<P>
In its report ``Singles Barred'', Shelter found an extraordinary variation in the quality of advice and assessment in different parts of the country that could not be accounted for by high demand. Indeed, some of the best performing local authorities were those in high demand areas&#151;Camden and Ealing were singled out for praise. Local authorities in areas of high demand and in areas of low demand were among those providing extremely poor advice. In some, people were turned away without being given an interview or any advice. Assessments were not made consistently, so that potentially vulnerable people, who might not appear so on paper and would not necessarily fall into any priority housing category, were missed. None of the applicants surveyed received a written notice of decision, nor were they informed of their rights to review.
<P>
Such poor service can cause people to lose their homes unnecessarily when they could have been helped to remain in them. Some will fail to get available accommodation, particularly in the private rented sector. Some may have housing benefit arrears but be unaware that they qualify for housing benefit&#151;it is very common for people who are in work to have no idea of the existence of housing benefit as an in-work benefit. Some who face a gap between their rent and their housing benefit payments may not know that in certain circumstances they would qualify for assistance with exceptional hardship payments, or they may not be aware of the availability of assistance through rent deposit schemes. Such provisions would be available to them if the quality of housing advice were consistent.
<P>
I am especially concerned about potentially vulnerable people who are missed&#151;a problem I have come across on several occasions. One example that springs to mind involves a young gay man whose partner had committed suicide in his privately rented flat. He was extremely vulnerable and believed that he might be HIV-positive, but had not felt confident enough to be tested. He was experiencing quite severe symptoms of psychiatric distress but because of his age and the fact that he had not been diagnosed as HIV-positive, he did not fall into a priority group. Such people get missed.
<P>
The amendment is designed to set a framework of standards. I understand the concern expressed by the LGA about it being too prescriptive, but I think that if authorities are to be made to be concerned about the problem, they must engage with us in dialogue about how to make standards consistent across the country. The sort of standards that I am looking for are those whereby all applicants are guaranteed an interview to ensure that vulnerable claimants are not missed out; all applicants are given accurate and up-to-date information about the options available to them; and people have access to information about where they can obtain benefits and quality advice about landlord and tenant law, for example. In addition, all applicants should receive information and a written decision about the right to review.
<P>
My amendment is a probing one, but I hope that I have made the case for its proposals. The issue is a minefield; we must consider what it is reasonable for the Government to prescribe and bear in mind the danger of being too prescriptive in placing duties on local authorities. The quality of advice, especially in areas of high demand, is crucial to people who are unable to gain access to social housing. I look to my hon. Friend the Minister to state what can be done to ensure that the local authorities that provide the worst services are brought up to the standard of the best.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Member for Regents Park and Kensington, North was careful to describe the measure as a probing amendment&#151;a comment that might have followed an in-depth exchange of views with the Whip. We do not know whether Ministers will accept the amendment, but I can state provisionally&#151;because we must first listen to the rest of the debate&#151;that we are quite taken with it and that, subject to the observations offered by other members of the Committee and the Minister, we are minded to support it. I hope that the four Labour Back Benchers in whose names the amendment stands will have the courage of their convictions in the event of a Division.
<P>
In the housing Green Paper, the Government promised councils an enhanced advisory role. It proposed to extend local authorities' duty to provide advice and support requiring them
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to take a multi-agency strategic approach to preventing and responding to homelessness''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Conservatives in local government warmly welcomed that proposal. However, the Bill falls well short of the Green Paper's modest suggestions in two respects: first, there is no clear mention of the multi-agency approach to homelessness advice&#151;strategic partners are needed in that equation. Secondly, crucially, the requirement to advise people is too narrow, referring only to those seeking allocation of housing.
<P>
If the proposals are to have the profound effect on homelessness that we and the hon. Lady want, the scope of the advisory role, especially its preventive value, should be much wider and help people to secure or maintain housing under any form of tenure, including owner occupation. The Minister will agree&#151;they may be famous last words&#151;that many people who fall into homelessness are owner-occupiers who get into difficulties. Many owner-occupiers have problems paying their mortgage and repairing and maintaining the property, or simply coping with the responsibilities of owner occupation.
<P>
It is telling that Labour Back Benchers felt it necessary to table amendment No. 80 to encourage the Govt to consider a wider role than that is proposed in the Bill as drafted. The amendment builds upon the existing provisions of the Housing Act 1996 to enable persons to gain assistance from their council while attempting to secure accommodation themselves, rather than simply getting advice as part of the allocations process, important though that is.
<P>
That is not a new theme; it was pursued by the Local Government Association, which is very much in favour of a properly enhanced duty of advice to prevent homelessness before it reaches crisis point. I do not apologise for quoting again from the document ``No Place Like Home'', produced by the LGA's allocations and homelessness task group, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The current duty to provide housing advice is only in relation to homelessness and the prevention of homelessness. The LGA Home Ownership Task Group has recommended a broader duty for local authorities to ensure the availability of housing advice on a range of issues in order to better empower and enable applicants to help themselves.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The LGA regards the advisory role as a corporate responsibility and not solely a matter for the housing department or a particular section. I hesitate to use the word ``holistic'', which is one of the most overused words in current jargon, but there should be debt counselling, help with access to welfare benefits, grants and so on, and a range of sources of advice. The LGA feels that other departments, such as social services and environmental health, can also play a key role.
<P>
The association mentions the importance of education in teaching life skills and ensuring that young people have realistic expectations of the local housing market. The document ''No Place Like Home'' states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is a considerable lack of understanding amongst young people about housing availability''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North touched on that point&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and the potential consequences of homelessness. Schools and colleges could play a role in local authority prevention strategies by helping to ensure young people are more aware of the issues and by helping them to develop life skills and self esteem.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The report concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Local authorities should be given a broader duty and the resources to enable them to carry out that duty effectively to ensure the provision of housing advice on a range of issues, including home ownership and the private rented sector, in their districts.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>A local Conservative politician, Councillor Paul Bettison, who is chairman of the LGA's housing executive and leader of Conservative-controlled Bracknell Forest borough council, spoke about the problems that face hon. Members and councillors of all parties in all constituencies in a recent speech to the annual conference of Crisis. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``By `quality', we aren 't just talking about the quality of housing on offer to prevent homelessness, important though that is. We need to ensure quality across the full service and that, for example, is why so much thought has been given by housing experts to the range and depth of the advisory role that should form part of any homelessness strategy.
<P>
 We can have high numbers of houses available; we can have a good choice of housing available; we can have good quality homes available. All this will count for little if those people most vulnerable to homelessness do not know about it, or do not know how to access it.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Councillor Bettison spoke in warm terms of Shelter's homeless-to-home scheme and its effect. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Shelter has been at the forefront in getting across this message''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Hon. Members have Shelter's briefing papers on amendment No. 80; they are quite long and I shall not quote from them extensively unless the Minister presses me to do so. They refer, for example, to the experience in their housing advice centres. Evidence from Shelter's research and the document ``Singles Barred'', to which the hon. Lady referred, is that many local authorities fail to provide a decent service. People are turned away without being given an interview receiving any advice; assessments of vulnerability are inconsistently applied and in some cases contravene statutory guidance. Many applicants do not receive a written notice of the authority's decision and they are told nothing about their right to a review&#151;a matter that we shall discuss in more detail later.
<P>
Shelter states that the new power is clause 20 is most welcome and makes an important point that is the ghost at the feast in many of our debates, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In areas where demand for social housing is high, authorities are unlikely to have any available accommodation to offer non-priority homeless people, as most of it will go to households in priority need.
<P>
 The reality is that in London , most of the south of England and many other parts of the country this power is unlikely to make much difference.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Minister should reflect carefully on what Shelter says and ask whether the power is merely theoretical, given that in many parts of the country, especially in London and the south of England, it will have no effect. Shelter also mentions other categories of people at risk, of which the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North gave some examples. It says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there are many other circumstances where people can lose their homes but will not be deemed a priority: in cases of extreme poverty, unemployment, sexual and physical abuse, family disputes and relationship breakdown.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Shelter gives useful examples, but I shall mention one statistic first. As a result of reports from its housing aid centres, Shelter concludes that the level of homelessness services is extremely variable&#151;to put it mildly&#151;particularly for people not in priority need. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In 1999/2000 over 50,000 non-priority homeless people approached local authorities for assistance.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am not sure where Shelter got that figure, but it is quite a lot of people. If even a minority of them did not receive any help or useful assistance, that is a serious matter.
<P>
Shelter quotes several examples, but I shall give only one, because I do not want to detain the Committee. One of four volunteers involved in the research posed as a 30-year-old woman fleeing domestic violence. Shelter says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``At one London authority Homeless Persons Unit, the applicant was told by the receptionist that a passport was essential, before he could pass on her details . . . The applicant was also informed that the local authority required a police or doctor's report to prove that it was unsafe for her to remain in her present accommodation. She was told that she was non-priority because she was single, without children and not pregnant. The applicant was left with no choice other than to return home.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That was a piece of research, but had the applicant been a real person in those circumstances, she would have been forced to return to the place where she had suffered the problem of domestic violence in the first place. The unit did not give her any information. The one thing that it did manage to do was to give her a customer satisfaction survey to fill out as she left the premises&#151;obviously, one box was ticked on that occasion.
<P>
The applicant went to another London authority and presented the same set of facts. Shelter says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the applicant was asked by the receptionist whether it was her first time there, and if she had somewhere to stay that night. She was then told that she would have to go to one of their Housing and Council Tax Customer Service centres first, where her needs . . . could be assessed. They would then refer her back to the Homeless Persons Unit.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is a significant number of hurdles for any of us to overcome, let alone someone who, in the real world, would be very distressed.
<P>
When the applicant presented at a metropolitan authority, a proper assessment of her needs was made. Shelter says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``She was given a choice of emergency accommodation...and told that if the direct access unit was unable to find her a place in a hostel that day (nothing was available at the time), she would be offered a sofa there.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Finally, the applicant went to a rural authority, where she was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``given a housing application form to fill in. She was told by the housing officer that, she could only assist and advise. The applicant was given contact numbers for a local women's centre and a list of . . . homeless accommodation . . . She was told that she was not a priority because she did not have children.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>She was given advice about not putting up with domestic violence, but at the end of the day she was still left with nowhere to go.
<P>
There are examples of other categories and types of cases in the document, to which I am sure most hon. Members have access. Again, Shelter has done useful research and produced some fairly hair-raising results, which show the enormous variability of the service offered.
<P>
On amendment No. 80. the Association of London Government says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``While we support best practice guidance on advice and assistance to households not in priority need, we have reservations about the Secretary of State having the power to direct local authorities on the form such support should take.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I certainly see the force of that argument. It is another of the ``damned if you do, damned if you don't'' arguments, which seem to crop up with alarming regularity, certainly in this Committee. How prescriptive should we be to deal with a practical, real-world problem? The ALG goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``London boroughs will face significant additional costs relating to the extension of duties to households in priority need, and, in those authorities under the most severe pressure, resources are not available to meet additional costs to support non-priority households.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That echoes Shelter on the simple fact that in large parts of the south of England and London, the new power may make no difference whatever. We sympathise with the points made by the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends and I hope that the Minister will deal with them sympathetically and constructively.

<P>

<B>Mr. Love:</B> In response to the hon. Member for Eastbourne, I rise to support the amendments, though I am always mindful of delaying the Committee and do not want to repeat the arguments. As a London Member, however, it is important to highlight some of the arguments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North.
<P>
London and the south-east are high-demand areas. We recognise the new power in the Bill to allow authorities to house non-priority cases, but it is unlikely in the short term to have any real impact in the Greater London area. There are substantial numbers of non-priority homeless&#151;about a quarter of all homeless, amounting to 54,000 cases last year. Evidence suggests&#151;and Shelter confirms it&#151; that that could be a significant underestimate.
<P>
If we cannot provide accommodation, we should be able to provide a decent level of advice and assistance. On the basis of my experience as a London Member, approximately a quarter of all the cases at my surgery are housing-related, a significant number being non-priority cases.
<P>
I echo my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North in noting that my local authority is under considerable stress. I recognise its difficulties, but the service that it provides can be variable. People often come to my surgery without any understanding of their own circumstances and the authority has failed to provide them with any helpful advice. Clearly, many such people are priority neither for housing nor for advice and assistance. That must change. The response of some local authorities to requests for assistance is to give the telephone number of Shelterline rather than to offer proper support .
<P>
We should examine ways of strengthening the current duty. Frankly, it hardly exists because authorities are asked only to provide advice and assistance ``appropriate'' in the circumstances, which leaves it wide open to interpretation. The weakness of that provision was demonstrated in the consumer exercise in the Shelter survey. Two of the authorities mentioned were in the London area.
<P>
The survey showed that the advice and assistance was variable and sometimes very poor indeed. That is hardly surprising when we know that some people were not even interviewed. How advice and assistance can be provided without interviewing people to ascertain their circumstances is a mystery. Sometimes no advice whatever was offered and no one was interviewed about their level of vulnerability or asked to check that their interpretation of the guidance was correct. I know of such cases from my constituency surgery.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne mentioned the provision of a written notice and telling people that there is a review mechanism. We need to look at that. While accepting local authorities' concern about being too prescriptive, there are areas on which the code of guidance will need to advise on what the advice and assistance should be. Everyone would accept that one needs to interview the person concerned to ascertain his or her housing needs. We should also provide information and advice on the availability of accommodation. If the local authority and the social sector cannot assist people with that, general guidance should be given to assist them in finding their own solutions to their housing problem. As has been said, there is also a need to provide assistance with benefits entitlement. In the London area, much accommodation is unfurnished and people need help to find out where they can obtain furniture if they want to move into such accommodation.
<P>
Giving a written decision and having it reviewed are important rights that should be available. As my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North said, the Bill should strengthen the rights of non-priority homeless people because of the stress that exists in high-demand areas. I hope that the Minister will be able to do something to help with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had an excellent debate. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who have a deep understanding of the issues and want better provision for the homeless have made clear and passionate speeches. I pay tribute to not only their contributions but those of Shelter, an organisation that has campaigned for many years on behalf of homeless people and has provided back-up, research and expertise to advise hon. Members on how to improve homelessness policy and how to draft amendments most felicitously to achieve some of its objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am delighted that the Minister's appreciation of Shelter has moved seamlessly from Opposition to Government. I associate my party with his endorsement of Shelter, an extremely helpful organisation to which we are all grateful. There is a cross-party&#151;indeed, all-party&#151;consensus on these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have listened with interest to the points raised by hon. Members and agree with much that has been said. Authorities should take seriously their responsibilities to those who are unintentionally homeless but not in priority need. It is not acceptable for authorities to send such applicants away without adequate advice and assistance. Shelter's recent study, ``Singles Barred'', which has been quoted by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, reported on the variable, inconsistent and sometimes inadequate quality of local authority advice and assistance. The hon. Member for Eastbourne singled out the passage dealing with the 30-year-old woman and highlighted the different treatment that she received in different areas. He pointed out that in one area she was told that she was not a priority because she did not have children.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman, like all members of the Committee, will know that the Government are determined to change that situation, which is why we will introduce an order that will extend the categories of priority need to include women fleeing domestic violence even when they do not have children. That demonstrates the Government's positive response to that situation, but of course it goes wider, as it covers people who will not be within the priority categories even when they are amended and who should receive better and more consistent advice than they are getting at the moment. There is merit in strengthening the current duty to move away from the subjective requirement for the authority to provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``advice and such assistance as they consider appropriate in the circumstances''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and move to a more objective test. Of course, nothing is ever quite as simple as it seems, at least not when considering amendments. The wording
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such assistance as they consider appropriate in the circumstances''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not just appear here. It appears in four other locations in the 1996 Act, and it would be inconsistent to agree one amendment without making comparable amendments elsewhere to ensure consistency throughout the legislation. For those reasons we do not intend to accept the amendment, but I do intend, if possible, to table an amendment to schedule 2 for the Committee to consider on Thursday.
<P>
I am less attracted by the second part of the amendment, which would have the Secretary of State specifying matters to be taken into account in determining whether advice and assistance that the authority proposes to provide is reasonable. There is such wide variation in the circumstances of different local authorities in different parts of the country that it is simply not sensible to specify nationally how authorities should respond in the light of local circumstances. As hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have said, there are enormous variations and we must recognise that. We do not wish to be unduly prescriptive, and we recognise the concerns that have been expressed in some quarters of local government about an excessively dirigiste approach if this part of the amendment were to be accepted. My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North who moved the amendment, acknowledged that it might be a little over-prescriptive. In those circumstances, we believe that it is right to table an alternative amendment to enable the Committee to debate it on Thursday. That will be located in schedule 2. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw her amendment.
<P>
I must respond to one or two of the other points that have been made during the debate. The hon. Member for Eastbourne expressed concern that there was no reference to a multi-agency approach. We have been debating that for most of the morning. A multi-agency approach is fundamental to the way the Government want to see authorities discharge their responsibilities. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Coventry South-West&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth:</B> North-East.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> North-East&#151;got it! My hon. Friend made the point very effectively.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne was a little unwise in highlighting the problems of owner-occupiers facing homelessness. He will recall the legacy of the previous Government who, in the early 1990s, managed to create a crisis of repossessions and the worst crisis of confidence in the home ownership market that this country has ever seen. I am pleased to say that the number of repossessions and the number of people plunged into negative equity have reduced consistently under this Government. Therefore, the extent of the problem facing owner-occupiers is significantly less than it was under the Government he supported. However, I accept that we need to do more for those home owners in difficulty in just the same way as we need to do more for other people in difficulty. That is precisely the purpose of this legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne referred to the legislation building on the 1996 Act. That is not an accurate description. This legislation amends some of the defects of the 1996 Act, which in certain respects significantly weakened the responsibilities for the homeless established in the 1977 legislation. If he has done his research, he will know that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1997 was introduced as a private Member's Bill by a Liberal Democrat Member with the support of the then Labour Government and that it was opposed by the Tory Opposition, even though three Conservative Members had sponsored the Bill. The official Conservative spokesman at the time took the interesting view that because it was in his view a Government Bill, the Opposition would oppose it. That is perhaps a comment on the Conservative party's lack of vision at that time. The Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 established the proper framework of responsibility for homeless people. We are now not just restoring it from the ravages of the 1996 Act, but enhancing it through the improvements set out in the Bill and through the extension of the priority need categories that I have already described.
<P>
I end on a point of agreement with the hon. Member for Eastbourne. He rightly highlighted the need for high-quality services and he quoted Paul Bettison, the chairman of the LGA housing committee, with whom I have worked closely and harmoniously in recent months. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about Paul Bettison's constructive and positive approach on this. We are happy to work with the LGA to carry forward the policies in the Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) spoke with feeling of his experience and described how a quarter of his surgery cases involve housing or homelessness problems. He recognised the variable standards of service offered in his area, while at the same time acknowledging the difficulty that his local authority faces because of local pressures. It is undoubtedly true that all authorities can do more and certainly those authorities that face less pressure than his can do a great deal more. We hope that with a clearer duty to provide advice and assistance to those not in priority need, we will enhance and improve the quality of homelessness services throughout the country. I urge my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Regents Park and Kensington, North to withdraw her amendment.

<B>Ms Buck:</B> I am grateful for the support that I received from my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton, although to echo the Monty Python four Yorkshiremen sketch, I just dream of only one quarter of the people coming to my surgery having housing problems. I am also grateful for the supportive remarks of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, although a little hintette of mischief-making just at the outer margins slightly undermined their generosity. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his supportive remarks and his recognition of the needs that I outlined. I look forward to seeing the wording of the proposed new amendment that will move us on from the subjectivity of the present definition.
<P>
In light of the spirit of acceptance for the first part of the amendment, I will seek leave to withdraw it. I understand why the LGA and others have reservations about the potentially prescriptive powers in the other parts of the amendment, but I stand by the thrust of my comments about the need to iron out some of the worst practice. I hope that the DETR will continue to work with the local government and housing organisations to do what they can to raise the profile of best practice so that we deal with the deficiencies. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 85, in page 12, line 28, leave out `homeless' and insert `threatened with homelessness'.
<P>
Briefly, the amendment is typical of the Government amendments, being designed simply to improve and enhance the Bill. It would change ``homeless'' to ``threatened with homelessness'', which is, as all hon. Members will immediately understand, technically the correct drafting in the clause. It has no other significance beyond that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of the debate on the amendment proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68 and 89, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.45pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I thought that the Committee should tease a little more detail out of the Minister before accepting the clause, because it represents a significant change to the 1996 Act, in its abolition of the minimum 24-month period and the changes that it imposes on section 193 of that Act.
<P>
At the time the 24-month criterion was established, various fallback positions were provided. It was a controversial measure. Under that Act, local authorities are required to provide accommodation for the households they accept as statutorily homeless for a minimum of two years. As long as they confirm every two years that the household remains entitled to assistance, they may provide accommodation on a continuing basis; and if they cease to provide accommodation after two years, the household may reapply for assistance under the legislation. In short, it was not as though families&#151;or whoever&#151;were set adrift after the minimum two-year period had expired. Fallbacks and a route for reapplication were built into the legislation.
<P>
I have a briefings from two local authorities that state what has happened in practice. The first comments:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The two-year limit has never really been implemented. In reality, homeless people are not able to find private rented accommodations and local authorities will assist until they can be placed in social housing.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The other says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The two-year duty is to be repealed. However, in practice, in London authorities either deal with cases within two years or continue to deal with them after two years have expired.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Shelter freely admits
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In practice, most authorities usually provide settled accommodation within the 24-month minimum period set out in the 1996 Housing Act, and continue to provide temporary accommodation where this is not possible.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Therefore, I query why the Government feel that it is necessary to change the legislative terminology, given that, in practice, the fears expressed by many of their colleagues during the Committee stage of the 1996 Act have not come to fruition, and a number of fallbacks and safety nets were enshrined in that Act. I am genuinely curious to learn what has changed, or how that section of the 1996 Act has gone wrong and so prejudiced people that the changes proposed in clause 21 are necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a curious way of putting his argument. The first authority he quoted in his defence was someone saying that the two-year duty has never been implemented; if that is true, he should understand that it is entirely appropriate to remove from statute a provision that has clearly fallen into disrepute because more than two years have passed since it came into force. I accept that in many areas it has not been applied because it is inappropriate: local authorities know it is not the right way to handle their responsibilities toward homeless people. Unfortunately, however, in some areas there has been a belief that it is a statutory requirement and therefore the authority has to go through the curious bureaucratic treadmill of reviewing people's cases after a two-year period has elapsed.
<P>
Of course, problems can arise. Consider the problems that may surround a family that has been accepted as a homeless family with children if, in the course of two years, the children have passed the age of 16 and are no longer children; the family might have ceased to be regarded as being in priority need. All sorts of things could happen that could have an adverse impact on the individuals involved. In the ``No Place Like Home'' report the LGA makes the point very clearly that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Reviewing the circumstances of priority homeless households after two years has created additional bureaucracy without uncovering, in the majority of cases, any significant change in the applicants' eligibility for rehousing.
<P>
</UL></FONT>On very simple grounds, the provision is undesirable because it is based on a completely erroneous conception of the nature of homelessness, it is ineffective and it imposes unreasonable bureaucratic burden. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees with the Government that it is high time that it was swept away by clause 21.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>Events which may cause the duty to cease</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, page 13, line 16, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and states that the offer shall remain available to the applicant for not less than three working days from the date of the offer, or such longer period as the authority consider reasonable in all the circumstances.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would provide for a minimum period of three working days during which an applicant may accept or refuse a final offer of accommodation from a local authority. That offer may consist of either a council house tenancy or nomination to a registered social landlord.
<P>
The purpose of building in a statutory minimum period is to try to end the practices that we know occur in a number of local authority areas, whereby applicants are given as little as 24 hours to make a decision. I suspect that all members of the Committee will appreciate that a 24-hour time limit will, in many cases, not give the applicant enough time even to view the premises, let alone sort out the range of domestic issues that may be necessary to the decision to accept or reject the property; those include the effect on work or the schooling of any children involved.
<P>
I welcome Government's clear intention, expressed by part II and echoed in the housing Green Paper, to increase the amount of choice available to the homeless. However, it would be wrong to tolerate other measures that at the same time militated against choice. My argument is that allowing the practice whereby some authorities allow applicants only 24 hours to decide seriously militates against choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am slightly horrified by the hon. Gentleman's words. Can he give us any specific examples illustrating how widespread are such practices&#151;which strike me as verging on sharp practice? I cannot imagine any reasonable local authority having a problem with three days or even a few more, if necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I will deal with the Department's research on the way people are currently treated. That research has gone some way towards influencing the Government in their determination to find ways of increasing the amount of choice. I am delighted that there is to be improvement.
<P>
I am also delighted that the Government are to fund a number of projects around the country where local authorities wish to explore different ways of improving choice. I would say gently to the Minister that my local authority, Bath and North-East Somerset, is anxious to work with the Government to explore ways in which greater choice can be afforded to homeless people. Improving that choice includes being able to give more than one offer to homeless people before considering that the duty to them has been sufficiently exercised. I referred to the research done for the Government by H Pawson and D Levinson. It was published by the Department only a few weeks ago and was entitled ``Local authority policy and practice on allocations, transfers and homelessness''. That research shows that homeless households are likely to get fewer offers of accommodation and less choice of where they live or the type of accommodation. They are also likely to be more heavily penalised for refusing an offer. They might be removed or suspended from the register for longer than other applicants. The research shows that since 1991 there has been a sharp increase in the proportion of authorities operating one-offer only policies. It shows that in 1991, 29 per cent. of homeless applicants were allowed only one reasonable offer and that by 2000, that had increased to 75 per cent. That is very different from the approach to non-homeless households, where very few are restricted to only one offer.
<P>
The second issue shows very clearly that, nationally, 79 per cent. of authorities always take into account the area preference of applicants who are not homeless when making an offer. That compares to only 47 per cent. of authorities where homeless applicants' area of preference was always taken into account. The research also demonstrates clearly that homeless households are less likely to have taken into account their aspirations in respect of the type of house in which they would like to live. It points out that one fifth of local authorities currently consider that if an applicant refuses their maximum number of reasonable offers, they are deemed to have made themselves intentionally homeless.
<P>
This comes to the point raised by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. In areas where housing pressure is particularly high, the evidence suggests that there is a shorter time limit for homeless households to make their decisions. There is a real difficulty when there is limited time because the homeless household must have an opportunity to view the property. They must be able to see how accepting that property may tie in with work patterns or with any educational requirements that may apply. There is also a problem in that some local authorities do not carry out any repairs and maintenance to a property until the new occupant moves in. The home seeker needs a period of time to get assurances from the local authority that the required repairs and maintenance will be carried out. There is a clear need, for a reasonable period of time to be offered to families before they make a decision.
