[Continuation from column 824]

<H5>5.29 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was on the point of concluding my remarks when we rose for a break. 
<P>
The evidence of the RHA and FTA in an earlier sitting mentioned a research paper produced by the immigration service called, "Enclosed Space Detection: A Review of the Available Technology". I am sure that the Home Office Minister will be aware of it, although the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Office, might not. I do not blame them if he is not. 
<P>
The paper gives an overview of some of the technology that is available for determining whether people are hiding or secreted in a vehicle. It also examines some of the pros and cons of the available technology, including 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"X-ray, carbon dioxide samplers, heartbeat detectors, thermal imaging, endoscopes and ... search dogs."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 18 March 1999; c. 406.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It discovers that, while some of those devices such as endoscopes and thermal imaging cameras may sound fancy, the technology is not advanced enough to work properly. Sniffer dogs and carbon dioxide samplers are the only methods that work well at the moment. 
<P>
If the Home Office is to produce a code of practice applying to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any person operating a system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that code will have to give a view on what technology should and should not be used. A company that said that its vehicles passed through a big search gate at Harwich or Dover, and were searched using a thermal imaging camera that may detect people, could nevertheless be in breach if the immigration service had concluded that that system was not yet perfect and it was not in the code of practice. The company would have a poor defence under clause 20 because it had not used the latest technology which the Home Office deemed to be the best and most effective technology for that job. 
<P>
I make the point because it is putting the Government's judgment on the gold-plated service that they will no doubt want to get from this code of practice. We will see that in the management practices on which they will insist--they want a gold-plated security park service. If the Government are serious about this, and I think that they are, I am afraid that they will over-egg the pudding by insisting that the systems operated by lorry owners, hirers and others are of the very highest standards. That will be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, such rules may be prohibitively prescriptive. 
<P>
One of the debates that used to go on in the Home Office, although in a department with which I was not directly involved, concerned prison privatisation. I use this example because it is exactly analogous. We can ask private operators to build a prison in one of two ways. Either they can be set an objective--we can say, "Build a prison and don't let people escape. These are roughly the conditions in which they should be kept"--or we can hand the company the six-inch-thick Home Office internal design and build manual, which lays down the specification of locks and every mortal thing to do with prisons, and say, "Do it that way." 
<P>
My worry about this code of practice is that the Government will not say to all those operating the system, "We don't want people to get on board vehicles. We want something effective which prevents that. Think about how vehicles are stored overnight and the technology used to check whether people are in them." Rather, it is inevitable that the Government will be prescriptive in the code of practice. They will say, "Use this technology, do it this way, keep it in these lorry parks, involve this level of security." That sort of prescription involves two problems. First, it is highly expensive. It will apply to operators within our jurisdiction but not to others, which will make our trade more uncompetitive. Secondly, the second that technology or systems change, the code of practice will have to be amended and adapted, because what it recommends will no longer be the most effective method. 
<P>
The code of practice is a crucial document. It will have evidential quality and could lead to people being penalised. It is disappointing that the Committee has not seen even a rough draft of it. There would be no harm in producing a rough draft or even subject titles. Why do not the Government tell us even what the chapters will be about? What will the code contain? If we know, we can judge whether it will be too prescriptive or too expensive, and decide whether it will have a hope of working. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I am delighted to follow my right hon. Friend in speaking about the draft code of conduct. I think that both he and my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere were a little generous in their opening remarks to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office, who has now decided to leave us, and whose empty chair his fellow Minister is gazing at. I suspect that he is wishing that his chair was the empty one. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary is the Minister who has been involved in discussions with the industry, and he and his Department will be responsible for drawing up the code of conduct. I understand that he may have other pressing engagements at 5.30 in the morning, such as his pillow, but his failure to be present is a little discourteous to other Committee members who are still present to debate the matter. Like my my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, I mean no disrespect to his fellow Minister, whom I admire and respect. The Minister of State is a keen cricketer, and, as my hon. Friend pointed out, his strike rate has been considerably better than that of his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border reminded the Committee of the sense of dæjã vu he feels because of the many times that he sat on the Government Benches listening to Opposition Members demanding to see a code of conduct or a code of practice. My mind goes back to consideration of at least two education Bills, during which the hon. Member for Weaver Vale was on the Opposition Benches. I think that he was joined by his hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall) in talking late into the night. If I remember correctly, on one occasion they spoke much later than this Committee has about a code of conduct relating to special needs education. I remember the late and much-lamented Derek Enright also waxing lyrical on the issue for many hours. Opposition Members have been in the current circumstances before, when we were in government. The Committee should have been given more information about the code. We should have had sight of it, and the industry should have at least been able to have some form of discussion before the relevant clauses were discussed in Committee. 
<P>
During consideration of clause 18, the Committee considered some of the problems facing the industry in trying to ascertain whether illegal and clandestine immigrants are concealed in trucks. I spoke of the difficulties of investigating some loads, such as those including medical equipment, foodstuffs or valuable high-technology equipment. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere mentioned curtain-sided trucks, access to which is available only from above. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend touches on a point that I should have developed in my earlier remarks about the code of practice. Should not the code of practice refer to the goods carried? It would be interesting to know whether the draft includes such references. Will the Minister deal with that point? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> My hon. Friend is right to make that point. I think that I am right in saying that the recommendations made by the Road Haulage Association for a code of conduct, to which I shall refer in a moment, show that it wants the code to deal with the type of load carried. It is in the best interests of the Road Haulage Association, which is at the sharp end of delivering the policy and of implementing the code of practice, not only to see the code as soon as possible but to ensure that it is practical and workable. It is also in its interests to secure acceptance of the responsibilities placed on its members and to ensure that safeguards are built into the clause for members and for employees working in an industry that involves increasing risks, as I think the Committee will agree. It is the avowed aim of the Road Haulage Association to produce a code that, as the association puts it, prevents and protects. It wants to secure measures that will ideally prevent the problem from arising in the first place, but the Government are going about that in a somewhat heavy-handed manner. At the same time, the association wants to protect those who may be vulnerable if something goes wrong or if there is a disaster. In fairly powerful evidence to us, the RHA highlighted the UK distribution industry's great concern that many perfectly innocent, law-abiding drivers and people at ports at the final destination of the goods--are potentially being exposed to danger. Increasingly, the tractor unit and the vehicle driver will have gone, and the trailer will have been left in a warehouse. A warehouseman may open it the next morning and be unexpectedly confronted by illegal immigrants who may have a knife or other weapons and be in a confused state. It is only right that the code of practice--as and when it is drawn up--includes the RHA's concerns as well as the responsibilities and duties that will be placed on it. That is what the association will want. 
<P>
We have heard much about the problem of organised crime and trafficking, which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have rightly deprecated. Drivers and those who work in the industry are becoming increasingly concerned about the extent to which they are exposed to organised crime gangs, which are involved in the illegal trade that we are discussing. As things stand, there is no way of exposing such illegal passage where drivers are involved without independent checking and verification procedures. The RHA would say that such procedures should, as part of the code of practice, include the involvement of the immigration service or the local police force. The industry has rightly made it clear that it does not condone drivers who participate in illegal actions, but that current law is enough to call people who deliberately break the law to account. 
<P>
I will not repeat some of the examples that my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border gave a moment ago of the technology that might be used. The RHA and the practitioners would like to discuss several issues with the Government: security at certain ports and embarkation and disembarkation points, which we have discussed elsewhere; negotiations with the French authorities and, in particular, Calais; and the issuing of guidelines to operators on checking their vehicles. Earlier, I asked the Under-Secretary several times about what specific checks he would like to be involved. Our debate may provide an opportunity for the Minister of State to tell us what he expects to be in the code of practice and what specific checks he would like the industry to participate in. 
<P>
I am disappointed that the Minister who is responsible for these matters is not with us, but, like other Opposition Members, I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Conservative Members will know that the Government always speak with one voice, although I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be deeply touched by hon. Members' by concern for his welfare and about the fact that he is not present. 
<P>
I want to deal with the general observations that have been made. The debate has had many characteristics of a clause stand part debate and, with your leave, Mr. Maxton, I will respond to those general points before dealing with the specific amendments. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary had three meetings with the road haulage industry in the lead-up to the publication of the Bill. Since then, the immigration service, the Home Office and DETR officials have each had meetings with the industry, including a demonstration of search proceedings. 
<P>
The Government are working with the industry to advance the preparation of the code of practice. We will make a draft available when we are in a position to do so. Obviously, there is no point in doing that until we have completed our detailed discussions with the industry. 
<P>
I should mention for the benefit of Opposition Members that clause 19(3) provides for the implementation of a negative scrutiny procedure before the code can be brought into force. That will give them the opportunity to pray against the relevant instrument and thereby obtain a debate. 
<P>
I want to mention in particular the valuable contribution of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. He mentioned many of the issues which I am sure will be considered as part of the draft code; I am sure that his valuable and practical observations will assist all those who are deliberating on its contents. His experience of government has assisted all of us. 
<P>
I mention those points because, in the light of earlier comments, I am concerned that were I to accept another Opposition amendment, my ministerial career might be placed in jeopardy. Nevertheless, in the spirit of reasonable co-operation and because the Government believe that the code of practice has a vital role to play in the defence against the civil penalty provided in clause 20(3) and intend to issue a code, we accept in principle amendment No. 468, which would require a code of practice to be issued. There are drafting implications, but I undertake to table a Government amendment on the matter on Report--as long as no one again mentions that I have accepted an Opposition amendment. 
<P>
On amendment No. 469, clause 19 (2) and (3) provide for parliamentary scrutiny of the code of practice to be followed by those operating systems for preventing carriage of clandestine entrants; subsection (2) provides that before issuing the code, the Secretary of State must lay a draft before both Houses of Parliament and subsection (3) that the code may then be brought into operation by an order. Government amendment No. 41 will delete "made by statutory instrument" in subsection (3), because clause 134 already provides that all powers confirmed by the Bill to make orders, rules and regulations are to be exercisable by statutory instrument. 
<P>
Amendment No. 469 introduces a requirement in subsection (3) that no order is to be made unless a draft has been laid before Parliament and approved by resolution of each House. The code of practice is important; it will underpin the operation of one of the defences against the civil penalty, but it is not itself a regulation. It would not be appropriate for it to be brought into force by means of an affirmative resolution procedure. Clause 19(2) and (3) provide for a full Parliamentary scrutiny of the code at an appropriate level. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment. 
<P>
The first part of amendment No. 220 proposes adding a requirement that the code of practice be subject to approval by affirmative resolution; I am being repetitive, but it is necessary to spell out the Government's position on the amendments. We have already discussed the need for an affirmative resolution procedure and I hope that it is clear that the Government are sensitive to the feelings of the Committee on that. However, the requirement for an affirmative resolution for a code of practice would be excessive and inappropriate. The second part of amendment No. 220, which is identical to amendment No. 453, concerns consultation with interested parties and would require the Secretary of State to consult with interested parties such as transport industry organisations and human rights organisations. That proposal recognises that several parties have a legitimate interest or concern about the civil penalty. The Government are drawing up the civil penalty in consultation with transport industry organisations, particularly the Road Haulage Association and the Freight Transport Association, and we will also consult organisations on our draft code of practice. 
<P>
The Government recognise the concerns of human rights associations about those and other provisions of the Bill and our decision to use the Special Standing Committee procedure was intended to ensure that we gave the fullest possible consideration of, and heard the range of opinion on, the issues raised by the Bill. It is not necessary to impose a requirement for consultation as the amendments would do. Clause 19 makes provision for parliamentary scrutiny of both the draft code and any proposed revision to it. We shall not bring a code or revision to Parliament unless and until we are satisfied that we have consulted relevant organisations. 
<P>
Our aim throughout the process of preparing the civil penalty provisions has been to ensure that we create a penalty regime that is effective in deterring the major problem of clandestine illegal entry. It must be workable and not impose wholly unreasonable requirements on those concerned. We are carrying forward that approach into the preparation of the draft code of practice. 
<P>
The amendments would raise several difficulties of interpretation. There would be scope for considerable legal debate about the meaning of organisations referred to in the amendments, with a constant threat of disruption when an Organisation claimed that it should have been consulted. The Government have made considerable provision for parliamentary scrutiny of the code of practice and the provisions of clause 19. We have also clearly shown our good faith by the consultation process that we have already undertaken and that we are continuing by the operation of a Special Standing Committee procedure for scrutiny of the Bill. In view of that, I suggest that the Committee rejects the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I seek your guidance, Mr. Maxton, before commenting on what the Minister has said. Is it your ruling that those Labour Members who are fast asleep count toward the Government's majority? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> They are in their seats, so they count. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is like the point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West when he asked whether penalties would have to be paid on clandestines who unfortunately arrived dead. 
<P>
We have made considerable progress and, although the Minister has woken up the rest of his hon. Friends, it might be better if he does not wake up the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall). It may also be better, in terms of  joined-up government, if he takes over the responsibilities of the Home Office, because we seem to be making greater progress when the Minister of State from the Lord Chancellor's Department responds. We pay tribute to him again for accepting the earlier amendment. I would thank him for his gracious and kind remarks about my genius in anticipating what is in the code--if I did not have a deep and abiding feeling that he was taking the biggest mickey that I have heard in Committee for some time. Perhaps it is his wonderful smile that leads me to that conclusion. 
<P>
I am not being discourteous to the Minister, but it should not be up to a humble Opposition Back Bencher--well, moderately humble--to guess what such a code of practice would contain. I accept that he will let us see a draft code of practice when he has picked up enough information from the organisations concerned. No doubt there will be an initial draft, which will be circulated only to those organisations so that they can pick out the biggest howlers, correct the draft and see what they will wear or what they will go into orbit about. 
<P>
The draft code will then be passed around other Departments for scrutiny and eventually it may emerge when the Bill is debated on Report or in another place. That is no criticism of Home Office officials; I am just describing the amount of time a code of practice takes. The Minister will not want to show it to us when he receives the first draft if the freight or transport organisations go into orbit because they dislike parts of it. He will want to present even a draft code of practice as something that those organisations can live with in the main. I am worried about the time scale. Yes, the Government will do their best to produce the code, but we may have concluded our debates on the Bill before we get sight of it. 
<P>
I need a little guidance on my next point: the code of practice is to be followed by any person operating a system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants. How can that apply? That problem was described to us when we took evidence in the Grand Committee Room. We were told that, in eastern Europe or in other countries, some vehicles were being stuffed full of clandestines at the factories where products were being loaded on to the lorries. In those circumstances, the owner or operator in this country, no matter what his code of practice for storing the vehicles in secure lorry parks, might not be able to take any action on that point. Perhaps the Government used the easiest wording, rather than saying that the code of practice should be followed by the hirer, the owner or the driver. It is easier to say that it should be followed by any person operating a system, but will it be binding on people other than the owner, the hirer or the driver? Will it apply to people not in those categories? 
<P>
Although we have made progress, and it is difficult to criticise the Minister for his courteous response, we are still in the dark as to what will be in the code. It is all very well for the Minister to say, "It will probably contain the things mentioned by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border; it will probably mention technology, operating systems and ISO 9000," but we do not know the detail, or what a burden it might be on industry. We may be asking people to do the impossible. 
<P>
I end with a phrase that I have used before. Governments inevitably go for gold-plated solutions. A few years ago, my right hon. and hon. Friends were thinking of simplifying the tax system by introducing self-reporting. We were assured that it would be simple and straightforward, but I warned that Governments cannot invent anything simple and straightforward and that self-assessment would be a bureaucratic nightmare. Indeed, in my opinion it is, because my tax returns were wrong in both of the past two years. 
<P>
Any code of practice invented by a Government will over-egg the pudding. I would have liked the Minister to assure us that although they will consider the best technology and so on, the system will not be over-prescriptive and over-expensive. That would be yet another blow to British trade; it would mean foreign operators not complying with the system, picking up our freight business and bringing in clandestines.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I welcome the Minister's generosity in accepting the Opposition amendment to change "may" to "shall". It certainly shows how much importance the Government place on the code of practice. 
<P>
I asked earlier whether the code of practice would be in place when the regime of fines was introduced. If not, it is possible that people might be fined before the code of practice is agreed. I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that their introduction will be concurrent, as it is essential for the defence of drivers and the owners of the vehicles that the code should be in place. 
<P>
It was said earlier that without a code of practice, drivers and owners might have the defence that they did not know what procedures they had to carry out because the Secretary of State had not complied with his obligation to produce the code. I accept that consultation and introducing new technology may take a little time, but I hope that the Government will not issue notices or levy fines on people before they have agreed with the industry on the code of practice. 
<P>
We have talked a great deal about the Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association and human rights organisations, but no one has yet mentioned trade unions. The new provisions have implications for many drivers who are members of the Transport and General Workers Union or other unions, which may become involved if the drivers are fined. I hope that the Minister will assure me that the Government take the views of trade unions seriously and that they will be consulted. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) was a member of the Transport and General Workers Union. There ought to be broad consultation. 
<P>
It is important that the operators and owners of vehicles should be consulted, but ordinary drivers will also face difficulties. One of their first ports of call, apart from their employer, will be the trade union, and it is important that the union has some input. 
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and the Border also referred to costs. The evidence from road hauliers confirmed that there were cost implications and 833 834 we must all be sensible about them, given the current state of the road haulage industry. British road hauliers may be the only ones who have to meet the extra costs. 
<P>
I make those few simple points and hope that the code of practice is brought in concurrently with the measures to levy fines. Consultation should be wide enough for all people to feel that they have made an input: the code of practice will then be viewed as fair with respect to employers and employees. 
<P>
<H5>6 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Once again, this has been a good debate. I welcome the Minister's acceptance of amendment No. 468, creating a duty--rather than leaving it as a power--to issue a code of practice. It would be churlish of me not to welcome that. 
<P>
I was less happy with the Minister's response on the affirmative resolution procedure, to which I will return in a moment. I would appreciate it if the Minister would deal with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole about introducing the code of practice at the same time as the fines regime. The Minister made a gesture with his head, which I took as implying approval: will he confirm that? 
<P>
The Minister rightly mentioned an element of overlap in the amendments in the group, which shows that the same considerations are running through our minds. I was concerned about his comments on consultation. I shall say no more about consultation with the industry, but there is also a need for consultation with human rights organisations, which could be valuable on several fronts. 
<P>
Let me state how I understood the Minister's response, as I do not want to waste time persuading him if he already agrees with me. The amendment referred to consultation with businesses and human rights organisations and the Minister made it clear that he was committed to consulting businesses. As to consulting human rights organisations, he was going at a fair old gallop but I was able to catch a glimpse of the rider in the seat and his colours as he was galloping along. The Minister recognised the concerns of human rights organisations but said that, because they had been reflected in the Special Standing Committee procedure, the Government did not intend to consult further. The Minister is nodding his head, so I have understood that part of his response correctly, but I ask him to think again about that. 
<P>
One of the striking aspects of the Special Standing Committee procedure has been the taking of evidence from many different interests which sometimes coincided. That was certainly the case with carriers' liability. Justice, as the Minister knows, carried out an analysis of carriers' liability to assess whether it complied with human rights legislation. Its detailed approach was valuable and the Government should think again and respond to some of the points that Justice made. 
<P>
We want to ensure that the Bill is compliant with the European convention on human rights, and the Minister has put his name to that on the front of the Bill. Justice raised a number of points where it thought that the Bill was not compliant with the European convention. I have mentioned some of those already, so Ido not propose to go back over them again, but it referred to the later processes relating to the detention of vehicles and the part that that plays in the enforcement of penalties. It thought that the detention of vehicles would pre-empt remedies that might be available to the persons held to be responsible. 
<P>
There is a human rights point of view to be considered. Justice had a note prepared by learned barristers who referred to previous cases in front of the European Court of Human Rights, such as the Air Canada and Nagy cases. The Minister should reconsider in the light of this debate, and think whether, in view of Justice's legal expertise and the research that it has undertaken, it has any value. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): What has this got to do with the amendments? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 220 asks the Secretary of State to consult human rights organisations, but the Minister said that the Government did not at present intend to consult them. I am explaining why it would be appropriate for him to reconsider. I have two reasons why that should be done, and I am dealing with the first. It is not a point that I made earlier in the debate, but I should have made it. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> The Government have trumpeted loudly this new procedure for the Special Standing Committee and encouraged organisations to come along to give evidence as if to a Select Committee. Would it not be a considerable deterrent to organisations to participating in this process in the future if they thought that by doing so they would reduce the bilateral consultation opportunities that they would get with the Government when matters of detail of this sort needed to be prepared? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is an excellent point. If anything has come out of the Special Standing Committee process, it is the need to listen to what these organisations have to tell us. We have all found that of value. We would not like them to get the impression that if they gave evidence to a Special Standing Committee it might be taken as enough and that the Government would then stop listening when they were considering the Bill in future, particularly when it came to important matters such as drafting a code of practice. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall the reference I made a couple of days ago to the evidence from the Home Secretary? He dismissed out of hand much of the evidence that we had received from other interested organisations on the ground that it had been too quickly prepared. What sort of message does that send out to those organisations? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Perhaps that reflected the disappointment that the Home Secretary felt with the evidence, which was nearly all critical. He is a great champion of the Special Standing Committee procedure; he argued the case for it all the way through the Asylum and Immigration Bill in 1996. Indeed, some commentators said that that was the only point he had to make about that Bill. He certainly made the point very strongly. On mature reflection, the Home Secretary would not want to bring the role of human rights organisations and others to an end with a Special Standing Committee if there were areas in the Bill that were going to he important in the future. That brings me to another point that I made earlier, and I make no apologies for making it again as, it is relevant to what my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East said. 
<P>
The code of practice is extremely important. We have complained that we have not had the opportunity to see it; well, neither have the human rights organisations. They have had no input into it. The code of practice itself might run into ECHR points in future and it would be as well to get their expert opinion. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman who is a veteran of the 1996 Act. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I was on the Committee on both the 1996 Act and the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. The hon. Gentleman makes great play of consultation with organisations outside the House. Has he talked to any of those organisations over the past year or so? They all say that since the change of Government in 1997, the willingness of the Home Office, in particular, to talk to them has improved immeasurably compared with anything that happened in the previous 18 years. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Yes, I have talked to people and attended meetings. I will not be drawn on the hon. Gentleman's second point. I hope that he will not mind, but it would mean straying from the amendments and I am keen to stay on them. He will not press me hard on that, as he is a reasonable man. He understands that I do not want to be dragged down an avenue that is not strictly relevant to the amendments. 
<P>
The human rights organisations represent the welfare of the would-be refugees. They will know the points in the code of practice that would affect such people. I hope that I have been sufficiently careful to make it clear that we have been concerned about the welfare of clandestine entrants, even though we share all the sentiments that have been expressed about the need to stop them coming into this country unlawfully. 
<P>
I hope that this is not taking the meaning of human rights organisations too wide, as I am not sure that it would want to be brought into that category, but can I commend to the Minister the contribution made by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association? It gave an excellent commentary on every part of the Bill. I am sure that it would have an excellent contribution to make on this point. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consult the human rights organisations and have a second think. I cannot for the life of me see what the Government would have to lose by consulting them. The Minister has just had a good argument put to him by his hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow about the value of consultation. I am sure that he wants to be seen as a listening Minister. We are pleased with the way in which he has listened to these debates and I hope that he will continue to listen. 
<P>
I was a little disappointed by the Minister's response on the point about parliamentary scrutiny and the affirmative resolution procedure. It would not have cost the Government anything to have let us have further parliamentary debate. My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border was correct: businesses that consult with the Government and leave it in their hands to draw up the code of practice may have views on it they wish to make known and to have debated in Parliament. If they come to us as Members of Parliament and we do not have any further opportunity for debate, there is nothing more we can do about it. 
<P>
I cannot see why the Government cannot allow an affirmative resolution procedure. I am not sure whether the Minister was present earlier, but his colleague the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department allowed the affirmative resolution procedure in respect of two earlier amendments. The Minister's brow is furrowed. Two amendments were granted earlier on points of detail on the affirmative resolution procedure. We had one knocked back on the code of practice for employers trying to avoid alleged discrimination under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. I can understand the sensitivity there, but not here. Is the Minister prepared to consider it?  
<P>
It would cost the Government nothing to do so, but it would give us another opportunity to look at the code of practice. So far, we have been kept in the dark about it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> This has been an interesting debate. My hon. Friends have been puzzling about what Opposition Members discuss across the kitchen table. We now know that one of their highest priorities is trade union rights and consultation. That will come as a surprise to some of my hon. Friends, but it shows that Conservative Members are well on the way to becoming a successful Opposition, so much so that they are likely to remain in that position for a long time to come. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere raised many points that I have already dealt with. I emphasise that the Bill requires the Secretary of State to lay a draft of the code of practice before it can be issued, which will give ample opportunity to all interested parties, including human rights organisations, to comment if they wish to do so. It will even give Opposition Members the opportunity to voice their concerns. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's range of questions about consultation. 
<P>
A substantive issue that had not already been raised is the extent to which the code and the overall scheme for civil penalties will be introduced together. The code is an essential part of the overall scheme outlined in this part of the Bill. The code will be drafted and will come into force before the penalty regime commences. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a valuable debate and I am grateful for the Minister's response. I shall not press him further on the affirmative resolution procedure except to say that I do not want him to think that, if he accepts the amendment, it will open the floodgates and 837 838 we will request affirmative resolution procedures throughout the Bill. That will not be the case; we recognise that some things are best left to negative resolution. This proposal was especially fitted to affirmative resolution, but I shall not repeat my arguments on the matter. I shall raise other, general issues, in the stand part debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Amendment made: No. 41, in page 14, line 24, leave out "made by statutory instrument".--[Mr. Hoon.] 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is an important clause and the Government should take note of what the industry says about the code of practice. 
<P>
I want to ask the Minister about the timetable for consultation. When will it take place? When will it be completed? Has there been any recent consultation with the industry? The FTA and the RHA, both of which gave evidence to the Committee, will be involved in the consultation, but we do not know who else will take part. Given the definition of the width of the vehicle that emerged during the debate, many organisations whose interests are affected may not he aware that they come within the ambit of the Bill. Will the Government approach organisations other than those already involved to discover whether they want to contribute to consultation on the code of practice? 
<P>
Will the Government give us a rough idea of their approach to the code of practice and its contents? We are familiar with other codes of practice; the problem with this one is that it deals with a wide range of people, businesses and types of vehicle. Will the code of practice be specific in relation to each type of vehicle and give carriers a good idea of what they can be expected to do? The Minister should bear in mind the fact that later in the Bill the onus of proof is on the carriers, who bear all the burdens. What are they expected to do? An earlier example, the curtain-sided tilt trailer, is unusual in that it can be entered only through the roof. The hon. Member for Harwich looks perplexed. I shall give way so that he can tell me why he is puzzled; the hon. Gentleman may know more about curtain-sided tilt trailers than I do. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> I have never heard of a trailer that can be entered or unloaded from the top. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to be unfair to the hon. Gentleman but I mentioned the matter earlier; the trailer is from the product range of Wilson Truck Services, which includes the open-top curtain-sider with loading access through the roof. I am telling the Committee the details from the specified product range of the manufacturer, which should know what it produces. If it is possible for there to be access only through the roof, should there not be some provision for such a vehicle? 
<P>
I ask the Government to think about the position of lorry drivers, owners and hauliers and to make the code of practice as specific as possible in order to help them. Fulfilling the terms of the code of practice may--just--enable them to bring themselves within the defence in the proposal. I ask the Minister to be reasonable and to deal with the matter on a case-by-case basis. 
<P>
Will the code of practice take into account not only the nature and construction of a vehicle but also its contents? Will different practices be recommended for refrigerated and non-refrigerated goods? What steps can a carrier reasonably be expected to take that are consistent with protecting the load that he is carrying? Can the code of practice deal with steps that may be taken to notify the authorities, and at what point such steps should be taken? The Minister is nodding sagely, and I hope that in due course he will answer all my questions. I understand that he will not be dealing with the matter himself, but on the basis of his previous replies I look forward to his response. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> The way forward is to treat the code of practice as if it were similar to the health and safety at work procedures. Under the Health and Safety Commission there is a tripartite approach comprising the employers, the unions and outside experts. In this case, the outside experts could be the Government or their agencies, who will have some idea of the pattern of the discovery of illegal immigrants and will know what is reasonably practicable. They will presumably check vehicles on a sample basis, and will know what sort of checks would be feasible for a range of vehicles. The associations of operators and the trade unions will have a fair amount of experience too. 
<P>
No doubt other European countries will adopt a similar approach; we cannot pretend that only the United Kingdom is affected. We may have singular legislation, but I suspect that what is in the code of practice will be urged on operators in other countries too. Although there are some owner-operators who carry the liability, most drivers are employees whose firms will have the expertise to contribute to the formulation of the code of practice. 
<P>
The code of practice relates to one subsection of the next clause. It will be a bit like the highway code and will be taken into account. I would stray out of order if I referred to the defences available, but I presume that the code of practice at least overlaps with possible defences, leaving aside the question of duress. However, it will offer advice to the driver or the master of a vehicle, light aeroplane or small vessel, and it may refer to duress when it advises them not to do things that might place them in danger. 
<P>
Only one big welfare provision relates to would-be entrants to the United Kingdom. Operators should not do something that might cause physical harm to someone who might be in their vehicle. It would not be acceptable to fill a vehicle with gas to prevent people from breathing, so the idea of testing for carbon dioxide seems sensible. Poisoning people or knocking them out is not acceptable. 
<P>
The reason for the code of practice is generally accepted. The Government will be able to organise the kind of consultation that will bring together the people involved. We have debated whether changes should be considered under the positive or negative resolution procedure. However, if the Government are prepared to modify the code in the light of experience, simpler ways of getting the changes through Parliament may be desirable. In the initial years, several changes will have to be made as the result of experience. For that reason, there may be benefits in using the negative resolution procedure. As the Minister fairly said, the code of practice by itself will not be law, so it is conceivable that his advice to the Committee to accept the negative resolution procedure may be appropriate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I, too, welcome what my hon. Friends have said. We are looking forward to seeing the code of practice and wish that we had a copy of it, if only in draft form. 
<P>
It will take time to introduce the technology, and there will be training implications for drivers. They will have to understand their liabilities under immigration law and how to operate the provisions. This is not just a case of producing a nice document, on which everyone agrees. We must also consider the practical problems. A road haulage manager may have 10 vehicles, five of which go to the continent. They may not always be the same five, so vehicles on domestic routes may be switched to the Calais route. That means that technological changes may have to be made to the whole fleet, and that may not be possible if the vehicles are busy and the manager does not want to take them off the road. The implementation of changes may take time. 
<P>
Any code of practice will be useless unless time is taken to explain to drivers what their responsibilities are, how they should operate and what is best practice. This country does not have a great tradition of training people and explaining things to them. Because of the implications for the industry and the serious implications for those who could put themselves at risk by entering a vehicle coming to this country, we should implement the code of practice properly and give the industry time to adjust to it. I shall be interested in the Minister's comments on that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> So far in our debates, we have had lorry transport at the forefront our minds. All my remarks were made in the context of lorry operators. However, the code of practice will also apply to other modes of transport, and that is a whole new ball game. It will apply to ships and aircraft--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> And to ferries. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It will also apply to ferries. 
<P>
Although we talk about a code of practice, there may be three separate codes of practice, relating to the air transport industry, the road transport industry and ferries. I would not quibble about that. It may be more sensible to have three separate documents rather than one monstrous document that leads lorry drivers to say, "Two thirds of this is rubbish. It doesn't apply to me, mate." British Airways might also think that two thirds of such a document did not apply to it. 
<P>
Of course, the Government will consult the RHA and the FTA; they are talking to them at present. However, they should consult others bodies in the road transport industry. The Minister's colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry or the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions may be able to give him the figures, but tens, if not hundreds of thousands of operators do not belong to the RHA or the FTA. The RHA represents big freight operators and the FTA is supposed to represent--my choice of words is not intended as a criticism--owner-drivers and smaller companies. However, thousands of other operators want to do their own thing and do not want to pay subscriptions to those organisations. They do not see the point of belonging to them. 
<P>
Although I accept that it is impossible to get the views of all the other operators, the Government should turn their mind to getting the views of some of them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Without using focus groups. 
<P>
 6.30 pm 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Yes, the Government need to focus on the problem without using focus groups. My hon. Friend makes another helpful suggestion. 
<P>
I am prepared to help the Government to write the code of practice for a modest fee; I shall be free this afternoon--[Interruption.] I shall not be out to lunch, but I will be free from 1.5 pm. If the Government are to accept my suggestions, they must not just consult the road haulage operators. The code of practice may deal with technology and haulage operators do not know the slightest thing about that. The Government will have to speak to experts in vehicle design, building and construction and to the people who sell such technology. 
<P>
If the code of practice contains sections on secure lorry parks, the Government will have to take advice from operators, such as Group 4 and Securicor, who know how to run them. It may also contain operational guidance and advice on how to manage things. The Royal Society of Arts used to set examinations for the certificate of competence in road transport, but I do not think that it had expertise in that subject. It was an independent examination body. The Government will need to consult the experts in operating transport systems. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will assure us that he will consult all the bodies that I have mentioned when the Government draw up the code of practice on road haulage. I do not want him to say that we need not worry because they have consulted the key bodies, such as the RHA and the FTA, which the Opposition mentioned. I am afraid that many other groups will want to have a relative input into the code. It will not be effective unless they are consulted. 
<P>
I have few comments to make about the shipping and aircraft industries. I presume that the Government will consult the airline operators associations, British Airways, others and the key ferry operators. They will have a considerable input to make. 
<P>
My final point concerns the distribution of the code. In the Government Departments in which I had the privilege to serve, I often found that, irrespective of the wonderful ideas that we had for publications, getting them distributed to the people who needed to know about them was another matter. It is a criticism of all 841 842 Governments--and it may be inevitable--that one can find tens of thousands of copies of leaflets and codes of practice in the cellars of Government Departments, not as a result of excessive print runs, but of the difficulties in distributing them to the guys that needed them. 
<P>
I do not see any problem distributing the code of practice to shipping operators and airlines. The big problem will be distributing it to all the people who operate road transport systems that could be used to carry clandestine entrants. The RHA and the FTA will distribute the code to all of their members, but it will be impossible to get it to the tens of thousands of smaller operators, even if the Government could access the Swansea office and obtain a list of all the names and addresses of those who own or operate vehicles. As the code of practice also applies to rented vans and much smaller vehicles, not simply to big HGVs, hundreds of thousands of drivers of little trucks and bigger trucks crossing the channel will need to know about it. The Government have taken on a task on which they will not be able to deliver. 
<P>
Inevitably the code of practice will reach those who are probably doing everything properly at the moment. That is not a criticism of this Government or this Minister in particular; it happens to all of us. We can always get the information about what should be done to the good guys, those who will obey it in any case. Getting it to smaller operators, to those who may need the training, who are not members of trade associations or who are not sure what to do, is always an impossible task. 
<P>
I do not regret that there is nothing in the clause or elsewhere in the Bill that deals with that, because it is probably not appropriate or necessary to include anything about the distribution of the code of practice and the way in which the key people who need it can obtain it--but perhaps the Minister can tell us how he will make sure that the tens of thousands of lorry operators and van drivers crossing the channel obtain the code of practice and follow it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Just as Conservative Members have struggled to come to terms with being in opposition, I have struggled to come to terms with being a Minister. One of the most valuable words that I have learned to use when asked a question about a timetable is "soon". 
<P>
I have already described the extent of the consultation that has taken place. That consultation continues. There will be further meetings with representatives of the road haulage industry and others affected, but it is too soon to say at this stage precisely when the draft will be published. I am assured that it will be available as soon as possible. 
<P>
I have answered the question from the hon. Member for Hertsmere about the other organisations that have been consulted. A draft will be published. That also deals with the point made by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. The draft will also be available to those who may not be members of certain organisations, and they, too, will have an opportunity to comment on it. 
<P>
It would be wrong at this stage to give even a rough idea of the likely contents of the code, although, as I said earlier, the right hon. Gentleman gave an interesting overview of the matters that will have to be considered. It would be wrong for me to say precisely what will be in or out, because that would forestall consultation, and I am sure that Conservative Members would not wish me to do that. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West was right to compare the code to health and safety provisions. He will know that in health and safety cases it is a defence if an employer can show that the system of work is safe. That was an appropriate analogy. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole referred to training considerations, which are an important factor. In its discussions with the road haulage industry, the immigration service has undertaken to assist by promoting relevant training similar to the advice and training that it provides to passenger carriers in relation to carriers' liability. That was a valuable point. 
<P>
As regards the distribution of the code of practice, things have moved on, even since the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border was in the Home Office. The code is the kind of document that today the Home Office would make available on the internet, with an appropriate publicity campaign. We can rely on the various hauliers organisations to ensure that their members receive copies of the code of practice once it is published. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 19, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 20 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Defences to claim that penalty is due under section 18 </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 189, in page 14, leave out lines 31 to 33 and insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"( ) If the carrier represents that he, or an employee of his who was directly responsible for allowing the clandestine entrant to be concealed, was acting under duress, the carrier shall not be liable to a penalty unless it is shown beyond reasonable doubt that the carrier or such an employee of his as is mentioned above was not acting under duress".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 472, page 14, line 38, leave out "and" and insert "or". 
<P>
No. 473, in page 14, line 40, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A) A carrier shall not be found liable for a penalty by reason of any action or failure to act by him, or a person or persons in control of a vehicle, ship or aircraft when he can show that the health or safety of himself or others would have been put at risk if he or the said persons had taken a course of action other than the course they took.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> These important amendments concern the defence that will be available under the clause. We are moving on from the clauses setting out the ingredients of the new penalty and the procedure to be followed, to the steps that a person who seeks to defend such a liability can take. 
<P>
We believe that it will prove difficult in practice for a person to avail himself of these defences. It is noteworthy that the onus seems to be on the person alleged to be liable for the penalty, and that the Secretary  of State rather than a court will ultimately judge whether the defence is made out. That has the combined effect of making the regime even more draconian than it already is. I mean no disrespect to the Minister, who has just accepted an amendment, although not one that made the provisions less draconian, but so far the Government have made little or no movement towards making things fairer for lorry drivers, owners or hirers. We did not give them a helping hand in clause 18 or 19. I hope that we can make more progress in that direction in this clause, because we do not want such people to nurture a sense of grievance that they have been treated less well than others, such as those who face criminal charges, because they do not have the safeguards that are available. Therefore, we must look more closely at the defences. 
<P>
Two defences are available to a person alleged under subsection (1) to be liable to a penalty. Amendment No. 189 concerns the defence of duress, which is available under subsection (2). For reasons that I shall go into in a moment, duress is a particularly appropriate and important line of defence to a person in this position, but, as the clause is drafted, it would be difficult for a person to avail himself of it. 
<P>
We agree that a defence of duress should be available. We agree with the Home Secretary, no less, who told us in his evidence to the Committee that duress 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"plainly has to be a total defence".
<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 22 March 1999; c.479.]
<P>

<P>
We therefore find it surprising that he has made that defence available in the Bill in a very different form from the way in which duress is dealt with in criminal cases. It stacks the odds against the person maintaining it as a defence. 
<P>
I see that the Minister is taking part in discussions. He became engaged when I suggested that the defence in the clause is not as good as the defence of duress in criminal cases. Perhaps I should take him through the reasons why I think that it is not as good. I hope that this is not at odds with his experience. He is an experienced practitioner and may contradict me, but I think that it is fair to say that the defence of duress, while clearly available in criminal cases, is not found as commonly as other defences, and it is perhaps even less common that such a defence succeeds. He may gainsay that proposition, which I make in a general way, without the benefit of statistics. I see that notes are now coming into his hands which may contradict me. The hon. Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall) is taking a keen interest in the debate. His ears have pricked up--perhaps he will make a contribution. 
<P>
I apologise for referring to the law too often, but if we are to debate duress, which is one of two defences under clause 20, it is important to define it. In the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland v. Lynch in 1975, Lord Wilberforce defined duress as something which is superimposed upon the other ingredients, which, by themselves, make up an offence--that is, upon act and intention. The victim completes the act and knows that he is doing so but the addition of the element of duress prevents the law from treating what he has done as a crime. Therefore, in law, duress is superimposed on the other ingredients that make up an offence, even when the accused person knows what he is doing. 
<P>
<H5>6.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
Duress arises in that form in law when a serious threat is made to the person who carries out the act in question. Straightforward and stringent requirements must be fulfilled if an action that would otherwise constitute a crime is not to be treated as a crime by reason of duress. There has to be a serious threat for the law to determine that circumstances amount to duress. The law has recognised threats of death and grievous bodily harm, and threats of imprisonment, although there is more doubt about that. 
<P>
It is possible to envisage threats of imprisonment in the circumstances that we are considering. From what we have heard about the circumstances that many lorry drivers and owners confront, it is not impossible to conceive of threats of death and grievous bodily harm. Such threats would be sufficiently serious in criminal law to constitute duress. Although threats of death and grievous bodily harm and possibly threats of prison are sufficiently serious, those of serious psychological injury are not. 
<P>
Serious threats to third parties, especially close relatives, might be sufficient to constitute duress. That is important because many drivers will be foreign nationals whose families are in other countries. We must consider overseas lorry drivers as well as British lorry drivers whose families are safe in the United Kingdom.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> To develop the point about duress, could it constitute finding illegal immigrants who threatened to harm themselves? If an asylum seeker or illegal immigrant threatened to cut his wrists if a lorry driver took action, would that constitute duress? If an illegal immigrant threatened to set fire to the lorry, and thus harm not the driver but the vehicle, which might be worth £1,000, and the cargo, for which the driver was responsible, would that constitute duress? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has caught me out. He has stumped me. If a clandestine entrant threatened to harm himself it would not constitute duress, although it would be distressing. It would entail the risk of serious psychological injury to the driver, which is not sufficient to count as duress. 
<P>
I shall consider my hon. Friend's second question shortly, but I give way to the hon. Member for Hallam. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that amendment No. 473 would cover a case of self harm, which the hon. Member for Poole mentioned? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have been bowled out twice in the same over. I shall have to consider the matter and perhaps tackle it when we discuss amendment No. 473. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Poole asked about threats of damage to property. It is an extremely good point. I have not come across such an application of duress in general criminal law. That may be due to inadequate research and, if so, I shall endeavour to put the matter right. However, my hon. Friend's point may 845 846 be germane to the application of duress under the clause. I ask the Minister to provide more detail, given that the circumstances that my hon. Friend described are conceivable. It may be appropriate to enlarge on the defence of duress in criminal law and adapt it to the purpose set out in the clause. The principle is sound, but it needs to be adapted. 
<P>
For, the law to determine that circumstances amount to duress, the threat must not only be serious but cogent. It is not sufficient for the person to believe that a threat of death or grievous bodily harm would be carried out unless he committed the act in question if a person of reasonable firmness, showing the characteristics of the defendant, would not have given way to the threats. Those words are used in a leading textbook. That is broadly the meaning of duress in criminal law. 
<P>
Will that definition of duress apply to clause 20? We have been told that the clause provides for a civil penalty. In view of obligations under the European convention on human rights, I can understand the Minister's reluctance to apply definitions from criminal law to a civil penalty. If he did that, the clause would seem to provide for a criminal rather than a civil sanction. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. I have listened to the hon. Gentleman's comments, but is it in order to hold a long discourse on duress when the amendment that we are considering has nothing to do with that concept? The amendment would reverse the burden of proof. The same defence as that for which the clause provides would be used. Duress is common to the clause and the amendment. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The concept of duress forms part of the amendment and the hon. Member for Hertsmere is in order. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for that, Mr. Maxton. The hon. Gentleman did not listen to the beginning of my remarks. [Hon. Members: "Start again."] I shall not do that, but I shall remind the hon. Gentleman of my first point. 
<P>
I said at the outset that it is difficult for a defence of duress to succeed, but that it is an important defence in the circumstances that we are considering. My arguments support the amendment. I am impressed by the fact that the Minister has not intervened. He has experience of such matters. Perhaps he will tell the Committee about cases in which he successfully mounted a defence of duress, and his defendant was triumphantly acquitted due to the Minister's powers of advocacy. We will wait and see he says. 
<P>
I have already argued, regarding the broad meaning of duress in the criminal law, that the threat must be serious and cogent. Will the Minister apply that meaning to the law in such circumstances, or does he envisage a form of duress that is not regarded as duress in the criminal law? We have already encountered an example in which the threat is to property. We can all imagine a threat to property of such magnitude that it would superimpose itself on the will of the person concerned and result in an action that that person would not otherwise have taken. That might fit in with the legal theory of duress but might not meet the strict requirement for duress under the criminal law. 
<P>
A substantial body of law exists on the defence of duress. I will put the hon. Member for Wyre Forest out of his misery--no, perhaps he would not be miserable about it--and tell him that I do not propose to go into that substantial body of law. The hon. Gentleman might have found that interesting, but I will not tempt him to intervene. 
<P>
The key point for the haulage industry, which supports the amendment, is that duress has stringent requirements. Under the criminal law, we have to ask how the defence of duress is established and on whom the burden of proof rests. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest was interested in that. The key point is that the burden of proof in criminal proceedings is on the Crown, or the prosecution. In support of that statement I cite a passage from "Blackstone's Criminal Practice" which says that the Crown are not called upon to anticipate defence of duress and destroy it in advance, but if the accused places before the court such material as makes duress a live issue fit and proper to be left for the jury, it is for the Crown to destroy that defence in such a manner as to leave in the jury's mind no reasonable doubt that the accused cannot be absolved on the grounds of the alleged compulsion. There we have it. The burden of proving that there is no duress is on the Crown. 
<P>
In the criminal law, the burden of proof--I am sorry to use another legal phrase; it simply means who proves what--is on the prosecution, which must disprove duress by the normal criminal law standards of proof, so the jury must be sure that the accused person was not acting under duress. If the jury is left in any doubt, the person must be acquitted. Those are the normal protections under the criminal law afforded to an accused person who raises the issue of duress, claiming that he did what he did because a serious threat had been made against him or someone close to him. 
<P>
Let us return to the way in which duress is dealt with in clause 20(2). I hope that all members of the Committee, not just the hon. Member for Wyre Forest, will see that it is dealt with in a significantly different way. The Minister may gainsay this if he wants to, but under subsection (2), as compared with the criminal law, it is clear that the burden of proof is on the carrier--in other words, on the defendant. In one sense, the carrier is not defending criminal charges, but he is still defending himself against being liable, as the responsible person, to pay a penalty. The burden of proof is on him. That is my interpretation of the words in subsection (2): 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a defence for the carrier to show".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
<H5>7 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
That places the burden of proof firmly on the shoulders of the responsible person alleged to be liable for a penalty. Will the Minister confirm that the effect of subsection (2) is to place the burden of proof on that liable person? Will he also tell us more about the standards of proof that the responsible person will have to meet? We know that the burden of proof is on him. What of the standards of proof that will have to be met to show that he was acting under duress at the material time?  847 848 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Is there not another even more serious problem? My hon. Friend has told the Committee about standards of proof in the courts: the Crown has to prove such and such and the jury has to be convinced. However, the problem for us is that the judiciary, the jury and the courts will not be involved. The hapless lorry drivers will have to prove their case to an immigration official. There will be no jury or magistrates, and the standards of proof required by Government Officials may differ widely from those required by a properly constituted court and jury. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. I hesitate to use the word "theoretical" but my right hon. Friend would certainly understand what was meant by it. Every aspect of the penalties lies in the hands of the Secretary of State. He decides who is liable for penalties and who the responsible person is. He sends the penalty notice, and if the responsible person wishes to dispute it, it goes back to the Secretary of State to decide on liability. The Secretary of State thus exercises every function going. 
<P>
Some people would say that that made our debates theoretical; because the Government will do what they want in any event, and no one else can intervene or exercise independent judgment. However, I would not be so cynical as to say that. I hope that the Secretary of State will bend over backwards to exercise his functions in a judicial manner and to follow the letter of the law and the provisions in the Bill--including the amendments that I hope that we are going to make. My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border demonstrated the importance of having as many safeguards as possible for the person alleged to be liable for a penalty, because everything is in the hands of the Secretary of State. The amendment would help to make the provision look fairer. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend hopes that the Secretary of State will bend over backwards to operate the system in a proper judicial manner. However, am I wrong in assuming that while the law refers to the Secretary of State, in practice he, the Minister of State and junior Ministers will not be involved? "The Secretary of State" is a term used to cover the officials of the IND. I had assumed that these decisions would be made by immigration officials and that appeal mechanisms would be dealt with by slightly senior officials; I was not certain in what circumstances, if any, the Secretary of State personally would serve notice on anyone.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend is right that there is no provision for an appeal against the judgment made by the Secretary of State. That makes it all the more important to have the best legal safeguards available in the first place. Moreover, it should appear fair to the lorry driver; he should not feel that he is being subjected to some sort of arbitrary or draconian regime where he does not get a fair say. I hope that he will get a fair say, but there we are. That makes the point about the importance of getting this right. 
<P>
It is unsatisfactory that the burden should be placed on the person concerned. He does not have the same safeguards as are available to a person facing a criminal charge and he has many other disadvantages. The amendment tries to make things a little fairer by transferring the burden of proof from the shoulders of the responsible person to the Secretary of State. All its technical defects will doubtless be pointed out to me, but in a broad way it tries to recreate the way in which the defence of duress would operate in a criminal case. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest can now see the full picture here. 
<P>
We do not see why lorry drivers, owners or hirers should be treated in an inferior way compared with a person facing criminal charges. Moreover, the defence of duress is clearly needed by people who will be subject to this liability. We heard in our evidence about the background to this: the activity of criminal gangs on the continent and the risks and threats to which lorry drivers and clandestine entrants are exposed. Earlier this month a gun fight between rival groups of traffickers left one person dead and three injured. According to reports the shots were fired after two groups of traffickers began disputing a payment received from a refugee who had been put on a lorry bound for England. 
<P>
The Committee will have recognised that we are dealing with some pretty desperate people here. It is not just the clandestine entrants who are desperate but all these people involved in the trafficking trade. We must do our best to protect our lorry drivers. 
<P>
Once again I will ask hon. Members to put themselves in the position of the British lorry driver. He is often on his own on the continent in a difficult situation. He may be very isolated. He may come across these gangs and be exposed to these sorts of threats. Let us consider the overseas lorry driver, too, as he will come within this framework of liabilities. We have not had submissions in the main from foreign lorry drivers, but I am sure that we should consider their rights and interests too. 
<P>
How easy in practice will it be for an overseas lorry driver to avail himself of this defence? He is on his own in this country. How can he prove that he has been subject to threats and duress on the continent? All the witnesses and the evidence are likely to be on the continent. Here he is in this country with its unfamiliar legal and administrative system. Will he not find it very difficult to convince the Secretary of State? All the odds are stacked against him. How can he demonstrate to the Secretary of State that he was acting under duress in bringing in a clandestine entrant? 
<P>
Will the Minister say how such a person might go about doing that? Will he require evidence from other people? 
<P>
The Committee must bear in mind a point raised by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association in its submission to the Committee. I do not completely agree with ILPA, but I accept that the Bill will make matters more difficult from that organisation's point of view. 
<P>
ILPA says that the availability of the defence of duress will permit false allegations to be made against clandestine entrants by responsible people trying to get off the hook. That is a legitimate concern from a good source, but it is outweighed by the need to provide lorry drivers with the defence of duress in the circumstances that I described. It would be wrong for duress to be 849 850 available as a defence in criminal proceedings, but not for someone in this type of offence. 
<P>
However, should there be a risk of false allegations being made, that risk has been aggravated by the Government casting all the burden on the lorry driver. The lorry driver cannot rely on an independent investigation or normal proceedings. The burden is on him to establish the defence, which creates an even greater risk of someone making allegations against a clandestine entrant that are not founded in fact. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> As drafted, clause 20 specifies defences for the carrier. Is there not a danger that carriers who are employers might turn round and say that there is a problem, putting pressure on their employees to say that they were under duress under such circumstances? My hon. Friend was trying to bring out that danger. False allegations may occur, and the Secretary of State may find many claims of duress and believe that that is the general run of things. So there will be a problem when a genuine case arises. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point about another problem that will arise. My hon. Friend's concern is legitimate and is bound up with the general nature of the provisions. Such risks will appear in relation to many aspects of the Bill, as drivers are being made liable, alongside owners and hirers. 
<P>
At all times, we must bear in mind the employer-employee relationship. The vast majority of lorry owners and drivers are thoroughly decent people, and I hope that some of those pressures will not come to pass. 
<P>
Evidence submitted by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association to the Committee states 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ILPA is concerned that the establishment of a duress defence will encourage carriers to make unfounded allegations against passengers in order to seek to escape liability. This may result in asylum seekers being charged with serious criminal offences such as assault, threats to kill or blackmail. The establishment of the defence will therefore have the indirect effect of further criminalising clandestine passengers, and therefore asylum seekers and clandestine passengers, and therefore asylum seekers and refugees."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are fairly important considerations. The Committee will have gathered that a threat must be very serious if it is to amount to duress. Allegations against clandestine entrants would therefore have to be of that type. 
<P>
On balance, duress should be available as a defence. The need for such a defence is clearly expressed in evidence submitted to the Committee. That outweighs ILPA's concerns, even though some of those concerns are legitimate. 
<P>
ILPA's evidence contains another point which supports my argument. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The clause is also objectionable in that the burden of proof on these defences rests on the carrier where in these proceedings it ought to be on the Crown to prove the negative as well as the positive elements of the crime."--[Official Report, Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c.  207.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On that point I entirely concur with the association. It will be difficult for the Secretary of State to prove that the defence of duress is not made out, while at the same time being the person who decides whether it is made out. We are asking a great deal of immigration officers, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border said, and are putting them in a difficult legal position. 
<P>
7.15 am 
<P>
Will the Minister reconsider this matter and find a way to avoid one person carrying out the functions of prosecutor and judge? That would be desirable, because, on any view, it is a basic requirement of justice to separate the functions of prosecutor and judge-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> And jury. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> And jury, as my right hon. Friend correctly reminds me--while we still have the right to trial by jury in this country. I shall say that for the Minister of State's benefit without going too far down that avenue, but I think that he understands my point. I think that I have said enough about duress for the time being, but it is an issue that may arise for many lorry drivers and we shall have to consider it with care. 
<P>
However, that is not the only defence available under the clause. A defence is also available under subsection (3), which brings me to amendment No. 472. We believe that a person liable to a penalty will not only find it difficult to avail himself of the defence under subsection (2); the defence under subsection (3) may also, in practice, be difficult. Again, the amendment is intended to make matters a little easier and fairer for the person liable to a penalty. 
<P>
We must bear in mind that it is a cumulative offence. When I first cast my eyes over subsection (3) and read the three limbs in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), I thought that, if any one of the limbs was made out, that would amount to a defence. Each one is a stringent requirement for somebody to have to make out, but it would be a considerable task to show that all three were made out. Once again, the burden of proof has been placed on the shoulders of the person liable to a penalty. He, rather than anybody else, must prove that each of the three limbs is satisfied. 
<P>
I hope that I am remaining in order, Mr. Maxton. I shall refer to amendment No. 472, if you wish me to. The purpose of the amendment is to break the subsection up, but the amendment may be defective. It deals with an important point that has been canvassed by many of the parties giving evidence to us. For example, it is not enough for the person concerned to establish that an effective system was in operation under paragraph (b). He must also prove, under paragraph (c), that on the occasion in question the person or persons responsible for operating that system did so properly. That is assuming that the person concerned knows who the driver was and that the driver is available to give evidence. As I have said, it may be difficult for an owner who has hired out his vehicle to find the driver and get his evidence, assuming that someone who is available to give evidence would be willing to do so. I ask the Minister for guidance on how such a person can establish the third limb of defence under paragraph (c), especially given that the burden of proof rests on him. Will the evidence of the driver that he operated the system be sufficient? What other evidence might be required? The joint submission of the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association helpfully highlights that point. I shall briefly quote that submission because this is an important point on evidence.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Given that a company with 10, 15 or 20 vehicles will have a system for all those vehicles, is it conceivable that the company's overall record might be a defence for an individual infringement? In other words, the company would argue that, although a clandestine immigrant came in on one of its vehicles, it had run hundreds of vehicles across the channel and had good systems overall. Would that be a defence, or does the provision purely relate to one incident and a solitary driver? How widely is the provision drawn? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend has made an excellent point, which, I am afraid, I did not anticipate. He has made his point, and I hope that the Minister will tell us whether the fact that a fleet has a safe system will be sufficient under paragraph (b). I have to tell my hon. Friend that, on a first glance at paragraph (b), my initial reaction is that that would not be a sufficient defence because paragraph (b) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an effective system for preventing the carriage of clandestine entrants was in operation in relation to the transporter".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps I am wrong, and perhaps the Minister will deal with that point. 
<P>
The Freight Transport Association and the Road Hauliers Association gave important evidence about that matter in their joint submission. They said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe that it will be impossible in practice for drivers to benefit from the defences set out in 3(c). Most drivers are the sole occupants of a vehicle".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that any discussion of subsection (3)(c) should come in the debate on amendment No. 190. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to you for that guidance, Mr. Maxton. I shall simply confine myself to the broad questions that I have asked the Minister. What sort of evidence will be sufficient for a person to establish the defence, given that the burden of proof rests on his shoulders? What evidence can he produce? 
<P>
Amendment No. 473 is on an entirely different subject; it deals with a very important defence, which we must consider carefully. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be useful if the parliamentary private secretaries were awake in order to pass messages to Ministers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> All members of the Committee will want to consider this important subject: health and safety seems to have been overlooked in the Bill. I was first drawn to that point by some of the evidence that we took from the hauliers, which opened my eyes to the fact that there seemed to be no health and safety provisions in the Bill. Health and safety should be paramount, by which I mean the health and safety of carriers and others, including clandestine entrants. A carrier should not be under pressure to feel that he must compromise on health and safety. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Poole made an important point about not putting lorry drivers in an invidious position. Without having much practical or expert knowledge of the field, I can think of many ways in which carriers--particularly drivers--might be put in such a position. Amendment No. 473 would allow carriers not to be found liable when they can show that health and safety would have been put at risk if they had acted differently. It may not be technically correct or elegantly drafted, but it suggests an idea for the Government to consider. I want that idea to appear in the Bill because health and safety is so important. 
<P>
Health and safety issues can arise under many heads. The industry tells us that breaking sealed containers would be undesirable on health and safety grounds. I can think of many cases in which that would be so. Many cargoes are hazardous. What should a lorry driver do if he is carrying such a cargo and believes that there may be some clandestine entrants? The situation would obviously be bad enough already, and we would not want lorry drivers to do anything that might make matters worse. The lorry driver may be under no threat, but may believe that there has been clandestine entrance to his lorry. He may feel that by taking a particular course, he might be exposed to danger. 
<P>
Health and safety run through all the issues covered by the amendments. What can we reasonably expect a lorry driver to do without exposing himself to risk? When should he open cargoes? How should he deal with clandestine entrants? We have not given sufficient attention to these important issues, and I seek a constructive response from the Minister. If he cannot accept our amendment, will he think up an amendment that can be added to the Bill to make health and safety the paramount concern that it should be? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have remained largely silent during the past few hours as there were plenty of speeches from the Opposition Benches. However, amendment No. 473 is worth a short contribution. The Committee will be disappointed to hear that I do not have at my fingertips all the detailed arguments that the hon. Member for Hertsmere has so ably outlined. I shall refer only to matters of principle and to earlier debates on what should happen to clandestines if they are set down by a driver who, having discovered them, felt that he had to dispose of them in some way. 
<P>
In setting health and safety as the top priority, above any other impact of the law, amendment No. 473 goes to the heart of the matter. We can all imagine circumstances in which a lorry driver may set people down in inappropriate places such as the side of busy roads, resulting in a serious threat to those people. However, it would be far worse if, for example, the captain of a ship wanted to get rid of clandestines, and there have, unfortunately, been cases in which precisely that has happened. God help us if the captain of an aircraft ever wants to get rid of clandestines who are discovered en route before they arrive at the port of entry when, under these provisions, the carrier is liable to a fine. 
<P>
The Minister needs to respond to this important principle by setting out matters clearly to responsible persons regarding the health and safety of everyone, including clandestine entrants. We want to stop the 853 854 traffic in clandestines, but it should be made clear to the persons responsible that in no sense do the government intend the health and safety of clandestine entrants to be threatened, however inadvertently, by the very real risk that responsible persons face of incurring a fine when they reach the United Kingdom or otherwise encounter an immigration officer. 
<H4><center>[Mr. Colin Pickthall in the Chair] </center></H4>
<P>
<H5>7.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made some important remarks about the safety of migrants in sea passages. Aid agencies working with illegal migrants believe that as many as 1,000 people may have drowned in 1998--more than 200 of them in Spanish waters--compared with about 3,000 dead in the previous 10 years? I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was aware of that fact, but it certainly supports his comments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Those are useful facts. I have been aware of some notorious cases, particularly regarding Albanians en route to Italy and north Africans en route to Spain. People en route to the United Kindom may become aware of these provisions, and may be similarly tempted to dispose of people in a thoroughly reprehensible way. 
<P>
As we said in earlier debates, it is important to strike the right balance between seeking a deterrent and treating humanely those who are involved when deterrence has failed and trafficking occurs. I hope that the Minister will accept that health and safety are an important part of humane treatment. Can he assure us that when the Bill is enacted, people will not be able to claim that they carried out a particularly inhumane act that affected clandestine entrants' health and safety purely because the law was so draconian and tight that they had no means of defending themselves for taking a sensible and humane response to people whom they discovered in transit? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> This is the clause that I have been waiting for all night. I am keen to discuss at length these and other amendments, because I am horrified by the clause. 
<P>
I cannot imagine, even in my hanging and flogging days at the Home Office, presenting such a draconian measure, which contains no decent defences, before the House of Commons. Now that I am a child of the new millennium and a touchy-feely, more caring person, I am absolutely horrified at the clause. 
<P>
The amendments would make the clause accord slightly more with natural justice. I shall not follow my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere by explaining duress. Indeed, I could not explain it, but I understand his point that it is difficult to prove duress. Proving to a court of law that someone was acting under duress is a heavy burden. It is no good saying, "I felt threatened", or "I thought my life might be at risk." That, as I understand it, is just not good enough. One has to clear an incredibly high hurdle. In many court cases, it cannot be proved to the satisfaction of the judge and jury that someone did something because they were in immediate fear of their life, or were under such an appalling threat that they felt they had no option other than to follow such a course of action. 
<P>
My concern about the clause, and why I support the amendments, which may ameliorate some of its effects, is that we are not talking about proving such points to a judge and jury. We have spent some time discussing defences. We may be under the impression that, when a carrier is stopped and found to have a clandestine entrant on board, his defences will be conducted in a court of law. We may think that the following would happen. A prosecution would make a case that the carrier was caught in such circumstances. He or his legal advisers would then try to explain why he was acting under duress, or to give a defence under subsection 3(a), (b) or (c). At the end a magistrate or judge would sum up and a jury or magistrate would come to a conclusion. 
<H4><center>[Mr. John Maxton in the Chair] </center></H4>
<P>
That is not what is envisaged under the Bill. We are not talking about defences presented in a court of law, or about the judicial authorities of judge and jury deciding whether duress has been applied. For simplicity, let us continue to talk about lorry drivers. Under the proposals, a driver may be stopped by the immigration authorities at a port and a clandestine entrant found on board. 
<P>
I am not moving off the amendment but must refer to clause 21 to explain. The Secretary of State would then serve a notice on the carrier who might have to produce his defences. Defences will be produced to an immigration official. That official will decide whether he has caught a carrier with a clandestine on board and judge whether the defences offered are good enough under clause 20. 
<P>
I would be grateful for correction, and would request a detailed response from the Minister, on my view of the references in the Bill to the decisions of the Secretary of State on whether defences have been proven satisfactory. I assume that legitimate officials of the Secretary of State will be taking those decisions. I cannot imagine that it will be the Secretary of State personally taking them--he does not in most other circumstances. A carrier will have to produce his defence before an immigration official of appropriate rank. If he is to hope to avoid the penalty under subsection(3), he will have to say to an official, "I am sorry sir, I was acting under duress."

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying into clause 21 and into questions of procedure. Clause 20 is about the substance of defence; clause 21 is about the procedure of that defence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I take your point, Mr. Maxton, and am sorry to have mentioned procedure. I am on the subject of defence, but am trying to point out that a carrier will have to prove his defence before immigration officials rather than before a court of law. That is not a matter of procedure but a problem with the burden of proof. I admit that I am not making the point well. 
<P>
It is bad enough that we have the burden of proof under clause 20(2), about which I want to talk in a moment. As well as shouldering the burden of proof, the carrier must also prove his case to the satisfaction of an immigration official. That is an entirely different ball game from proving it to a court's satisfaction. In those circumstances, clause 20 is grossly unfair. It places an appalling burden of proof on an individual that he was under duress. 
<P>
The individual must satisfy immigration officials, who may be slightly more cynical than a court. I do not want that to be taken as a criticism of immigration officials; the situation would be similar if the police were to be judge and jury in their own cause. I do not think that many Labour Members during 18 years of Conservative Government would have tolerated a situation in which people had to prove to the satisfaction of a police officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State that they were acting under duress. 
<P>
We would never have advocated such a system, but if we had, the Opposition would never have tolerated it. That would have been a grossly unfair burden of proof and contrary to natural justice. People are entitled to expect defences to operate as if they were made in a court of law, but the clause does not propose that. 
<P>
I also support amendment No. 472, which would make it slightly easier for a carrier to produce an effective defence in these extraordinary circumstances, in which the burden of proof will be on him. He would not have to prove all three steps of the hurdle--paragraphs (3)(a), (b) and (c). Under the clause as drafted, the carrier must prove all three before he will have an effective defence. That is a steep burden to place on a carrier, especially when the burden of proof will be against him. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have been listening carefully to my right hon. Friend, who has spoken out strongly from the point of view of someone with some experience in the field. How does he think that the provision will appear to the average carrier--whether a driver or an owner? Will they consider it to be stacking everything against them? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> They will regard it judicially as the VAT inspector arriving and making a judgment. Of course I am not critical of officials legitimately doing their job, whether they are Customs and Excise or immigration officials. However, the Bill vests in them power to impose draconian civil penalties--later on in the Bill, we discover that they can detain vehicles, which may be worth £50,000 to £80,000. Those are pretty heavy penalties to vest in officials operating under the authority of the Secretary of State. If police officers were to have such powers, we would build in some defences and rights of appeal, and PACE would certainly be amended. The Bill will give such powers to officials, so carriers must have better defences than they have under the clause. 
<P>
That is part of the purpose of our amendments. The lead amendment would reverse the burden of proof of clause 20(2), not to introduce some incredible new concept of law but merely to make the provision operate as does a proper court of law. That is why the clause is so unjust. I could support it if it proposed a judicial system--if the defences were being made in a court of law. The Government might get away with that. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman keeps referring to clause 21 when he talks about the procedure whereby the person will be dealt with, rather than the burden of proof. 
<P>
<H5>7.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I take your point, Mr. Maxton. I am trying to make the point that the burden of proof is wrong, because in all courts of law the burden of proof is normally the other way round. In the Bill, the Government have reversed the burden of proof. Without straying into clause 21 and procedure, that is particularly unjust because the clause relates not to the operation of a court system but a system that is administered by officials--the decent and hard-working officials who are trying to deal with the awful problem of clandestines. Police officers deal all the time with criminals, and can become somewhat cynical about them. We would not, therefore, trust them to be judge and jury in their own cause. 
<P>
Similarly, it is inevitable that immigration officials or the officials, whoever they may be, who are operating the system on behalf of the Secretary of State, will become hard-bitten and cynical. I stress that that is not a criticism of immigration officials. It is inevitable, in doing the job that they do, that they will see some pretty awful things and will get some pretty rum views about how some people, carriers and clandestines, behave. Given those circumstances, it cannot be right that they judge whether someone has satisfactorily proven under clause 20(2) that he was acting under duress. It is the immigration official who will make the judgment, not anyone else, and it will be an immigration official who will hear the lorry driver's defence and say, "I'm sorry mate--that's not duress. I don't accept that." 
<P>
If I have got this completely wrong, I will happily take an intervention from the Minister and say that I am sorry and that it is not actually for the immigration official to make the judgment whether duress has occurred. I will shut up, because I have got it wrong. However, unless the Minister wants to correct me, I believe--if I have read the clause half-decently--that I am right. For the burden of proof to be this way round, with an immigration official making the decision, is grossly unfair. 
<P>
The issue of health and safety arose in the Special Standing Committee. I listened with horror to what was said by the representatives from the UNHCR and other organisations about what desperate carriers might do, having found clandestines on board, if they thought that they faced severe penalties as a result. It was pretty horrific, and I admit that I decided to take some of it with a pinch of salt. I did not believe that the people concerned could throw people overboard from ships or take other actions that would result in their injury. 
<P>
We saw the reports from Emma Daly in The Observer, which were not about crossing the channel but illegal immigrants being transported from Morocco across to Spain. We would no doubt like to pretend that such things would not happen in the case of carriers operating across the channel. However, if we have penalties that are as severe as they appear to be in Spain, we will see cases involving similar desperate and unprincipled operators. I shall not make any nationalist points about 857 858 foreigners, because some British operators in desperate straits may take similar actions in disposing of their cargo to those that we read about in The Observer. 
<P>
It is vital that we build in the health and safety defence, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said. We heard about the case a few years ago of the person who stowed away on the undercarriage of a jumbo jet and froze to death or fell to his death when the undercarriage was let down. We may say, "How can anyone stow away like that--it is so dangerous. It's appalling--what was he thinking of?" It demonstrates the desperate straits to which people will go in getting into another country. We may think that we know about Hazchem loads. We see lorries with various symbols and signs showing that they are carrying hazardous chemicals. However, we do not think that they are sloshing around loose inside it but that they are in drums that are tied up nicely so that they are safely stowed on board. If people do stow away on board a vehicle carrying a hazardous cargo, and the vehicle is sealed and the tabs are down, but the driver has reason to believe that he may have some clandestine entrants on board, he has a serious problem. His health and safety could be at risk if he takes action in the back and disturbs the cargo and he could be in serious trouble under one part of the law because he is carrying people in the back of a vehicle containing hazardous chemicals, the sanctions for which are severe. 
<P>
What does he do? Clause 20 does not give him an adequate defence. It takes no account of such situations. He is not acting under duress, nor is he failing properly to operate the system for keeping clandestine entrants out of his vehicle. Amendment No. 473 is sensible and right. Surely we would not want people to be so afraid of the penalties in this clause that they are willing to take risks with their health and safety or with that of clandestine entrants who may be in the vehicle. 
<P>
I cannot see how the Minister can reject the amendment. Admittedly, it is not the most elegantly worded amendment--though my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere wanted it to be as perfectly designed as possible--but it certainly makes a point in principle. We do not mind how the Home Office or the Lord Chancellor's Department tidies it up, but it would add an important defence to those already contained in clause 20. I therefore look forward to the Minister saying that he accepts the principle of the amendment and that he will clean it up and bring it back on Report. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I want to make only a brief contribution, because I know that the Committee wants to make progress. 
<P>
I support amendments Nos. 189, 472 and 473 because it is important to get the wording right and give proper protection to drivers who act responsibly. Will the Minister tell us how a judgment will be made? Will it be made purely on the case of an individual driver, or will the system take into account a fleet's track record? Would the character of a driver be taken into account? That is material. 
<P>
We have been talking about an individual who would probably make his own case, on his own. One of the ways in which one does that is by appealing to credibility. When I first read the clause, I thought how dreadful it was that the Secretary of State was in effect the individual who had to deal with this. 
<P>
The more I look at it, the more I think that the Secretary of State has given himself a dreadful power, because endless hon. Members will write to him on behalf of road haulage companies and drivers in their constituencies saying, "This person is of fine character. What are you doing?" I wonder whether the clause ought to provide for an ombudsman or appeals system. 
<P>
We have tabled the amendments in an attempt to be helpful. I look forward to the Minister's reply as I have looked forward to all the ministerial replies to this debate.

<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Like my right hon. and hon. Friends, I had not intended to participate in the discussion on this clause, but having heard the debate, I am more than persuaded by the eloquence of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border that the Home Secretary is taking unnecessary powers in this clause. 
<P>
Both the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam and my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border talked about the lengths to which some carriers might go when faced with the severe penalties in the Bill. I want to remind them of the oral evidence that we heard in earlier sittings on that point. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East brought up the problems after the Vietnam war with the boat people, many of whom were left in the seas off Asia because the penalties on people who picked them up were too severe. Anne Owers of Justice pointed out to him that one did not have to go back as far as the Vietnam war. There is more recent evidence. For example, the captain of a Russian ship carrying refugees and asylum seekers from west Africa realised that he would be penalised by the ship's owners and threw the stowaways overboard. 
<P>
When giving evidence to the Committee, Mick Hardwick of the Refugee Council said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My opposite number in the Italian Refugee Council tells me that every day there are bodies washed up on the Adriatic Coast, and it is thought that this often occurs when traffickers simply turf people overboard from little rubber dinghies that they use to bring people from the Albanian coast to Italy".
<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, Tuesday 16 March 1999; c. 130.]
<P>

<P>
There is plenty of evidence of the desperate lengths that people will go to when faced with such severe penalties. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere spoke eloquently and at length of the difficulty with which hauliers will be faced when seeking to use the defences offered under clause 20. Noteworthy are the three defences offered under subsections 3(a), (b), and (c). Any right to appeal will be to the Secretary of State, but decisions will be taken by senior immigration officials, who may dismiss appeals out of hand. 
<P>
My hon. Friend was right to say that the proposal represents another nail in the coffin for the hauliers. It is another aspect of a Bill that heaps penalties on them. The Under-Secretary accused me and others of seeking to defend disreputable hauliers, but we are not seeking to do that at all. 859 860 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Can my hon. Friend see any reason why the Government should not make the defence of duress available to the hauliers in the form in which it is used in criminal proceedings? In such proceedings, the burden of proof is on the Secretary of State. The hauliers may conclude that all the factors are stacked against them. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I cannot find any such reason. I think that the hauliers will conclude that this and other aspects of the Bill are grotesquely unfair. I am a layman, not a lawyer. I try to steer clear of lawyers at all times. I usually come away a lot poorer when I have anything to do with lawyers. I was extremely impressed by my hon. Friend's understanding of the difference between the right of duress under criminal and civil law. He referred to the understandable sense of grievance that the hauliers will feel as they perceive that the Government are singling them out for special treatment. 
<P>
The Under-Secretary is still absent from our debate at this late hour. He may be poised to make a dramatic reappearance, doubtless refreshed and ready for the further fray. Throughout the night's debate, he has come perilously  close to tarring all hauliers with the same brush of being disreputable and of seeking to deceive. He has suggested that the majority of hauliers have voluntarily accepted illegal immigrants into their trucks. We have ample evidence to show that that is not the case. Because of our dealings with hauliers in our constituencies, none of us would believe that. 
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said, the concept of duress as a defence is a fine one, but not as it is drafted in the Bill. Not only my right hon. and hon. Friends but the groups from which we have taken evidence in recent weeks believe that that defence will not work as drafted. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere gave an erudite discourse on the application of duress in the criminal law, as could be expected of him as an experienced lawyer. With some help from my hon. Friend the Member for Poole, he examined the different possible causes of duress and what might qualify under the clause and under the amendments as duress. I certainly found that interesting, even if the hon. Member for Wyre Forest tired somewhat during the course of the explanation. 
<P>
I was especially interested--as hauliers will be--in the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere on the burden of proof, and how it compares with prosecution under criminal law. In answer to his earlier intervention, that suggests to me that clause 20 is contrary to natural justice. That is certainly how it will be perceived by hauliers.
