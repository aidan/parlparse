<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000236"></a>The
Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b><b class="B"> </b>Good afternoon,
Sir John. It may help the Committee, given that clauses 175 to 177
result from clause 174, if I briefly explain its purpose.</div>
<a name="06062160000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is an enabling
measure that will extend the United Kingdom&#146;s ability to enter
into international agreements for mutual assistance in the enforcement
of taxes. Those agreements may cover the exchange of information,
assistance in tax collection and the service of documents. The UK has
more than 100 bilateral agreements providing for such exchange on
direct taxes. Within the European Union, there is a well established
framework for assistance on direct and indirect taxes, including the
recovery of debt. The clause allows for the United Kingdom&#146;s
entering into multilateral tax arrangements.</div>
<a name="06062160000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government announced in the pre-Budget report our intention to ratify
the Council of Europe and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax
matters. The convention contains provision for exchange of information,
multilateral tax examinations, and assistance in tax collection and
service of documents. It also contains important safeguards, and I want
to discuss those in particular. They relate to the confidentiality of
taxpayer
information.</div><a name="06062160000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062160000237"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I understand
that the convention to which my right hon. Friend referred is a 1988
convention. Has it really taken the United Kingdom 18 years to put it
into domestic
legislation?</div><a name="06062160000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000238"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> No, it has not taken the United Kingdom 18
years. For a convention to be effective the member states that
subscribe to it must also put it into their law; otherwise it cannot
work. Regrettably, although the United Kingdom has championed the
argument about the exchange of information internationally, both 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column765" />Column number: 766</div>in the OECD and in the European Union, it is only relatively recently
that the convention has reached the point at which it can be ratified
by the United Kingdom, and used. My hon. Friend will be well aware that
the principles in the convention will be found also in our tax
treaties. It has been the practice of both Conservative and Labour
Administrations for a long time to advance and extend the double
taxation agreements.</div><a name="06062160000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was referring to the important safeguards on the confidentiality of
taxpayer information. That is a matter that always prompts some
discussion in debates on double taxation treaties. So it
should&#151;for every agreement. Each one is negotiated individually,
and reassurance about that is important for every tax treaty.
</div><a name="06062160000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the convention, the information obtained is to be treated as
confidential in the receiving state in the same manner as information
obtained under its domestic law, or under the conditions of secrecy
applying in the supplying state, if those are stricter. That is
particularly important for the United Kingdom, because we have strict
confidentiality with respect to the exchange of taxpayers&#146;
information. We shall have occasion to consider that aspect of the
matter again on clause 178. That applies even within United Kingdom
authorities. Outside the United Kingdom, we adhere very tightly to the
strict conventions, and that dictates whether we will exchange certain
types of information with other states; their standards have to be at
the same level as
ours.</div><a name="06062160000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The convention
also sets outs instances in which states are not obliged to provide
assistance. An example would be where a state&#146;s domestic law
would not allow it to obtain information or if there were public policy
grounds.</div><a name="06062160000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
also allows the United Kingdom to extend the scope of its bilateral
treaties to include indirect taxes, such as VAT. VAT is, of course, a
tax on consumption, and consumers should pay that tax at the rate voted
for by the Parliament in the country where the consumption takes place.
That is another important principle that the UK continues to advance in
all international forums, but particularly in the European
Union.</div><a name="06062160000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result of
globalisation, deregulation and technological advances, a range of
services can routinely be purchased by private individuals from
suppliers in other jurisdictions, including those outside the EU.
Extending mutual assistance arrangements with such countries will
support our efforts to ensure compliance and help to tackle tax
fraud&#151;an issue about which this Committee, like all Finance Bill
Committees, has been very
concerned.</div><a name="06062160000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, the clause consolidates the existing enabling legislation
concerning agreements about the international exchange of information.
As with the existing legislation, agreements provided for in the clause
are made by Her Majesty in Council subject to prior consideration and
approval by the House. I reassure the Committee that, as now, any order
will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, in the same
way as our double taxation treaties
are.</div><a name="06062160000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be happy
to hear points on which hon. Members seek clarification, but I commend
the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="06062160000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062160000239"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): I am grateful to
the Paymaster General for her opening 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column766" />Column number: 767</div>remarks, which have given me some reassurance on one or two of the
points that I wanted to raise, but I still have some anxieties about
clause 174 and the consequential clauses, 175 to 177. I shall follow
her lead and deal with them as a whole, so that I need not trouble the
Committee separately in relation to the subsequent
clauses.</div><a name="06062160000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the Opposition recognise the advantages of entering into agreements
with other countries in relation to the collection of information on
tax. That should, we hope, put us in a stronger position to ask for
help from foreign Governments in collecting information about the
overseas tax affairs of British citizens. The exchange of information
has been part of our general tax law for some years. However,
traditionally, such exchange has been based on specific double taxation
agreements. The information exchange envisaged by such treaties in the
past was rather more narrowly focused than the clauses under
consideration. It generally extends only to that which is required to
allow the treaty to give relief&#151;that is, only to the extent that
the treaty relieves individuals&#146; tax
liabilities.</div><a name="06062160000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clauses seem to give Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs rather
wider powers to start to enforce the tax laws of other countries and to
investigate people&#146;s liability to tax under foreign
jurisdictions. However, it has long been established&#151;since the
case of Government of India, Ministry of Finance <i class="I">v. </i>Taylor in
1955&#151;that the courts will not enforce the tax laws of other
countries. I have received a number of representations from
organisations that are worried that the clauses may undermine that
long-standing
principle.</div><a name="06062160000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Institute of Chartered Accountants expresses a number of concerns. Its
briefing for Committee members
states:</div><a name="06062160000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
concerned that the consequence of the UK signing up to
the...Convention&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062160000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
1988
convention&#151;</div><a name="06062160000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;could
be that the UK would be asked to enforce tax collection on behalf of
overseas jurisdictions, party to the multilateral convention, which do
not have the same...standards of &#145;due process&#146; as
the UK to ensure that tax was properly payable by the person against
whom the enforcement was being required. This would breach the Human
Rights of the person against whom the enforcement was being required.
This is compounded by the fact that HMRC officers have a unilateral
power to disclose and the taxpayer has no rights of appeal, nor to know
that it has even happened.&#148;</div>
<a name="06062160000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institute goes on to point out that
although subsection (5)&#151;the Paymaster General has adverted to
this&#151;specifies that the clause will not be applicable where the
overseas jurisdiction does not have appropriate confidentiality rules
in place, it contains no such safeguard in relation to human rights,
due process or the general integrity of the tax system.</div>
<a name="06062160000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar concerns are expressed
by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which says:</div>
<a name="06062160000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are concerned that
should the UK
ratify&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062160000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">the 1988
convention&#151;</div> <a name="06062160000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;tax
payers resident in the UK could automatically be exposed to foreign tax
claims from jurisdictions having a system of law (in connection with
the process and assessment of tax) which does not meet the same
standards as those applicable in the United Kingdom.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column767" />Column number: 768</div><a name="06062160000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institute points to the problems that
could arise where the taxpayer has no right of appeal in the foreign
country on the substantive question of whether the tax is
due.</div>
<a name="06062160000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The tax
systems in a number of countries are not rules-based in the way that
the United Kingdom system is. I have received representations about
countries taxing companies on their so-called profits, which far exceed
the actual profit made in that jurisdiction. I am told that that is a
problem in some middle eastern countries, and similar concerns have
been raised about certain African countries. In countries such as
Russia, the interpretation of tax rules can differ widely between
different tribunals and cities. In some countries, there are also
disproportionate penalties in tax law. In China, for example,
non-payment is technically punishable with the death penalty.</div>
<a name="06062160000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society echoes the
concerns of the other professional organisations that I mentioned. It
says:</div><a name="06062160000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
concern is that HMRC may find themselves compelled to collect taxes by
an overseas jurisdiction that does not have the kind of rules based tax
system or tradition of non-corrupt administration that is taken for
granted in the UK.</div> <a name="06062160000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">We
believe that mutual assistance with the collection of taxes should be
restricted to those countries that have a high standard of public
administration&#148;.</div><a name="06062160000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth looking at the experience of cross-border tax law enforcement
in the European Union. The powers that we are considering have some
precedent in EU law and in the EU directive on mutual assistance in the
recovery of taxes. The difference, however, is that the EU directive
requires member states to adhere to minimum levels of fairness. The
accession process and the adoption of 50,000 pages of the acquis
communautaire involve, among many other things, an extended vetting
process to ensure that accession countries&#146; tax laws meet
minimum requirements.</div>
<a name="06062160000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Agreeing to enforce the tax
laws of other EU member states, therefore, is one thing, but enforcing
the laws of any country that signs up to the 1988 Council of Europe
convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters is quite
another. There is real anxiety that the safeguards in relation to the
EU laws are not in place here in relation to the convention. We should
not forget that countries where there is widespread abuse of human
rights will not hesitate to use their tax systems as part of their
means to suppress dissent, and I imagine that the Government would not
be happy enforcing the tax laws of countries such as Burma or Zimbabwe.
I would be interested to hear the procedure that the Government would
follow should a country with a controversial human rights record sign
up to the 1988 mutual assistance
convention.</div><a name="06062160000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, only certain EU member states, plus the United States and
Azerbaijan, are signatories. It would be useful to hear from the
Paymaster General what will happen when other countries, with more
controversial tax systems and human rights records, sign up. It seems
that such countries do not have to give guarantees about the content of
their own tax systems before they sign up. The Paymaster General said
that there will be a process of parliamentary assent before any further
use is made of the powers, and I should be grateful if she could
confirm that that process will operate in the case of any new country
that signs up to the 1988 convention. That would give Parliament the
opportunity to scrutinise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column768" />Column number: 769</div>the wisdom of agreeing to disclose information to and assist the tax
authorities of controversial countries.</div>
<a name="06062160000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, I have just a
few practical concerns. One, on which I would value the
Minister&#146;s views, relates to the cost of inquiries made on
behalf of foreign Governments. What happens if the Government spend
time and money making investigations on behalf of foreign Governments
only to find that they do not receive an equivalent level of assistance
in relation to the tax affairs of British citizens abroad? Is there any
procedure for reimbursement of the cost of investigating tax matters on
behalf of foreign Governments? Do the Government have the power to turn
down requests on the ground of disproportionate
cost?</div>
<a name="06062160000194"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="06062160000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also
concerns about the notice of investigation. Another restriction that
could be incorporated would be to confine investigation on behalf of
foreign Governments to cases in which the Government had already chosen
to investigate a particular taxpayer&#146;s affairs. Some concern has
been expressed about the prospect of British taxpayers being subject to
a bolt-from-the-blue investigation of their tax affairs with no
indication of what is going on. The Chartered Institute of Taxation
would go even further, calling for safeguards to be written into the
legislation so that no disclosure could occur without the approval of
the High
Court.</div><a name="06062160000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
practical concern on which I would value the Paymaster General&#146;s
input is that HMRC could be carrying out investigations on taxes that
are entirely unlike taxes levied in this country. They might include
the Saudi religious tax&#151;the Zakat&#151;or the Korean education
tax. Others include the Eritrean rehabilitation tax, which has caused
concern in relation to religious freedom, and the Libyan jihad tax, a
form of payroll tax that I believe has given rise to complications. I
value the Minister&#146;s assurance that HMRC will not be involved in
investigating such controversial taxes, even should the relevant
countries sign up to the 1988 convention, because it could give rise to
significant practical as well as constitutional
difficulties.</div><a name="06062160000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last anxiety is about the extent of the reciprocity in relation to the
information to be gained under clause 175. It refers only to taxes or
duties covered by those arrangements; there seems to be no explicit
requirement that a foreign Government should have agreed to investigate
the evasion of UK taxes in their country. Such an undertaking would
surely be an important prerequisite to action in this country by our
Government. I am particularly concerned to ensure that we have genuine
reciprocity; even when double tax treaties are in place, enforcement
sometimes leaves something to be desired. For example, Italy is meant
to give tax credits on dividends paid to UK shareholders, but it has an
almost decade-long backlog in refunding those
credits.</div><a name="06062160000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions give HMRC some significant new powers to take legal action
and to make investigations in relation to foreign taxes. Some view the
provisions with anxiety, as if the Bill has a sting in the tail, and
the Opposition are concerned that although the legislation provides
some safeguards, as outlined by the Paymaster 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column769" />Column number: 770</div>General, they are insufficient. That is so particularly in relation to
countries with doubtful human rights records, which could in theory
sign up to the 1988 treaty. I hope that she will be able offer some
reassurance to me and to those organisations that have contacted me
expressing their anxiety about the
provisions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000240"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am happy to respond to the hon. Lady&#146;s
inquiries on this important area. I am a little surprised at the views
expressed by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which normally
follows closely tax law and tax practice, not only in the UK, and which
I thought understood very well the processes with regard to our double
taxation treaties. Of course, confidentiality, protection and the
refusal to provide information are all pertinent to the double taxation
treaties, which allow for the exchange of information, and this and
previous Governments&#146; approach to the matter is well
known.</div><a name="06062160000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also well
known and generally accepted that the quickest way to ensure that the
tax authorities have the information that they require is through
information exchange. It is less burdensome, it is transparent, and it
deters those who might think about concealing their tax affairs in
another jurisdiction, because it is quicker to settle them in the
correct
jurisdiction.</div><a name="06062160000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal first with the hon. Lady&#146;s example about signing of
the convention by countries with human rights records that are at best
inadequate and at worst positively unacceptable. She cited Burma, China
and Zimbabwe, although there are others. The convention is open only to
OECD and Council of Europe countries, and both those organisations have
strict policies on human rights. In the case of the OECD, human rights
are relevant even to whether a country receives observer status, let
alone full participation rights or final membership. So the point is a
red
herring.</div><a name="06062160000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
there is a back-up. The convention provides that&#151;as is currently
the practice in our double taxation treaties&#151;information can be
refused. The small and dedicated team that deals with information
requests at HMRC has a lot of experience, and if the team suspects that
the requested information might in any shape or form endanger the human
rights of an individual, it can refuse to provide it without
explanation. We have discussed that in previous Finance Bills when we
considered mutual information
exchange.</div><a name="06062160000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">On tax
treaties, the hon. Lady misunderstands. All the existing tax treaties
contain exchange of information provisions that allow parties to tackle
evasion and ensure that correct amounts of tax are paid. That has been
operational for some time, and no principle will be breached by the
proposals, nor are we moving on to new ground. It is correct that there
are relatively recent developments on indirect tax in relation to
double taxation treaties, but those treaties do slightly more than just
relieving double
taxation.</div><a name="06062160000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
shortly with disproportionate penalties and the important points about
confidentiality, as well as the matter of comparable, like for like
taxation.</div><a name="06062160000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062160000241"></a><b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): Will the Paymaster
General explain subsection (1)? It
says:</div><a name="06062160000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;those arrangements
have effect (and do so in spite of any enactment or
instrument).&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column770" />Column number: 771</div><a name="06062160000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, that does not
exclude the European Communities Act 1972, nor the Human Rights Act
1998, and to that extent an important constitutional precedent is being
established&#151;particularly as the provision deals with debt
recovery, which is a more definite action than information provision.
What consideration have the Government given to the constitutional
implications of the
proposal?</div><a name="06062160000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000242"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I was going to come to debt recovery, because
the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) also asked
questions about it, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me take
things step by step. If hon. Members think that there is something new
and different from our double taxation treaties here, they are
labouring under a misunderstanding. This is about tax information
provisions, which follow the same
point.</div><a name="06062160000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next point
that the hon. Lady made was about which taxes and duties would be
covered. She made points about a tax that would not be levied here. All
the taxes covered are those with a UK equivalent that&#151;to make it
even narrower&#151;is within the remit of the Finance Bill. Anything
that moved beyond being an equivalent of such a tax would not be
required for exchange; it has to be narrowed down for that
point.</div><a name="06062160000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
reiterate a number of points about confidentiality and then go on to
the process. I tried to make it clear in my introduction that the rules
operating in the other state that we are exchanging information with
would have to be as strict as ours in order to open the exchange. If we
did not think them comparable, with the same protections, it would not
be opened. That reassurance is sought as part of the negotiations on
double taxation treaties. If HMRC was not satisfied on those
assurances, the provisions would not be
applied.</div><a name="06062160000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady then asked about acting on behalf of other
jurisdictions&#151;covering the debt recovery point&#151;and
exactly what is going to happen here. I again need to put on the record
that HMRC has a great deal of experience with the 100-plus taxation
treaties that we already operate, and we are building on that. However,
a state would not be required&#151;so we would not be
required&#151;to carry out measures at variance with its own laws or
administrative practices. That is another way
out.</div><a name="06062160000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then,
the request for assistance in recovery&#151;not
investigation&#151;should not be made in the first place if the
requesting state has not gone through all the necessary legal processes
to prove that the debt exists. States cannot decide that they prefer to
use our enforcement rather than their own. They have to go right the
way through their processes and make the case for the debt. Only at
that point can the request be made, and even then there would be
conditions. Is it comparable? Are we satisfied on the confidentiality
standards? Are we satisfied that there is a case to be
answered?</div> <a name="06062160000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady asked about costs being proportionate. HMRC could refuse
assistance, even after being satisfied on those other points, if it
felt that the costs were disproportionate. That kicks back into our own
rules as well. That is a double lot. It could say that the cost of
providing the assistance is disproportionate in its view and therefore
it declines to make that arrangement.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column771" />Column number: 772</div><a name="06062160000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady said something
about a right of appeal. It is true that there is no right of appeal
against disclosure of information, but there never has been. I keep
going back to the 100-plus tax treaties that we have. What the taxpayer
can do, because we are talking about a tax debt in another
jurisdiction, is to contest it there. They can contest the
debt&#151;</div><a name="06062160000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000243"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> Only if they are allowed
to.</div><a name="06062160000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000244"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Yes, absolutely, but that would come back
through the powers that say that the same rights are not provided as in
the UK system, so the principle of the highest standard is not met, and
we shall not assist in the recovery of the debt, whether it is
considered proven or
not.</div><a name="06062160000195"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div> <a name="06062160000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department&#146;s practice has always been that it would need to be
satisfied that in providing the information&#151;this is one of many
qualifications&#151;or pursuing the debt, if it had been established,
the confidentiality of the taxpayer&#146;s information would be
safeguarded to the same standard as our own. At such a point, we could
say, &#147;No, we are not doing
this.&#148;</div><a name="06062160000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
remind the hon. Lady that our standards are very high? The standard in
the UK is that sharing confidential taxpayer information is a criminal
offence that can be prosecuted. If an official in HMRC shares any
taxpayer information with a non-authorised person&#151;someone
outside HMRC or, sometimes, outside the specific area&#151;they are
liable to criminal prosecution. HMRC has information gateways, and when
the information moves on, the criminal prosecution is attached to the
information and not to the person who discloses it. If we were not
satisfied that the information was protected to that level, we would
not disclose it.</div>
<a name="06062160000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department understands the delicate balance involving the confidence of
taxpayers and their knowing that they are providing information that is
used for the appropriate measures for which it was sought. Where it is
transmitted, either in the UK to another authority or outside the UK,
it must have that same protection and exceptional grounds must be
involved.</div> <a name="06062160000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that I have dealt with the point. I said to the hon. Lady that if there
is any situation in which HMRC honestly believes that providing the
information requested could lead to an abuse of the individual&#146;s
human rights, that information will not be provided. There are tight
standards. Members of this Committee need to examine how HMRC protects
information here in the UK. Things will be done to those standards and
information will not be provided in any other
circumstances.</div><a name="06062160000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that I have covered all the points. An individual&#146;s human rights
are clearly protected, but we must make it clear to individuals that
due process and co-operation can take place in the exchange of such
information in tight circumstances. The hon. Lady need only examine the
tax treaties that we currently have to see that.</div>
<a name="06062160000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The double taxation treaties
are already subject to affirmative resolution. Any tax agreement will
come through this House on affirmative resolution. At every 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column772" />Column number: 773</div>point, the Government will be able to be pressed. They will therefore
give the assurance that all these considerations&#151;at each point
in each agreement and not just as a general series of points on this
clause&#151;are protected. That gives tax authorities the appropriate
tools to do their job effectively, but importantly it provides the
strict safeguards that we would expect in respect of
information that is provided on a confidential basis.</div>
<a name="06062160000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope both
that the hon. Lady accepts those reassurances and that she will be
reassured that the points she raises are important. It is important
that all Governments and all Ministers should be vigilant on the use of
taxpayer information and its protection by
confidentiality.</div>
<a name="06062160000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000245"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for what
she has said. This has been a useful debate and it has reassured me on
a number of serious matters. I acknowledge the strength of the
Minister&#146;s point that to get into the OECD and the Council of
Europe a nation must be subject to vetting procedures. I fear that she
may still need to use other safeguards, because the process might not
be foolproof given the detail involved in tax legislation. A few
countries with tax systems in which due process is not up to scratch
might slip through the net, get into the Council of Europe and the OECD
and have the opportunity to sign up to the convention. They would have
to surmount a useful hurdle, but the other safeguards outlined by the
Paymaster General, particularly the public policy safeguards, should be
ready for deployment in case the vetting procedures for those
organisations do not cover all relevant
issues.</div><a name="06062160000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also grateful to the Paymaster General for emphasising not only the
fact of the safeguards but the importance of being vigilant and using
them extensively to ensure that HMRC is not party to collecting taxes
levied with the motivation of a breach of human rights. I hear what she
says on costs and I am reassured to hear that the powers in question
will have an impact only on taxes broadly aligned with those levied and
collected in this country. It is also welcome that she has confirmed
that each time a new country is brought within the scope of the powers
there will be individual consideration of that country by the
Government and the House. Because of the importance of the issues
raised, which she acknowledged, I hope that when new countries come
into the framework Ministers and other Members of the House will be
vigilant in ensuring that all safeguards are in place to preserve human
rights and due process in the tax
system.</div><a name="06062160000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000246"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I point out to the hon. Member for Chipping
Barnet that the clause provides an example of the fact that the onward
transmission of material from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column773" />Column number: 774</div>HMRC, even within the net of Government or public bodies, carries with
it criminal sanctions for the unauthorised, unlawful disclosure of
taxpayer information.</div>
<a name="06062160000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause ensures that
information requested through an information gateway under the Gambling
Act 2005 is subject to such a sanction. There was a slight mismatch,
because the Gambling Act went through the House in parallel with the
Bill that set up HMRC and introduced the criminal sanction, and it was
dealt with in the short period before the last general election. That
is why we have had to return to the matter now. I assure the Committee
that the information has been protected in all that time as well, and
the gateway is operational only with criminal sanctions
applicable.</div><a name="06062160000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

That the clause be read a Second time.</div>
<a name="06062160000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause seeks to exempt
from pre-earned assets tax persons whose estates fall below the
inheritance tax threshold, by amending schedule 15 of the Finance Act
2004.</div><a name="06062160000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Standing Committee, we have spent a lot of time debating inheritance
tax and the scope for avoidance. We have also spent much time talking
about those whose estates are above the inheritance tax threshold.
However, the new clause deals with property that could fall below the
inheritance tax threshold but be liable for pre-earned assets tax. The
annual income tax on continued use or occupation of pre-earned assets
was introduced in 2004 to ensure that those who sought to get round the
inheritance tax rules on gifts with reservations without a tax charge
were caught. We support
that.</div><a name="06062160000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, with
the help of the Chartered Institute of Taxation and its low incomes
tax reform group, I have drafted the new clause to highlight the group
of people who fall under the tax, whose assets may fall well below the
inheritance tax threshold and who would be inadvertently caught by the
tax, perhaps without realising. After making the gift, people may find
that they are liable to the
tax.</div><a name="06062160000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chartered Institute of Taxation and its low incomes tax reform group
helped me by providing examples that fall outside the narrowly defined
exemption that exist in the legislation but still fall in the broad
remit of the pre-earned assets tax regime. The first refers to a mother
and father who help their daughter and their son-in-law with the
purchase of a house. Time passes, the husband vanishes and the daughter
succumbs to a serious long-term disease. Six years after giving the
money to help with the purchase of the property, the parents move in
with their daughter to help to look after the children. According to
the interpretation of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, those
parents then fall into an annual tax based on the extent of their
contribution to the original purchase of the property. I welcome the
Paymaster General&#146;s comments on whether she concurs with that
interpretation.</div><a name="06062160000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second example refers to a mother and daughter who live together
following the death of the father. The mother makes an outright gift to
allow the daughter to purchase part of the house in which they both
live. The daughter moves abroad to live and work but retains her stake
in the house in which her mother continues to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column776" />Column number: 777</div>live. In that case, the mother would be liable to the tax charge ad
infinitum even though the estate would fall below the inheritance tax
property threshold. At the point at which the gift was made, they did
not consider that they would be reserving a benefit. That would be the
case even if the mother had only loaned the money to her daughter. She
would still be caught by the tax. I would again like the Paymaster
General to confirm that that example would fall into the tax regime.
The system could work in reverse. If a son who helped his mother buy a
sheltered accommodation property moved in with her to look after her,
it would be the son who would be caught by the tax. The new clause
seeks to overcome the difficulties for those people who are below the
inheritance tax threshold.</div>
<a name="06062160000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I talk
through the details of the clause, I draw the Paymaster
General&#146;s attention to not just the apparent unfairness of the
situation but the wider issue of whether the public are even aware that
they could be liable to this charge. It is not clear to an individual
where in the self-assessment tax return they are held liable to such a
charge. At present, those who may be subject to the charge are expected
to give an affirmative answer to self-assessment return question 13,
which
states:</div><a name="06062160000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Did
you receive any other taxable income which you have not already entered
elsewhere in your tax
return?&#148;</div><a name="06062160000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
plenty of people in Committee would not be aware whether they would
fall into the circumstances that make them liable to pre-earned asset
tax given that question. The pre-earned assets charge is explained only
in the explanatory notes, and people consult those only if they think
that the question might apply to them at some point. How are those who
are currently outside self-assessment even to know that they might be
liable? It is not clear how anybody can make sense of this tax without
professional advice. Again, I ask the Paymaster General how many people
she thinks might be liable for the charge, and how many of them might
not be paying it.</div>
<a name="06062160000196"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="06062160000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if one
gets so far as to realise that one might be liable for the charge, and
one understands it, one will be aware that there is de minimis
exemption of &#163;5,000 if the yield is deemed to be an annual
rental value of that amount. I shall be interested in the Paymaster
General&#146;s comments on how that de minimis was arrived at, as it
could clearly catch people whose estate falls below the inheritance tax
threshold.</div>
<a name="06062160000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause suggests that the problems for the taxpayer who does not have an
accountant could be resolved if the rules and restrictions for the
pre-owned asset tax were aligned with those on inheritance tax. Any
estate that is below the inheritance tax threshold is exempt. The new
clause seeks to amend schedule 15 of the Finance Act 2004 by inserting
a series of new paragraphs on property, chattels and other
miscellaneous assets, one of which would be new paragraph 6A, which
states that the preceding
paragraph</div><a name="06062160000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does not apply
if the value of the chargeable person&#146;s relevant estate is below
the relevant threshold at the relevant
time.&#148;</div><a name="06062160000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
calculation in that respect is done by taking 80 per cent. of the
inheritance tax threshold, which allows 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column777" />Column number: 778</div>for some variation in the valuation of the estate. It also seeks to
create a situation in which, if the estate is below the inheritance tax
threshold, it is simplified; there is one easy alignment. If a benefit
is needed later on the gift that has been given, that will be counted
with the estate. That is simpler and makes more sense.</div>
<a name="06062160000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude, our concern is
that, as it stands, there is a presumption in the legislation of tax
avoidance, although in many cases family circumstances may dictate
changing arrangements. The new clause seeks to make arrangements fairer
for families who might not have the liquidity to explore the POAT
regime, or who might simply want to help each other in difficult times.
If people are not eligible for inheritance tax, it seems unfair
inadvertently to catch them in that way. I would much appreciate the
Paymaster General&#146;s response.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000250"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I have some sympathy with the new clause, but I am
not sure that it is worded in the right way or whether it will do what
the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) said. I
seek clarification, and I have seven questions for her, because it
seems from what she said that, for example, question 13 on the
self-assessment form could be better worded, and that people might
unwarily end up liable for tax without realising it.</div>
<a name="06062160000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot refer to line numbers,
because the amendment paper does not give them, but at the top of page
1345, we find new paragraph 3A(2)(b). My first question is to ask the
hon. Lady what that means. The second and third refer to sub-paragraph
(3)(a), which concerns the disposal condition, and (3)(b), which refers
to a contribution condition. Can she give examples in each case?
Fourthly and fifthly, can she give examples of the disposal condition
in paragraph 6A(3)(a) and of the contribution condition mentioned in
paragraph 6A(3)(b)?</div>
<a name="06062160000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">My sixth
question concerns paragraph 25(2)(a) at the bottom of page 1346, which
refers to &#147;relevant property&#148;. That is defined in
proposed new paragraph 25(3), at the top of page 1347, which refers us
back to paragraph 22 of schedule 15 to the 2004 Act. Will the Paymaster
General therefore remind the Committee what paragraph 22 currently says
about relevant property?</div>
<a name="06062160000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">My seventh,
and final question, relates again to the top of page 1347. Proposed new
paragraph 25(9) states that new clause 8 would be retrospective and
apply from 6 April 2005. I stand open to correction, but I seem to
remember the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne expressing grave
reservations in this Committee about retrospective tax legislation.
Have I misunderstood her previous comments? If not, why does she seek
to make an exception in respect of new clause
8?</div>
<a name="06062160000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000251"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> I outlined the Opposition&#146;s reservations
about the pre-owned asset tax regime at some length when we discussed
clause 80, and it would not be productive to repeat those points, but I
shall refer briefly to some of them.</div>
<a name="06062160000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I outlined during that
earlier discussion, there is a degree of consensus between the two
Front Benches about seeking to ensure that people cannot gain tax
advantages by giving away property that they continue to use. However,
that consensus breaks down in relation to the Government&#146;s
decision to supplement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column778" />Column number: 779</div>the long-standing reservation of benefit rules, which have applied since
the 1980s, with the pre-owned asset tax regime.</div>
<a name="06062160000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have significant
reservations about how the regime operates, and the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne gave a number of examples to illustrate that. On
a number of occasions, the regime has caught transactions that have
nothing to do with tax, and which are all about family members trying
to support and financially assist one another. As I said, we live in an
era in which the elderly are increasingly asset rich and cash poor, and
it is not uncommon for children to wish to buy out a proportion of
their homes to release cash for their parents. However, such
arrangements fall foul of the regime.</div>
<a name="06062160000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for Falmouth
and Camborne said, one of the real anxieties about the pre-owned asset
tax regime is that it bites not only on innocent transactions, but that
the people who enter into them can be wholly unaware of the negative
tax consequences. That is why we have reservations about that aspect of
the pre-owned asset tax regime. As I outlined earlier, we also have
reservations about the fact that inheritance tax and pre-owned asset
tax could bite in the same circumstances. That is certainly not the
Government&#146;s intention, but it does happen, as the examples that
I outlined show.</div>
<a name="06062160000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although new clause 8 would
address one area of controversy&#151;the lack of a nil rate band for
pre-owned asset tax rules&#151;it would be welcome if the Government
were to review the whole operation of the regime. That includes the
points raised by new clause 8, although I would not seek to interpret
and analyse it in quite the depth that the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) did. I have a degree of sympathy
with what the new clause seeks to achieve, but it is important to look
at the pre-owned asset tax regime as a whole, because it needs
significant reform, and I hope that the Paymaster General will consider
undertaking a review of its operation.</div>
<a name="06062160000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000252"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The new clause seeks to cater for the position
of those who do not have sufficient wealth to be liable for IHT if they
die, but who, as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne said, have
entered into arrangements that are liable for income tax under the
pre-owned asset tax regime.</div>
<a name="06062160000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">My officials have been
contacted by the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the low income tax
reform group and have discussed the views of those organisations about
the current provisions and about whether we need to arrange for further
changes to the legislation. Despite that discussion and the concerns
raised, there has been no evidence&#151;it would be good to have
evidence rather than theoretical propositions&#151;of whether people
are caught in such a situation. That is despite positive discussions
with those two organisations. In fact, as a result of those
discussions, HMRC has put detailed guidance on the internet. It was
updated at the end of last month, following further consultation and
helpful contributions from those organisations.</div>
<a name="06062160000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the hon. Member for
Chipping Barnet is right; we covered the issue extensively during our
discussion of clause 80 and the charges aimed at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column779" />Column number: 780</div>taxpayers who have engaged in complex tax avoidance schemes. On the
whole, such taxpayers know whether they are liable. In addition, there
has been detailed guidance to calculate liability and there is printed
guidance on the tax return guide, which also directs the taxpayer to
the internet guidance and the probate and IHT
helpline.</div><a name="06062160000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne that I am aware of the two
organisations&#146; representations, but the facts of the
matter&#151;whether there are real cases, the number of them and
whether they merit changing the legislation&#151;have not been
established. In addition, I am unable to accept the new clause because
it would not make the provisions described by the hon. Lady. In
particular, the new clause would operate by reference to the value of
all of a person&#146;s property at the time that the relevant
arrangements are entered into. Some such arrangements could be
long-standing, which would mean that there could be cases in which
attainment values were not so much impracticable as impossible, and
would therefore be a
bar.</div><a name="06062160000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">So far,
approximately 1,000 elections into IHT have been received by HMRC.
However, the deadline for the self-assessment return for the first year
of the charge is 31 January 2007. Although I cannot accept the new
clause, which produces an impossible proposition, I have asked my
officials, in good faith with the discussions with the two
organisations, to work closely with those organisations and to seek out
whether there really are examples, and to keep the situation under
review. Should it be necessary to return to this matter, we will. That
is the better way in which to
proceed.</div><a name="06062160000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062160000253"></a><b class="B">John
Thurso</b> (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD): The
Paymaster General asked for concrete examples. I have a constituency
case that I think fits the bill precisely. It concerns a son who is
trying to look after his parents, and I believe that the value of the
property is just over &#163;100,000. I do not have the details to
hand, but if I may, I shall write to the Paymaster General with
them.</div><a name="06062160000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000254"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> For a minute, I thought that the hon. Gentleman
was going to ask me to express a view on that individual case. He
prefaced his remarks by saying that he thought the case might be
covered.</div><a name="06062160000115"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">I
am advocating that it is not sufficient to advance that there is a
theoretical problem; before we change legislation, we need to be
reassured that there are specific examples. I hope that the Committee
will be reassured. I hope also that the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne will withdraw her new clause and be reassured that the
sensible thing is to monitor the situation and to seek out examples, if
they exist. The deadline is not until January 2007. If further action
is then needed in the very specific cases in question&#151;whatever
the reason for such cases arising&#151;and if the legislation does
not cover the situation, that will be the appropriate time at which the
Government should return to the
matter.</div><a name="06062160000197"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000255"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I thank the Paymaster General for that
response, which provides some reassurance that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column780" />Column number: 781</div>Treasury is aware of the potential for a problem. The examples that I
gave are, of course, theoretical, but it would be useful to know
whether the Government intend that people in the circumstances in
question should be affected by tax in the way suggested. I should be
interested to know what research is being undertaken by the Treasury to
see whether that is happening. Perhaps there is no evidence&#151;but
perhaps there has been no research. I appreciate that the deadline may
not have passed, so the problem may not
yet&#151;</div><a name="06062160000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000256"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> With respect to the hon. Lady, that is a daft
proposition. The idea of a problem has been advanced and outside
organisations and the hon. Lady have suggested that the legislation
should be changed. We cannot set up a research project every time there
is a change to the tax system. What is required is that if people have
concrete examples not covered by the de minimis of &#163;100,000 they
should come forward. That is exactly what the two organisations
concerned have been asked to do. We shall then consider the evidence
base. The obligation is on those
organisations.</div><a name="06062160000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000257"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I thank the Paymaster General for her
intervention. Of course, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will
also have access to such theoretical examples as I have given. Given
that the tax returns do not have to be
filed&#151;</div><a name="06062160000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000258"></a>Dawn

way?</div><a name="06062160000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000259"></a>Julia

longer.</div>
<a name="06062160000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000260"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I know, but I just want to explain that the tax
authorities know what people tell them. If people do not tell them
things, such as that there is a problem, they do not know. That is how
tax works. That is why we discuss confidentiality. Taxpayers provide us
with information on which we
act.</div><a name="06062160000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000261"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> My concern is that there may also be people
who may not be aware that they fall under the regime in question, until
they are investigated by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs.
There are potentially other reasons why they may become liable for the
tax.</div> <a name="06062160000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to the
point that I was making, given that the returns will not need to be
made until 31 January 2007 and that it may not be possible until then
to determine the potential scale of the problem, and given the helpful
reassurances by the Paymaster General about how people may or may not
be caught, and her agreement to monitor the situation, I shall be happy
to withdraw the new
clause.</div><a name="06062160000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000262"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Lady sounded as if she was about to ask
leave to withdraw the new clause; will she reply to my seven questions
before she
does?</div><a name="06062160000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000263"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Of course, I am withdrawing the motion, but
if the hon. Gentleman wants me to clarify I am more than happy to do
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column781" />Column number: 782</div><a name="06062160000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman raised an
issue about retrospection: given that the returns do not have to be
filed until January 2007, application from the date in question seemed
consistent and sensible. He also raised questions about the value of
the property. As I said, the key issue was that the intention of the
new clause was that the value of the chargeable person&#146;s estate
meant the aggregate of, first, their estate at the relevant time, and,
in addition, any other gifts that they might have had, for which they
would receive benefit in the future. The intention was&#151;and this
holds for the three different paragraphs&#151;that if that value
represented 80 per cent. of the inheritance tax threshold it could be
exempt from inheritance tax.</div>
<a name="06062160000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that clarifies
matters for the hon. Gentleman, but, as I said, given that the returns
will not be filed until 31 January 2007, and given the Paymaster

dialogue and representations from those organisations that have raised
concerns, I am happy. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<a name="06062160000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be mercifully brief, not
least because some Members may recall that we debated a similar
amendment to last year&#146;s Finance Bill. However, today&#146;s
new clause is slightly different. It would regulate the price of road
fuel when world oil prices push up the pump price. It would do that by
utilising the additional VAT charged on pump prices that have gone
beyond a forecast level, which is to be laid down each year by the
Chancellor.</div> <a name="06062160000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
subject came up in debate last year. The Chancellor already makes
forecasts. The question was asked about last year&#146;s Finance Act,
and I ask again through the new clause. If such forecasts are to be
referred to in statutory legislation, it would have to be provided for
in the Bill.</div> <a name="06062160000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is not designed to weaken the impact of rises planned for
environmental reasons. Using the additional VAT gathered to minimise
rises in the pump price will happen only when the price reaches the
forecast price and consequently the yield set down by the
Government.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column782" />Column number: 783</div><a name="06062160000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Chancellor publishes that forecast, I suggest that he should be obliged
to publish the anticipated yield from duty and VAT on oil prices up to
50 per cent. above the forecast. That would allow far greater
transparency, and all road users would be able to see how much of the
VAT yield might be offset against the higher fuel prices in any given
circumstances.</div>
<a name="06062160000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fundamentally, we need this
measure or one like it because of the great difficulties faced by the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000265"></a>John
Thurso:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I share our concern for the
premium paid by motorists in remote rural areas; it is largely a matter
of market forces because of the throughput of cars on the garage
forecourt. Will the new clause do anything to address the premium, or
will the premium be enshrined, with the overall price going up or down
throughout the
country?</div><a name="06062160000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000266"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> Sadly, it is the latter. By necessity, the fuel tax
regulator needs to address a number of issues. The question is relevant
insofar as prices are much higher in rural areas, and they will benefit
more from any decrease in the price. We need to look at the cost to
business, especially the ability to plan road fuel costs properly,
because of the uncertainty that we have seen over the past year. I
shall put that into context.</div>
<a name="06062160000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
what the Financial Secretary said earlier, the percentage of tax in the
retail price has gone down by 8 per cent. in real terms&#151;from 68
per cent. to 60 per cent. Duty and VAT still account for about 60 per
cent. of the cost of a litre of petrol. Within that, there remains a
great deal of scope for the Government to do something. To put the
price into context, when we last debated the subject on 6 July 2005, I
said:</div><a name="06062160000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the AA, using its
own estimates on unleaded petrol, indicated that some six months ago
the price of a litre was about 80p. This month it is about
86p.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 6 July 2005; Vol. 436, c.
361.]</div><a name="06062160000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the past four or five weeks, the price per litre has crashed through
the &#163;1 barrier in many parts of Scotland. Since we had the
debate less than a year ago, there has been a price rise of between 20
and 25 per cent.</div>
<a name="06062160000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something
needs to be done to assist the road haulage industry and those who live
in remote rural areas and to provide businesses with more certainty as
they budget for their road fuel costs. I will not push the new clause
to a vote today. It is a probing amendment to see whether the
Government have changed their mind in any way on the proposals we
submitted last year and to allow consultation with the other parties in
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales who backed the proposals last
year. We may wish to come back to it on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000267"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I am surprised that an hon. Gentleman representing
the Scottish National party in a seat in Scotland suggests that the
measure would help the haulage industry. Of course, he and other hon.
Members are more expert on the issue than I am, but I suggest that in
Scotland the haulage industry competes principally with rail. Perforce,
because of the lower 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column783" />Column number: 784</div>density of population in Scotland, the rail network is less dense. The
haulage industry is hit by the problem where we have a system of
cabotage in the south of the country, where trucks may come from the
continent where they pay lower fuel prices. By the time they get to
Scotland, I would have thought that they had emptied their tanks so I
cannot see how the measure would assist the haulage industry in
Scotland.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000268"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> The
hon. Member for Dundee, East was brief in his remarks. I will try to be
similarly concise in mine. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman and to
his party. They are dogged about pursuing the issue through the Finance
Bill. He mentioned the Committee of the Whole House, which sat last
July, though the proposal that we are considering this year turns on
the oil price rather than on both the oil price and the pump price, as
did last year&#146;s proposal. It is a mechanism that would introduce
considerable complexity. It would do little to bring stability to the
UK market. It would also not offer any guarantee of reducing prices at
the pumps because the duty increase to be frozen would more than likely
be less than the fluctuations driven by the upstream oil market
volatility.</div> <a name="06062160000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">At its
heart, the new clause is based on a misconception, which is that high
fuel prices lead to higher overall VAT receipts. The reality,
particularly given the VAT regime, is that that is not necessarily the
case. Where people spend more on one commodity, they tend to spend less
on another, so the overall level of VAT receipts usually remains
unchanged. Also, the hon. Gentleman did not mention that VAT-registered
businesses can reclaim the VAT incurred when buying fuel for their
business journeys, so the level of VAT that they pay at the pumps has
little or no effect on their balance
sheet.</div><a name="06062160000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, it
is for those reasons that the Government believe that the best way to
deal with high oil prices is to work with oil-producing countries and,
through the G8 Finance Ministers, to try to stabilise the volatility in
the oil market to improve its functioning, rather than simply focusing
on short-term changes in levels of duty, as the new clause does. The
hon. Gentleman described it as a probing amendment. He reserves his
right to return to the issue on Report. He may well press it to a vote
at that point, but I remind him and the Committee that when he did so
last year his proposition was defeated by 12 votes to
351.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000269"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> I thought that we got 18 votes. I say to the hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West on competition, a local haulier
from my constituency came to see me recently devastated that it had
lost a huge amount of business from 42-tonne wagons with big tanks
filling up in Europe, coming up to Scotland and picking up business to
return down south. So the issue of competition from those wagons is
precisely what he described. It does not just exist in the south of
England and the midlands but in my constituency. On competition to
rail, I wish that what he said were so. If all the freight yards and
the Red Star parcel offices were still open, and there was competition
from that, perhaps the debate would be different but, as the hon.
Gentleman knows, after 18 years of Conservative Government and, before
that, Beeching, that is not the
case.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column784" />Column number: 785</div><a name="06062160000198"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="06062160000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
Financial Secretary that I am aware that the use of VAT to offset fuel
duty would not result in a full offset. The AA said that last year the
price rose from 80p to 86p. Using the mechanism here&#151;effectively
the same one&#151;that would have resulted in an offset of 1.2p. The
industry supported that measure. It would provide the Government with
yield and ameliorate the worst excesses of spiking and global price
rises.</div>
<a name="06062160000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have put
that point on the record and listened to the Financial Secretary. I
reserve the right to return to the issue at a later stage, but I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="06062160000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000270"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> On a point of order, Sir John. Before we
conclude the business, I would like to put on the record my thanks, on
behalf of the Committee and all the Ministers, for the excellent way in
which you, Sir John, as well as Mr. O&#146;Hara, and Mr.
Benton have stewarded, assisted and ably guided the Committee through
our complex debates. I would like also to thank the Clerks, the
<i class="I">Hansard </i>writers and the Doorkeepers for their help and assured
touch in making the business of the Committee run
smoothly.</div><a name="06062160000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet; speaking for the
Opposition on the Finance Bill is a huge challenge, and this was her
first time doing so. She was ably assisted by the hon. Members for
Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) and for Fareham (Mr.
Hoban)&#151;her Front Bench team.</div>
<a name="06062160000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
congratulate also the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne who, too,
was in her first Finance Bill and supported by her colleague, the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed). I congratulate all the
other Opposition Members on their&#151;I do not want to make anyone
laugh&#151;patience and skill in contributing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column785" />Column number: 786</div>to a thorough and high-quality debate, despite the competing demands of
other issues, particularly the World cup.</div>
<a name="06062160000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my hon. Friends the
Financial Secretary, and especially the Economic Secretary&#151;it
was his first Finance Bill too&#151;for some new concepts. We now
know what &#147;straddling&#148; means&#151;not always in terms
of the legislation, but certainly the posture of Ministers. We were
greatly encouraged by the Economic Secretary&#146;s observations
today on philosophy, and I think that all of us are assured that tax
legislation will be safe in his
hands.</div><a name="06062160000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate
the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) on
attending a Finance Bill after 10 years. He said that he will not come
back for another 10 years. All I can say is, &#147;Good luck&#148;:
being in Opposition will be just as unpleasant to him then as it is
now. I thank Mrs. Gauke, who at times I thought was a Committee member.
I do not know what we would have done without her. Actually, I do know
but I am not unkind enough to say.</div>
<a name="06062160000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank my hon. Friend the
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. I do not think that he realises
this, but he makes many officials in HMRC happy because, as they slave
over explanatory notes and regulations, they know that there are at
least some in this world who read those notes and regulations intently
and have questions to ask of them. I am not sure that Ministers always
welcome those questions; none the less my hon. Friend has played his
part.</div> <a name="06062160000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all my
hon. Friends who have participated for all the hard work that, I am
sure, they have done and for participating in the Committee. I am
eternally grateful&#151;I really am&#151;for their support and
assistance in ensuring proper discussion of the
Bill.</div><a name="06062160000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all
those from the professional bodies who brief us and who have supported
all Members on the Committee and, dare I say it, my
officials.</div><a name="06062160000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know it
is inappropriate but I thank the Whips. Normally they are not referred
to in Committee but they have done a splendid job in ensuring that we
have timely discussion, not for too long but of appropriate
length.</div> <a name="06062160000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look
forward to the remaining stages of the Bill. Again, I put on record our
thanks to you, Sir John., in what is, I think, your 16th Finance
Bill.</div>
<a name="06062160000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000271"></a>The

<a name="06062160000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000272"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Or 17th. I hope that you do many
more.</div>
<a name="06062160000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000273"></a>Mrs.
Villiers:</b> Further to that point of order, Sir John. After
what seems like several years, we are at the end of the Committee. We
had the thrills and spills of snagging, straggling, probing,
turbo-charging, recycled reheated turbo-charging and pre-emptive
reversed multiple turbo-charging. That was just this morning. Both the
Economic Secretary and I demonstrated our inability to pronounce Arabic
financial instruments. We had a lively discussion on whether the age of
financial capability and responsibility was appropriately 18, 25 or, in
the case of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West,
52.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column786" />Column number: 787</div><a name="06062160000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
temperature climbed, I felt that the Committee lost the will to live
but our sentence is nearly up, or at least we are on day release until
Report in a couple of weeks. I echo the thanks of the Paymaster General
to our three Chairmen&#151;to you, Sir John, and to your co-Chairmen,
Mr. O&#146;Hara and Mr. Benton&#151;for the exceptionally patient
and skilful way in which you guided our deliberations in Committee.
Like the Minister, I give my grateful thanks to the Doorkeepers and to
the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters for their hard work and
assistance.</div>
<a name="06062160000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
the Clerks of the Committee&#151;Malcolm Jack for his work on the
Committee of the Whole House and Frank Cranmer for his incredible
patience and hard work in assisting all Members of the Committee on the
difficult task of taking a Finance Bill through the scrutiny process.
It was certainly a challenge to take on the Finance Bill as my first
Standing Committee and to lead for the Opposition on it. I am grateful
for the assistance given to me by Mr. Cranmer and the Clerks of the
Committee.</div> <a name="06062160000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
grateful to my Front-Bench team&#151;my hon. Friends the Members for
Rayleigh, for Wycombe and for Fareham&#151;for their hard work. They
all worked exceptionally hard, as did the Back-Bench team. I see that
some of the latter have retired hurt, but they endured the lengthy
deliberations with great application and
diligence.</div><a name="06062160000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his
absence, I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) for getting in trouble for passing notes in
class. I repeat my apologies to the Committee for getting that wrong. I
note that my hon. Friend has fled the country, but I am sure that it is
not because of anxiety about contempt of Parliament. I also pay tribute
to Mrs. Gauke, who was ever present in our discussions, if not in
fact.</div><a name="06062160000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
acknowledge the civilised approach taken by those on the Government
Front Bench in almost all the Standing Committee debates. We had some
lively exchanges and some constructive ones. I am grateful for the
movement we saw from the Paymaster General on schedule 20. I also thank
the Liberal Democrat Members for their occasional guest appearances. I
pay tribute to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) who
made some thoughtful contributions on film and on
oil.</div><a name="06062160000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
I put formally on the record my thanks to the many professionals,
experts and organisations that provided a wealth of commentary
and advice on the Finance Bill. A particular &#147;thank you&#148;
should go to PriceWaterhouseCoopers for the advice and assistance given
to the whole Opposition Front-Bench team. We owe it a large debt of
gratitude for its assistance. In similar vein, I should like to express
my thanks to KPMG for similar assistance and advice. It is impossible
to run through all the individuals and groups on whose briefings I and
my colleagues have relied, but they certainly include the Society of
Trust and Estate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column787" />Column number: 788</div>Practitioners, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Law Society and
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Without
their assistance, it would have been simply impossible to provide the
effective scrutiny necessary for so important a piece of legislation.
Lastly, I thank the Whips for, as the Paymaster General outlined,
managing the whole process in a very civilised and effective
manner.</div>

Goldsworthy:</b> Further to that point of order. Sir
John. I shall keep my remarks short in case it degenerates into an
Oscar-style ceremony of thank yous. I should like to add my thanks to
you, Sir John, for chairing the sittings so skilfully. I also thank the
other Chairmen, Mr. O&#146;Hara and Mr. Benton. With so many Finance
Bill virgins&#151;I suppose one might put it that way&#151;on the
Committee, it must have been difficult to ensure that we all remained
in order.</div>
<a name="06062160000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to thank the Paymaster General for her very kind words, and I
congratulate the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet on doing such a
sterling job on her first time. I would also like to thank my
colleagues and the professional bodies who made my life a lot easier
during my first Finance Bill. It has been a baptism of fire, but I have
enjoyed it, and I am sure that I shall many happy memories, once I am
looking back at it. I am sure that that will be the same for the
remaining stages. Finally, I forgot to thank the Clerks for all their
help, because so much of the procedure was new, and their patience and
guidance was much appreciated.</div>
<a name="06062160000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000275"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> May I, Sir John, thank you for your chairmanship,
as well as that of Mr. O&#146;Hara and Mr. Benton? This was
my first Finance Bill Committee, and I have learned a great deal from
it. I would like to be in a position to thank my hon. Friends for all
their help and assistance, but such is the lot of a small party. I
thank all the staff. Sadly, I fear that, like the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West, I am looking forward to next year
already.</div><a name="06062160000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062160000276"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I will certainly report to Mr. O&#146;Hara and
Mr. Benton hon. Members&#146; thanks, and I am very grateful to them
for those kind words. It has been an excellent Committee, which has
conducted its proceedings with courtesy and extraordinarily good
humour&#151;at times, a little ribald for the Chair, but there we
are. With my usual masochism, I have to say that I have enjoyed it
greatly.</div> <a name="06062160000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Bill
