<P>
On resuming_
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have a tiny procedural difficulty. We are debating amendment No. 124, but its mover is not in the Committee. It is my duty, therefore, to invite further debate on the amendment. Does the Minister wish to speak?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the mover is not here, no.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is no further debate on the amendment, so it is my duty formally to put the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I should like to explain to the Committee that it is not that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has carelessly failed to turn up at 8 o'clock. He warned me at half past six that he would not be here. I am in possession of a marvellous piece of paper, which says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I have asked the right honourable Peter Brooke, MP, to dispose of my amendment as he sees fit, following the Minister's response."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I realise that we may not be able to have any further debate. This is, however, an extremely valuable piece of paper, which I propose to retain on my person.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. When we began our deliberations this morning, the hon. Member for Croydon, South referred to my commitment to produce explanatory notes on the significant number of Government amendments relating to the public-private partnership. I rise simply to inform all members of the Committee that explanatory notes have been placed in the relevant pigeon holes in the Members' Lobby.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That was not a point of order but a ministerial statement, which I take it the Minister was invited to make, and for which we thank her.
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 477, in page 66, line 45, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"having found no valid reason for the delay and provided an estimate of the administrative expenses to be incurred and reimbursed."._[Mr. Ottaway
.]
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 412, in page 67, line 22, at end insert_
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5A) Where the Mayor prepares a local implementation plan on behalf of a London borough council, he shall in preparing the plan have regard to the costs involved".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 125, in page 67, line 27, leave out from first "Council" to end of line 28 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he will pay to the Council from his budget any additional costs caused by the implementation of his plan.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 468, in page 67, line 28, at end insert_
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7A) The Mayor shall pay out of his own budget the difference between the cost of preparing and implementing his plan and the cost of preparing and implementing the plan prepared by the London borough council.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South has moved formally amendment No. 477. Amendment No. 412 stands in my name, and amendment No. 125 stands in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst who, as we now have cause to know, is not present. I am not going to propose his amendment or speak to it but, happily, it echoes the one that I have tabled.
<P>
My preoccupation in tabling amendment No. 412 was to provide a paving amendment to matters such as waste management, which we shall come to later. The Bill will enable the mayor to intervene in the affairs of a local authority or instruct it to perform in some way or other without the mayor and his administration being responsible for the costs that the local authority subsequently incurs. There would be a risk of gesture politics that would have to be paid for by someone else. My amendment is intended to make the same point in a slightly different way in the context of the contingency, which may arise under clause 128, of the mayor stepping in to carry out the plan himself. It is in line with my earlier remarks about economy, which are constantly preached by Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall be brief. The amendments relate to the costs of preparing a local implementation plan. They vary in the ways in which they approach the problem. The most foolish is amendment No. 125, which was tabled by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. I regret that he is not in the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Armed with my piece of paper, I must speak on my right hon. Friend's behalf. There is no way in which folly could ever cross his lips.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Folly may not cross his lips, but it certainly crosses his amendment. It would provide a direct incentive to the indolent and the incompetent by ensuring that an authority that fails to produce a local implementation plan would receive a financial reward for that failure. I cannot believe that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, who has talked about encouraging efficiency and economy, could want to be associated with such a provision.
<P>
We envisage the mayor using his or her power to produce a local implementation plan only as a last resort. Nevertheless, it is a power that he or she must have if the strategy is to be delivered. The mayor must, of course, use the power reasonably, in common with any other power that the Bill provides. However, it is not appropriate to stipulate preconditions on the exercise of that power in any more precise detail. We are not, therefore, prepared to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I confess that I am not fully persuaded by the Minister's arguments. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 478, in page 67, line 4, leave out from "above" to end of line 6.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 484, in page 67, leave out lines 8 and 9 and insert_
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) refuses under section 127 to approve a local implementation plan submitted under subsection (3) above, and".
<P>
No. 479, in page 67, leave out lines 10 and 11.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Subsections (3) and (4) give the mayor the power to prepare a local implementation plan himself without first giving the borough the opportunity to submit a new local implementation plan that complies with his wishes. The amendments would remove that power and require the mayor to allow councils a chance to get their plan right, in the light of the mayor's objections, before he steps in. The preparation of a plan by the mayor should be a last resort.
<P>
Councils are closer to the local people who will be affected, and are more knowledgeable about local circumstances. They are better able to ensure that the local implementation plan interfaces with the other policies and functions of the council. Councils should, therefore, always have an opportunity to rectify any inadequacies before the mayor marches in.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> In essence, the amendments would restrict the mayor's options if he or she refused to approve the original local implementation plan produced by a borough council.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 478 and 484 would mean that a council must be allowed two attempts at producing a local implementation plan before the mayor could intervene and prepare a plan on the council's behalf. It would not be appropriate to restrict the mayor's options in that way. It should be up to the mayor to decide whether to give a council more than one chance to produce an acceptable LIP, but the mayor should not have to give a council two chances. A borough's initial attempt may be far short of what is required, and the mayor should be free to decide that it would be better, and quicker, for him or her to step in and prepare the plan instead.
<P>
We expect the boroughs and the mayor to develop a co-operative relationship. Preparation of local implementation plans could and should be part of that relationship. But the mayor must have real power in reserve if for any reason a borough does not produce a plan worthy of approval or of contributing to the implementation of the mayor's transport strategy.
<P>
We do not believe that the mayor's power should be watered down as suggested by the amendment, and I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister has not given me any good reason to withdraw the amendment, except to say that she does not agree with it. Nevertheless, I will not detain the Committee further. I note her comments and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 471, in page 68, line 2, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or is likely to fail,".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may consider amendment No. 472, in page 68, line 5, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or is likely to fail,".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In the implementation of the plans by the mayor there is a presumption that the mayor will assume failure of a local authority plan. The amendments would reverse that presumption to leave the possibility of failure rather than a presumption of failure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I should like to reinforce the argument made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. It would be wrong to anticipate failure. The purpose of the amendment is, as I understand it, to remove the "likely to fail" category. It can reasonably be argued that the mayor can exercise a power on behalf of the council if it has failed to implement a proposal_that is a clear and unarguable dereliction of duty. As the hon. Gentleman argued, the words "likely to fail" make a presumption that may be unreasonable and is incapable of definition. How do we define "likely to fail"? At what moment before the 12th hour do we make that judgment?
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would justify that, or, if not, be willing to consider what appears to us to be a perfectly reasonable proposal.

<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The amendments are an attempt to reduce the mayor's right to implement his or her own transport strategy in co-operation with the boroughs. I am not clear why we should attempt to restrict the mayor in that way. We are not talking about rocket science; we are not talking about making plans that are totally foreign and unusual to boroughs. In the main, they have been expected to make such plans year on year; they will soon be expected to produce some plans that will run for much longer than that.
<P>
It is therefore possible to spot long in advance whether any or all of the proposals in a plan will be implemented satisfactorily and to time. It is vital for the success of our proposals that the mayor and the councils keep in touch on the progress of local implementation plans. If the council is clearly going to fail, we do not think it helpful or productive that the mayor be forced to wait until the council has failed before taking any action. That is a recipe for delay and unnecessary expense.
<P>
Local authorities will soon be expected to implement plans that will run for two, three or possibly four years_they will have long timetables. If the mayor has to wait until the end of a timetable of two years, for example, the proposals would of necessity be delayed by four years. This is the recipe for inefficiency. By the time the council has failed to implement some proposals, it may be too late to salvage them. An earlier intervention may have saved them.
<P>
I trust that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the light of my remarks.
<P>
8.15 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Again, the Minister makes little effort to explain her Opposition to the amendments other than simply to say that she opposes them. I shall not seek to divide the Committee, but I note the Minister's opposition. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 488, in page 69, line 14, leave out second "and".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 489, in page 69, line 15, at end insert_
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(d) in order to advise the Mayor generally on transport issues: and
<P>
(e) for the purposes of promoting the use of the River Thames for the carriage of passengers and goods.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We have now reached chapter II of part IV, and the constitution of Transport for London. The amendments would expand the functions of Transport for London to include a request for the mayor to be advised generally on transport issues. The proposals follow the White Paper's references to the use of the River Thames in relation to Transport for London.
<P>
I am sure that we all agree that the Thames is an under_used asset in the capital. There are many good ideas for the river, but not many of them make money and most go bust or need a subsidy. Nevertheless, the Opposition believe that the Bill should promote the river, which explains the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief. I am conscious of the forthcoming involvement of Transport for London in matters relating to the river. Earlier today, the Minister picked up my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South for not including the river and those who work on it on a proposed list of people who need to be consulted. In so doing, he indicated the importance that the Government attach to the river.
<P>
Although my hon. Friend was somewhat discouraging about the effectiveness of people who currently use the river for tourism and for passenger traffic, such people have significant apprehensions about what the transport authority may be planning. I am conscious that regulations, instructions or ideas are to be communicated to people who operate on the river in the near future, for application from 1 April in contractual terms. I detect significant apprehension about the possibility of a public intervention in matters currently decided by private practice. Such practice has been encouraged to make substantial investment, and it now looks as if the Government may interfere with it.
<P>
I am conscious of the Government's problems in securing transport for Greenwich in the year of the dome. It would be singularly unfortunate, however, if able entrepreneurs who know a lot about the subject_I am thinking especially of the French expertise that has been brought to the river_are discouraged or deterred by the Government's actions. I mention the matter for paving purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> As a riverside member of Parliament, I assure the Committee that the matter is very important for hon. Members who have worked along the river and who represent riverside constituencies. I want to spend a moment or two flagging it up. I think that the amendment, which we welcome, might be our only opportunity to raise some of the river issues.
<P>
I hope that the Government can respond positively to amendment No. 489, which is the substantive amendment. It has two arms, both of which we support, but I want to focus on the second. I urge Ministers to accept at least the principle of including a provision promoting the River Thames for the carriage of passengers and goods, although I am happy for them to say that there is a better place for it in the Bill.
<P>
Following on from where the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster left off, how far have the Government got in including river transport in the integrated ticketing system? That was something to which Steve Norris was committed when he was Minister for Transport in London. He tried hard to make progress with river ticketing, but found the resistance of some of the officials very frustrating. He was not helped by the fact that those commercial ventures that started to run commuter traffic along the river in the 1990s sequentially failed. They failed for commercial reasons, not through the fault of the Government._ [Interruption
.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Several simultaneous undercurrents of conversation are causing too much distraction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> One company failed because of very poor marketing. It started the service but was surprised when so few people used it. The reason was poor information. The same company and another then failed because of poor reliability. If commuters are going to use such systems, it is no good them turning up on Greenland pier for the 7.50 am boat, only for it to arrive at 8.20 am.
<P>
A third reason for the failure of such schemes was_arguably_overpricing, although no one would expect a river boat service to charge Woolwich ferry_type prices; that is, to be free. Some people who work in London came to live in housing along the river because of the prospect of river transport. I could 613 614 
<P>
produce prospectuses that were used to sell houses and flats in my constituency on the basis that they would be near a pier from which people could commute to Westminster, Charing Cross, Lambeth and so on.
<P>
I attribute no blame to the companies that tried and failed, but we need to learn from their experience. The Metropolitan police and the river police have learnt about the sort of craft that work, as opposed to those that did not. There has been much technological innovation. The Metropolitan police now use a very good Finnish boat which moves much more quickly and produces much less wash.
<P>
Some people have now grasped the nettle, with the support of the Government. A company in my constituency, City Cruises, owns the large passenger vessel whose service the Queen inaugurated a couple of years ago. I welcome the fact that it has been commissioned by the Government to carry out some of the services for the millennium in Greenwich. It is a great tribute to the couple whose business it is and to all those who work for it, many of whom are my constituents. There is an issue about what will happen after 2000. The company is actively concerned to continue the service_having invested in four or five large new boats, it wants them to continue in passenger use.
<P>
Although river transport will never have a mass market or be a competitor in numbers with the buses, trains and tubes, I am persuaded that it is a complementary market. Tourists are not the only potential market; those who live near the river on both sides and workers will also create a market. The key is a reliable, regular and relatively low-priced service. The other factor is the availability of information on a vessel's whereabouts. That can be done with the same technology that is now being used for buses.
<P>
My first question to the Minister_I should be grateful for the best information she can give_is where we are in committing the Government to an integrated pricing system for river tickets. If it is not there yet, what can supporters of such a system do to help it along? The sooner it comes about, the better. My vision is that before the end of the Government's first term_
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Their first term?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> By the end of their first term_whether they get a second term is up to the electorate_I hope that they will have created a tube map with interchanges on the river, so that we will be able to see where it is possible to interchange between tube and water craft.
<P>
Secondly, there is certainly a strong case for the carriage of more freight and goods on the river. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster has already told us that he has resisted entering the debate about whether it is better to take waste by river or by road. Other than that mention of it, I shall also resist doing that; the Minister for Transport in London rightly said that that is a controversial issue.
<P>
At present, there is little freight use of the river. Some effective freight use is that which takes waste of various sorts by barge in a relatively environmentally sound way relatively long distances relatively quickly. I am convinced that there is scope for more of that, even though the river now, sadly, has fewer points of access than it might have.
<P>
Thirdly, there are opportunities that have not yet been taken to increase passenger transport. I do not want to try to trick the Minister into an answer now, but if the site of the Greater London authority building is the site in my constituency, as I hope that it is_having been to see the design, I am persuaded that with some amendment and good will on both sides, it could be a perfectly good and valid candidate_one thing that we could do with such a site, and with other public buildings, is to give it riverboard access. When I went to see the design in Battersea and examined it carefully, I suggested a way in which a dock could be constructed so that people could unload, as it were, from the river into a dock underneath the building. Such a system does not involve the slightly more complicated option of additional piers_on which by definition there must be a numerical limit_and can create docks to take people off the river.
<P>
Finally, if we get it right, there is the potential_I say this with some care, because all members of the Committee will be aware of the sensitivity of this issue_of overcoming the historical legacy of the tragedy of the Marchioness. That incident reflected some pretty poor river practice about 10 years ago_it happened 10 years ago this August_in navigation, vessels, crewing and so on.
<P>
A capital city service on a beautiful river with beautiful buildings alongside_whether short trips or long_haul trips right up to the boundaries of London in the west or the east_presents a huge opportunity. That is the best way to see the city, other than from the air. It is absolutely the most enjoyable way to see the city. I have always subscribed to the policies of the previous Government and this Government to ensure that we continue to add along the river buildings worthy of our capital city in the sites that remain.
<P>
We cannot enjoy that view in the way that the river allows by any other means. One can be a Wordsworth and stand on Waterloo bridge, but, to be honest, that is limited in its enjoyment.
<P>
I hope that Ministers are positive about what is a worthwhile probing amendment, and I hope that we end up making absolutely clear in the Bill the Government's commitment, which is extremely welcome, that river traffic will be included as one purpose and activity of Transport for London. Indeed, that commitment should be not just written into the Bill but woven into the fabric of London transport once the Bill is enacted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I wish to make only a brief point. I speak from some experienced on the matter, after a previous life as a solicitor for the Port of London Authority with involvement in legal matters relating to the piers.
<P>
The amendment may not be at the correct place in the Bill, but I welcome the opportunity for this debate. The matter raised by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster needs further consideration by Ministers. Investment in the piers is considerable. We 615 616 <P>
want to encourage competition on the river, especially for passengers_tourists and others. There is a problem, because the required investment is so large that regulations for passengers on the Thames may deter it. I am not sure whether the clause is the right place in the Bill to deal with the matter, but it needs careful consideration. Otherwise, past investment may be threatened and intentions to invest in tourism may be prejudiced.
<P>
8.30 pm
<P>
I should also like to flag up the issue of extending use of the river outside the core of central London. Although that market is more difficult in terms of demand, there is a need to integrate with other forms of transport to encourage greater use of the river on the east and west sides of London. That integration should involve passengers as well as freight, especially in the Rainham area in Havering, which adjoins my constituency and which has considerable potential.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I shall speak briefly, and address my remarks especially to amendment No.489. I echo the comments of my hon. Friends in arguing for use of the river Thames. I, too, represent a riverside constituency. Unfortunately, however, the Rivers Frays and Colne are not especially navigable.
<P>
This is one of the few Committees of which I have had the privilege of being a member in my brief time in the House, but I am beginning to get the hang of it. I feel that there is a chance that the Minister might take the amendment away and think about it, whether it is a probing or paving amendment. If we were lucky and that happened, I would also speak in favour of considering the canals.
<P>
The Grand Union canal runs through my constituency. In times past, it was a means of getting passengers from Uxbridge up to Paddington. There is an admirable public house called the Paddington Packet Boat. It is very close to another such establishment, which many Opposition Members may remember from hazy July days a few years ago_the Turning Point. I admit that the idea of taking commuters up to London by that means might not be appropriate for the exigencies of the modern world. If the Minister is considering the promotion of the river Thames as a means of carrying passengers and goods, however, she could also usefully consider the promotion of the Grand Union canal for freight.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I shall begin with the most recent contribution, which was made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall). He referred to the rivers in his constituency and to the Grand Union canal. I am sure that he is aware that the Government have made abundantly clear our wish to see a great deal more freight moved on our inland waterways. We shall change the requirements to ensure that our freight facilities grant, which could be used for that express purpose, can be tapped into for the inland waterways.
<P>
Carrying passengers on the canal would clearly be possible for Transport for London. There would need to be co-operation between the mayor_via Transport for London_and British Waterways. That would underline the strong objective that the Government have espoused since coming into office. I am talking not only about utilising the River Thames but about how we can more effectively use the vastly under-used resource of our inland waterways and canals. I say that not only because the hon. Member for Uxbridge referred to waterways not being suitable in many instances for moving freight, although many still are, but because they can be a major tourist attraction.
<P>
The points that my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) raised were matched by the opening remarks of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I was somewhat disturbed by both their contributions. I and my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister have had meetings with those who provide services on the River Thames_in many instances, they have done so for many generations. The remarks of my hon. Friend and the right hon. Gentleman lead me to believe that there is still concern on the part of the relevant families and, as the right hon. Gentleman said, of entrepreneurs. If that is the case and they perceive some form of discouragement, I will be happy to meet and reassure them. I will be happy to assure them that we would never countenance implementing our proposals for increasing the movement of people and freight on our River Thames by excluding or removing work from those who have earned their living on the River Thames for generations.
<P>
The major contributions to the debate have been on the amendment that deals with the River Thames. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made a sizable contribution. I am pleased that there is so much support in the Committee for what has been the Government's clear and strong objective since we came into office.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister introduced the Thames 2000 initiative and it is happening. My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster referred to the cost of piers. The Thames 2000 initiative was launched in July 1997 fundamentally to change the passenger service regime on the River Thames. There are three central elements. London Transport has formed a new subsidiary, London River Services, to own and manage piers on the Thames, to license services, and to promote and integrate river services into the capital's transport system.
<P>
All the piers that are the responsibility of the Port of London authority will transfer to LRS in the spring of this year. As part of the Thames 2000 initiative, a programme of pier construction has been undertaken, which is part-financed by a &#163;6.8 million grant from the Millennium Commission. The programme will produce new piers at Waterloo and Blackfriars and fund the complete replacement of existing piers at the Tower and at Westminster. That is being implemented by the cross-river partnership.
<P>
The new passenger services to which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred will be introduced and they will be licensed by LRS. There will be two services to the dome_the express service and the hopper service between the dome and Greenwich. The contracts have been tendered for, won and signed. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that new boats have been ordered. He referred to the company City Cruises, 617 618 
<P>
which is in his constituency. The other company, White Horse Ferries, is now in a position to implement its services. Central to our thinking was the fact that there should be a legacy from the services that will be provided on the river_specifically those to the dome. Again, that is something that we want to expand.
<P>
I am not entirely convinced by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey's remark that there will not be a major increase in the use of the river for passenger services. We have seen an increased growth in activities on both banks of the river_for example, the Globe theatre and the new gallery. Increasing numbers of hotels with a river frontage are seriously contemplating as part of their plans a pier with the provision of services.
<P>
Integrated ticketing is central to our thinking, and the relevant technology will undoubtedly come on stream in respect of the prestige programme. Ticketing will certainly be part of the mayor's strategy for integrating public transport in London. Increasing the simplicity of buying a ticket that will take one on to several modes_for instance, road, rail and river_is intrinsic to encouraging people to make more use of public transport for their journeys.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the use of information_he gave the example of tube maps_to highlight multi-modal points. Good information is central and essential. It should show us how we can most easily and successfully complete our journeys_not only from our front doors, but to our destinations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I was not suggesting that there will not be significant growth on the river. I agree with the Minister that there can be growth and that it is the Government's job, and that of the rest of us, to encourage it. I merely meant that in sheer passenger number terms, the river can never compete with trains, buses and tubes. However, there is great potential for growth, and I know that the Government acknowledge that.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, and I was not criticising him in that respect. The potential exists for evergreater development to regenerate both the north and south banks of the river. The river will have a major part to play in moving us not only across it but also from east to west.
<P>
As a further surety of the Government's commitment to the mayor's ability to make infinitely better use of the Thames as part of an integrated strategy, we placed a requirement early on in the Bill_in clause 33_for the mayor, in preparing, revising and implementing any strategy, to have regard to the desirability of promoting and encouraging the use of the River Thames especially in terms of passenger transport services and the transportation of freight. The clause requires that, as a part of the mayor's general duty, he or she will promote and encourage the use of the river in the formulation of all strategies, including those for transport, waste, spatial development and culture.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the terrible tragedy of the Marchioness. The very first word with regard to the mayor's transport strategy is "safe". The primacy of safety informs the Government's thinking and will inform that of the mayor.
<P>
The other amendment that was tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South seeks to alter the way in which Transport for London would exercise its functions. That is unnecessary. Transport for London is already required to exercise its functions in accordance with directions from the mayor, and the mayor's transport duty is to develop and implement policies for the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services. We envisage that the main bulk of TL's activities will be operational, but it would he remarkable if the mayor did not wish to seek its advice on matters connected with his or her duty. There is nothing to stop Transport for London offering advice or to stop the mayor requiring it to do so.
<P>
I have already touched on our commitment regarding the River Thames. In the light of what I have said, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I want to respond to the Minister's comments, because I appreciate the spirit in which she uttered them. Some members of the Committee have riparian constituencies. About three and a half miles of my constituency is upon the Thames, like those of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department.
<P>
It was in a way a pity that it did not fall to her to respond to the debate. When we get on to police courses, I am certain that we shall dwell on the fact that the river police existed 30 years before Sir Robert Peel's force did. I am not going to be diverted, Mr. O'Hara: I can see the apprehension in your face.
<P>
The Minister for Transport in London referred to conversations with those who have made their living on the Thames for generations. It is true that I have had contact with the master of the Watermen's Company, which falls into the category to which the hon. Lady referred, although not specifically on the subjects that we have debated this evening.
<P>
When I used the word "entrepreneur", I used it in the technical, French sense_well, it is a French word. It is the arrival of the French on the river which has made a significant difference. I am not devaluing the contribution referred to by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but the French contribution is highly professional. It is born of much experience, not only on the Seine in Paris, where French practice is widely admired, but in a series of other cities throughout the world. Their experience is well worth listening to.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Upminster for having reinforced our observations about the Port of London authority, which conducted the long-term contract negotiations with those who came on to the river. I am also very grateful to the hon. Lady for her kind offer. If any of those who work from piers in my constituency and three of the four to which she referred are in my constituency_I will take her up on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am glad that the importance of the river has been recognised on both sides of the Committee. This has been an excellent debate, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 783, in page 69, line 16, after "strategy", insert_
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A) Transport for London may, with the approval of the Mayor and Assembly, borrow money for investing in transport in Greater London."</font></ul>
<P>
The amendment would allow Transport for London to borrow money. We tabled it because it is not clear from the Bill, and it is implicit elsewhere, that Transport for London will not be able to do that, and will be dependent on the GLA for its money. My hon. Friends and I want to probe the proposition, with the strong presumption that the Government might accede to it.
<P>
This is not simply our view. Many representatives of business in London are in favour of this proposal. If, as the hon. Member for Brent, East apparently said last night over the road, and others have argued, the public of London assume that one of the GLA's most important functions_possibly the most important_is transport, the delivery of the sort of transport strategy that Londoners want will not be achievable without finance. That is self-evident. However, the resources are not available.
<P>
The Government have accepted that. The Prime Minister announced at last year's Labour party conference that the Bill will, for the first time in legislative history, allow two more forms of revenue to be raised. Road charging is one, and the charge for residential parking levies is the other. Liberal Democrat Members welcome those measures; we have argued for them all along.
<P>
 I shall restrict my comments in this debate. Depending on the reply to this debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) may want to join me in pressing Ministers further. We want to explore whether Transport for London will be able to borrow. If it is accepted that it will be set up as an agency of public transport with the independence to act commercially, it must have the power to borrow. It is no good setting up a commercial body that is defined as being separate from the GLA but which has a GLA link_I shall return to exactly what the interrelationship between them is in the stand part debate_without giving it the commercial opportunities that would allow it to invest in, for example, the river or land use.
<P>
Even more importantly, such a power is necessary because Government plans for the private-public partnership, however well intentioned, may fail, intentionally or otherwise. They may fall in whole or in part. The Government might think that they have a deal, but the partner could pull out or go bust. The Government might hand over to the Greater London authority an arrangement under which insufficient money comes in_the revenue stream could dry up.
<P>
One thing about which the Deputy Prime Minister was very clear on the Floor of the House_he was often questioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) about it_was how sure we are that the &#163;7 billion is real money and not just notional. In reality, the &#163;7 billion for the investment programme is not in the bank at the moment. It is aspirational and not real. In the world of finance, borrowing and commercial contracts, not everything is successful. Investments do not always go up; sometimes they go down. Of course the Government will be able secure a contract, if that is their intention_although we would wish that that was done by the GLA. Even so, that does not guarantee that all the money will come forward as expected.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I want to imagine for a moment that I am a City lender of money to good propositions and that the authority wants to borrow a significant amount for what seems like a good idea. What will be the ultimate covenant that the transport authority can give me as a lender? I would need to know that. At the most humble level, if I am a building society and I lend on a house, I have the security and the value of that house in the last resort. What kind of security would the transport authority be able to offer a lender?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If I may say so, that is a very good question. I hope that I can offer what I believe to be the answer. The debate is about ascertaining precisely that.
<P>
One of the securities is the sort of security that the hon. Gentleman and I and every other Committee member is required to offer if we negotiate a mortgage_a revenue security. One part of the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question will be the revenue streams from road charging and residential car park charging. The debate is the wrong way round in a way_we will discuss the relationship between the GLA and Transport for London later. However, I assume that a second security will be the capital that is currently owned by the state_that is, London Regional Transport_and which will be handed over to the Greater London authority when London Regional Transport is abolished by the enactment of the Bill. That might then be vested in Transport for London.
<P>
For example, if the Government carry out their plan as currently envisaged and keep in public ownership the rolling stock of the tube system, for instance, that could go to Transport for London and form the collateral or the security against which borrowing could happen. I hope that we will have that debate, although the Minister might be able to help us by giving some answers now. Our argument is that it is no good setting up something called Transport for London without giving it all the attributes of a commercial venture, with its own assets which it can invest, borrow against and use to increase its worth and its stock.
<P>
Finally, we will want to know that there is the right balance between the body's political_with a small "p"_direction and its commercial acumen. That is crucial. I do not think that any hon. Member in the Room would argue that the balance between operational, political and strategic decisions should not at the end of the day ensure that the enterprise is viable, but that involves a problem.
<P>
Ministers may make an important announcement tonight, but it appears from everything that the Committee has heard so far that there is no guarantee that 621 622 
<P>
the taxpayers' public subsidy for Transport in London will continue at the current level after the creation of the GLA. The hon. Member for Croydon, South has often made that point on the Floor of the House. I am not an expert, but I understand that all major western capital cities use a significant amount of taxpayers' subsidy towards their operations.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> The hon. Gentleman failed to mention what I believe to be the four most important words: public sector borrowing requirement. Does he accept that his proposals_I go along with his wishes, at least_will not change the fact that the Government will refuse him simply because of that requirement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman takes us one step further on and I hope to be able to answer his question. it is right to deal with it now to open the debate up to its final extent.
<P>
First, the Minister outlined the Government's present position on continuing to subsidise Transport for London at the level currently enjoyed by London Transport. That issue is hugely important. If the public-private partnership is to replace the subsidy and the Government do not intend to continue it, I have to say to Londoners that we could be in big trouble_we will have to appreciate that. I do not think it likely that we can provide a London transport system that achieves the things that we want_expansion in bus numbers, renewal of the tube infrastructure, more rolling stock for the railways, improvement in signalling and all the other things_without continuing the public subsidy. The rest of the country has always allowed London and some other cities to enjoy such benefits because it is in the interests of the whole nation that the capital city and the major conurbations have transport systems that work properly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) spoke about the public sector borrowing requirement. There are two possible responses. The Bill continues the Treasury's current grasp on the requirement through the Secretary of State, who will operate as a sort of sibling of the Chancellor of the Exchequer but will be tied by the same family loyalties to the Treasury rules. My hon. Friends and I have long argued that the Treasury should be freed from its old approach to public sector borrowing requirements. We believe that certain things should be allowed to escape from the regime under which everything has to count against the public sector borrowing requirement. I understand that general economic practice has to some extent moved away from old constraints and views about the tightness of that discipline. Of course, we have to work out how much the nation spends, but how much of that is public and how much is not is an interesting question.
<P>
Secondly, if the public-private partnership approach is, as I remember the Deputy Prime Minister saying, freed from the old constraints as a way of raising money, the Government will have got half way there. We do not reject in principle the public-private approach across the public sector and enterprise, although we do not propose it for the London transport system. We need to know to what extent the Government's plans will be free of the public sector borrowing requirement Treasury rules. It is important to have answers. We shall come to public-private partnerships in a separate debate.
<P>
There are potentially three major restraints on Transport for London. The greatest is the public sector borrowing requirement, a national macro-economic constraint. The second may be the constraints of Government not providing taxpayers' subsidies and the third may be the fact that TfL is not allowed to borrow. We seek reassurance on each of those potential restraints that there is the power to borrow and that there will be continuing investment.
<P>
Lastly, we would like a reassurance that the hand of the Treasury will not say, "Whatever you think down there, you will not be allowed your own way." I hope that the amendment can open up the debate and give us some fair answers. The Minister would make herself hugely popular if she could confirm_

<P>

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I thought that the Minister already was hugely popular.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Lady would be even more popular if she could be a combination of Transport Minister for London and Treasury sibling bountiful, which I am sure she would wish to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We are grateful to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for moving the amendment. It paves the way for a number of amendments later in the Bill. There is no harm in cantering round the course as a preliminary measure.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: One can borrow only against a revenue stream and, apart from the fare income from London Underground, the revenue streams envisaged by the Bill are road pricing and non_residential parking revenues. We shall come to the merits of those shortly, but as the Bill stands there is no guarantee that those streams will be available to the mayor.
<P>
We are all aware of the wording that says that the Treasury can get its mits on the money_ [Interruption.] The Minister disagrees. I am delighted. I have not seen an amendment to take up that point, although I may have missed it. [Interruption.] We are talking about borrowing and one can borrow only against a revenue stream. At the moment there may not be a revenue stream, and that is the relevance of my argument. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Ministers have all said that the Bill will be amended accordingly, but it has not been as yet.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The amendment has not yet been laid.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If there are to be interventions, they should be from a standing position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister says that the amendment has not been laid. The Government have been talking about it for several months. We could all write it out in a few minutes. If there is a problem I will tell them where the Table Office is. It simply needs to be done. There is talk of 10 years or is it a permanent revenue stream, in which case what happens after 10 years? In the absence 623 624 <P>
of a guaranteed revenue stream there are only two things one can do with the revenue: one can either subsidise or privatise. We are talking about public private partnerships but again that seems to be integrated into the road pricing or non-residential parking revenues which we will come to later. Nevertheless the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has done us a favour in moving the amendment at this point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I am rather concerned whenever the subject of borrowing is raised. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, there is always the chance of these things going wrong. It is interesting that the Liberals should appear rather like the literary Borrowers, the race of small people who live in a fictional world. However, my concern for my constituents would be who would pay if things go wrong. I am afraid that it would be the people of London. I cannot support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall touch briefly on the remarks of the hon. Member for Croydon, South. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made the position clear in the Chamber and on more than one occasion on Second Reading I gave a clear commitment on the issue of hypothecation from revenues raised via congestion charging and the private non-residential levy. I have had occasion to give the same commitments here on 100 per cent. of revenues raised being used for transport in London and that any programme would be reviewed after 10 years and that such schemes would be guaranteed to run for at least 10 years. As for the aspersions that the hon. Gentleman cast on both my honesty and that of my hon. Friend the Minister for London and indeed, the honesty of our right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister: I did not expect a great deal of the hon. Gentleman certainly better than that.
<P>
I turn now to the specific points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I am going to be highly unpopular with him. He was somewhat lyrical on occasions in speaking. He was specifically and exclusively about the power of Transport for London to borrow money, but the Bill already confers that power on Transport for London.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey should turn to section 39 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989_[Interruption.] The hon. Gentleman knows where the Library is. That section applies to the local authorities referred to in subsection(1). Clause 95(2) makes Transport for London and other functional bodies local authorities for the purpose of part IV of the Act. Section 43 of the 1989 Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as part of the proper management of their affairs, a local authority may borrow money for any purpose relevant to their functions".</ul></font>
<P>
That borrowing is regulated by part IV.
<P>
I should also like to touch on the points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about support for Transport for London, which we currently envisage will be wholly through revenue grants. However, I repeat yet again that it will have borrowing powers. It could also be issued with credit approvals allowing it to make capital expenditure funded by borrowing, but the case for doing so would have to be examined on the merits of the particular project, bearing in mind that local authority spending funded by borrowing counts as public expenditure. We have thus come round full circle to the points made by the hon. Members for Chipping Barnet and for Uxbridge about borrowing requirements for public spending.
<P>
<B>Mr.Hughes:</B> The Minister has the benefit of cross- referencing. She says that the Bill makes provision for Transport for London in relation to existing legislation. I do not doubt her and apologise if I missed it, but can she direct us to the relevant clause? Will she also tell us whether two provisions that apply to local authorities in other legislation will apply here. I will refer to the capping regime of the day under her administration, and short-term rather than unlimited borrowing. If those are the two restraints, the power to borrow may not be as significant_and certainly not as free an option_as Transport for London, and indeed Londoners, may want.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> On the first question, the relevant provision is clause 95(2). On the second, we have made it abundantly clear that the maintenance of prudent, stable debt ratios is essential to the Government's overall fiscal strategy. That means that public expenditure must be regulated. The GLA must be brought within the normal capital finance system applying to all other local authorities. There cannot be a separate system or special treatment for the GLA or the functional body.
<P>
Local authorities' capital investment, funded by borrowing, still scores as public expenditure, even if a project generates sufficient revenues to cover the borrowing. There is a good case for examining a private finance initiative option when a project seems likely to be self-financing. Provided that there is sufficient risk transfer to the private sector, such a deal would be outside the capital control and therefore would have no impact on the authority's capital resources. Continuing revenues from the project would meet contractors' charges and no Government approval or assistance would be needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understood exactly what the Minister said. However, when the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions was in opposition as a shadow transport Minister, he regarded the ability to borrow outwith the restraints of the PSBR as an important policy. Now that he is in government, he wishes to deliver that policy.
<P>
The Minister said that such policy might apply in transport areas that are not, technically, local government. Transport for London will be a function of local government, but it will not have the benefits of borrowing opportunities that will be given to other transport areas.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I should be interested to know what other borrowing transport facilities are allowed to borrow outwith the overriding national strategy on the PSBR.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister answered that question in her previous contribution. A degree of risk that is more than that in the private sector falls outside_
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): My hon. Friend just said that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is my point. If Transport for London borrowed in the same way, why cannot it be liberated too? 
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> As I have said repeatedly, we do not perceive that a special case can be made for the GLA and its functional bodies that is outside the requirements that apply to other local authorities.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has a tendency to discount and disregard the Government's major breakthrough in raising a revenue stream that will be directed exclusively to transport in London. The revenue raised from congestion charging and a private non-residential parking levy will be specifically and exclusively hypothecated to that system.
<P>
In light of that, and the points that I have made, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not think that there is misunderstanding between us, but there is a difference of view. Our view is that the GLA will take over a nationalised industry and will be running the equivalent to what is a railway system in the rest of the country. Therefore, the GLA should not be treated like other local authorities, because such authorities do not run railway, tube, boat and bus systems. Transport authorities run such systems.
<P>
A new form of local government will be created. We do not want the GLA to be a local council. Originally, the Government held the same view, but now they say that it must be a local council. That is unacceptable. The hon. Member for Uxbridge does not want borrowing because he does not want anything to go wrong or redound for his constituents. Clause 95 contains a reference to a borrowing facility, but it is so cabin-cribbed and confined by the other restraints, that when it comes to the crunch, the GLA will not be able to have all the borrowing ability that it needs, and Transport for London may not either.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> This is an important clause. I wish to explore its crucial core element_namely, the relationship between TfL and the Greater London Authority. I quote from a briefing from the Association of London Government that was prepared not for us on these Benches exclusively but was sent to all hon. Members. It reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The establishment of TfL as an independent body raises issues of accountability. The ALG has argued that TfL should have powers devolved to it by the Mayor (rather than possess them in its own right) which would make it easier to hold it to account.
<P>
There could be problems were TfL not to follow the Mayor's strategy, particularly on detailed decisions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that that goes back the days of the GLC's transport policy. The briefing continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This could lead to a repetition of problems experienced by the GLC in trying to introduce Travel Cards in the face of reluctance from London Transport. This could also come about as a result of conflicting expenditure priorities between maintaining the existing infrastructure, expanding services or implementing a new charging strategy.
<P>
The method of solving disputes between TfL and Boroughs needs to be clarified. The Mayor acting as Chair of TfL and as arbitrator would appear to be a conflict of interest."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall come later to the composition of TfL in terms of people and how they get there. We have views about that too.
<P>
It concerns us that the Government still have not got right the differentiation between the general strategic responsibilities of the GLA and the independence of the TfL agency, which is the agency of the GLA. My hon. Friends will return to this later in another context, but I ask the Minister the following question. If, for example, Transport for London wanted to resist a GLA view about introducing free travelcards for a group that does not currently have them, or if, for example, TfL wanted to resist the GLA's view about freezing fares, who would have the ultimate say? Would TfL be able to say, "No, that is not something that we are going to do"? There will at most be one person from the Greater London authority on TfL according to Government plans and that is the mayor. Where, in the end, does the power lie? That is a core question about the power of the GLA, and I hope that members of the Committee will form their view on whether the Government are trying to resolve that most important matter on the basis of the Minister's answer.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am beginning to doubt the value of publishing explanatory notes. I shall read out paragraph 232 of the explanatory notes on the Greater London Authority Bill, which is headed "Clause 132: Transport for London". It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Clause 132 establishes Transport for London . . . as a statutory corporate body and requires it to exercise its functions in accordance with guidance or directions given by the Mayor and in order to facilitate the general duty of the authority, and to implement the transport strategy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The transport strategy will be devised by the mayor. Transport for London has no reason for existing other than to implement the mayoral strategy. I must say to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that I find it unutterably bewildering that there is any doubt that TfL is answerable only to the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Surely the Government have considered the alarming prospect that a Liberal could be elected mayor. He or she would chair Transport for London and might have different policies although sharing those responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I have to say to my hon. Friend that his generosity in his fantasy scenarios is admirable.
<P>
I return to the core of the clause, about which there could have been no doubt until the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey showed yet again that he had failed to read in the Bill's significant clauses that Transport for London will exist only as a functionary body for implementing the mayor's strategies and duties. In the light of my explanation, I trust that hon. Members will vote for clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have read the explanatory notes more than once and I understand every word; but the Minister has not answered my questions. If she can tell us that the mayor and the assembly take the view that there should be travelcards_
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> If the mayor takes the view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If the mayor takes the view that travelcards should be extended to six different categories, or if the mayor believes that there should be a freeze on fares for a year, three years or six years, is there a guarantee that Transport for London could not oppose or prevent the implementation of any strategy devised by the mayor?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> If the mayor decides that he or she wishes to extend the use of travelcards which, given their popularity is entirely possible, that is what will happen. On the issue of whether the mayor wishes to freeze fares, if the mayor has the money so to do, that will be his strategy. I have to say to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that it is absurd to believe that Transport for London will be able to oppose the only person who has the power given under the Bill and by a mandate from the people of London for the implementation of strategies and duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall have one more round if I may. The reason why there could be a conflict_the Minister alluded to it_is that the mayor may believe that a fares freeze would be affordable, while Transport for London may disagree because it has other commitments. If such a dispute arose, and the mayor could say, "I'm sorry but whatever commercial advice Ministers take, I am the mayor and my strategy includes a fare freeze", I would welcome that. It would constitute progress and greater power to the politicians_we may disagree about who they should be_than they enjoyed under the GLC.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> We had lengthy debates in Committee on the need for the mayor to publish a budget. If a serious conflict of interest arises, the power rests with the mayor, and I would expect those who were uncomfortable, incapable or unwilling to implement the mayoral strategy for which the Bill provides to be afforded the opportunity to resign. I trust that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's questions and that clause 132 will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister has answered the question. That is reassuring because although we disagree about which politicians should have all the power, the sort of events that happened before the abolition of the GLC will not recur. I am grateful for the Minister's reply.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 132 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transport for London</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 162, line 15, after "Subject" insert "to sub-paragraph (IA) and"
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 82, in page 162, line 17, at end insert_
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) Any appointment made under sub-paragraph (1) above shall be subject to the approval of the Assembly by a simple majority."<P>

<P>
No. 779, in page 163, line 1, after "Mayor", inset
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", subject to the approval of the Assembly by a simple majority.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The amendment would ensure that all appointees to Transport for London were not only nominated by the mayor, for which the Bill provides, but approved by a majority vote of the assembly. That is a perfectly proper approach. The President of the United States nominates his Cabinet or the judges for the Supreme Court, but they take office only when they have undergone a scrutiny process. Those who implement the transport strategy should undergo a similar approval process. If members of the assembly, as the watchdogs of the public interest, believe, for a good reason, that a nominee is unsuitable, they should be allowed to vote against the appointment. That is the purport of amendments Nos. 81 and 82.
<P>
In our previous debate, the hon. Member for Brent, East said that anyone who resisted the mayor's policy and did not resign would be sacked. To prevent victimisation, the assembly should play a role in removal as well as appointment. Amendment No. 779 would grant the assembly the power by simple majority to agree to or dissent from a proposal to sack a member of TfL.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I think that I can comfort anyone who is worried about the GLA's efficiency except the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. We shall not accept the amendments because they would confuse the line of accountability. My hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London made it crystal clear that the mayor is accountable to the people of London and that Transport for London is the executive that is answerable to the mayor. Therefore, the mayor will make the appointments. If the amendment were accepted, accountability would be diluted, there would be no clarity or certainty, the mayor would be subject to the whims of the assembly, and the mayor's appointees might or might not be accepted. That is a recipe for confusion, a lack of clarity and a lack of accountability.
<P>
9.30 pm
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will by now fully understand why we do not for one moment accept his amendments. Let me give him one clear reassurance_I would not want him to misinterpret this clause as well. We are requiring all appointments to Transport for London to he made on the basis of merit; the Nolan principles will apply. It is not a question of the mayor appointing friends or cronies; appointments will be made by the mayor on basic principles of merit and with a proper framework for independent evaluation of candidates as part of the appointment process. That will ensure clarity of accountability, that appointments are made on merit, and that Transport for London can do the job that it is set up to do_to carry out the mayor's strategies and ensure that his policies are put into effect.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am reassured by the Minister's last comments. I assumed that that is what he would say, so I am glad about that. We are not reassured by his first comments, but we assumed that that is what he would say about that matter, so that came as no surprise.
<P>
The Committee knows, and it is known more widely, that in different guises we have a different view from the Government about whether the assembly should have a bit of power or not much power at all. By the end of the GLA's first term, if the members of the assembly do not go back to the people of London to say that there needs to be a change in the balance, I will be hugely surprised. We will get effective London government when we share it between mayor and assembly, not when we concentrate power.
<P>
If we really want good people to scrutinise the mayor, we must give them some power to act, not only to contribute to a consultative process. However, as we did not expect to win this argument, having anticipated the Minister's position, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
"and those who use passenger and freight transport facilities and services".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Brooke:</B> There are rumours_I will say no more than that_that the Government want our proceedings to accelerate. I simply observe that we were reminded this morning by Mr. Winterton that we had 80 clauses to cover in the next nine sittings. If we are to cover the best part of half of them in this sitting and this morning's, we will have accelerated enormously. God knows what my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst would say were he here, although happily none of the immediately forthcoming clauses attract amendments tabled by him. I speak only for myself, but those of us, especially from the Back Benches, who have tabled amendments should continue to move them, and so I shall.
<P>
The amendments relate to the membership of Transport for London. Amendment No. 406 would place an obligation on the mayor. Amendment. No. 407 singles out the transport needs of business_rather than the impact of transport on business_to ensure that TfL has specific and relevant skills. Amendment No. 409 refers to membership for those who use passenger and freight transport facilities and services. Essentially, what I am asking is that we should have as members of Transport for London people with specific business experience in the area of freight and transport.
<P>
My remaining amendment, No. 408, although perfectly properly grouped with the others because it also relates to the membership of Transport for London, is in fact separate, and refers to economic regeneration and property development. That is a saga that dates back to Lord Beeching, who recruited Mr. Philip Shirley of Unilever to the board of British Rail in the early 1960s with the intent that the real estate of British Rail should be exploited. Since then, we have had a series of major schemes, such as those at Victoria station, Broadgate and Blackfriars. I am happy to say that the remarkable alphabetical list of all the stations to which one can go from Blackfriars was preserved, although it was taken inside rather than being put at the main gateway. If you have never visited Blackfriars station, Mr. O'Hara, I should say that the list enables one to know that, if one does not want to visit Berlin, one can visit Bexley instead, which follows immediately afterwards in the alphabetical list. The great Sir John Betjeman once presented himself at the guichet in the days before the fall of the wall in East Germany and the dmarche in Russia and asked for a cheap day return to St. Petersburg, when it was still called Leningrad.
<P>
Railtrack have a massive opportunity as regards former British Rail properties. There is necessarily a read-across into Transport for London strategy. It is, therefore, highly desirable that that expertise should be available to the membership of Transport for London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to raise a concern about the membership of the board of Transport for London, particulariy in respect of paragraph 2(3). At the end of a list of provisions that runs from (a) to (e), that paragraph refers to the desirability of including in the membership a person with knowledge of accessibility issues as they relate to "persons with mobility problems". It is entirely appropriate to take such questions into account when considering the membership. The definition is, however, rather narrow in relation to the issues that affect disabled people who may want to use transport facilities in Greater London. Mobility issues are not the only ones that are relevant or of concern to disabled people in that regard.
<P>
Several organisations outside this place have raised the issue of whether one person can properly represent the very diverse views, needs and interests of disabled people. Not least among those is Age Concern. In that respect, I would be interested to hear whether there is scope in the Bill to ensure that we have someone who deals not only with concerns about mobility but with the concerns of people with visual impairments, hearing impairments and so on. Such issues are also highly germane to the discharge of the responsibilities of the mayor and of Transport for London. In that respect, the amendments raise serious questions about the composition of TfL.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the issue. Although it may not be considered the most important, but as it has provoked an on-going extensive discussion between Ministers, I hope that they will respond in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that I will be able to persuade the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster to withdraw his amendment because it is genuinely not necessary.
<P>
Paragraph 2 of schedule 8 contains the list of characteristics to which the mayor should have regard in determining who should be appointed to Transport for London.
<P>
<H5>9.39 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>9.54 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming_
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was explaining that the provisions of schedule 8 indicate some of the characteristics to which the mayor is expected to have regard when considering the appointment of members of Transport for London. Those characteristics are fairly obvious. They include experience of transport, in particular the impact of transport on business and the environment; experience of finance and commerce; experience of national and local government; experience of the management of organisations; and experience of the organisation of trade unions or matters relating to workers. There is a further reference to experience of representing the interests of women and of persons requiring transport which is accessible to those with mobility problems.
<P>
Having indicated those broad criteria, it is right that the choice should remain with the mayor. We do not, therefore, support the idea of too prescriptive a set of terms of reference. We believe that the mayor should make appointments on merit and choose the best people for the job. We do not want unduly to restrain the mayor's ability to do that. If the mayor has two candidates, one who is clearly better qualified, and one who has more of the experience listed in schedule 8, the mayor must be free to decide on the better qualified candidate if he or she so chooses.
<P>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman recognises that this is an appropriate balance to ensure that the composition of Transport for London is suitably representative but is ultimately made up of people of the right quality to do the job.
<P>
The schedule provides for persons who are experienced in the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"impact of transport on business"<P>
<P>
and amendment No. 407 refers to people who are experienced regarding the "transport needs of business". I am not really into detailed textual analysis. There may be differences in those two forms of wording, but I suspect that that will take us into the rather more obscure areas of semantics, which I do not wish to enter into this evening.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If there were a competition with a jury, it would be easier for me to explain my wording than it would be for the Minister to explain his.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall reply by saying only that it is difficult to see how someone with experience of the impact of transport on business would not know about the transport needs of business. However, I shall take it no further than that. Nor will I explore the interesting circumstances that led Sir John Betjeman to seek a cheap day return to St. Petersburg.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I do not wish to return to Sir John Betjeman, great man though he was. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] The Minister seems to be including economic regeneration and property development, which I cited as important areas of activity in terms of transport service. The schedule refers to transport on the one hand, and finance and commerce on the other. They seem fairly broad categories for a very specific expertise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I take the right hon. Gentleman's point, but remind him that this is being set up as part of a structure that will also contain a development agency which will focus specifically on skills in relation to regeneration, urban development, property development and associated matters. The structure that we are devising will require all the strategies to be developed so that they are consistent with each other. Obviously, the mayor will want to ensure that the expertise available through the London development agency_which we shall debate at a future date_will cross-fertilise with the expertise available through Transport for London. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman's anxieties on that score are set at rest.
<P>
I have to tell the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that I do not envisage a situation in which someone with experience of the transport needs of people with mobility problems, who is concerned about accessibility, will not do the job that the hon. Gentleman was talking about. I am sure that Liberal Democrat Members could devise all sorts of different categories of people who should be included on the list, but we have given a clear indication that we want someone to be appointed who has expertise in the area. I have no doubt that other members of Transport for London will also want to do their best for people with disabilities. The idea that only someone who is specifically qualified in this area is capable of looking after the interests of people with disabilities is ludicrous.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I must point out that the Minister is extending my point to exaggeration. It is a little unfair to suggest that I was implying that other members would not be able properly to represent the interests and views of disabled people. I hope that the Minister accepts that the Bill's wording ought at least to have been tested tonight. I accept the points that the Minister made, but there was no need to make them in those terms.
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Rather than welcoming what ought to have been a pretty clear indication that we attached importance to this issue, the hon. Gentleman's speech laid him open, I am afraid, to the response that I gave a moment ago. I shall say no more on that, but I hope that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will see fit to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the manner in which he responded_he did it in his usual style, which is always likely to win friends.
<P>
All three of the station developments to which I referred are in my constituency, but I was not seeking simply to make a constituency speech. As the Minister knows, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. We will know in 10 years' time whether anything comparable to Broadgate has been developed from London Transport sites. I shall make certain that I have a word with the Minister about this group of amendments in 10 years' time; in the meantime, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 162, leave out line 34.
<P>
This simple amendment would omit line 34 on page 162. I sort of know what the Minister is going to say, but he_or whoever replies_ought to reflect on the matter a bit.
<P>
An assembly member ought to be able to be on Transport for London. In the document "Home Rule for London", which the Liberal Democrats submitted to the Government in response to the Green Paper, We set out our preferred structure for that body. I mention the existence of that document so that students of these things can obtain a copy and read it. It is a good read and cheap at double the price.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> Cheap and nasty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is certainly not nasty, but good value as always. The one thing we argued for was that Transport for London or the equivalent agency should be chaired by an assembly member. The Minister will say that that would confuse accountability, but we would argue that although transport will of course be a central job of the mayor, there is a real danger that if the mayor and the mayor alone can be on Transport for London, he or she may be obliged constantly to concentrate on transport matters in detail, even when other London matters ought to be a priority. For example, if the Government's proposed structure was in place in the next two weeks, the mayor might regard his or her principal responsibility for several weeks as dealing with policing matters in London. It might therefore be entirely inappropriate for the mayor to have to go on sitting in Transport for London meetings dealing with the budget, public-private partnerships and so on.
<P>
There is a strong case for the Government to reconsider their obsessive view that the mayor can do everything, while no one from the assembly can do anything. Even at this stage in their thinking, will the Government consider allowing an assembly member to chair or be a member of Transport for London instead of the mayor? I even offer Ministers a compromise: it could be an assembly member chosen by the mayor. At least let us have some shared power, not only retained power.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Once again, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that we were obsessed with the strength and power of the mayor. If we did not know at the beginning, we certainly know now that Liberal Democrat Members are obsessed with the power of the assembly. They return at every possible opportunity to the idea of giving assembly members more power. Amendment No. 76 is unacceptable. Transport for London's role is essentially executive. It will be a tightly focused organisation that is directly responsible to the mayor for the implementation of his or her strategy. As we stated in the White Paper,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Transport for London's board will not include elected political representatives, whether local or national. It will be the role of the Mayor to provide political and strategic direction."</UL></FONT>
<P>
The assembly's role will be to scrutinise the transport strategy and the performance of the mayor and TfL in implementing it. It would be nonsensical to have an assembly member of that tightly focused executive body if he or she were not going to do what the mayor wanted anyway_he or she would be subject to being sacked. The assembly will, through its role in the GLA's overall budget, approve TfL's. It would not be right for assembly members to get involved in the running of TfL. The amendment is not sensible, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the Minister's position. We believe that some jobs could be shared without a blurring of accountability. However, given our willingness to gain favour from even the most recalcitrant members of the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 781, in page 163, leave out lines 8 and 9.
<P>
Even if power is to be kept with the mayor, and even if an assembly member is not allowed to be a member of Transport for London, it might be conceivable that someone else could chair it. We should like to explore that point. I understand that the mayor does not have to be a member of TfL but that, if he is a member, he has to be the chair.
<P>
The Minister has already conceded half our point by conceding that the mayor does not have to be a member of Transport for London. The mayor might be more useful to TfL as a contributing back-bencher rather than 635 636 <P>
merely as the chair. I hope that the Minister might accept the possibility of giving someone else the chance to chair TfL. I cannot believe that of all the other members of TfL, nobody would be capable of that task.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am genuinely intrigued by the idea of the mayor in the role of a back-bencher serving on the board of Transport for London and, in that role, criticising his or her own strategy as it is required to be implemented by TfL.
<P>
If the Committee needed a perfect example of Liberal Democrat Members' inability to get to grips with our proposals, this is it. They are unable to consider even for a fraction of a second the desirable outcomes that we see clearly in the power structure that we have created for the chairman of TfL. The inability of Liberal Democrat Members to think their own ideas to their inevitable, illogical conclusions never fails to amaze me. In the light of that, I strongly urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If the Minister can give a decent answer to this simple question, I shall: is there not a conflict of interest if the mayor is chair of TfL and is also the person to whom appeals are made if there is, for example, a refusal to grant a service permit? If the Minister has a good answer to that question and can satisfy me that there will be no conflict of interest, I shall, of course, withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I certainly have an answer but it is doubtful whether the hon. Gentleman will find it a good one. It will of course be within the powers of the mayor to appoint an appeals Committee. It can be at arm's length, and there is no requirement for the mayor to sit on it. It will act, as all such committees do, in a responsible way. There is no conflict of interest. If the mayor decides to chair Transport for London, how can there be any conflict of interest in ensuring that the mayoral stategy is implemented? As for appeals procedure, yes it would be entirely possible and within the mayor's powers to appoint such an appeals system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That was a very good answer. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Schedule 8 agreed to.
<H4><center> Clause 133</center></H4>
<H4><center>Directions etc by the Mayor</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> An earlier debate, prompted by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, concerned information going around London. When the mayor issues guidance or directions under this power, what public information will there be about them and what time lag will there be between the proposal for directions and their coming into force? I do not want the legislation to lay down details in days and hours, but I want to know that when the mayor has an idea, there will be an opportunity for people to respond to it before it turns into an order that others must obey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The simple answer is that everything will depend on the circumstances. If the mayor is expecting an immediate response to an urgent situation, the mayor will issue a direction and expect it to be implemented immediately by Transport for London, which is appointed by the mayor and which the mayor may well chair. There may well be wider issues on which the mayor may wish to issue guidance. I would expect Transport for London to have a certain amount of time to consider the guidance before it was implemented, but it would be impossible for me here in Committee to specify all the different circumstances between those two extremes. It is a relationship in which the mayor sets the strategy and may choose to chair the body but certainly expects the body to carry out his or her guidance and directions. If those directions should be implemented immediately, then that should happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand that answer. What did the Government have in mind when they included in this list in clause 133(3)(b) the specific provision about the conduct of legal proceedings? It is important to have some clarification beyond the guidance notes if the Minister can give it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Obviously, any Organisation may become involved in a legal action, and guidance is sometimes required as to whether that action should be pursued, particularly if substantial costs are involved. There might be a balance of advantage in one course of action or another, and it might be appropriate for the mayor to give guidance to Transport for London before it became heavily engaged in what could be an extremely lengthy and expensive process of litigation. Those are the circumstances that I can envisage, but there will undoubtedly be others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> This is my last linked question. Would that guidance, either at the time or later, become public? It is an important matter. I understand the confidentiality issue in commercial transactions, but I should have expected the Minister to have agreed that the public should be allowed to be aware of and to evaluate a decision, at the direction of the mayor, not to proceed with a legal action which might be hugely costly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can envisage circumstances in which the principle of confidentiality would have to prevail_for example, personnel matters or contractual matters in which commercial confidentiality applied. However, in general, the mayor's directions must be public. As we established in earlier debates, the mayor will be under a duty to report to the assembly every month on his decisions. Guidance or directions given to Transport for London would constitute one of those decisions. Unless such decisions were governed by circumstances requiring confidentiality, the presumption is that the guidance will be public.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 133 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<H4><center>Clause 134</center></H4>
<H4><center>Structures of fares and services</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): It is important that the clause is properly debated because, for many Londoners, it goes to the heart of how the fare structure will be organised and what it will be. The GLC's most famous policy_some might say its most infamous policy_was the fares fair policy, which introduced a particular fare structure. I am sure that the mayoral candidates will focus on transport and fares.
<P>
A Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate is likely to put forward a Liberal Democrat policy: that is, that there should be a freeze on fares in the GLA's first term. That would encourage people to use the transport system and would help to reduce congestion. Polling by groups such as the Association of London Government shows that that is a very popular policy. We hope that other mayoral candidates will have such policies. The election process for mayor could therefore involve a debate on the future fare structure.
<P>
In such a debate we could focus on issues such as affordability and sensible structures for concessionary and discounted fares. At the moment, London Transport's fare structure is not affordable and does not produce the best use of London's transport system. The Government, who were elected in May 1997, have continued the previous Government's policy of increasing fares above the inflation rate, year after year. That means that many people who would otherwise have used London Transport are not doing so.
<P>
The Government's predecessors would have pointed to the increasing number of people using London Transport, year after year, as proof that London Transport's fare structure was affordable and sensible. They would have argued that showed significant demand for transport under the current fare structure.
<P>
However, one must consider the counterfactual position. What would happen if fares were reduced? Would the increase in the travelling public be much greater? There was a significant increase in the number of people using London Transport when the GLC introduced a fares fare policy under the leadership of the current hon. Member for Brent, East. In 1983, when there were reductions of about 26 per cent. in London fares_the hon. Gentleman may wish to correct me on that_there was a 16 per cent. increase in the travelling public. I believe that that is the largest annual increase in the numbers using London's transport system.
<P>
That year, the fares fair policy had other beneficial and measurable effects. Road casualties were reduced by 3,500; pollution was reduced, which clearly improved Londoners' health; and the number of people commuting by car decreased. A number of externalities exist in regard to any major mass transit system. Those externalities are often difficult to capture in the ordinary balance sheet or in the profit and loss account of a transport operator.
<P>
We could also examine road deaths. When I visited the road traffic police garage at Hampton, which looks after the south-west London area, I was staggered to learn that one road fatality can cost the overall public purse_taking into account the costs of the coroner, the police and so forth_up to &#163;l million. Reducing road deaths can thus massively benefit returns to the public purse. Clearly, a policy to encourage people off the roads and on to public transport would bring those benefits, even though they may not show up in an authority's profit and loss accounts.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I am trying to hasten the process rather than intervene myself later on. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the importance of clause 134, but does he agree that its main emphasisis is a reference to clause 135? My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South may have decided not to move his amendment to the clause solely because of the time and the light but because the whole ethos of clause 134 depends on what is discussed in relation to clause 135.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will know that in historical terms the amount of subsidy to London transport in the 1970s averaged &#163;50 million a year_and considerably more by the late 70s. By the 1990s, it had reached more than &#163;500 million. That is not enough for London Transport, which claims that a subsidy of &#163;750 million or even &#163;l,000 million is now required. To save time, I suggest that all these matters would be much better discussed in relation to clause 135, not clause 134.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention, but the clause deals with fare structure and I am addressing my comments to that rather than subsididy_I know, of course, that it feeds back on the issue.
<P>
It is important to return to my central point about the affordability of the current fare structure. We have seen a continuum of fare policies, despite changes in government. The present Government seem to believe that it is right to increase fares above inflation year on year despite clear evidence that that causes problems to many low-income groups in the capital which cannot afford to travel on London Transport.
<P>
In a recent documents_a briefing paper called fact sheet No. 7 and entitled "Fares and Tickets"_London Transport deals with affordability and relates revenue per passenger kilometre to the increase in earnings of the average London employee. It seeks to prove that London fares are affordable. However, further analysis shows that it is a rather ingenious way of presenting facts to serve its own purposes. More than two thirds of Londoners earn less than the average London earnings. A large percentage of the capital's population_even on the basis of London Transport's chosen statistics_face difficulties in affording transport in London.
<P>
Unless the new mayor's transport strategy produces a far more affordable fare structure, London Transport will not attract the number of customers needed to reduce congestion and allow greater access to the capital's transport system by more people in our city.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Despite the hon. Gentleman's protestations of concern about the people who, he argues, cannot afford to use public transport in London, and his contention that people on low wages and so on should be able to travel on it, my perception is that behind his arguments and those of his hon. Friends is a wish to dilute and restrict the powers of the mayor. He is effectively arguing, I presume, that specific and possibly detailed fare structures should be put into the Bill. This is all part 639 640 <P>
of Opposition Members' refusal to accept that the power structure that will be created within the Greater London authority has already been accepted by the people of London. They wish the mayor to become the political motivating force for the creation of a transport strategy.
<P>
The mayor will have to take a view about the level of fares, which will have to be acceptable to the travelling public. Affordability will inevitably figure in the mayor's considerations; equally, the mayor will have to take account of the setting of fares when defining Transport for London's budget.
<P>
The general transport duty requires the mayor to develop and implement policies for the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services. Of course the mayor will have to_and will wish to_take account of the general duty, and other factors, when setting fares. There will clearly be a need to consider the budgetary and operational implications of a particular fare strategy. The mayor undoubtedly will wish to increase the level of patronage of public transport in an economic manner and in a way that matches the capacity of available public transport to accommodate the increases in numbers; but I repeat that, in essence, behind the argument of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is a desire to restrict and limit the mayor's powers to make decisions at the time they need to be made. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not divide the Committee and that the clause will stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister suggests that we are trying to restrict the mayor's powers. Words such as efficiency, reliability and affordability have appeared frequently in the Bill and in all parties' amendments. The concept of affordability was in an amendment that we chose not to move. Such concepts are inherently contestable. Their purpose is to try to boost the mayor, not to prescribe his powers. Mayoral candidates would argue about what they, as potential mayors, meant by such concepts and how, through their strategies and policies, they would implement them.
<P>
Our attempts to raise the issue of affordability and the need to make London transport accessible to people in low-income groups do not mean that we are trying to prescribe; we are attempting to nudge candidates in what we believe_what I should have thought the hon. Lady believed_was the right direction. We felt moved to make those points because there have been so many inflation-busting increases in London Transport's fares. London already has one of the highest_

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Can I take it that if the hon. Gentleman were in government he would not have implemented any fare increases? If so, where would funding for London Underground come from?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I made it very clear at the outset that we believe that there should be a fares freeze policy_
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That is in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> One could reinvent all past policies. This Government could have gone back on their opposition to privatisation. Our future policies are clear: we advocate a freeze on fares. I should be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's fares policies. Through his amendment he wanted them to be regulated between minus 2 percentage points and plus 2, which is hardly a logical approach.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> This question may save the Committee's time if I choose not to speak on clause 135. The hon. Gentleman talked about a fares freeze. Is he saying that the cost of that policy should fall on London council tax payers or on the Treasury? As a London Member of Parliament, I am inclined to say that it should fall on the Exchequer. However, on behalf of people outside London, I ask why the whole of the United Kingdom should pick up the cost of subsidies to London transport.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am more than happy to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. We support clauses to introduce congestion charges and parking levies on non-residential parking places. The revenues from these new charges can be used for public investment and to encourage people to use public transport. That is one way to support a fares freeze policy.
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee_I am just a populist. The issue is important, as London's fares are almost the highest of any capital city in the developed world. Londoners are worried about that; poll after poll shows that the cost of public transport is one of the key anxieties of people in the capital. Liberal Democrats want to tackle these anxieties and we believe that the mayor who will win office, and the popular support of the people of London, will follow a freeze on fares policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be briefer than the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I may be too tired to recall the question I am about to ask when we come to clauses 149 to 151, which I understand are the Government's targets tonight. I therefore ask my question now. In clauses 149 to 151 there are procedures for consultation if a route is to be discontinued; there will also be consultation on new services, or on alterations to an existing route. If, when we discuss clause 151, I were to ask why there was no consultation on frequency of service, would the Minister refer me to clause 134(2)(b), under which the mayor has a responsibility for frequency?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I must congratulate the right hon. Gentleman. His contribution was indeed brief, but it was of such complexity that I am tempted to ask if he would write to me with his query, when I shall be happy to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Minister has stimulated me to stay awake until we reach clause 151.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(11) Transsport for London shall protect their members and employees from any legal liability or costs as a result of any arrangements which are entered into with any other person".</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will take me a little time to do justice to the amendment. I referred earlier in our proceedings to the cases that give rise to it. The point I want to make may seem obscure, but it raises an important issue.
<P>
Evidence was given to the Nolan committee of a general threat to local authority members and officers who became involved in joint-venture enterprises. The example given was not a transport enterprise, but the principles apply very much to transport activities. Council officers from the London borough of Waltham Forest drew attention to problems that had arisen as a result of a joint venture entered into by the council with a private sector company to provide a water park leisure facility for the public. Two of them had agreed to be appointed as directors, relying on an indemnity given by the council to its employees. The banks started proceedings against the council in 1992 for the honouring of certain guarantees. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal, in a 1996 case involving Allendale borough council, declared that such guarantees were ultra vires and therefore void. In 1994 the joint liquidators of the company started proceedings against the council officer directors, but not the two private sector directors. The liquidators alleged that the two concerned had allowed the company to continue to trade while insolvent. They sought up to &#163;1 million. The two officers said that the reason for pursuing them and not the other two directors was the assumption that they would have contractual indemnity provided by the council, which would ultimately pay if the claim succeeded.
<P>
In October 1996 the two applied to the High Court for a declaration as to the lawfulness of their indemnity. The court considered that it did not cover their actions as directors of the company, because the council involvement in the establishment and financing of the company was ultra vires. Lord Nolan's Committee was asked to consider what happens when a lawful act is subsequently deemed unlawful.
<P>
When decisions were made on the Waltham Forest water park in 1986-88, councils were being encouraged to form joint ventures with private companies to pursue their objectives. Neither the council's legal advisors nor the district auditor had raised concerns about the council's guarantors for the joint-venture company's liabilities. In the Waltham Forest and Allendale cases, because of the ultra vires rule, the councils have been relieved of their contractual agreements with the banks, involving millions of pounds, without penalty. The ultra vires principle thus left responsibility with the employees who had relied on the integrity of the council's decisions.
<P>
The officers were placed in personal financial jeopardy as the banks sought to recover their money in other ways. They invited Lord Nolan's Committee also to consider the liability of an auditor who had failed to identify or stop the ultra vires act in the first place. They added that their legal costs to date amounted to &#163;100,000 and that, had those not been paid by their trade union, they would have been in severe trouble.
<P>
I raise the issue because it seems quite possible that the same issue may arise in the context of Transport for London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster argues from the particular to the general. While I am acutely aware of the instances that he described involving Waltham Forest and Allendale, they do not necessarily provide a sound basis for the very wide-ranging obligation that he wants included in the Bill.
<P>
The amendment is technically flawed and impractical, but that is not my only reason for asking the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw it. If it were accepted, Transport for London would be required to indemnify its members and employees against any liability that might arise from agreements with other persons for the provision of transport services under clause 135. Such an arrangement would place Transport for London under a more onerous obligation than that which currently applies to London Transport.
<P>
More fundamentally, it would be objectionable to require Transport for London to protect its members and employees against legal liabilities for wrongful or negligent acts or for omissions, regardless of the circumstances in which the liability was incurred. The right hon. Gentleman described instances of people becoming involved in processes that they thought were lawful but which were subsequently found not to be. I think that he will, however, recognise that the amendments would cover any circumstances_even those in which the employee knowingly acted unlawfully or fraudulently and those in which he acted negligently.
<P>
The arrangements that will be entered into under clause 135 are likely, as is the case now, to involve the contracting out of functions. By definition, that will mean that the contractor's staff, not the staff of Transport for London, will undertake the function. The members  <P>
and staff of Transport for London will not be parties to the agreement_it will be the contracting party. Liability under the agreement will, therefore, attach to Transport for London and not to persons who are not parties to the agreement.
<P>
I hope that that explains why the amendments are not acceptable. The right hon. Gentleman raised perfectly legitimate concerns, which arose from the Waltham Forest and Allendale judgments, but I hope that he will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Minister's response was fair-minded and I will, of course, accede to his request. At the same time, I cannot help feeling that there is some obligation on Parliament in the context of the Waltham Forest and Allendale cases, which involved considerable anxiety for the people concerned, to make provision by some means or other, although that would obviously involve much more modified language than I have used. I am not pressing the issue in the context of the Bill, but if provision is made, the contingency that I described_whereby as the Minister acknowledged, the officers believed that the act that was being performed was within the law_will not arise again.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> One of the great joys of being a Minister in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is that our enormously wide remit means that I can respond generously to the right hon. Gentleman. I will investigate the matter of Allendale and Waltham Forest and write to him about it. I hope that he recognises that that is a better way of handling the matter than pressing amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> Clause 135 makes important provision for dealing with the general powers of Transport for London. I sense that the Committee does not want to be detained at this stage, but I want to put down a marker to the effect that various issues need to be raised.
<P>
I finish by asking_this may be a point of order_whether we have the right to raise the matters before us on Report if we accept the clause without or even with a Division. Incidentally, as a new member of the Committee, I want to ask an obvious question: will there be a Report stage if no amendments are made to the Bill?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> A point of order has been raised. Any Member of the House is free to table amendments to the Bill when it returns to the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I am grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I sought your guidance on amendment No. 787_
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If I could interrupt the hon. Gentleman, I was going to raise the issue myself. I have had an opportunity to plot my way through the large group of amendments of which amendment No. 787 was part. Amendment No. 787, which refers to clause 140, is in hon. Gentleman's name and is on page 581 of the amendment paper. I have the discretion to allow the hon. Gentleman to move it when we reach the relevant part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful, Mr O'Hara. I had understood that to apply where grouped amendments relate to a later clause. If that is an understanding under your chairmanship, it may solve some technical problems.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We did move rapidly through rather a lot of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> More generally, in response to the comments made by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet, the hon. Member for Croydon, South tabled lots of amendments_in large measure probing amendments, I guess_to what is a very broad clause giving powers to Transport for London. He flagged one question which we have not so far pursued: what is the limitation to the shareholding power of Transport for London in other operators? If our understanding that it is to be allowed to have only a minority shareholding is correct, what is the logic behind that?
<P>
For example, it might be reasonable for Transport for London to acquire a river transport company that was in difficulty but important to commuter river traffic, or a bus company running a night-time service or a suburban service between hospitals and stations_a social rather than a commercial service. Why should Transport for London be restricted in taking a majority shareholding in such companies?
<P>
There are issues to which we shall return under clause 140_thanks to your ruling, Mr. O'Hara_relating to powers of disposal and acquisition of land. I would be unhappy if because the hon. Member for Croydon, South has seen fit to try to help the Committee by not moving some amendments, we did not have the opportunity to hear what the Minister has to say about ownership, and to return to the matter later. However, I am content to flag up those issues now, rather than to pursue them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman, Mr. O'Hara. The reason why I did not move the amendments is that we appear to be in the ludicrous situation of flying by the seat of our pants. We have no idea for how long the Government want to continue sitting tonight. We have no idea which amendments they want to reach. We would be happy to accommodate them by coming to an agreement about timing, which would allow us to pace the debate. If the Committee is to operate completely in the open air, we will have no idea at what pace to proceed. If that is a macho thing because Government members of the Committee do not want to come in on Thursday, the consequence if we reach clause 150 is that we will have covered 28 clauses_probably the most substantial 28 clauses of the Bill_in one day and two sittings. That is a travesty of the scrutiny procedure of the House.
<P>
I see that you are leaning forward, Mr. O'Hara. I do not know whether you want to say something. I was going to make a point in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I took it that the hon. Gentleman was raising a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> No, it was a speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was not a point of order for the Chair. It is not for the Chairman to read the mind of the Government or the Opposition to discover how far and at what pace they intend to proceed. My task is to ensure the orderly conduct of the sitting at whatever pace the Committee chooses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I only mentioned your name at the beginning, Mr. O'Hara, because it is the convention when starting a speech to address the Chair.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to a point made by the London Regional Passengers Committee. It asked why clause 135(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Transport for London may provide or secure the provision of public transport services in Greater London",
<P>
while schedule 9 states:
<P>
"within, to or from Greater London."
<P>
That harks back to the point that I made earlier today about the apparent difference between the clause and the associated schedule.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Liberal Democrat Members understood that the Committee was going to draw stumps today after clause 134.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): Where did the hon. Gentleman get that from?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I can tell the hon. Gentleman later where we got it from. I understand that the Government may he minded to suggest that we break at 11 o'clock. We share the hon. Gentleman's view that it would be nonsensical to try to go through at such a great pace the Greater London authority's powers over transport in general, the railway system, the inter-relationship between Transport for London and the railway system, the bus services and all the other transport powers. That was not expected to happen. I believe that the relevant guidance suggests that although the selection list concludes with clause 151, selections normally extend way beyond the point that the Committee is expected to reach.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should relate to the clause 135 stand part debate. Hon. Members who wish to raise issues about the pace of the Committee can do so only on points of order, which in this instance are not points of order for the Chairman.
<P>
When we have disposed of clause 135, I intend to carry on until 11 o'clock and then to suspend the Committee for 20 minutes. It may be that the Government or Opposition business managers may have knocked heads together during that time. That is for them; it is not for me. I seek interventions only on clause 135 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I stand corrected, Mr. O'Hara. You are right to say that I was moving away from the substance of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 135 is the first of a series of clauses which deserve, to a greater or lesser degree, a significant level of consideration. Prompted by the comments of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet, we pointed out that clause 135 is one such clause. We shall be happy not to linger on it, or on the others, at unnecessary length. However, I hope that members of the Committee will accept that the clauses are important and that all hon. Members will have the opportunity to make their points at a suitable time, which I anticipate will not be this evening.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I find it somewhat bizarre that the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey have spent such a considerable amount of time complaining about the lack of time that we have to debate the issues before us.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South referred to the concerns that had been raised with him by the London Regional Passengers Committee with regard to the word "in", which seemed to exclude all the other duties. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman and the Committee_that was an error and we shall be tabling amendments to put it right.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised the issue of minority shareholding. I think that he has confused the Bill with an amendment that the hon. Member for Croydon, South did not move. Transport for London will be able to form, promote or assist companies, either by itself or with others. It will, therefore, be able to have wholly-owned subsidiary companies.
<P>
The clause deals primarily with the powers that Transport for London will use to implement the mayor's transport strategy. Those powers secure the provision of public passenger transport services and facilities. The clause sets out similar powers to those that are currently held by London Regional Transport under section 3 of the London Regional Transport Act 1984, as amended by the London Regional Transport Act 1996. As I have already said to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, Transport for London will be able to form, promote or assist companies, either by itself or with others, in order to carry out its transport functions. It will be able to enter into agreements with others to carry out its functions, and such agreements can include arrangements for joint operation, ticketing and revenue pooling between TfL and the other parties.
<P>
The clause also provides that in some circumstances, TfL will be able to make agreements to carry out other activities for which it does not have specific powers. That is intended to facilitate private finance initiative arrangements such as the prestige ticketing project that is currently being undertaken by LRT. Transport for London will take on LRT's obligations under any such agreements where they have been entered into by LRT prior to its abolition. Transport for London will be able to transfer its relevant property, rights and liabilities to the company or person with whom it has the agreement if that is necessary for the purposes of the agreement. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> What are the differences between the operating powers of Transport for London as set out in the schedule and the current operating powers of London Transport?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The powers contained in the schedule are similar to those in schedule 2 of the London Regional Transport Act 1984, which sets out LRT's powers to discharge its duties under that Act. However, LRT's powers are exercisable only in relation to public passenger transport. Transport for London will be able to exercise its powers under schedule 9 in respect of all its functions, not just public transport, thus reflecting its much broader range of responsibilities. Its focus will be across all modes of transport in London, rather than narrowly on the underground and buses, which is the case for LRT.
<P>
 Nearly all the powers in schedule 9 are identical or very similar to LRT's existing powers in the 1984 Act, although the schedule reorders the powers so that they are more logically grouped. I trust that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question and that the Committee will support the schedule.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> Very briefly, schedule9 is six pages long and spells out the reasons for clause 135. 1 believe that clause 135 and schedule 9 are vital. I know that the Committee wants to make progress, so I shall merely put down a marker now to say that I intend to raise the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As is the hon. Gentleman's right, of course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understood both the substantive points that the Minister made. Of course Transport for London will have powers over other forms of transport than London Transport. However, I should like to probe the hon. Lady on two matters.
<P>
First, although her general reply was perfectly adequate as far as it went, was her attention directed to any significant differences between the schedule and the 1984 Act? For example, are the powers for the research and development of policy in section 21 of the 1984 Act reproduced in the schedule? Will the GLA, the mayor, the mayor's political advisers and others be expected to do research and development on transport strategy, or will that burden fall largely on Transport for London?
<P>
I have not gone through the previous legislation and listed the Powers, although I note the reordering_I have seen similar headings. London Research Centre transport powers, for example, might have been transferred across to Transport for London. I am happy for the Minister to give me what reply she can now. I shall also be happy to have a more specific reply in writing, if that is appropriate.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I hope that my reply will be sufficiently comprehensive for the hon. Gentleman. If not, I shall be happy to reply to him in more detail.
<P>
The powers with regard to research and development that will pass to Transport for London are the same as those exercised by London Regional Transport. Research and development in the areas that we are talking about are particularly important; it would be absurd if those powers were not transferred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am content with that reply. I shall undertake some further research of my own, and if I need to ask the Minister questions, I shall return to this issue later.

<H4><center>Co-operation with the Franchising Director</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I hope that the Committee will understand that it is important to spend a few minutes debating the clause, which concerns the links between transport inside and outside London. The Committee will want the Ministers to explain two main issues.
<P>
First, how will the needs of people in the south-east as a whole who use London transport and wider transport systems be co-ordinated? As has been said under previous clauses, such co-ordination is important because London transport cannot be organised without giving thought to the hinterland beyond London. That is where franchising directors should play their role they are in place to ensure that London's transport services are delivered, many of which come into London from outside.
<P>
Do the Ministers envisage mechanisms to prevent and deal with the conflicts that may arise? The GLA could take the view that train services from London to the suburbs should run until 1 am, while train operating companies servicing areas outside London could argue that they should run until only 12.30 am. I shall give an example that is topical this evening. From recollection, I think that the last train from Waterloo to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton departs at about 1 am, or just after. The GLA's view about the right time for that last train could differ from the views of others who think that it is inappropriate for trains to go beyond Kingston to Esher and other places in Surrey at that time.
<P>
What would be an appropriate way of reconciling such conflict? As I understand it, Transport for London may give guidance to the franchising director, but it is optional for the franchising director to give effect to that guidance. Is that the case, and if not, how can such conflicts be resolved?
<P>
Secondly, is there a role for an arbitrator? Does the Bill provide for an arbitrator, and if so who is it?
<P>
Finally, how does the proposed link between the GLA and the franchising director fit into the Government's plans for the strategic rail authority? My understanding is that the strategic rail authority will take over the role of the franchising director for most purposes. Will that be a straight transfer of responsibilities, so that the GLA will negotiate with the strategic rail authority? Again, what would happen in the event of conflict with the body entrusted with the transport strategy?
<P>
The mayor could take the strong view that the extension of night-time transport was a priority for tubes and railways, which would be perfectly reasonable. I understand that the tube network cannot run all through the night, because, unlike New York, London does not have the necessary track capacity. Many factors could be at work that do not effect other train operating companies. Staff costs, ability to recruit staff, trade union arrangement and other factors might come into play. How would such a clear strategy issue of the sort by which the Minister sets so much store be reconciled with the interests of others?
<P>
The Minister has made clear that we are to have a new authority in which the strategy of the elected people is all important. As areas around London do not have such strategic authorities_there is no regional authority for Kent, Surrey or the south-east_there could be conflict between the elected representatives of 7 million or 8 million people and the appointed bodies around London It would be helpful to know whether the Government have answers to questions about co-ordination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I welcome the tightening of the clause. In the evolution from Green Paper to White Paper, it was still rather woolly. Given that a substantial number of London's commuters come in to the city by rail rather than underground, the railway network should obviously be a part of the system.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in wanting to know the degree of co-operation that will exist. The clause talks about a duty to co-operate. Such wording is perilously close to Liberal Democrat drafting. Quite what happens in the absence of co-operation, I am not sure. I should be grateful to know how such co-operation is envisaged, and which office has the last word.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have a strong sense of dj vu. Fifty years ago, my father was not only leader of the Tory party on the London County Council but the last deputy chairman of Southern Railway before it was nationalised in 1948. The linkage between the commuter rail network and the authority for London brings back the time of my youth.
<P>
I want to look forward to clause 163. People may believe that that is looking too far ahead, but I am entering into the spirit of things. I understand that the Government may well want to finish consideration of the Bill over this weekend. I quite understand the game that we are playing, and my eyes have been lifted to the horizon. I detect some discrepancy between clause 163, in which it seems the franchising director has some ability to overrule the mayor and the co-operation called for in clause 136. Although 27 clauses separate clauses 136 and 163, and not everyone will necessarily notice the connection, I hope that the Minister will reassure us that there is no discrepancy and inconsistency between the two objectives.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Clause 136 places Transport for London and the franchising director under a duty to co-operate with each other over the co-ordination of services provided or secured by T for L and franchised rail services overseen by the franchising director. Transport for London and the franchising director are also placed under a duty to provide each other with the information necessary for that co-operation.
<P>
The clause allows Transport for London and the franchising director to enter into agreement with each other for the purpose of that co-operation. It is the Government's clear, stated and desired aim for the mayor and the franchising director to work in partnership. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, the franchising director will have become the strategic rail authority by the time the mayor takes office. The strategic rail authority will comprise the office of the franchising director and the existing British Railways Board. We expect to have a shadow strategic rail authority in place by spring. That will require legislation but if the other place is amenable, or behaves itself_fingers crossed_such legislation may be introduced this year.
<P>
It is our desired aim that the strategic rail authority and the mayor should work in partnership. However_and I think that this was the hon. Gentleman's central point_here, as with all other requirements relating to mayoral duties and strategies, the mayor may not engage in something that is outwith the national strategic transport policy and which would impact adversely outside the GLA.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The mayor will be in a unique position. He will take into office a powerful mandate granted to him by the people of London. Thus the office itself_quite apart from the individual_will be a force to be reckoned with, whether transport is provided by Transport for London or franchise rail operators and everyone involved in the provision of transport will acknowledge that force.
<P>
There is therefore that clear political influence, but there are also concrete powers. The mayor will be able to give the franchising director binding guidance on passenger rail services in London, within the constraints that I have already detailed. The mayor will be able to buy in new passenger rail services for London, promote investment in, for example, new or existing stations, and require train operators to participate in multi-modal ticketing arrangements and concessionary travel 651 652 <P>
schemes. The mayor will, of course, inherit London Transport's role in the co-ordination of bus, tube and rail services.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked about a possible conflict between train operating companies and the mayor, but I cannot conceive of there being that sort of conflict. As I said, the mayor will have the power to provide new passenger rail services. There is a clear need for investment in our railway infrastructure, but I shall not pretend to the hon. Gentleman that new services can automatically be provided in the way that he envisaged. We are also considering train paths and rolling stock. As part of an integrated transport strategy, for example, the mayor could decide to respond to a need for trains to run much later at night or earlier in the morning_with the new work patterns, I often hear complaints from people who find that no public transport is available if they have to start work very early in a morning or if shift patterns mean them working very late at night.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether there would be an arbitrator in a dispute_perhaps we should call it a non agreement_between the mayor and the proposed strategic rail authority. In essence, the arbitrator will be the Secretary of State. The mayor will have the right to approach him or her in such circumstances.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster highlighted the fact that some of the concerns that have been expressed, including those raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, are dealt with by clause 163. I trust that I have managed to answer the questions of the hon. member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister has been helpful, but perhaps she can help me with two more things.
<P>
On this occasion_I hope that the hon. Lady will be pleased to hear this_we agree that the Secretary of State must have a role. We are dealing with powers outwith the competence and geography of the authority. If there is a national policy from elsewhere, for example, there must be co-ordination. Thus, I do not dissent from the hon. Lady's suggestion. I do not know whether she implies that the Bill explicitly provides for that arbitration role for the Secretary of State or whether it follows because elsewhere the Bill prescribes that the Secretary of State will have that role vis-a-vis what will be the strategic rail authority. It would be helpful if the Minister could answer that.
<P>
I am conscious of the need to link this discussion into our later debates_the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster was right about that. Does what the Minister said mean that in addition to the mayor or the GLA quite properly arguing for and requiring additional services in London to be delivered by the franchising people, the mayor would be able to seek, for example, potentially significant variations of service? I assume that the answer is yes. For instance, if there was no service on the Hackney-Chelsea line on a Sunday, and the mayor said that there must be, because he regards it as a key orbital route, I assume from what the Minister says that the mayor would have the power to say, "That must be delivered. You must adjust your service accordingly." Is that a fair conclusion to draw from the Minister's response to the debate?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> On the powers of the Secretary of State, the hon. Gentleman has picked up on the overarching requirement on the mayor that all the strategies must fall within the framework of the national integrated transport strategy and not impact adversely outside the Greater London area.
<P>
On the mayor being able to buy in additional services, obviously the mayor must have the money to do so. However, if the mayor perceives that to be essential for the integrated transport strategy, it will be for him or her, in co-operation with the strategic rail authority, to provide such services. I repeat that because of the railways structure that we inherited, it is not a simple matter for the mayor to buy such services. I have already touched on the issues of train paths and rolling stock. It would be remiss of me not to mention that another part of the national strategy is increased movement of freight by rail. That comes back to the point about available train paths.
<P>
If the mayor so decides and has the money, there is nothing_apart from the caveats that I have just given, which have to do with the present physical capabilities of our railway infrastructure_to prevent such services from being provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am very positive about the opportunities presented. One of the banes of transport life in London has been that the railways have not been incorporated with other modes of transport. That is a major source of frustration for all of us who live and work in the city.
<P>
I hope that in future we will be able to avoid the sort of nonsensical conflict that we still have under the present inherited regime. To choose a topical example, a major crossrail project through my constituency in Southwark would have a major environmental impact_demolition of buildings, conservation orders, and so on. There has never been an evaluation of the significance of the alternatives to London, to be set against the national significance of the greater crossrail system. At present, the only way to resolve that issue is by an inquiry under the Transport and Works Act. That is not the best way, because it involves confrontation, petitioning and a quasi-judicial process.
<P>
To end where I began, we are very positive. We hope that the strategy works well, and we are keen to collaborate with the Government to ensure that there is maximum co-operation among all modes of transport_and, in particular, between the London government, whoever runs it, and the franchising director.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support and for picking up on one of the major planks of our proposals for the creation of a truly integrated public transport system for London. That involves not only the power of the mayor but partnership, which is not only inherent in but written into the Bill, to bring into play forces that can begin to make a real difference to an integrated transport structure for London.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendments are primarily measures to protect Londoners' money by requiring external audit of TfL. It is right to have the accounts audited externally, especially to ensure that public debt remains at a stable and prudent level.
<P>
Amendment No. 512 sets out the information that should be considered and incorporated into any report. Forcing the outside audit of TfL's competence would improve transport standards and, of course, assist in open government and democracy, as amendments elsewhere would.
<P>
An important principle is at stake. Independent external accounting and financial advice would keep the staff on their toes to a greater degree than was the case elsewhere. I hope that the Minister recognises that principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Amendment No. 514 is about debate and approval for the report. I will not make the trite point about getting majority support for things, but I want to explore one issue. I just asked my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam when his last train went and he said that he would not make the last train. He added that there was no answer when he called the 2231234 phone number, which is meant to give London Transport inquiry information, to find out when the last tube went. The customer services of London Transport and Transport for London are exactly the sort of things that are worthy of inclusion in annual reports.
<P>
Do the Government envisage that the assembly will have an input into the information in the report? It is clear that the mayor can direct TfL. That is quite proper, but the report could benefit from the assembly's pool of experience. Whatever else the 25 people sitting in the assembly do, they use transport to go round London and that will be of some benefit. I hope that the Government see a role for the assembly and that it will, whatever its composition, take on a role that enables it to contribute to getting the reports and to ask and answer the questions that Londoners will want to have asked and answered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My one regret is the pusillanimous wording of amendment No. 511, which is in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South and which refers to the budget for the forthcoming year. When we discussed the budget more largely earlier, my hon. Friend moved an amendment to the effect that the previous three years' financial figures should be available so that the budget could be prepared. We were extraordinarily modest in not pursuing the Government at that stage and did not ask why the capital budget should not look three years in advance. To operate on a one-year basis does not sound like new Labour; it sounds like a very conservative project. I am sorry that my hon. Friend has not stimulated and provoked the Government at this late stage by suggesting that the annual report, too, should look three years ahead.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am absolutely delighted by the prospect of clairvoyance that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster has raised. He spoke about requiring reports not only from three years in arrears, but for three years in advance. That would undoubtedly test the abilities of all those who have struggled desperately in recent years to keep London Transport services going in difficult circumstances and with no future certainty.
<P>
The amendments would impose restrictions on and specify the contents of TfL's annual report and are unnecessary. Amendments Nos. 510 and 511 would make it a requirement for the accounts of the preceding year and for the budget for the following year to be published with the report. Amendment No. 513 would give the assembly the duty of appointing and fixing the pay of TfL's external auditors.
<P>
Clause 117 adds the functional bodies, including Transport for London, to the list of public bodies in the Audit Commission Act 1998 that are required to make up accounts annually. It also adds TfL to the list of bodies that must be audited by an auditor or auditors appointed by the Audit Commission.
<P>
TfL will also be covered by the Accounts and Audit Regulations 1996. Under regulation 9, TfL will have to publish its accounts
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as reasonably possible after conclusion of an audit, or nine months from the date following the end of the period to which the accounts in question relate."
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I expect that Transport for London will take steps to ensure that its accounts are published with its annual report, in common with good practice. London Regional Transport does that at present. The accounts and all supporting documents will be open to the public under provisions in section 15 of the Audit Commission Act 1998. We intend to table an amendment to put it beyond doubt that Transport for London will have a duty to publish its annual account.
<P>
There is no need to publish the budget for the next financial year with the annual report. The mayor is already required under schedule 5 to publish the draft budget for each body when it is presented to the assembly for approval. The budget for each functional body will be available in a public document and in the general accounts of the GLA. It follows that amendments Nos. 510, 511 and 513 are superfluous.
<P>
Amendment No. 512 would require various information to be contained in the report, and would require it to be available to the public and published in a summary in two newspapers. The Audit Commission Act 1998 and the Accounts and Audit Regulations 1996 already lay down requirements that Transport for London will have to follow as to what it must include in its published accounts. That legislation also lays down the rights of local government electors for the area of a body subject to audit.
<P>
Transport for London will be covered by the provisions of the Local Government Bill currently before Parliament. That will require it to set and to meet published performance targets and to undertake reviews of performance. There is no need to set those aspects in stone in the Bill. Amendment No. 512 is therefore also superfluous.
<P>
Amendment No. 514 would require the assembly to approve the report by a two-thirds majority. Unless the authority did that, it would be unlawful for it to approve Transport for London's component budget for the following year, if it was higher than the year to which the report related. The amendment simply would not work. The GLA consolidated budget must be agreed and the level of GLA precept must be set by the end of February each year. The annual report must be published as soon as possible after the end of the financial year on 31 March, so by the time the assembly considers the report, the budget will have been set long ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I do not understand why just because the budget has been agreed, set and approved, and could therefore be reported on, the assembly should not have objections about some other matter that would allow the withholding of agreement to the report. Those of us in political parties in which annual reporting is as normal a process as annual conferences know that although bits of a report can be objected to and remitted, that does not stop other parts being agreed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendment No. 514 would, however, make it unlawful for the assembly to approve a budget involving an increase on that of the previous year if it had not already been approved by a two-thirds majority that year's accounts. I was making the point that that procedure is simply impossible, as the budget will have had to have been approved the procedures that the Committee agreed to a week or so ago. It would be quite impossible for the assembly to comply with the obligation that the amendment seeks to place on it.
<P>
The assembly can debate the report if it so chooses, and I have no doubt that it will want to scrutinise closely the report and accounts of what will be one of the largest_if not the largest_of the functional bodies responsible to the mayor. The assembly also has the right to consider and approve the consolidated budget. It does not just have the choice of doing so_it is obliged to do so, and to consider not only the budget for the GLA but also that for the functional bodies. If assembly members are unhappy about the content of the report, we can trust them to remember that when they come to consider the budget for the following year.
<P>
There is no need for amendment No. 515. It is for Transport for London to decide how to regulate its own procedures under paragraph 5 of schedule 8. Transport for London members will decide on whether and how to vote on matters such as the annual report.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked about the availability of information to the assembly. Assembly members will be able to seek all the information that they legitimately need in order to make an evaluation of the work of Transport for London, and they will undoubtedly make use of that to comment on the annual report when it is available.
<P>
I envisage no problems in terms of the mechanism for ensuring the proper reporting of TfL's performance and the availability of information to allow proper scrutiny of its operations. That will ensure that the people of London can be satisfied that Transport for London is delivering, in a cost-effective way, a high-quality transport service for the people of London. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw the amendment.
657 658 <P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I chose not to intervene on the Minister at this hour of the night because I belong to the school of the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell)_I believe that Ministers should be in bed by this hour, and that it is wrong to test them unduly. I did not want to break the Minister's chain of thought as fatigue begins to set in.
<P>
I return to the Minister's opening remarks. He disarmed my comments about budgeting three years ahead with observations about clairvoyance. He may recall, as may the Minister for Transport in London, that when we sat on a Committee that considered another Bill, I cited Miss Katharine Whitehorn's account of a motorway box that was planned in north London. The only house in the street that was affected was one which had been bought three months earlier by a professional clairvoyant. I am not in the least bit fussed by this form of parrying.
<P>
Given the way in which the Minister subsequently developed his argument, is he suggesting that setting a capital budget three years ahead for Transport for London is not sensible because Transport for London would not know how to finance it? Does he have a better reason for arguing that a three-year capital budget is not sensible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman will recall that when we debated the capital budget last week, it was made clear that the budget is framed on an annual basis and that a statutory procedure must be completed before the capital plan can be agreed. We have made provision for the mayor to give indications of minimum spending levels in advance. In the spirit that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to see encouraged and that the Government have sought to pursue through the comprehensive spending review, I have no doubt that there will be indications of the kinds of expenditure levels that may be envisaged in future years.
<P>
However, that is very different to setting a precise budget on a three-year basis. The Bill provides only for an annual budget for TfL and for the GLA. Attempts will be made to look to the longer term, particularly as the public-private partnership moves ahead, and some of the problems of annuality in budgeting should thus be overcome.
<P>
Speaking strictly in terms of the clause, it would not be feasible to provide a detailed and fully finalised three-year budget in advance, because the information would not be available and the statutory processes would not have been satisfied. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for responding to amendments Nos. 513 an 514, to which I did not speak I apologise for not doing so.
<P>
Can the Minister confirm that the Audit Commission's appointment of external auditors will meet the criteria that are sought by the amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied by my assurance that the procedures that the Audit Commission will adopt are those that were prescribed by legislation that was put onto the statute book by a Conservative Government. That is designed to ensure proper scrutiny by independent auditors which meets the highest standards. That is what we are applying to Transport for London. We are not seeking to create new and special arrangements_we believe that those put in place by the then Conservative Government form a sound basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> When the arrangements were put in place, we did not envisage that an Organisation of this nature would be established. Nevertheless, having been put in place by a Conservative Government, they must have some merit. Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
