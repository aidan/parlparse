<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (4A) Subject to subsection (4) above a court may make a reparation order under subsection (2) above instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way'.--[Mr. Clappison.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): We were dealing with the type of orders that can be made with a reparation order. We understand that, under clause 63(4), if a court wishes to make a reparation order, it cannot impose the sentences specified in subsection (4)(a) and (b). The court could combine a reparation order with two of the sentences, but only if it has made an action plan order or a supervision order in the first place. A reparation order could be combined as an element of them.
<P>
If the court wants to make a reparation order, it will not be able to pass a custodial sentence. That is sensible enough. However, it cannot make one of the non-custodial orders mentioned in subsection 4(b). A reparation order cannot be combined with a community service order or and a compensation order, and our main concerns relate to the latter.
<P>
I do not want to anticipate the Government's position, but I suspect that the Minister will argue that if a court takes the view that someone should do unpaid work as reparation, it would be superfluous to order community service as well. We do not feel as strongly about that as we do about compensation orders. However, it would not do any harm to make someone old enough to serve a community service order--that is someone over 16-to serve a reparation order to pay off his debt to the community as a whole and to the individuals involved. That would add an extra element of flexibility.
<P>
Compensation causes us the most concern. Reparation orders are being introduced without flexibility. Unless we have misunderstood the Government, we believe that it is not their intention to include a financial element in a reparation order so that a defendant is required to make payments to a victim. Will the Minister confirm that?
<P>
Under subsection (4)(b), it will be impossible for a court to make a compensation order alongside a reparation order. That is strange, especially because courts commonly make compensation orders and have been encouraged to do so by the House of Commons. In the ``No More Excuses'' White Paper, the Government stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The reparation might involve writing a letter of apology, apologising to the victim in person, cleaning graffiti or repairing criminal damage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is all well and good, but what if the victim of crime wants compensation as well?
<P>
We are concerned about cases in which someone's window is broken or car is damaged. Under the form of reparation to be introduced, it will be possible for the courts to order the offender to do some gardening, to tidy up or to write a letter of apology. However, the court will not be able to order that the victim is paid compensation. Many victims--especially less well-off victims who may not be covered by insurance--will want financial compensation above all else.
<P>
We are not alone in our concerns: magistrates are also alive to this apparent defect in the reparation order proposals. The Magistrates' Association
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would question the restriction against making a compensation order as well as a reparation order.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We agree with that sentiment. The proposal is perverse and may deprive victims of what they want most of all. If victims are not aware, when asked to give consent to a reparation order, that it will not involve any financial compensation, they may well feel deprived.
<P>
I do not want to anticipate too much--I shall have another bite of the cherry--but the Minister may argue that if compensation is ordered as well as reparation, it will effectively punish the offender and compensate the victim twice over. If so, I am not convinced. If my car is damaged or my windows are broken, I will want financial compensation to put matters right, but I have suffered other losses as well as financial ones.
<P>
We all know how inconvenient it is to have to stay at home and wait for the window to be repaired or to take the car to a garage. There may be additional inconvenience or suffering between the commission of the offence and having matters settled. Victims should be compensated for those additional losses too, so we do not accept the argument that we would be compensating victims or punishing offenders twice over. It is possible for the courts to combine compensation orders with other orders and we see no reason why restoration should not be combined with compensation.
<P>
Perhaps we have it all wrong, and the Minister will spring to his feet to tell us that compensation orders can be combined with reparation orders or that if they cannot, reparation orders can include some element of compensation. We shall listen with interest to the Minister's response because that is what we believe fits the bill in this case. If the Government are not prepared to combine the two, reparation orders will be very strange animals.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> The hon. Gentleman has approached the problem constructively. The issue rests on the choice of regime and systems that are put in place. The hon. Gentleman took note of my earlier point that there is more than one way of introducing reparation into the offender's regime; it can sometimes be achieved through other sorts of order.
<P>
	Although a reparation order cannot be made in conjunction with custody, that does not rule out some element of reparation being applied. A few weeks ago when I was meeting people who worked in prisons for Mediation UK, I spoke to the mother of a victim who was obviously devastated over the death of her son. Some time after the event, she had felt able to meet the offender and discuss what had happened with him. Without taking away all the hurt, it helped her to understand what had happened and to feel that the offender had done something to compensate. It did something to put events behind her and allow a healing process to start.
<P>
	In that particular case, it would obviously be inappropriate to have a reparation order associated with a custodial order. We want to avoid such links, when two inappropriate disposals are combined rather than applying the idea of reparation, which we believe should underlie much of what happens in how sentences are applied.
<P>
	As I said earlier, a reparation order cannot be combined with some community sentences--a community service order, a combination order, a supervision order with requirements, an action plan order or a compensation order--because reparation of one sort or another is already available as part of those orders.
<P>
	The legislation that governs community service orders, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, is set out in the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973. It requires a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of or over sixteen years of age''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to ``perform unpaid work'' in accordance with the provisions of the Act. It is available only for offences punishable with imprisonment.
<P>
	The ``National Standards for the Supervision of Offenders in the Community'', published in 1995--the standards are non-statutory, although that has not caused any problems in their application--explains that the main purpose of the community service order is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to prevent further offending by re-integrating the offender into the community''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it goes further than that, saying that it does so through two means, first
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``punishment--by means of positive and demanding unpaid work, keeping to disciplined requirements''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and, secondly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reparation to the community--by undertaking socially useful work.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The words ``reparation to the community'' are specifically used in that code of practice. We want to encourage and develop that approach.
<P>
The combination order combines elements of the probation and community service orders. It, too, requires the offender who is more than 16 years old to perform unpaid work for a number of specified hours. Encouragement should be given to the probation service and others involved in such orders to make work undertaken as reparation to the community to be relevant to the offence whenever possible. I have been involved in the supervision of people on community service, not, I hasten to add, as a probation officer--that was not my profession--but as a communiy worker accepting people under supervision. The engagements can be tremendously beneficial and such links are attempted.
<P>
The supervision order with requirements was introduced in the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, and was amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to allow the additional requirements. Although none of the requirements refers specifically to reparation, ``National Standards for the Supervision of Offenders in the Community'' suggests, as one of the methods of providing supervision, that offenders aged 10 to 17 should participate in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``activities designed to make reparation to the community by undertaking socially useful tasks which, if possible, make good damage done by offending.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such tasks are therefore supposed to relate to the offending behaviour.
<P>
In many ways, it is pleasing to find that such principles are already set into some arrangements, although they can be made much more explicit. There will be greater public confidence in sentences if they are understood to involve that element of reparation.
<P>
As is the case for the supervision order, a reparation requirement is one of the options available to the court for the action plan order. As the hon. Gentleman said, the compensation order is rather different, because recompense under the order is financial, rather than in kind, as is the case under other orders. It is nevertheless inappropriate to combine a compensation order with a reparation order, as it smacks too much of punishing the offender twice for the same offence. Given that the reparation order is likely to be used for offences at the lower end of the seriousness scale, it would be wrong to approach it in that way.
<P>
In each case, the courts will decide whether financial reparation or reparation in kind is more suitable. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), especially as I was able to speak to those involved and examine how it worked. In such cases, although there is no statutory requirement, financial reparation can be part of the offender's response, guided by the supervisor, not because that is required or because there is a separate compensation order, but because it makes sense in the circumstances.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I want to make one final point and then I will give way.
<P>
On many occasions the court considers that a compensation order is not appropriate, when the victim feels that financial compensation is appropriate. That could also be pursued under a civil claim, which is not ruled out under the arrangements that we have proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister made an important point about payments under a reparation order. Is he saying that even if a formal compensation order had not been made, it would be possible for an offender to make payments to the victim under a reparation order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I cannot see any way in which that voluntary contribution could be ruled out. That happens at present, without reparation orders, and I gave a specific example of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will there be an order from the court that the offender should pay money to the victim as part of a reparation order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No, I did not mean that. I was saying that it is possible to achieve a positive response from an offender, if he is made to engage with the damage that he has done and with the concept that he should make reparation. That can often be done without any order from the court. It can involve positive activity and a financial payment.
<P>
I refer the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) to the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North this morning. She spoke of positive responses as the natural consequences that result from making offenders meet people in the community and making such offenders understand that they have done wrong.
<P>
It would be confusing if we mixed the financial requirement of the court with the more general reparation order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is doing his best, but I am not convinced. When a victim is asked to give his consent to the making of a reparation order, will he be told that if such an order is made, the court will not be able to order any compensation in money?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is right that that should be done. The victim should know the circumstances. On many occasions, courts do not order compensation, even when they are invited to do so. The hon. Gentleman is correct in his interpretation of the expression ``to make reparation'' under a reparation order. The expression is defined in clause 78(1) as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make reparation for the offence otherwise than by the payment of compensation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is because the reparation order is intended to engage the offender in fully understanding the damage that he or she has done. The offender will not just go through the motions, but will contribute something positive to the individual or collective victim, or to the community, to put things right.
<P>
I understand the point that the hon. Member for Hertsmere is making, but the Government have given much thought to these matters and have listened to the comments of those who have run pilot projects. We do not wish to follow a route that might lead to confusion between the different options available to the court.
<P>
The establishment of a reparation system is a major step forward. As I explained earlier, Labour Members had been asking for such a system over many years. If it had been set up, we should have learned much about the consequences and the alternatives. We will study the consequences of introducing such a system to the courts and will keep the matter closely under review. We want a range of clear and well-understood options that will work. I hope that I have clarified the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I think that the Minister's heart is in the right place on this matter. His instinct is the same as mine. He has been given some lousy advice about compensation orders and reparation orders. The reason that he has just given--I understand that it is on advice--is a lousy one. Those who gave the advice should examine the issue again. They have spoilt a rather good idea by the way that it has been introduced.
<P>
	I judge the Minister's instincts to be sound in this context because in the first part of his reply he made the sensible and fair point that the fact that offenders were given a custodial sentence should not rule out their making reparation. I agree with that. I know that it would have to be voluntary. It would be a jolly good thing for those people to write letters of apology to their victims if the victims wished it.
<P>
I cannot go along with the reasons given for not combining reparation with community service or--I feel more strongly about this--compensation orders. The Minister rightly said that community service involved reparation to the community. However, that should not rule out an element of reparation to the victim. I cannot see the harm in combining the two. It is inflexible not to do so. The Minister is right to say that community service is a fairly high-tariff non-custodial sentence. Courts impose it as an alternative to custody.
<P>
I should be happy for reparation to be included in such a high-tariff sentence. It should not be reserved just for low-tariff sentences. There is a case for introducing it across the board. I want flexibility, and there would be nothing wrong in adding appropriate reparation to a high-tariff non-custodial sentence such as community service.
<P>
I do not feel as strongly about the community service issue as I do about compensation. In any case, as the Minister knows, community service orders are only for people aged 16 and over, whereas the reparation orders that we are discussing are, I think, for people aged 10 to 17, so only 16 and 17-year-olds would be affected by those arrangements. However, I feel strongly about compensation orders. Reparation without the possibility of compensation is plain daft. Many victims will want financial compensation.
<P>
I am not as worried as I was before I heard the Minister's remarks, as he sensibly said that he would expect victims to be warned that a reparation order would prevent the court from making a compensation order. I should be very concerned if victims were not to be given such a warning, because they might consent to reparation before discovering that by doing so they had deprived themselves of financial compensation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> That is a point on which I wanted to say something further. The victim's attitude to reparation is an important element in the decision, as we have said. I am sure that a victim's preference for reparation by way of compensation would be weighed by the court. It would have to be made clear that there was no guarantee that the court would decide in accordance with that wish, because it would have other factors to consider. It migh not consider it appropriate in all the circumstances. However, the victim's view would inform the court's decision and the magistrates would be sympathetic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is a fair point. There would be no guarantee that the victim would receive any compensation from the court. However, the Government, relying on the bad advice that they have received, have made it clear that if a reparation order is made it will not be possible for a court to order financial compensation, either through a compensation order or as part of a reparation order. I should have been very concerned indeed if victims had not been told of that when they were asked for their consent.
<P>
I want to know a little more about how the Government propose to warn victims that they will not be able to receive compensation if a reparation order is made. We need to know that the warning is being given in a satisfactory way and that all victims will understand the consequences. I shall be looking to the Minister for a little more detail. He can write to me if he wishes, because I do not want to put him on the spot, but we want victims to be sufficiently warned that they will not receive compensation if a reparation order is made. The provision is inflexible. It is inappropriate to put victims to that election--to have to choose between reparation and compensation--and to put courts to the same election when it comes to sentencing. Magistrates have said that they want the power to order compensation and reparation. There is no good reason why they should not.
<P>
I suspected that the Minister's line of argument might be that that would be to punish the offender twice, but I invite him to consider combining action plan orders and supervision orders with reparation orders. That, too, has an element of people being sentenced twice. I do not see why a compensation order should be ruled out on those grounds. It is not a case of compensating the victim twice over. Why not make financial compensation for the monetary loss and compensation through a reparation order for the inconvenience and suffering caused?
<P>
I return to the commonsense aspect of the matter. Victims may want some tidying up, cleaning or gardening done and may even want a letter of apology; but if a window has been broken or the car has been scratched or damaged, victims will want money to pay someone to supply and fit the glass or have the car taken to the garage to be properly resprayed--and that, too, will be monetary compensation.
<P>
I have made my point about flexibility in the bank. I have now cashed it, and I think that I have received my cheque back in full. I am a little happier with what the Minister told us about warning victims. I would have been most unhappy if that had not been the case. It would have been dangerous as well as daft if victims had not been warned. I am not happy with the provision, but I want the Committee to make progress. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 263, in page 50, line 21, after `aggregate', insert

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 266, in page 50, line 37, leave out `three' and insert `six'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to consider in more detail the nature of reparation orders. Under clause 63, a reparation order cannot require an offender to work for more than 24 hours in aggregate. As we have just discovered, reparation orders cannot be combined with certain other forms of sentence. In the light of that limitation, we believe that 24 hours is too low a maximum, especially as that maximum covers a wide age range--from 10 to 17.
<P>
The amendment would keep the maximum of 24 hours for offenders up to the age of 14, but would extend it to 48 hours for offenders aged between 14 and 18. We believe that 24 hours is rather low for 16 and 17-year-old lads and that 48 hours is a more realistic maximum. We are strengthened in that contention by the fact that an offender aged 16 could be required to work for many more hours under a community service order, which, as the Minister said, involves unpaid work in the community making reparation to the community.
<P>
Community service is a high tariff--I have already said that it should not rule out a reparation order being made, but I remind the Committee that a community service order cannot be made for less than 40 hours. I think I am right in asserting that the maximum community service order that can be made for 16-year-olds is 240 hours. That contrasts with what we think is the low maximum of 24 hours for a reparation order.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 266 would extend the period in which reparation can be made from three to six months. However, if the Minister were to tell us that reparation should normally be carried out as soon as possible, we would certainly agree with him. Had our earlier amendment been accepted, provision would have made for longer reparation orders to be made for older offenders. In such a case, flexibility over the maximum period for reparation may have been required.
<P>
I will not press amendment No. 266 strongly because we think that reparation should be carried out promptly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I should make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that the periods referred to in his amendment and in the clause are intended to be the maximum that can be required of the offender, but the offender will not necessarily be forced to stop at such a point. I recall meeting a young offender whose reparation involved gardening for elderly people. He continued to do that for many months after the order had stopped. The period of reparation and the work that he did helped him to understand the damage that he had caused as an offender. The voluntary activity which grew naturally out of the reparation that he had been required to undertake is one of the most positive outcomes that one could possibly hope to see.
<P>
We regard such voluntary activity as the essential act of citizenship. Successfully engaging an offender in that activity is an extremely satisfactory outcome. I would like to see such outcomes encouraged as reparation orders are put in place and as the philosophy of reparation becomes a day-to-day element of supervision and of dealing with offenders.
<P>
The Government believe that the amendments are unnecessary and that, in some cases, they may be counter-productive, weakening the force of the order.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 263, which proposes to increase the period of reparation for 14 to 18-year-olds from 24 to 48 hours. Reparative activity may also be carried out under a community service order, which allows for up to 240 hours of meaningful activity, so there is a provision for a considerable period of reparation for youngsters at the upper end of the age range.
<P>
It is true that the order is available only for offenders aged 16 and over, but offenders below that age should be in school. We must be careful about imposing too heavy a burden on such offenders or about distracting them from school activity that may be part of their rehabilitation.
<P>
The maximum period of 24 hours may be equivalent to a Saturday afternoon every week over a three month period. That seems to place quite a large burden on youngsters of that age. That is right--the reparation order should be a serious measure--but we want it to be implemented over a relatively short period in a focused way. A measure that allows offenders to fulfil the order and the spirit of what is intended in a fairly short period is most likely to be effective.
<P>
We do not think that there is a great deal between us and the Opposition--I would apply that to the idea of extending the reparation order to six months. For some youngsters in their early teens, six months is almost a lifetime, although it is only a blink of the eye for those of us who are getting older. However, as the Committee stage goes on, three months can seem quite long.
<P>
The reparation period allows the youngster to see the end of the task ahead. That is the difference between a reparation order and a community service order and supervision order, both of which are intended to deal with cases in which action over a longer period of time is appropriate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman gave practical suggestions to make the order work. I hope that, after reflection, he will allow us to proceed in the way outlined in the Bill. That will offer the courts choice and flexibility without taking away the focus on the time period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has made some fair points. The point of having a maximum is to cater for every case, not just the generality of cases. A higher maximum might be appropriate for cases at the older end of the age range. The Minister made a fair point about children under school age. However, the case of a young lad who offends after he has left school requires a longer reparation order than the maximum proposed by the Bill.
<P>
I take heart from the fact that the maximums for other orders have been increased by later statutes. I am speaking from memory, which may be fading, but I remember that there was once a restriction of 120 hours at the younger end of the range for community service orders. That has been increased to 240 hours. We might see the same thing happening to reparation orders.
<P>
I hope that Ministers and their advisers will be flexible in a year or two if the evidence suggests that a longer period is required. Having put down that marker, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 267, in page 51, leave out lines 3 and 4.
<P>
The amendment contains a small point that occurred to us after reading subsection (11), which requires a court to give reasons if it does not make a reparation order. The subsection is intended to give the court a nudge in the direction of making a reparation order. However, what will happen in cases in which the order has not been made because the victim has refused consent? I may be wrong, but it would appear that that fact would have to be stated in open court. We want to avoid anything that might embarrass a victim. We do not want an offender to know that an order has not been made because the consent of the victim has been withheld. If our understanding is wrong, will the Minister tell us? If not, I look for reassurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman raised a slightly different point from the one that I expected. The answer is contained in clause 64(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before making a reparation order, a court shall obtain and consider a written report by a probation officer social worker''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or another appropriate person. That report will go into the detail of the reparation, including the views of the victim. If the court receives a report that suggests that reparation is not appropriate because the victim does not want it, the conclusions of the report will provide the explanation.
<P>
If the victim is not willing to take part in reparation, the report and the court should consider the possibility of making reparation to the wider community. There may be reasons why that is not appropriate, but it is unlikely that the victims' feelings that reparation was inappropriate to them would lead directly to the consequence that reparation was inappropriate.
<P>
I take the hon. Gentleman's point that we would not want to put the victim in the embarrassing position of being blamed for refusing reparation. I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman's sentiment there. I will undertake to consider his point carefully and look into the best way of ensuring, through guidance, that that sort of mistake cannot be made. The provision is unlikely to lead to that outcome, but I note the hon. Gentleman's concern. If it is necessary to have belt and braces to be certain, I am more than willing to examine the matter further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response and for his understanding of the basis of our viewpoint. Subsection (11) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The court shall give reasons if it does not make a reparation order in a case where it has power to do so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So for every case where the court has the power to make an order, it has to give its reasons. As the Minister rightly said, inquiries will have been made to establish whether the victim is prepared to give consent. As he also rightly said, a belts-and-braces approach is necessary to ensure that victims will not be embarrassed. As the Minister is prepared to look further into the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may debate clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to go over old ground, but we have been concerned throughout the Committee to ensure that we receive accurate information on how the orders are working. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on offences for which reparation orders are available as sentences. We imagine that they will be widely available from the outset and that they will not need to be piloted in the way that other sentences created in the Bill will be--for example, with drug treatment and testing orders. We look to the Minister for confirmation.
<P>
Moving more widely into stand part territory, I do not want to go back over our arguments about compensation, save to say that it is a serious matter and that we hope that the experience of courts and of victims will be considered and researched by the Home Office. If the measure needs to be changed to make it more flexible, we hope that Ministers will adopt a flexible approach and do what is necessary to achieve our common objectives of making reparation as effective a sentence as possible; of making it work to put things right for victims; and of making offenders think about the consequences of their actions. Reparation orders should be made available as widely as possible across the country and across a wide variety of offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman introduced his points constructively. I want to respond to his last point. It is certainly the Government's intention to consider how reparation orders work, to ensure that they work effectively and to change or develop them in the light of experience. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman was so positive about his wish to see them work effectively.
<P>
I want to correct one point regarding piloting. We intend to pilot the measures. It could be seen as a straightforward and effective idea, but it is easy to introduce something that seems simple and to find out later that it has gone wrong because problems were not anticipated. A short period of experience can show that things can go wrong.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Reparation schemes, in rather a crude form, have been introduced in several areas. The Thames Valley police have been courageous in introducing reparation, but the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) gave us an example of how things had gone wrong. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North described some successful experiments. I also know of some good reparation schemes. We must learn from the bad and the successful experiences and ensure that things do not go wrong in future.
<P>
We will set up reparation order pilot schemes to run from the autumn. That will not prevent the introduction of voluntary schemes, but it will provide proper oversight and evaluation. It will ensure that when the schemes are rolled out nationally, they will operate according to standards and criteria that are understood, and will be fully effective.
<P>
I understand the hon. Member for Hertsmere's concern that there should be a report each year. At the end of the first year, it will be appropriate to take stock as part of the 18-month pilot scheme. However, it would be confusing to include voluntary schemes, as statutory schemes will be available only in the pilot areas. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that as matters progress, we should know in which areas schemes are available. During the 18-month period, we hope that other areas will learn from the pilot schemes and will prepare to be part of the national roll-out of the scheme.
<P>
It will be easy to provide details about areas that have statutory schemes through an annual parliamentary question. We can deliver the information to Parliament without the need for the amendment. Indeed, we should want to go further than that and give Members of Parliament information about the way in which the reparation orders work during the pilot stage, about the results of the evaluation and about best practice in introducing or strengthening reparation in other elements of sentencing.
<P>
I hope that that information will satisfy the hon. Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I had assumed that such extensive piloting would not be necessary because, in some ways, reparation orders are a less complicated sentence than drug treatment and testing orders. The Minister says that it is important to get things right. That is a fair point. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath, in his valuable contribution this morning, showed what can happen when things go wrong.
<P>
I want to turn again, for the last time, to the issue of compensation orders. That will be my third bite at that cherry. The fatal flaw in the Government's proposals is the lack of ability to award monetary compensation and it will result in many problems. Will the Government consider that matter during the monitoring period? Above all, will they also consider, during piloting, how victims will perceive the reparation orders?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am happy to confirm that the views of victims will be an important part of the evaluation process. We shall take account of the views of all those involved in the process of reparation and of people in the wider community. I am glad to give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that we shall not consider only the views of the offender and those who supervise him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to press the amendment to a vote and, in the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or, where the offender is aged over 16 years, a community service order'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 314, which refers to flexibility in sentencing, can be dealt with briefly. Schedule 5 covers what will happen when someone fails to comply with a reparation order. We do not want the courts' hands to be tied; they should have the maximum amount of flexibility. We want to explore whether the courts can make a defendant who is in breach of a reparation order perform a community service order when the offender is over 16 years of age. We want the courts to have that additional element of flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The amendments would extend the list of breach options to include the community service order for those aged over 16. It is an unusual age range because the phraseology normally used is ``for those aged 16 and over''. There could be confusion. It is not confusing in normal language, but it is a use of language that I have discussed with many people on various occasions. We need clarity so that youngsters who commit a breach know that there are strong penalties available to the court and that breaches are regarded seriously. I hesitate to extend the range of options.
<P>
The community serivce order, which is available for imprisonable offences only, is about preventing further offending by reintegrating the offender into the community, through punishment by means of positive and demanding unpaid work, keeping to disciplined requirements and through reparation to the community by undertaking socially useful work. As I said earlier, the reparation element is contained within the national standards for community work.
<P>
The amendments would add nothing of value to the breach arrangements. I understand the point of the hon. Member for Hertsmere that they would add slightly to the flexibility of the courts, but I am not convinced that they would add to their powers or the serious considerations that would weigh with the young offender if he thought of not fulfulling the court's requirements. If the court considers that a breach needs a response beyond that available under the Bill, it can discharge the order and resentence. There are considerable options available to the court. In view of those comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 315, in page 104, line 38, leave out `or' and insert

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 281, in clause 68, page 54, line 46, leave our `or' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but may only sentence the offender to a detention and training order if the seriousness of the offence for which he was made the subject of a supervision order is commensurate with such a sentence.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is not an amendment that I shall be pressing with any vigour. We believe that serious consequences should follow when an offender has failed to comply with an order. The purpose of the amendment is to explore the position regarding sentences of detention and training. We looked for some information from the Minister about that, especially in view of the comments to the effect that reparation orders should be for offences at the lower end of the tariff. We are looking for guidance from the Minister in this exploratory amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Schedule 5 puts in place a series of procedures analagous to those that will be available for the supervision order when the changes introduced by the Bill have taken effect. It may be that the similarity with the supervision order has led the hon. Member for Hertsmere to confuse amendment No. 315 with one dealing with the supervision order. Amendment No. 315 refers to the supervision order rather than the action plan or reparation orders.
<P>
When a young offender has failed to comply with one of the orders--an action plan, a reparation or a supervision order--the courts will have available to them the following options: the imposition of a fine of up to &#163;1,000; a curfew order; an attendance centre order under section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982, either in addition to or as well as varying the order; or to discharge the order and to resentence for the original offence. Alternatively, when the original order is made by a Crown court, the youth court may commit the offender to the Crown court to be resentenced for the original offence.
<P>
Schedule 5 and the charges contained in clause 68 will make the enforcement of breaches of the three types of order effective. Resentencing for the original offence under these provisions will be limited in such a way that the court can make a new sentence only in a manner in which the offender could have been dealt with if the order had not been made in the first place. The restriction on resentencing would mean that a court could only give on such occasions a detention and training order if the offence for which the juvenile had been originally convicted met the seriousness tests set out in section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Additional tests are present within the detention and training order provisions if the offender is aged under 15 years of age.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 315 and 281 would insert in the breach of procedures a restriction on the use of the detention and training order in resentencing by limiting it to only appropriately serious offences. However, it is unnecessary because of the existing section 1 tests which I have already described to the Committee. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman a satisfactory answer.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It does. The amendment was put in that form because I wanted to obtain an explanation from the Minister. I understood that schedule 5 covered what would happen when there was a breach of a reparation order. It also covers other orders, as the Minister said, but I was particularly interested in the reparation order as it is a new one. We covered the ground on reparation orders and where they fit into the tariff in an earlier debate but, as the Minister said, they will be subject to the other provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 regarding the seriousness of offences. The purpose of the amendment was to explore that, but it is probably on all fours with the 1991 Act. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 369, in page 104, line 48, leave out `of the breach'.
<P>
Schedule 5 deals with the enforcement, variation and discharge of reparation and action plan orders, the presence of the offender in court and on remand when such proceedings are on-going, and some further supplemental provisions.
<P>
Paragraph 3 of schedule 5 requires the youth court, when dealing with an offender who has received a reparation or action plan order from the Crown court and who is to be returned to that court for a breach hearing, to provide for the Crown court a certificate to the effect that the offender has failed to comply with the requirements of his order. Unfortunately, this paragraph contains an error; amendment No. 369, which is a drafting amendment, corrects the position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment deals with the circumstances in which it is necessary for an offender to be held in custody in order for him to be brought before a court. We are anxious in all cases to try to keep younger people out of prisons. We accept that there are times when they need to be held in secure conditions in order to bring them to court, but we are concerned that such secure conditions are not those of an adult prison. We are putting down a marker. We want to know the ages of young people who spend time in adult prisons. Without making a particular point, it is important that adults and young people should be separated. The amendment is a reflection of the general proposition that, whenever possible, young people should be kept out of adult prisons. By young people, we mean those aged under 21. Subsection (6), on reparation orders, covers offenders aged over 18, but we are keen to keep all people aged 18 to 21 out of adult prisons if possible.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that I have long wanted young people to be kept out of adult prison accommodation. I am pleased that the enthusiasm of the Conservative party as represented here is greater in opposition than it was in Government.
<P>
	There are problems in adopting the approach suggested by the hon. Gentleman Amendment No. 316 would place a limitation on where, under the action plan and reparation order provisions set out in schedule 5, a youngster who had attained the age of 18 could be placed if he was committed by a court to coustody pending an appearance before a court. The amendment would make it impossible for a court to place such a juvenile in a prison, but he could be sent to other accommodation as appeared to the court to be suitable.
<P>
	Although I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, it is not necessary. The courts will be dealing in those circumstances with people who have reached the age of 18, who, in those circumstances, are adults and they should therefore be treated on that basis.
<P>
	With a juvenile who has been committed to custody pending an appearance before a court to deal with breach arrangmeents, the committal must be to local authority accommodation. Only when such a person in breach has attained the age of 18 can a court make the committal to custody to a remand centre or a prison. Paragraph 4(6) of schedule 5 makes it clear that if the offender is 18 or over when he is brought before the court, he shall not be remanded to local authority accommodation. The choices open to the court if the amendment were accepted are therefore limited. The amendment is unhelpful.
<P>
	Clause 68, on the other hand, makes the enforcement of breaches of supervision order requirements more effective. It also makes provision that when a supervision order imposed by the Crown court is breached, the breach proceedings are heard by the Crown court. The clause simplifies the existing breach arrangements and extends the options open to youth courts when dealing with young offenders for breach of supervision order requirements.
<P>
The courts will be able to impose a fine, make a curfew or use the other options available. Clause 69 also creates powers for the youth courts to remit breaches of Crown court imposed supervision orders to the Crown court, and powers for the Crown court to re-sentence for the original offence. Those changes place supervision orders on the same footing as other community sentences, as well as providing for more effective responses to breaches of supervision orders.
<P>
Amendment No. 282 would place a limitation on where a juvenile could be placed if he were committed by court to custody pending appearance before the Crown court. The amendment would make it impossible to place such a juvenile in an adult prison, but it would require that a committal to custody would have to be made to other secure accommodation. Again, I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, but it is not necessary and is too limiting. The revised version of section 15 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 would be subject to the existing provision in section 23 of that Act.
<P>
Section 23 of the 1969 Act, which will be amended by the Bill, gives the courts powers to commit a child or young person for sentence to local authority accommodation. The amendments to the Act proposed under clause 89 of the Bill will give the courts additional powers to commit12 to 16-year-olds to local authority accommodation with a security requirement, provided certain strict criteria are met. The courts will therefore have some flexibility about where the young person might be accommodated, a flexibility that would be limited under amendment No. 282. That amendment is therefore unhelpful.
<P>
Clause 74 puts in place arrangements to deal with a young offender subject to the new detention and training order, who offends during the currency of the order. The clause aims to provide an additional deterrent to further offending for those subject to the new order.
<P>
Subsection (1) states that these provisions apply to those subject to a detention and training order if they commit a further imprisonable offence after the release from custody and before the expiration of the order. Subsection (2) provides that, on conviction for a new imprisonable offence, the court can impose a period of detention, irrespective of how it decides to deal with the offender for the new offence. Subsection (2) also states that the offender may be detained in such secure accommodation as the Secretary of State may determine for the whole or part of that period of further detention.
<P>
The provisions allow some flexibility as to what secure facilities might be used for the offender to serve the further period of detention. The purpose of that flexibility is to ensure that the placement of the offender is not constrained by where he was placed for the original detention and training order as set out in subsection (7) of clause 71. Any further placement will clearly need to take account of the nature of the further offence, the offender's age and maturity--similar considerations that led to the original placement under the detention and training order.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 329 and 330 are linked. They would introduce into the Bill restrictions on the placement in secure facilities for those offenders who have been convicted of a further offence under the terms of clause 74, so that those aged 16 years and under could not be placed in an adult prison.
<P>
Those two amendments are unnecessary and curious. They are unnecessary in that they do not recognise the thinking behind the new detention and training order, which is that young offenders should be placed in secure accommodation depending on their age and maturity, rather than some other artificial constraint. The amendments are curious in that the proposed restrictions apply only to those aged 16 years and under, which means those who have not yet reached the eve of their 17th birthday. The hon. Gentleman has not explained why he omitted 17-year-olds. The proposition also contains some internal inconsistencies.
<P>
With that explanation, and what I have already said on amendments Nos. 216 and 283, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response. We shall return to the earlier part of his remarks about young people in prison on later amendments. I do not want to give the Committee too much of a trailer for that debate. I shall read carefully what the Minister said. He suggested that amendment No. 316 would prevent such a person being held in prison and that it would be unduly restrictive. I am surprised that the Minister and those advising him have made that interpretation. The amendment would insert the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other accommodation as appears to the court to be suitable for accommodating the offender.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment puts forward an alternative, which would include prison if the court thought it necessary. The purpose of the amendment is to give the courts a nudge in the direction of not sending such offenders to prison and to widen the range of options that they have to deal with such a person. I do not see how the amendment could be considered restrictive.
<P>
I am a little more worried about the Minister's reaction to amendment No. 282. It relates to the breach of supervision orders under clause 68(1)(c). Where an order is made by the Crown court, it would allow for such a young person to be committed in custody. We may have got it wrong, but supervision orders relate to young people rather than older people. It is the young person's alternative to probation. The age range for supervision orders is 10 to 17, and we want to ensure that children in that age range are not held in adult prisons. We are worried about 15 and 16-year-olds who are held in remand in adult prisons. We will discuss that when we reach a later amendment. Amendment No. 282 spells out that if a person who is in breach of a supervision order has to be held in custody in secure conditions, it should not be in an adult prison. We shall read what the Minister said at greater length, but we want to ensure that no such children would be held in an adult prison.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> In some circumstances, inappropriate results would follow --for example, if a short remand was required to enable a court to take further decisions, the only secure accommodation available might be some distance away, which would complicate the taking of instructions and discussions with the young person and their family about the arrangements. I accept that young people should be housed appropriately whenever possible, but in some circumstances, especially when the term of remand is short, it is in the interests of young people to allow greater flexibility than the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I know that the reason that the Minister has just given has been given more generally as a reason why 15 and 16-year-olds should be held in adult prisons. The range of alternative provision should be extended to make it possible for such people to be held locally, so that they can see their legal representatives and their families without their being held in adult prisons. We shall debate that later; I do not want to trail the debate too much, because I am looking forward to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I do not want to trail the responses to a later debate either, but in opposition we attempted to persuade the previous Government that the provision of secure accommodation at a local level, rather than remote from the homes of young offenders, was preferable to the option that they chose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We shall debate the matter later; much will be said about it. The Government must realise that they have been in power for a year and that we are examining their record. They cannot rely too much on what happened under the previous Government--especially when that Government have a better record on the provision of secure accommodation.
<P>
Mr. Michael rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We shall have the debate now if we are not careful; the Minister and I will have to contain ourselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The Conservatives do not have a better record. Moreover, as Conservative Members spent the period 1979 to 97 referring everyone back to previous Administrations, for me to so after 12 months is quite modest.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is quite enough about past records.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall move away from more contentious ground. The Minister understands my point. I shall read his response at length, with the care it requires. I do not want to be presumptuous, but will he write and tell me whether someone who is in breach of a supervision order may be held in an adult prison under clause 68? What is the current practice for dealing with such people? Have they been held in adult prisons in any circumstances? Is that permissible under the law as it stands? I think that the Minister is nodding and that he is prepared to write to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman as he requests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments deal with action plan orders for 10 to 17-year-olds, which require the offender to comply with certain requirements and subject him to supervision. That is rather similar to the effect of supervision orders with a condition of intermediate treatment--something presently used by the courts. The latter orders, under section 12 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, could require a defendant to reside at and go to certain places, and, for a maximum of 90 days, to participate in certain activities.
<P>
The action plan appears similar and is limited to three months. We think that that is long enough for the activities and the treatment side of the regime, but on the short side with respect to supervision. Under the old supervision order with the condition of intermediate treatment, which I imagine will still be available, the supervision order could last longer than 90 days. We understand that the action plan orders will impose treatment with supervision, as compared with supervision with treatment under supervision orders. Amendment No. 238 would allow an action plan order to last up to six months. That would give the courts greater flexibility--in particular to order supervision to run alongside the activities and, if appropriate, for longer than the activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall be brief in responding. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that the supervision orders would remain available--and so would supervision orders with an intermediate treatment requirement. Increasing the action plan period from three to six months would introduce potential confusion between action plan orders and supervision orders--the very mischief that the hon. Gentleman has said he wants to avoid.
<P>
We intend the action plan order to entail an individually-tailored approach. The breadth and flexibility of the requirements that may be included would make such an order, by definition, extremely intensive and demanding over a short period. A young offender subject to such an order might be obliged to comply with several different requirements. That could take up much of the time of those who were still at school or were in employment.
<P>
The action plan regime is thus different from that of supervision orders--including supervision orders with an intermediate treatment requirement--which are less focused and last longer. However, it would be for the courts to decide what regime to impose on sentencing. The closely focused period of three months gives the action plan order its distinctive quality. We want the courts to have a range of options, each one distinctive and capable of being fully understood by the courts, the young offenders and everyone involved in the court process.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned the proposed further hearing arrangements and the relevant intervals, but I should be happy to respond if he wished to develop that aspect of the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is, I believe, referring to amendments Nos. 225 and 226, which relate to very minor points. On reflection, although I thought that there was a scintilla in them, I judged that it was not sufficient to develop into open debate. On any view the amendments are perhaps too much matters of detail to deal with in that way. As the Government are keeping an open mind on matters, perhaps they will consider those amendments in due course.
<P>
I hear what the Minister says about the substantive point on supervision. However, the new action plan will, in any event, be similar to what is already available in supervision orders, which contain a condition of intermediate treatment. Increasing action plan orders from three to six months will not make any difference. The condition of treatment in the order, not the length of time, makes it similar to a supervision order. An increase from three to six months will merely increase the flexibility of supervision. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 241, in page 53, line 17, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where the offender is under the age of 16'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with a small point that I shall make briefly. Action plan orders can be made for offenders from the age of 10 to 17. If the offender is less than 16, the clause will require the court to obtain a report about his family circumstances before making an action plan. Why are 16 and 17-year-olds apparently excluded from that requirement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Whereas in law juveniles are all those over the age of 10 and under the age of 18, the criminal justice system makes a distinction between those under and over the age of 16. That is a common-sense distinction, because 16 is the school leaving age and people aged between 16 and 18 move from education into work--at least, the intention is that they move into work rather than into unemployment. However, I will not refer in extenso to the Government's policy on that.
<P>
Those over the age of 16 are, in many ways classified as near adults. The distinction manifests itself in various provisions. For example, some community sentences such as probation orders and community services order are available only to those aged 16 and over.
<P>
The clause continues to recognise that 16 and 17-year-olds are in a transitional stage between childhood and adulthood and that different consideration should be given to them. Many youngsters in that age group have left school and may be living independently of their parents. They may even have family responsibilities of their own. Therefore, the consideration given to their family circumstances is not the same as that given to younger children. However, the courts will consider carefully the circumstances of every offender before they make action plan orders or any other community sentence. That is a matter for guidance, not something that should appear in the Bill. I hope that that explanation satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
We shall be issuing comprehensive guidance on all the new measures in the Bill. That will include asking for sensitivity in cases in which youngsters over 16 have family circumstances or arrangements to which it is appropriate for a court to give greater attention. That should not be an absolute requirement, as it needs to be for those under the age of 16.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. As he knows, 16 and 17-year-olds are young persons in the eyes of the law. When they become 18, they become young offenders in its terms. Over the years, age limits have changed and risen, but we have different age limits for different matters.
<P>
The Minister said that the Government will give guidance for 16 and 17-year-olds. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 278, in page 54, line 20, after `offence' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`punishable with imprisonment in the case of a person aged 21 or over'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wish to explore a small point briefly, and it might not amount to anything in light of the Minister's explanation.
<P>
The clause concerns supervision orders. Subsection (4) rewrites section 12AA of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. That relates to residence requirements whereby an order can be made requiring the offender to reside in local authority accommodation. Section 12AA set out the conditions that had to be fulfilled before such an order could be made. One of the conditions was that the offender, in the case of an adult, had committed an offence punishable with imprisonment during the currency of the order. The new condition mentions the commission of an offence, but leaves out the stipulation that it should be an offence punishable with imprisonment in the case of an adult.
<P>
I ask the Minister to confirm that our understanding is correct. If it is, why has such a provision been introduced? Does it amount to a deliberate lowering of the threshold of the seriousness of the offence that can require a young offender to live in local authority accommodation? A wide range of offences is punishable with imprisonment in the case of an adult, but the measure seems to extend the provision even further to cases that are not punishable with imprisonment. Will the Minister clarify the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Clause 67 is designed to achieve two things that will strengthen existing supervision orders. First, if will enable conditions requiring reparation to the victims of an offence or to the community at large to be attached to the order.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere referred to the second element by which we seek to simplify the conditions that must be satisfied before the courts can impose a requirement to live in local authority accommodation. At present, a resident requirement can be used only if the offender commits a further serious imprisonable offence. The clause simplifies the conditions to allow the court to impose a residency requirement where the offender, while subject to a supervision order with requirements, breaches those requirements and commits any further offence.
<P>
	The court will need to be satisfied that the offender's living arrangements contributed to his offending behaviour and that a residency requirement will assist in his rehabilitation. That gives the court the power to impose a residency requirement when it thinks that that is appropriate after a breach of the previous specific conditions.
<P>
	I worked with young people before entering Parliament. I saw many of them move from home or care into independent living and into fairly chaotic lifestyles in which the influence of their peer group could be damaging. Therefore, it is sensible for the court to have the flexibility to be able to intervene in circumstances when living conditions are relevant to the offending and when intervention will prevent the offending from continuing and becoming more serious. That is in the interests of the young persons involved, their potential victims and the wider community.
<P>
	The court will have to consider the circumstances and be satisfied that they are appropriate. I urge the hon. Gentleman to accept that the court should have flexibility and not, as in certain cases, be forced to stand by when an offence draws attention to circumstances that give rise to concern. It should not have to say that it cannot do anything because the offence is not sufficiently serious. It is in the interests of the young person for the court to have both power and flexibility.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is correct in the general run of things, but it is a question of how serious the offence has to be before we start to consider such a step. We do not want the courts to be unable to place in local authority accommodation those who have committed serious offences. However, a change has been made and the words ``punishable with imprisonment'' have been deliberately deleted in the case of an adult. The Minister referred earlier to ``a serious imprisonable offence'', which is not the right description to apply here, because the deletion means that the offence does not have to be punishable with imprisonment at all. As the law stood before the deletion, it was ``any offence punishable with imprisonment'' rather than ``a serious imprisonable offence''. The Committee should reflect on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> If my use of the phrase has misled the Committee, it was not my intention to do so. I did not mean to indicate a serious and imprisonable offence but a serious offence--one that is imprisonable. I did not seek to imply the distinction drawn by the hon. Gentleman; if I misled him, I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has been generous but there is no need for him to apologise: he was certainly not trying to mislead the Committee. I suspect that the Minister's instinct is the same as that of Conservative Members on this matter--a restriction to serious offences. He is now saying--and I did not interpret him differently--that the offence is serious because it is imprisonable rather than that it is imprisonable and serious as well.
<P>
I was about to say that the Committee needs to consider how wide the net is for offences punishable by imprisonment. We are not talking about what the public would regard as the most serious offences--robberies, serious woundings or burglary. Imprisonable offences--any offences punishable by imprisonment--go down to the minor offences of shoplifting and criminal damage. In theory, those are all punishable by imprisonment. The deletion has the effect of saying that for offences even less serious than those, a youngster could be put into local authority accommodation.
<P>
If I wanted to be contentious--I do not because the Government have not fully weighed up the problem and there is scope for them to think again--I would ask for an example of an offence not punishable with imprisonment that would merit such treatment. However, I merely want the Government to think again about the issue and the signals that are being sent out by the deletion. Deleting the condition that the offence is punishable with imprisonment for an adult effectively sends out the signal that the Government want to lower the threshold of seriousness for putting young offenders into custody--or, rather, into local authority accommodation. I am not convinced that the Govenment have fully understood that implication.
<P>
	We spotted the deletion and we ask the Govenment to think about it. However, given the lateness of the hour, I shall be seeking the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment. At the same time, I invite the Minister to throw some further light on the deletion. I want to know what inferences we should draw from it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to tease out what is happening and I am happy to try to assist him. He made a slip of the tongue, which betrayed some confusion, when he first referred to custody but withdrew it and then referred to local authority accommodation. The tests for custody are about protection of the public and the appropriate level of punishment. The tests for local authority accommodation are likely to be more about stopping offending as it develops. We are dealing here with youngsters who are already within the criminal justice system: they have reached the point not only of supervision but a breach of supervision. So it is likely that other developments will have taken place earlier in the offending career.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman invited me to provide examples of non-imprisonable offences that might lead a court to move in this direction. I shall offer two. One is causing harassment, alarm or distress under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 especially if such an offence were seen by the court as part of a pattern of activity and a deterioration in a young person's circumstances. A second is the throwing of missiles, indecent or racial chanting or going on to the play area under sections 2, 3 or 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that in a particular environment a youngster with an offending career who becomes involved with a particular peer group might give a court grounds for concern. It is not difficult to conceive of circumstances in which the court's ability to exercise the power would be in the best interests of the youngster. I am not suggesting that the court should exercise its power in all circumstances, but that it should have the flexibility to exercise it in appropriate circumstances. I seek to rebut only the argument that that flexibility should be removed as the amendment suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am still not convinced. The Minister has given us two examples but I am unsure how realistic they are. He needs to take account of a whole range of offences at the lower end of the scale. If I took the proposal away for further analysis, I could provide some examples that might persuade the Committee that people were going to be placed in local authority accommodation for offences that were not very serious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The whole point is that in those circumstances the court would be able to make precisely that judgment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is right. We have to cater for every possible judgment that can be made by the courts. The Minister will realise that a current provision is now to be deleted, but I do not want to go over the whole argument again and prolong our proceedings unnecessarily. However, I want the Minister to think about the signal being sent and that it is worth exploring it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 228, in page 55, line 30, after `child', insert `over the age of 12'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 229 in page 55, line 41, leave out from beginning to end of line 2 on page 55, line 43, leave out `further offending by him' and insert `serious harm'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to the serious issue of the Government's new sentence of detention and training orders for young offenders. It is important for us to consider what criteria will be employed in applying them.
<P>
Amendment No. 228 raises a serious issue about the age range over which detention and training orders are to be available. The Committee will know that the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 introduced a new form of sentence, the secure training order for young offenders between the ages of 12 and 15. Narrowly prescribed criteria had to be fulfilled before such a sentence could be given.
<P>
I do not want to go over old debates, because we are interested in what is happening now. The Government's attitude to the sentence has changed several times. They started out with a record of opposing sentences for 12 to 14-year-olds. In a written answer of July 1997 we were told that the Government had changed their mind and were going to introduce secure training orders under the provisions of the 1994 Act. When the ``No More Excuses'' White Paper was published in November we were told that the Government would not introduce the secure training order, which was to be subsumed within the new sentence of detention and training for 10 to 17-year-olds.
<P>
So interesting policy developments have taken place. The secure training order was ruled out, introduced and then abolished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong in his historical description. I do not want to detain the Committee, but before the general election we made it clear that we would review the situation that we found when we came into office. Once we were in government, we did that and we said that we would implement the order. At that point we made it plain that we intended to clear up the confused matter of secure accommodation orders that we found. We have moved swiftly to do that--there is no inconsistency whatever in our approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister will remember the debates that we had.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> As do the rest of us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As do the rest of us, says my hon. Friend. I do not think that secure training orders were part of the Labour Party's manifesto during the election campaign. It is fair enough to say that a review would take place. However, at that time Labour party policy was to oppose training orders, as it had been since 1994.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes the mistake of believing everything said by the former Home Secretary, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard). Most of what he said was inaccurate, pretty unproductive and pretty ineffective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): Disgraceful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to discuss the record of the previous Home Secretary, I am happy to go on to that. The hon. Gentleman should take care to examine the record of the present Government when we were in Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No, I am making an intervention. If the hon. Gentleman reads Hansard, he will see that his remarks are inappropriate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The record of the previous Home Secretary is not a matter for debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister refers to Hansard. I refer Committee members who wish to examine the matters under discussion to the record of debates on what became the 1994 Act. That shows that the Labour party and the Minister consistently voted against the secure training order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that the Minister is giving a commitment that his boss can match the record of the previous Home Secretary in reducing crime during his tenure in office?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Whether the Minister succeeds in that is an interesting matter. He is certainly managing to succeed in setting a record for introducing sentences for young people. When in Opposition, the Government said a great deal in debates about 12 to 15-year-olds. However, they are now introducing the possibility of keeping 10 and 11-year-olds in secure conditions. I cannot begin to imagine what Labour Members would have said if the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, introduced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe had included sentences for offenders aged 10 and 11. I should add that my right hon. and learned Friend rightly took pride in the record of falling crime during the past four years.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I certainly intend to speak on the amendments, but will my hon. Friend reflect on the following matter? He has mentioned debates on the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. He was involved in those debates, so was the Minister as Opposition spokesman, and so was I. We spent 180 hours in Committee. Despite their levity, Labour Members might be interested to know that we sat all through the night--
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> We will do it again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We will do so again if the Minister presses us, so that we can explore in detail the U-turns that the Labour party has made. Labour Members were elected on a manifesto that consistently followed through everything that the Labour party said in opposition. They opposed secure training. Now they are standing on their heads and supporting it.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Home Secretary, in his opening speech, was frank enough to acknowledge that throughout the 1980s the Labour party was wrong and the Conservative party was right. I praised him for that in my speech on that occasion. He said that in clear terms. He concedes that the Labour party has done a U-turn. Despite all the levity of Labour members of the Committee and the Minister's synthetic rage, why cannot they do so also?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This intervention is rather long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will not take the matter any further, save to say--
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
Conservative Members should remind themselves about the debate. Labour Members argued for the provision of secure accommodation locally, so that it could be related to other activities involving offenders' homes and families. That is precisely what I have heard Conservative Members arguing in an earlier debate, when it was more convenient to take that approach.
<P>
We have wandered into the territory of the record of the previous Home Secretary. His record on crime is one that Conservative Members--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, the interventions are getting rather lengthy. Secondly, hon. Members are constantly straying from the subject of the debate into the records of respective Governments. I ask members of the Committee to confine their remarks to the subject at issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Indeed, Mr. O'Hara. The Minister anticipated what I intended to say. The Labour party argued for alternatives to the secure training order. However, let us consider what the Government have delivered in relation to local authority secure accommodation. The Minister will be aware of the Government's pitiful record on that--[Interruption.] The Minister laughs, but let me remind him of how many places the Government have provided: six, after criticising the previous Government for providing 170.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has batted well; it has been a marathon innings. I hope that he will not start to test my patience at the end of the day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall carry my bat, Mr. O'Hara, and move on to the subject of 10 and 11-year-old offenders. That is a new subject and the Opposition should take it seriously.
<P>
The amendment relates to subsection (2)(b). To be fair, the Government do not propose to introduce custodial sentences for 10 and 11-year-olds, but the powers will exist for them to do so. The Government made that clear during the debates in another place. The Government are taking powers to introduce custodial sentences for 10 and 11-year-old children. The amendment makes it clear that custodial sentences of detention and training should be restricted to children over 12. The Opposition will not consider extending such sentences to 10 and 11-year-olds without good reason.
<P>
I was immediately interested in the subject when the proposals were introduced. I tabled a written question on offending by 10 and 11-year-olds. The answer revealed little evidence of an increase in offending among that age group; indeed, it showed that over a 10-year period the number of offences had decreased. It is difficult, therefore, to see from where the Government get their evidence.
<P>
We are all aware that children aged 10 or 11 can commit serious offences, and when they do so it is a matter of great public concern. Under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, the courts have the power to detain children convicted of the gravest offences, but I am sure that the Committee will agree that they should use them only for the commission of the gravest offences; detention and training should not be used for--I am sure that the Committee will understand what I mean by this--run-of-the-mill criminal offences, which although serious for victims are not so serious as to justify sentenceing a 10 or 11-year-old to custody.
<P>
We want to know why the Government propose to take such a step. What change justifies such a power? Where are not the rhetoric, but the facts and the evidence? What research and consultation have the Government undertaken? Above all, we want to know why the Government are taking what we regard as a radical step. We shall want to hear a convincing explanation from the Minister. We want not only to ensure that children are punished appropriately but that sentencing takes into account their long-term development. We put the Government on notice that we shall require them to make their case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am delighted to be able to speak on the amendment because, as the Minister is aware and as other Labour Members may have gathered from the interventions that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and I have made, Conservative Members have a long-standing interest in the issue. The Minister will recall that I spoke in detail in the House and in Committee during consideration of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill and he will be aware of my support for the provision of more secure accommodation by the Government and local authorities.
<P>
The Minister must come clean. He must recognise the concern of professionals about the Government's decision to close facilities at Colchester almost before they had opened. Arrangements were made for a new secure training centre attached to the military corrective and training centre, which hon. Members from both sides of the House and I visited during our consideration of the Armed Forces Bill just before the election. There was much cross-party support among hon. Members with experience of the law for the provision of such centres, but now the Labour party is in a cleft stick: it says that it believes in some expansion of secure training and provision, and in so far as it has had this belated conversion I welcome it, but despite that the Home Office is under the control of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I said that the Minister must come clean: he must admit that the Home Office does not have the money to put into practice many of the measures that it wishes to take.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is right to explore the matter further. Labour Members thought that I was joking when I spoke of sitting through the night, but we may have to do so to explore the issues more thoroughly. That is not an idle threat; we have done so before on various Committees. I speak for all my hon. Friends when I say that we can and will do it again.
<P>
I want to ensure that the Minister provides a proper explanation of how much funding the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary have given him for the new measure and tells us how many places he proposes will exist. I want to hear a pledge from the Government, although we have heard all sorts of reinterpretations of a pledge in terms of what can be carried out in the five years of a Parliament. When the Minister sums up, either in response to the amendments or to the clause stand part debate--although this is a matter for you, Mr. O'Hara, this may be such a fundamentally different subject that we need a separate stand part debate, which I hope you will consider--I hope that we shall hear how many places he proposes that there will be. I hope also that we shall hear a detailed explanation of why Colchester has closed and detailed funding figures for exactly how much is committed to the new places. It is to be hoped that we shall finally hear the Minister concede that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere was absolutely right to talk about the twists and turns of Labour party policy.
<P>
The Minister knows that I have been consistent in saying--to my own party when we were in Government--that we must have more secure accommodation. My own bitter experience in the courts in the midlands in the late 1970s and early 1980s was that there was never enough secure accommodation for juveniles who committed the most serious offences. On several occasions, I prosecuted or defended juveniles who faced the courts for offences of blackmail, robbery or arson, when many millions of pounds' worth of property had been burned to the ground and lives had been put at stake. There are few more serious offences, other than murder or manslaughter, than those.
<P>
In dealing with people who had committed such offences, courts were often at their wit's end, because no local authority accommodation was available. Before the Minister rises, as I anticipate he may, to argue that it is all the fault of the Tory Government, who did not provide places, the juvenile courts did not have such powers as a result of the legacy that we inherited in 1979, because the previous Labour Government did not run the economy sufficiently well to provide places. However, I know that you, Mr. O'Hara, will say that I am straying out of order if I delve into that part of history.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman, and he is straying very wide. I advise him that the further that he strays from the amendment, the less likely it is that I shall allow a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I accept that warning, Mr. O'Hara, and take it seriously, because I hope that there will be a separate stand part debate. However, I want the Minister to recognise that Opposition Members are very worried.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has tabled several amendments, but I should like to concentrate on amendment No. 232, because that is the one about which I feel most strongly. Restricting clause 69 to the extent that only further offending can operate as the trigger mechanism is too narrow. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter and return to it on Report. Of all the times that I have asked him to do so, so far I feel most strongly about this matter. He has been kind enough to recognise the seriousness of my and my hon. Friends' points and to say that he will reconsider them. Will he, with his officials, consider whether it might helpfully strengthen the Bill if he were to accept either the exact words of amendment No. 232 or at least a modified version of them? On reflection, the Minister may agree that a wider trigger mechanism would help the courts. A young offender may commit not just further offences but serious harm, which is the point of my reference to my past experience of juveniles who became involved in serious offences such as robbery.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We all know that in inner-city areas there has been a huge increase in street crime, sometimes by gangs that include very young juveniles. That crime includes muggings of pensioners or ladies, by teenagers armed with firearms or knives. Sometimes the gangs are led on by offenders in their late teens, but some as young as 12 or 13--or even younger--may be involved. Those are the offenders whom the courts might want to deal with in the way that we are considering. The Minister may therefore accept that ``serious harm'' would be preferable to ``further offending'' as a trigger mechanism.
<P>
Despite the fact that all hon. Members may have strong party political feelings about the matters that we are discussing, I sometimes resent the Minister's attempts to rewrite history. However, I shall not go into that matter now. I am making a serious and constructive point, despite my party political feelings on some of the relevant matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman's last comments, I shall not stray too far into remarks about pots and kettles. My record over the years speaks for itself.
<P>
The Colchester closure was due to the fact that the exercise was extremely expensive; we do not believe in wasting money. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath challenged me to state what finances would become available to provide places in the future. Our comprehensive spending review includes the question of future spending. The hon. Gentleman challenged me to say that we have no money for additional places. We are at present working within the spending limits left to us by the previous Government, as we made it clear we would. However, even within that constraint we have increased the number of secure places by six, by finding the money to renovate two units that the previous Government did not intend to renovate. I do not intend to rise to many of the debating points that were made, but I give Opposition Members notice that plenty of material is available to me should I want to--especially after the hon. Gentleman's attempt to blame the Labour Government of before 1979 for some of the ills of recent years.
<P>
We are committed to ensuring that the courts have a range of effective sentencing options--community based as well as custodial--so that the right approach can be taken with each offender. I hope that the community penalties that we have been debating will help to bring about the right overall balance. When young people commit serious offences or repeatedly offend, custodial penalties that can be served in facilities with a positive and constructive regime must be available to the courts. The Government strongly believe that custodial sentences are needed on occasion to protect the public by removing the young offender temporarily from the opportunity to offend. Appropriate regimes can help to prevent further offending.
<P>
The detention and training order would establish a single coherent framework that would impose increasingly stringent requirements before custody could be imposed on younger offenders. I agree that the need for detention and training orders for 10 and 11-year-olds has not been incontrovertibly established. The Bill contains a power for the Secretary of State to extend the provision to that age group. We intend to monitor the courts' use of detention and training orders for over-12s and the underlying rate of offending by 10 and 11-year-olds. If it proves necessary or desirable, the Secretary of State will exercise the relevant power. The intention is to make it possible to extend the provision if necessary, without having to wait for a further legislative opportunity.
<P>
The Committee can be assured that the Home Secretary would extend the scope of detention and training orders only through an order laid before Parliament. Evidence would have to be presented and debated. If the provision was extended to 10 and 11-year-olds, a court would, before imposing an order on such a young child, have to satisfy itself on three points; that the offending was serious enough to warrant the use of custody under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 tests; that the offender was persistent; and that only a custodial sentence would be adequate to protect the public from further offending by him.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 228 and 229 would withdraw the flexibility within the Bill to extend the range of detention and training orders to 10 and 11-year-olds. That is not helpful.
<P>
Amendment No. 232 is the last of the grouped amendments. Before imposing a detention and training order, the court must, as now, have regard to section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which restricts the use of custody to those instances where the court is of the opinion, first, that the offence is so serious that only such a sentence can be justified; and, secondly, when the offence is of a violent or sexual nature and only such a sentence would be adequate to protect the public.
<P>
With those under the age of 15, there will be a further test of persistence, and for those under the age of 12 the additional test will be that the court must be of the opinion that only--I underline the word ``only''--a custodial sentence would be adequate to protect the public from further offences.
<P>
Amendment No. 232 simply repeats the serious harm test of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 that applies to sexual or violent offences. Serious harm, in relation to the Criminal Justice Act, means death or serious personal injury occasioned by further offences. The condition that we propose for under 12s is to protect the public from further offending; that includes serious harm.
<P>
The criteria in the Bill strike the right balance between ensuring that the powers will be available to the courts when necessary and when all the criteria justify it, and ensuring also that they cannot be used gratuitously. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be content with my explanation of the intentions behind the provisions in this part of the Bill. I believe that they are wise and balanced. Work will be undertaken, as promised in the White Paper, ``No More Excuses'', to ensure that we develop a comprehensive approach and proper regimes for those youngsters who have to be held in custody.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I remain concerned. I cannot emphasise too strongly what a serious step the Government envisage taking. They are giving themselves the power to allow the courts to send 10 and 11-year-old children into custody with detention and training orders. It is a grave matter.
<P>
I understand that the Government are not introducing those provisions now, but that they are giving themselves the power to do so in future. My question--it has not been properly answered--is why the Government see fit to take such a power. As the Minister said, it will not be introduced through a further Bill, which can be debated in committee and on the Floor of the House, but by order. The Minister said that that there was no incontrovertible evidence to show that it was necessary to introduce such a sentence now.
<P>
These are serious matters and we may need to return to them at a later stage. We are allowing the Government to give the courts a sentence of detention and training for 10 and 11-year-olds. It is a radical step. We need carefully to consider whether it is justified. At the moment, the evidence seems unsatisfactory. The matter needs to be debated more widely. We may need to come back to it at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<b>Mr. Clappison</b>: I beg to move amendment No. 233, in page 56, line 10, leave out from `be' to `24' and insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments No. 283, in page 56, line 11, leave out subsection (6) and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6) The maximum term of detention and training that a Court including a Magistrates Court and Youth Court may impose for an offence is the same as the maximum term of imprisonment that it may impose for that offence.'.<P>

<P>
No. 284, in clause 70, page 57, line 1, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
No. 289, in clause 70, page 57, line 4, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6A) When a court takes account of any period for which the offender has been remanded in custody it shall state in open court that it has so taken account and the effect that this had upon the sentence.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This group of amendments is more technical. Two matters are covered by amendments Nos. 283 and 283, and I shall deal with them separately.
<P>
Amendment No. 233 deals with a sentencing matter. The Government are changing the nature of sentences that can be introduced for 12 to 17-year-olds, and possibly, in future, for 10 to 17-year-olds. Instead of courts having the flexibility to pass whatever sentence they see fit, they will be restricted to passing sentences of a determinate length--four, six, eight, 10, 12, 18 or 24 months. I anticipate that the Minister will tell us that there are resons why the Government want the provision to be introduced in that way and that they want particular activities, a certain form of treatment, education and training, to take place within a given period. that is all well and good, but the purpose of the amendment is to explore the technical sentencing difficulties that may result.
<P>
I can do no better than to quote David Thomas who is a reader in criminology at the university of Cambridge. He has been an authority on sentencing matters for many years and is the editor of ``Current Sentencing Practice''. He has written to me to say that he is very concerned about clause 69(5), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the term of a detention and training order shall be 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 or 24 months.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In his letter, David Thomas says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the legislation is passed in that form, it will cause endless problems in the courts. Far from promoting consistency in sentencing, it will lead to disparity and serious difficulty. Take two examples. A number of young persons all aged 17 are convicted of a series of commercial burglaries. The maximum sentence which could be imposed is 24 months. If the ringleader pleads guilty to the charges he is entitled in accordance with principles of sentencing and section 48 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to a discount on the sentence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall give way in a moment. The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The effect of that means that the next lowest sentence below 24 months is 18 months and the court must give him a discount so as to reduce his sentence to 18 months. Without this statutory restriction, the sentencer might, if he felt it appropriate, award a much smaller discount, say of three months, with the result that the sentence would be 21 months. In the same case, if the second defendant is significantly less responsible than the first defendant he will expect his sentence to be differentiated from that of the first defendant. This takes him to the next lowest step on the ladder, that is to say 12 months, and so on down the line. The practical effect of the provision will be the courts will be forced either to create an exaggerated differential between offenders convicted of the same offence or make no differentials at all.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before giving way to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath, I shall make a practical point that arises from that letter. It is all well and good for the Government to introduce compartmentalised periods of sentence, but they are introducing the measure on the basis of our present system of sentencing and the principles that are applied to it. The effect may be to create grave difficulties for the courts and could lead to injustice, including, as David Thomas said, when defendants receive a lower sentence than that they should properly have received in order to keep consistency with principles of sentencing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I have two points that I want to mention briefly to my hon. Friend, but before doing so, I have a question for you, Mr. O'Hara. It may almost be a point of order. You called the group of amendments, including amendments Nos. 285, 284, and 289, which are listed as amendments to clause 69, but they are printed as amendments to clause 70 in the amendment paper, and fall within a different group.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is quite common for amendments that refer to later clauses to be debated with amendments to the current clause. At the appropriate time, they are called formally, having already been debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. 
<P>
I wanted to interevene on my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere while he was quoting Professor Thomas, whose work we as lawyers of our generation will remember studying. I shall break off for a moment so that my hon. Friend can follow my logic.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he is making an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Indeed, Mr. O'Hara. My hon. Friend the member for Hertsmere will recall that when he and I were called to the Bar there was a provision in the law that a defendant between the ages of 18 and 21 coming before the courts might be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of between six months and three years. If he had previously been to borstal, the sentence would be between 18 months and three years, but he could not be given a sentence of imprisonment because borstal had to be considered first. Although borstal no longer exists, Proffessor Thomas's letter applies to exactly the same aspects of the law and the same restrictions. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere may remember this in the same detail as I do--as pupil barristers it was mother's milk to us--and in my first and, I am glad to say, successful appearance before the Court of Appeal I relied on Professor Thomas's articles on the law.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I interpret that as one single, extended point well made.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Indeed it was; I say only that I hope that the words of Professor Thomas have the same effect on the Committee as they had on the Court of Appeal.
<P>
We wish not to make a party political point but to avoid practical problems. We hope that the Government will reconsider the issue.
<P>
The Bill proposes a radical change that we considered in our debate on the repeal of section 37 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. It increases the maximum sentence that a magistrates court can pass on defendants aged 15, 16 or 17 from six months to two years, but before we consider the merits of the change we must consider the way in which the Government are making it. If the Government propose to do anything we are accustomed to their making a bit of a fanfare about it; they are not usually shy about telling us what they want to do. We wonder why they have been so shy about telling us about the proposed change--it certainly is not emblazoned across their consultation papers. Who have the Government consulted, and what research have they undertaken? This important issue must be considered carefully.
<P>
In speaking to amendment No. 285 I return to technical ground and to the views of the good Professor Thomas. In doing so, I do not make a party political point because clause 70(4) is reproduced from the Criminal Justice Act 1991, and possibly from other Acts. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where the aggregate term of the detention and training orders to which an offender would otherwise be subject exceeds 24 months, the excess shall be treated as remitted.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What will be the practical effect of that in operation? In the past, there have been some serious problems when courts have passed a sentence of detention which was meant to be subject to section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, but have not stated that that was so.
<P>
We are discussing detention and training, but there is another sentence of detention available under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act, which allows courts to pass much longer sentences in grave cases. There is great similarity between the names of the various sentences: the detention and training order, detention in a young offender institution and detention under the Children and Young Persons Act. In practice, even our high-quality and well-trained judges and recorders sometimes make mistakes.
<P>
If a judge makes a mistake and simply says ``detention'', but means to pass a long sentence for a grave offence under section 53 and there is an appeal, the point is made that there could have been confusion with detention in a young offender institution, or with detention and training orders. It is argued that the sentence should be remitted. Grave offences have taken place and judges have passed sentences of four, six or eight years' detention, but have failed to say that it was detention under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act.
<P>
There have been successful appeals involving serious offences because the courts could not be sure which form of detention was meant and have had to treat the sentence as one of detention in a young offenders institution. They have used the type of provisions that are set out in subsection (4) and remitted the excess sentence over two years. Serious offenders were given a much lesser sentence of two years, instead of receiving the long sentence that they deserved and needed. There is a string of cases in which such mistakes have been made.
<P>
If I am unable to convince the Committee about these matters, I shall consult ``Current Sentencing Practice'' during the dinner break and seek out the cases.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Through the dinner break?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Yes, through the dinner break. These are serious matters and it might assist the Committee and the Minister if I read out the cases in full. I had hoped that my arguments were strong enough to convince the Committee of the merits of my case without such supporting material. I do not seek to make party points. These are purely technical matters. The legislation was originally passed under a Conservative Government.
<P>
The wording of subsection (4) is the same as that in earlier criminal justice legislation, and it serves no purpose. The sentences should be subject to the same provisions as other sentences before the Court of Appeal; they should not be subject to the special provisions that will be made under subsection (4). Will the Minister take that into account and give the Committee a serious response? I await his comments with bated breath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I will be brief because I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will have the opportunity to go into some detail on reported cases.
<P>
I referred earlier to the fact that the predecessors of the Government's proposals have received much judicial attention and that I was lucky enough to be part of one of the leading cases on the previous law. That means I particularly sympathise with the important points that my hon. Friend made about the views of Professor David Thomas. Governments of all shades of opinion have come unstuck when they failed to heed the words of senior academics with experience of the courts. I hope that the Minister will consider seriously what my hon. Friend said. Will he and his officials examine Professor Thomas's comments carefully because he is one of our most respected criminal legal commentators?
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Hertsmere and for Gainsborough and myself have extensive experience of such cases going wrong in the courts. Professor Thomas argues strongly that if the drafting problem is not tackled, there will be problems in the courts. He means that and we should take him seriously.
<P>
I am sorry that none of the Minister's lawyer colleagues are present. The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) is not present, and neither are the hon. Members for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) and for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews), who is the most distinguished lawyer on the Government side, has been allowed to go to Hong Kong and was not even appointed to the Committee. Had that most distinguished counsel of the Crown, whom I have had the privilege of appearing against--
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> He is a good chap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman is undoubtedly a good chap. He is a good friend of mine and a superb speaker. The Minister would have benefited hugely from his presence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> There is no chance of that request being granted because the hon, and learned Member for Medway has a mind of his own. He is a rebel and speaks in Committee. We are still waiting for Labour members of the Committee to contribute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Minister has no support from legal brains, and earlier today the President of the Board of Trade and Secretary of State for Trade and Industry suggested that she had no respect for the legal profession. In response to a question from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), she described him as being a member of a closed shop. The Labour party has lost all its respect for the law.
<P>
I wish to take up the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. Professor David Thomas states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Clause 70(4) is a reproduction of Criminal Justice Act 1982 Section 1(B)(5). This provision has caused endless practical problems in the last few years which have surfaced in a long line of reported cases. The problem arises when a judge in the Crown Court intending probably to pass a sentence of detention under Section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 inadvertently or by a slip of the tongue omits the reference to section 53 of the 1993 Act. Because he is taken to pass the sentence of detention, possibly of very substantial length, Section 1B(5) comes into play and the sentence is automatically reduced to two years. The Court of Appeal cannot correct the error because the judge has passed a legal valid sentence, albeit not the sentence which he intended to pass and the Court of Appeal is not allowed to increase the sentence on the appeal except in the case of an Attorney General's reference.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I remind the Minister that a Conservative Government introduced the provision for an Attorney-General's reference.
<P>
Professor Thomas adds:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It will be far simpler if Paragraph 70(4) were omitted and a defendant sentenced to more than the permitted maximum could appeal against his sentence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Like me, my hon. Friend will want to be fair to the Minister. We understand that he has other things to do than spend the whole day reading sentencing practice, interesting and illuminating though that would be. Does my hon. Friend agree that if the Minister were to concede the force of our arguments and said that he would consider them, that would be a big step forward?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I entirely agree. I hope that the Minister will say that he will do that.
<P>
We are dealing with serious matters and are not wasting the Committee's time. We know that Professor Thomas has a valid point.
<P>
I was involved in the provision's predecessor when an assistant recorder at Birmingham Crown court got it wrong. The Court of Appeal could reverse the decision. Professor Thomas says that there will be a problem if the Minister does not withdraw the section on Report because the Court of Appeal will not be allowed to correct mistakes.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> In opening the debate the hon. Member for Hertsmere said that he would raise points of principle and of detail. Considerable detail has been put into the debate. Two hon. Gentlemen referred to Professor Thomas's comments on the Bill. I am happy to consider the comments that they quoted and to respond to them after the debate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath said that remarks by a distinguished academic lawyer should be taken seriously. The unspoken implication was that it would be unwise for a person without legal qualifications such as myself to take those remarks at a full gallop without having read them in full.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his generous approach. I forgot to look at notes that I made. I will refer him to the cases, as that will save me the necessity of having to refer to them after the adjournment debate. Volume one of Professor Thomas's ``Current Sentencing Practice'' refers to the case of Anderson, Eggdale and Venison, and volume two to the case of Marriott, Shepherd and Wilkins. Through his generous response the Minister has saved me from referring to those cases in detail--I say that as I hope that the Minister will be even more generous in his remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am sure that sales of the books of one academic will increase as a result of people reading our debates in Hansard.
<P>
I will respond briefly to the amendments. I know that is a bit of an innovation, Mr. O'Hara, but I thought that you might find it attractive.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It makes my decision on clause stand part much easier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Amendment No. 233 would allow detention and training orders to be imposed for any period between two and 24 months, as opposed to the discrete periods of four, six, eight, 10, 12, 18 or 24 months that we propose.
<P>
We propose those discrete periods for three good reasons. First, we want to make the sentence simpler and easier for the young person to comprehend. Secondly, we want to allow supervisors in the youth offending team and those who deal with the young person in custody to work with the young offender to produce a constructive sentence plan that is based on a fixed predetermined period. Having given great thought to the question of whether flexibility or determinate planned activity is appropriate, we have come down on the side of the latter.
<P>
Thirdly, we want to ensure that early release provisions in the detention and training order rarely mean that an offender who is given a longer sentence serves a shorter period in custody than one who is given a shorter sentence. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, such matters can become technical. I will examine the points that he made, but I beleive that we have ended up with the result that we intended to achieve.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman makes a great play of the suggestion that we are introducing a dramatic change in the law by allowing magistrates to impose a sentence of more than six months. Amendment No. 283 would unhelpfully limit the powers of the youth courts to impose detention and training orders up to the 24-month maximum. In cases where the youth court felt that a custodial sentence of six months was inadequate, it would have to remit the case to the Crown court for sentence. Such a restriction would be time-consuming and costly. That is why we have left it out of the new provisions.
<P>
We are not doing anything new. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 made precisely that arrangement. The only change relates to detention in a young offender institution for 15 to 17-year-olds, so we are not making the degree of innovation that the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<P>
It was said that we had not consulted on these matters. The proposals for the new detention and training order were set out in the White Paper, ``No More Excuses''. We also consulted a range of criminal justice agencies. Neither process produced anything to persuade us that we should change our proposals.
<P>
Amendment No. 285 would delete a safeguard provided in clause 70(4). Subsection (4) provides an upper limit to the court's power to impose consecutive detention and training orders so that 24 months is the maximum sentence. To do otherwise would appear unfair and be out of keeping with the existing sentence framework. Although I have undertaken to examine the hon. Gentleman's arguments, I believe that I am correct in what I say.
<P>
Amendment No. 284 would compel the courts to reduce the term of each detention and training order by the period of time spent on remand. It would remove the court's flexibility and prevent it taking account of the time spent on remand when sentencing.
<P>
Amendment No. 289 would introduce a new subsection to clause 70 that would require the amount of remand time that the court takes into account and the effect that that has on the sentence to be stated in open court. Under subsection (1), the court is already under a duty to explain why it is giving a custodial sentence and to give its reasons for the length of that sentence. I agree that that important information should be in the public domain, but the amendment would not lead to the courts giving any more useful information than is already required under subsection (1).
<P>
In view of the undertaking that I have given, and my explanation of why the amendments would not assist in the process that we are seeking to pursue, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. He accepted our argument that it is an innovation that 16 and 17-year-olds will now be subject to a higher maximum sentence in the magistrates courts. That is an important change. However, we are worried about the merits of that change; perhaps I should have spent more time on that subject in my opening speech.
<P>
We are worried about courts having to deal with more than one young offender at the one time. If, for example, one is 17 and the other is 18, the court will no longer have the power to remit the 17-year-old to the Crown court, which would allow him to be dealt with alongside the 18-year-old if the offence was serious. We shall consider the practicalities and the implications of that.
<P>
I turn to the Minister's reply to the technical matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath set out Professor Thomas's view of the problem, and I mentioned particular cases. The Minister has generously said that he will consider the problem. I stress that it is not a party political point. Contrary to what I said earlier, the provision was introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 1982, so it was in operation under the previous Government for even longer than I suspected. However, that does not exempt us from trying to put it right if it is causing practical difficulties.
<P>
On that basis I am satisfied with the Minister's comments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
