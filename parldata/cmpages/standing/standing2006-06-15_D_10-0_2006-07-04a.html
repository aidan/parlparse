&#147;ten years&#148; shall be deemed to be &#147;four
years&#148;.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(5) A donation
to a trade union shall not be a political donation for the purposes of
this Part to the extent that it is
made&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) to

<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 374</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(f) to otherwise promote good employment

relevant company includes the company by which the donation was made,
any holding company of the company by which the donation was made, any
subsidiary of such holding company or any subsidiary of the company by
which the donation was
made.&#146;.</div><a name="06070456000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070456000505"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): The subject matter is the
regulation of donations by trade unions and its relationship to
donations by companies. The amendments created a certain amount of heat
in our previous sitting, but I am not sure how much light was cast on
the issue.</div> <a name="06070456000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would take action on a potentially important problem: the
possibility of donations to political parties from companies being
laundered through trade unions so that a company evaded the requirement
for its shareholders to pass a resolution authorising such
donations.</div><a name="06070456000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
opposition to the amendments comes from the view that has been
expressed by the TUC that such donations would undermine the
independence of trade unions and get them into trouble with the
certification officer. I would like to make some points on those
matters, to which I hope the Minister will
reply.</div><a name="06070456000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
219 has one deeply unattractive aspect: it states something that is
simply not the case and goes into legal fiction. It says
that</div><a name="06070456000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a trade union is a
political organisation for the purpose of this
Part.&#148;</div><a name="06070456000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know that
that is not quite right. Trade unions that have not passed resolutions
to set up political funds are not allowed to be political
organisations; they are barred from such activities. Even unions that
have passed such resolutions are in reality industrial organisations,
but with a political aspect to their work. Their main work will always
be industrial.</div><a name="06070456000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording is unattractive and flows from the drafting of the clause,
which could have been more elegant. I hope that the Committee will take
into account the fictional aspect, which is intended to make amendment
No. 220 work rather than to cast aspersions on
unions.</div><a name="06070456000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the central
point about the laundering of donations via unions, the first question
to ask is whether it is possible for political funds to receive
donations from non-members of the union. If not, there is no route by
which a company can launder a gift to a political party by the method
in question. From a superficial reading of section 83 of the Trade
Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, it seems that it
is possible for people who are not members of a union to make donations
to its political fund. Section 83(1)(a)
states:</div><a name="06070456000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
may be added to a union&#146;s political fund only...sums
representing contributions made to the fund by members of the union or
by any person other than the union
itself&#148;.</div><a name="06070456000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
might have further comments to make, but at first sight that seems to
establish that a company could make a donation to a union&#146;s
political fund. Some unions, by their internal rules, rule out that
possibility and allow political funds to come only from members&#146;
contributions. However, nothing in the law requires a union to have
such a rule.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 375</div><a name="06070456000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second question is whether a
donation would undermine the independence of a trade union and
therefore make it completely implausible for it to take part in such a
scheme. Section 5 of the 1992 Act defines &#147;independent trade
union&#148; as</div><a name="06070456000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a trade
union
which&#151;</div><a name="06070456000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) is
not under the domination or control of an employer or group of
employers or of one or more employers&#146; associations,
and</div><a name="06070456000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) is not liable
to interference by an employer or any such group or association
(arising out of the provision of financial or material support or by
any other means whatsoever) tending towards such
control&#148;.</div><a name="06070456000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, we are
talking about &#147;domination or control&#148; or liability to
interference &#147;tending towards such control&#148;. The question
is whether a donation by a company to a union&#146;s
political fund&#151;separate from its general fund&#151;would
threaten that union&#146;s
independence.</div><a name="06070456000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
see how that could be, because a donation to a political fund for the
purposes of payment on to a political party would by that fact not
involve union management, negotiations with employers or any other
aspect of the union&#146;s activities as an independent body. It does
not threaten, in any way that I can see, the independence of the union
as defined in the 1992
Act.</div><a name="06070456000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given those two
statutory measures, I conclude that there is a problem: there is a
route by which a company can evade the provisions of the Bill. It could
give money to a political party through a trade union, and so undermine
the law. Although I find the drafting of the amendments unattractive, I
ask the Government to consider seriously whether that loophole should
be closed through an amendment&#151;if not the one before us, then
some other amendment to the Bill or to the underlying
legislation.</div><a name="06070456000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000506"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> I
want to start by going back to the genesis of the clause and the reason
that it is in the Bill. During our extensive consultation,
companies asked specifically that trade unions not be treated as
political organisations when companies decide on political donations.
That is the reason for the clause on trade
unions.</div><a name="06070456000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070456000507"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): This is an inquiry, Mr.
Illsley. Is membership of a trade union a registrable or declarable
interest in the context of this
debate?</div><a name="06070456000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000508"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That question is a matter for the register, not
the
Chair.</div><a name="06070456000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000509"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b><b class="B"> </b>I do not want any doubt to enter the debate.
If the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) so wishes, I shall declare
the fact that I am a member of the Transport and General Workers Union.
I have no doubt that probably all Members on the Government Benches are
members of one union or another, but in no way does that have an
inference in relation to what I just said. I hope the hon. Gentleman
will have the grace to accept
that.</div><a name="06070456000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000510"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> It was a question to the
Chair.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 376</div><a name="06070456000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000511"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I do not want any doubt to enter a debate on such
an important issue.</div><a name="06070456000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
put a clause in the Bill around trade unions because we were asked to
do so by companies. That is because we all know&#151;this is
accepted, even in the amendment tabled by Opposition
Members&#151;that companies provide a range of crucial facilities to
trade unions ranging from meeting rooms to employee time off, which
should not be regarded as a donation to a political party. I think that
is accepted by Opposition
Members.</div><a name="06070456000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070456000512"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Shailesh Vara</b> (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con): Were the
trade unions part of the consultation process and did they proffer
advice as to whether they agreed with the line proposed in
legislation?</div>
<a name="06070456000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000513"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I was not the Minister at the time, but my
information is that the clause was inserted at the behest of companies,
the CBI and others&#151;I am getting lots of nods. But of course,
during an inclusive consultation, we had contact with the trade unions
as well, so they will have had the chance to comment on those issues
and we will listen to their
representations.</div><a name="06070456000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000514"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I would be grateful if someone informed me what was
the exact advice from the trade unions, as they were part of the
consultation process. The Minister has been kind in pointing out the
CBI&#146;s position, but as a balance it would be useful to know what
was the advice given by the trade unions. If not now, I am happy to
receive that later.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000515"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> To be honest, the hon. Gentleman misunderstands the
purpose. I have a TUC briefing here. I have no doubt that it was sent
to him as well, as will be the case with the Law Society briefings and
everything else. If he reads that briefing, he will see that the view
of the trade unions collectively
expressed&#151;</div><a name="06070456000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000516"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> Actually, we have not received
it.</div><a name="06070456000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000517"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b><b class="B"> </b>As a broad-church party, I would have hoped
that the Conservative party was talking to trade unionists as much it
talks to business. That is what its leader would wish. It is most
interesting that Conservative Members still see themselves as a
partisan
group.</div><a name="06070456000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000518"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> This is to do with membership rather than
consultation.</div><a name="06070456000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000519"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Let others judge that; it is not a matter for me.
All I am doing is commenting on how Conservative Members think it
appropriate to carry out business. If the hon. Gentleman so wishes, I
shall send him my copy of the TUC
briefing.</div><a name="06070456000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
consultation with a huge range of people as we develop advice. I am not
even sure that there are minutes of those meetings, but I am not going
to undertake to provide them. The hon. Gentleman should consult the TUC
direct and I am happy to share with him the briefing that I received. I
have received 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 377</div>briefings from all sorts of people&#151;the CBI, the TUC, individual
companies, corporate lawyers, et al&#151;as we have developed the
Bill.</div><a name="06070456000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say to
the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Brokenshire), who moved the
amendment, that in setting out the issues on which he believes it
legitimate that there should be funding from companies for facilities
for trade unions, he has accepted, in conflict with what he is
asserting, that trade unions are essentially Labour party
organisations. That is not the
case.</div><a name="06070456000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trade unions can
and do undertake political activity, although it may interest
Conservative Members to know that of the about 170 trade unions, only
29 have a political fund, so there is no such general capacity across
the trade union movement. I was surprised by what a small proportion of
trade unions have a political fund. However, if the hon. Gentleman
accepts that those are issues, he cannot then define trade unions as
party political organisations and&#151;as insinuated by everything
that has been said, and even the body language this
morning&#151;Labour party
organisations.</div><a name="06070456000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">As in a
company, the core business of trade unions is to act in the interests
of their members, whether in negotiations on wages and salaries or on
conditions for their members, around health and safety issues or on
training, education and personal development issues. I am thinking in
particular of the impact that trade unions have had in supporting the
development of workers through trade union learning representatives,
which the Government
introduced.</div><a name="06070456000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unions
might look after the individual interests of members if they fall into
dispute with their employers at tribunals or get compensation if they
are injured at work. All that is the core business on which a trade
union will spend its
time.</div><a name="06070456000469"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06070456000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070456000520"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): I must apologise for not being
here on Thursday for the start of the debate. I agree with what the
Minister is saying about what trade unions can do to assist members in
the modern workplace, but she must be aware of the traditional
relationship between the Labour party and trade
unions.</div><a name="06070456000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context
of the Prime Minister&#146;s statement that the Government were going
to be purer than pure and whiter than white, does the Minister not
accept that however reasonable her arguments may seem in this room,
outside they will be perceived as a Labour Government giving trade
unions extra leeway that they are not giving to other organisations?
That is important to take into account too, because the clause will not
be perceived as whiter than
white.</div><a name="06070456000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000521"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> To be honest, and with the greatest respect to the
hon. Lady, that statement completely misunderstands what the clause is
all about. I really rather regret it. Most companies that have a trade
union with which they do business within the purview of the public
company recognise that there are huge benefits in getting maximum value
from and having a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 378</div>good relationship with their work force. If part of that relationship is
giving facilities to trade union representatives for all the reasons
that I have just enunciated and will not repeat, that is good business
practice.</div> <a name="06070456000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The genesis
of this has nothing to do with partial political interest. It is
entirely a response to representations that we received from companies,
which, with the greatest respect to the hon. Lady, do not see this as
party political in any way. It is nothing, nothing, nothing at all to
do with her insinuations. If I may say so, they demonstrate the
political prejudice that too many Conservative Members have against a
very important, long-established way of organising workers in the
workplace, which benefits not just those individuals, but collectively
ensures that the business maximises its value and best serves the
interests of its members. I am really sorry that she takes this very
prejudiced approach to trade union activity in the
workplace.</div><a name="06070456000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000522"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I note that the Minister said that this has nothing
to do with partial political interest. Does she honestly believe that a
contribution by trade unions of &#163;42 million to the Labour party
in the last parliamentary
Session&#151;</div><a name="06070456000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000523"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are not debating the relationship
between the Labour party and trade unions; we are debating the clause.
I am not going to allow a debate on party political
funding.</div><a name="06070456000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000524"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Thank you for that ruling, Mr. Illsley. I
just hope that hon. Members will remember what we are here to consider
in the context of the Bill. This is not a cheap attempt to score party
political points. The contribution made by the hon. Member for
Hornchurch from the Front Bench was not quite in the same vein as those
made from the Back Benches, but in view of the serious nature of a
measure that will affect companies over time and the fact that we are
trying to respond to a legitimate issue that has been raised&#151;not
by the trade unions, but by companies&#151;I regret that Conservative
Members are trying to develop the debate into a cheap political
diatribe.</div><a name="06070456000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the issue that we are trying to debate, the list demonstrates that some
Conservative Members understand that this is not a party political
issue. However, it is limiting in that it spells out activities but
does not get close to capturing the wide range of non-political
activities undertaken by trade unions, which are often of benefit to
and supported by
companies.</div><a name="06070456000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the clause is to make things simpler for companies to reduce their
administrative overheads. That is an underlying theme of the Bill, and
I hope that it is supported by Opposition Members. Providing companies
with a long list of approved trade union activities that they must
cross-reference before deciding whether they can legitimately expend
resources or time, or allow rooms to be used, would be inconsistent
with the principle that runs through the Bill. In restating part XA of
the Companies Act 1985, we have responded to requests from business to
provide clarity and simplicity.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000525"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. I apologise for
interrupting the Minister, but I have been reflecting on the
ruling that you gave to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara). We are debating the amendments that stand in
the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch, which are
specifically on the issue of donations to political parties and
organisations, and political expenditure. The Government, who are
resisting the amendments, happen to be from the Labour party, which
received &#163;42 million from trade unions in the previous political
cycle. I would have thought that a legitimate point to introduce to the
debate. I am sorry to challenge you, but will you explain why we are
not allowed to refer to
that?</div><a name="06070456000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000526"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is simply outside the scope of the Bill. The
hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire and the Minister were
debating the relationship between the Labour party and trade unions.
The clause talks about the relationship involving trade unions for the
purposes of a Government Bill, not the Labour party. Of course, the
Government are formed from the Labour party, but that link is not
strong enough to enable the Committee to debate political party funding
and the relationship between trade unions and the Labour party, so the
ruling
stands.</div><a name="06070456000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000527"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr. Illsley. Of
course we will abide by your ruling, but will we be entitled to draw
attention to the link in the clause stand part
debate?</div><a name="06070456000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000528"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire
and the Minister have already drawn attention to the relationship. I do
not see the point of a long, detailed debate on the relationship
between the Labour party and trade unions in relation to funding. The
relationship referred to in the Bill is that between the Government and
trade unions, and briefing papers on that are available to members of
the Committee. It is not relevant to have a long debate, or any debate,
on the funding relationship between the Labour party and trade
unions.</div><a name="06070456000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000529"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Right. I shall try to make progress on the
Bill.</div><a name="06070456000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000530"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. I note your
comments and welcome your guidance. We are trying to establish the fact
that trade unions are politically motivated. Unions are responsible for
electing the leader of a political party, who can then become Prime
Minister. I would welcome your advice on why such organisations cannot
be deemed
political.</div><a name="06070456000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000531"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think that is a matter for debate. As far as I
am concerned, the matter is too far removed from the clause. There is a
debate to be had on the TUC and trade unions, but to debate the
financial relationship between the Labour party and trade unions is too
far removed from the scope of the
Bill.</div><a name="06070456000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000532"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Thank you, Mr. Illsley. I return to the clause and
its relevance to companies. I have said two things&#151;that we are
responding to a request from business and that the purpose is to
simplify processes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 380</div>for business. I am not going to discuss the matter endlessly, because
motivations other than those to do with the clause are at the heart of
the Opposition
amendments.</div><a name="06070456000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to put it on record that we know of no evidence to suggest
that political donations to trade unions constitute a real-world
problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) observed
last week in interventions on the hon. Member for Hornchurch that any
trade union that accepted a political donation from a company could
jeopardise not only its status as an independent trade union, but the
trust of its
members.</div><a name="06070456000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070456000533"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): The hon. Member for
Burnley made some relevant points, and I am glad that the Minister has
addressed them, but will she confirm whether that is the view of the
TUC or whether it has been challenged in court so that we are clear
about the
law?</div><a name="06070456000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000534"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I do not have a clue. I do not know whether there
has been a challenge in the courts. Perhaps, being a lawyer, the hon.
Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) knows, but I do not. Has it
been?</div><a name="06070456000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000535"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Not as far as we
know.</div><a name="06070456000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000536"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Right, that is interesting. Perhaps Opposition
Members would like to launch such a challenge. I am sure that everybody
would want to engage with
it.</div><a name="06070456000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall answer
some questions asked by the hon. Member for Cambridge, who made a more
considered contribution. I am sure he understands that there are
disclosure requirements associated with trade unions&#146; political
funds. They have to file annual returns with the trade union
certification officer as set out in section 32 of the 1992 Act. Those
must contain the specified accounts, including revenue accounts
and</div> <a name="06070456000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other accounts
as the Certification Officer may
require&#148;.</div><a name="06070456000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, it is
difficult to envisage a hidden donation going through the route that
the hon. Gentleman suggested and not coming out in the accounts or
being visible to us all, whatever political party we come
from.</div><a name="06070456000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000537"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s
point&#151;the union has to make a return to the certification
officer giving a view of what has gone in and out of the fund in a
particular year. The problem is that the company making such a donation
could avoid having to go to its own shareholders to get a resolution to
permit a political donation. The question is not whether there is
transparency for union members, but whether there is transparency for
shareholders. My initial view is that not many shareholders will read
reports of trade union political fund declarations to the certification
officer.</div><a name="06070456000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000538"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I take that point, but I hope that the hon.
Gentleman accepts also that those trade union accounts are pretty open
to inspection. Section 30 of the 1992 Act provides for an elaborate
right to inspect all accounting records, so I think it would be
difficult to hide a contribution from a company to a trade
union&#146;s political fund.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 381</div><a name="06070456000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure we all agree that we
do not want to put in place a system that would make it unnecessarily
burdensome for companies to fund what most in the Committee agree are
non-partisan activities. However, in the light of what the hon.
Gentleman has said, I accept that the wording of the clause could give
rise to some confusion. I am prepared to look at that so that our
intent is carried out absolutely and, if necessary, I shall introduce
that further wording on
Report.</div><a name="06070456000122"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000539"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We have had a helpful debate on the
amendments that I spoke to at the end of last week. The contribution
from the hon. Member for Cambridge was considered and supported my
argument that there is some doubt as to the treatment of donations from
a company to a trade union and whether the protections afforded in the
context of more political donations would apply in those
circumstances.</div><a name="06070456000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s comments appear to support that and recognise the
fact that the amendments might have raised a valid point and
highlighted a potential problem. Clearly, the explanatory notes on the
clause state that the exemption is intended to cover the issues she
talked about&#151;the use of company vehicles by and paid time off
for trade union officials. The term &#147;donation&#148; might
capture such
donations.</div><a name="06070456000470"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06070456000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
interesting that the notes say that this provision is intended to cover
trade unions in countries other than the UK. While our debate has
focused heavily on the legal treatment of and relationship with trade
unions in this country, we must bear it in mind that this provision is
intended to have wider effects. While we have debated some issues and
legalities that might arise around the treatment of trade unions, we
have not touched on whether there are any wider issues in relation to
trade unions outside the United Kingdom that may and will have separate
legal and regulatory standing in that
context.</div><a name="06070456000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our debate
has recognised that there is a valid issue. I acknowledge that the
Minister has said that the driving force behind that change to the law
has come from the companies, that no issue has been raised by the trade
unions and that the Government have in no way introduced the change as
a consequence of any lobbying by trade
unions.</div><a name="06070456000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point at
issue is that we have to balance ease of administration, which is a
valid point, against the consequences of the actions that have been
included. Therefore, we must also take into account the interests of
shareholders, which is why we want to ensure that shareholders are
properly protected, and the fact that, whether by design or
inadvertence, these provisions cannot be, theoretically or otherwise,
used in a manner that might allow for a political donation to be made
in the way we have discussed this morning. I welcome the fact that the
Minister is prepared to consider the
consequences.</div><a name="06070456000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
debated the second part of the clause&#151;the broad equivalence
argument in the interests of shareholders and those of members of trade
unions. The amendment would in many ways impose a level 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 382</div>playing field as between the requirement for trade unions and for
companies to have a ballot on donations: there is a four-year rule on
one and a 10-year rule on the other. We also want to highlight the
broad equivalence argument in the context of the
amendment.</div><a name="06070456000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
relevant and important issue is a question of clarity and
simplification, but it would also ensure that we had a clear
understanding of the law and regulations that apply to trade unions. I
note that hon. Members have said that there is some issue as to the
context of the use of trade unions being described as political, but
clearly there was some doubt in the minds of the draftsmen in that they
felt it necessary to specify that trade unions are not
political.</div><a name="06070456000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
claim praise or credit for the drafting&#151;I note the comments of
the hon. Member for Cambridge&#151;but clearly there is some doubt in
that the initial drafting had to say that trade unions are not
political organisations in the first place. We are not seeking to give
greater emphasis to that point through the amendment, as this is a
question of legal drafting more than anything else. On the one hand, it
is being said that something is not a political organisation; on the
other, we have introduced the amendment as a mechanism to address the
concern that we have debated this morning and to undo the balance and
ensure that the protections are
afforded.</div><a name="06070456000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
says that that represents an additional complication of some sort, but
I do not see it that way. All the issues that we have highlighted in
terms of the important work that trade unions do in education and
properly representing employees involve promoting good working
relationships and protecting employees&#146; best interests. That is
properly encapsulated in the drafting that we propose. It is also
important to state clearly the many issues that the trade unions
undertake for the best interests of employees.</div>
<a name="06070456000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context of what I have
heard from the Minister this morning, while I note that she is prepared
to reconsider the issue and come back on Report, I want to press the
amendment to the vote to emphasise the importance that we place on it
and our belief that companies and businesses should indeed have
clarity, but not at the cost of shareholders being prejudiced by how
the clause could be
used.</div><a name="06070456000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000556"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 261, in
clauseÂ 357,Â pageÂ 159,Â lineÂ 36,Â at
end insert</div> <a name="06070456000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;provided
that the association itself makes no political donations or political
expenditure as defined in sections 346 and 347 in the relevant
year.&#146;.</div><a name="06070456000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
a very short point that relates to trade associations, which are
largely associations made up of employers, rather than unions. The
clause proposes that subscriptions to trade associations should not
count as political donations and leaves it at that. The amendment says
that that should be the case as long as the trade association itself
makes no political donation. That is important because otherwise it
would be an easy way to evade the provisions of the Bill. It is also an
easy way to get moneys to particular political parties by way of trade
associations.</div><a name="06070456000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to mention particular cases, but there are certain trade
associations in the centre of the country that make rather large
donations to particular political parties. They can easily be found on
the Electoral Commission&#146;s website.</div>
<a name="06070456000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of the amendment is
quite simple: why should a donation to a trade association, which will
be passed on to a political party, not count as a political donation
just because it is a called a subscription? The clause goes on to say
that subscription does not include any payment to the association made
for a special
purpose.</div><a name="06070456000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
members of an association were asked for particular donations for the
election, that would count as a political donation, but what would
happen if a trade association were simply to increase its annual
subscription by a substantial amount in a year that just happened to be
the one that constituted the run-up to a general election? That is a
loophole, and I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on
it.</div><a name="06070456000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000557"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made an interesting
point, and the matter bears closer examination, but I am not entirely
convinced that the amendment represents the right way to proceed. The
clause states that a trade association must further relevant trade
interests, thereby making a direct connection with trade and business.
However, he has raised an interesting point that needs to be
considered, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="06070456000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000558"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> While it appears that the hon. Member for Cambridge
is trying to fix a problem, I am not sure that the problem exists. A
great deal of the work of trade associations is to lobby Ministers,
councillors and so on, but they do not do so in a party political way.
We have constantly tried to frame our clauses in a way that makes
things as simple as possible for companies, but if the amendment were
accepted they would have to check before paying money to a trade
association that its business was not party political as defined
elsewhere in the Bill in relation to companies making donations to
political parties. It would add complexity.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 384</div><a name="06070456000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the real world, we know that
trade associations are there to lobby; that is why companies get
together and form them. If they suddenly upped their subscription
massively to pay money to a political party or to individuals standing
for a party in an election, that would be so obvious that it would
quickly be shown up and seen by companies. The amendment is an
unnecessary complication that would make things more difficult by
trying to deal with a problem that does not
exist.</div><a name="06070456000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000559"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I hear what the Minister says. The matter should
be raised in debates on other legislation, but the real problem is the
lack of transparency of trade associations and their political
activities. We have discussed whether lobbying should count as a
political activity, on which the Committee did not agree with my view.
I accept that this amendment is partly consequential on the amendments
that I tabled on that matter, but there is nevertheless a potential
problem. Will the Minister undertake to keep the matter under review
should particular instances arise in which that problem causes
difficulties?</div><a name="06070456000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000560"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> As with all legislation, we will keep it under
constant review. If, as the hon. Gentleman says, a problem arises and
his judgment is right and mine wrong, we will have to return to the
matter.</div><a name="06070456000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000561"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I thank the Minister. In the light of that
comment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

said that there was a certain amount of fiction in the drafting of
amendment No. 219 on trade unions, tabled by the hon. Member for
Hornchurch. There is also a certain amount of fiction in the drafting
of the clause. We are all members of such groups and recognise that the
purpose of some of them&#151;not all of them&#151;is to facilitate
lobbying and access by interest groups to Members of Parliament. That
was discussed at great length by the Committee on Standards in Public
Life and written about in various articles in <i class="I">The
Times.</i></div> <a name="06070456000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been instances of what now is generally regarded as an abuse of the
process in which all-party groups have had their reports written for
them by lobbyists or have issued statements or reports that are clearly
connected with the interests of the people funding the group. For
example, just before Christmas, the all-party group on identity fraud
issued a report 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 385</div>saying that there was a danger of identity fraud from Christmas cards
being left out with the ordinary rubbish and that people should shred
them instead. It turned out that one of the sponsors of that group was
a manufacturer of shredding machines. It is obvious to all concerned
that such groups have political purposes.
</div><a name="06070456000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The view of Sir
Philip Mawer is well-balanced. He said that there was no evidence that
all-party groups were being &#147;suborned by outside
interests&#148;, but that they were</div>

public policy&#148;.</div><a name="06070456000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view
is that that is close to a definition of political.

serious indeed because it strikes at the heart of a great deal of good
that goes on in this place. He has been here for only a year. He needs
to be careful about what he says. The purpose of all-party groups is to
inform parliamentarians, and well informed parliamentarians are better
able to ask questions. That goes to the heart of democracy. If by
asking questions, policies change, fine, but that does not mean that
the primary purpose of an all-party group is to campaign on particular
issues in the sense that he implies. He should reflect carefully on
what he is going to say on such

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000564"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his warning, but I
was quoting Sir Philip Mawer. There has been an investigation by the
Committee on Standards in Public Life and complaints have been made to
the Committee on Standards and Privileges regarding that matter. The
findings to which I am referring are those, effectively, of the House
itself. All Members should recognise the risks and dangers associated
with all-party groups. The key point is that we should recognise the
truth, which is that the purpose of many such groups is to organise
access to parliamentarians by particular interests. If we do not
recognise that, we will not be able to regulate them
properly.</div> <a name="06070456000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that the amendment, in many ways, is consequential on the one that we
tabled last week on lobbying. Our view remains that lobbying is a
political activity and should be covered by the Bill. However, if
Members are not prepared to go as far as we attempted to go last
week&#151;the Minister said that that amendment was somewhat
extreme&#151;they might be more favourable towards an amendment
dealing with matters with which we are all familiar and about which we
know the
facts.</div><a name="06070456000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070456000565"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): The Liberal
Democrats have got it completely wrong, and the Government, for once,
are absolutely right. I am shocked by what the hon. Gentleman says. He
states that the purpose of all-party groups is to arrange access by
lobbyists or members of business to Members of Parliament. The purpose
is exactly the other way around. These groups can be set up only by
parliamentarians. Their purpose is to provide parliamentarians with
access to information, contacts, discussion and professional
advice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 386</div><a name="06070456000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all subject to the
crooked timber of humanity. None of us is perfect. We all make
mistakes. There could be an instance when hon. Members&#151;it does
not matter whether they are Conservative, Liberal or Labour&#151;have
naively allowed themselves to be deluded. Although I sincerely hope
that this is not the case, a colleague may have been corrupted and
consciously allowed his judgment to be overridden by a financial
interest, and come to a conclusion that is not genuinely in the public
interest, but which is designed simply to promote some individual
commercial interest. Those are serious charges, and the hon. Gentleman
should not be making them as a generalised charge. If such things have
occurred, he should document them and, if necessary, report the
individuals concerned to Sir Philip Mawer.</div>
<a name="06070456000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some parliamentary group at
some stage may have, either naively or, as is much less likely,
corruptly, allowed a financial interest to override the judgment of the
parliamentarians in the report it produces. If that is the case, we
want to know the details and we need to know them this morning. We
cannot get away with a generalised accusation of that kind. To suggest
that the totality and generality of all-party groups are simply
designed at the initiative of outsiders to override our proper judgment
is a monstrous distortion of reality.</div>
<a name="06070456000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have greatly benefited from
all-party groups since I have been in the House. I have not taken an
interest in them in terms of being an officer of one, except in the
rather specialised all-party groups, such as the British-French and the
British-German groups, which are groups with foreign Parliaments. But I
have often been to meetings of all-party groups on the subjects in
which I was interested. I have greatly benefited from the discussions.
I have often told colleagues that I disagreed with them but that I
valued the opportunity to talk the matter through with them. It has
been an essential element of my preparation for the work of this place,
and I believe it has been for many others, too. I deeply resent what
the hon. Gentleman said. His suggestions are thoroughly misconceived
and I hope that he will think again before he addresses the Committee
on this subject
again.</div><a name="06070456000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000566"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting
contribution and puts a number of relevant points forcefully. I should
declare my own interest as a member of an all-party group, something
that other Committee members will probably also do. I will not seek to
advance the interest of any of the groups to which I belong. The hon.
Member for Cambridge made an interesting point about the use and
structure of all-party groups. He is right to highlight individual
cases where that may have been questioned, but I am not convinced that
an amendment is the right mechanism to address the problem.</div>
<a name="06070456000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right and proper for us
as parliamentarians to debate the purpose of all-party groups, how they
should be funded, constituted and structured, and who should provide
the secretarial support, but that is a slightly different issue from
our debate on the regulation of donations by companies to all-party
groups and whether shareholder consent should be required for such
donations.</div> <a name="06070456000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">All-party
groups, by their nature, have to be all party, so it is not a question
of directors seeking to promote the party they personally favour, which
is very much 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 387</div>the tenor of the protections afforded in the Bill and which are
reflected in the provisions of the 1985 Act. Therefore, I believe that
many all-party groups provide, and continue to provide, good and
valuable services to Parliament to inform debate. To be fair to the
hon. Gentleman, I do not think that he is denigrating that or
suggesting otherwise. His arguments belong in a separate debate and I
am not convinced that his amendment allows properly for the level of
discussion that we would appreciate and
value.</div><a name="06070456000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000567"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> In the interests of speed, I shall make just three
short points. First, by definition, those groups are all-party, and
there is no danger of directors using their money to pursue their
political interests. Secondly, the Committee on Standards and
Privileges deals with issues on all-party groups. As a result of the
investigations in <i class="I">The Times, </i>it is considering whether there
should be more transparency. I am sure that we all want it to look into
that.</div> <a name="06070456000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, we are
considering the interaction between companies and all-party groups. I
return again, and perhaps not for the last time, to our simple test: is
there a risk of directors using a company&#146;s money for their own
party political interests, rather than for those of the company? In
this case, that risk is so small that regulation would not be
justified.</div><a name="06070456000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000568"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Those hon. Members who have expressed outrage at
my comments on all-party groups misheard me. I was quoting a report by
Sir Philip Mawer. There are reports not only by the Committee on
Standards in Public Life, but by the Committee on Standards and
Privileges, which upheld complaints against three all-party
groups&#151;the intellectual property group, the patient safety group
and the pharmacy group. Investigations and consultations are still
going on in the House about those matters. I hope that hon. Members who
expressed outrage and surprise will refer to those reports, which I am
sure are available in the
Library.</div><a name="06070456000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000569"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman is saying that there have been
one or two abuses. Surely he is not saying that, as a result, we should
stop the funding of all-party groups by outsiders. We should not be
making laws on the basis of occasional abuses. As he was drawing
conclusions for the law, it was reasonable to assume that he was
attacking the whole system of all-party groups. There is no
justification for abolishing that system just because of one or two
isolated
cases.</div><a name="06070456000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000570"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I accept fully what the hon. Gentleman says:
there is no need to abolish the entire system. The amendment would not
do that. Instead, it would produce more transparency and openness when
companies fund all-party groups. The effect would be merely to bring
such funding within the ambit of the Bill, which does not stop
donations or political expenditure by companies, but requires them to
obtain the consent of their shareholders and members before doing
so.</div><a name="06070456000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
there is no need to end the entire concept of all-party parliamentary
groups, but there does need to be more transparency. That view is
widely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 388</div>accepted in the House. As the hon. Member for Hornchurch said, we are
all members of those groups, and I am not claiming any virtue for
myself or for my right hon. and hon. Friends. As one commentator said,
the House needs to look to and protect its
reputation.</div><a name="06070456000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that the debate is subsidiary to last Thursday&#146;s debate on
whether lobbying should count as political expenditure. I accept that
my view on that was not widely shared, but I still hold it. The essence
of politics is not elections but Government policy. Groups that seek to
influence policy and decision making by Ministers are engaged in
political
activity.</div>

am</div><a name="06070456000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
confines &#147;politics&#148; specifically to electoral activity.
That is not my view of what its scope should be, for the reasons that I
gave on Thursday. However, in the light of the Committee&#146;s
decisive vote then, and because this is in many ways the same issue, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070456000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000571"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 263, in
clauseÂ 359,Â pageÂ 160,Â lineÂ 23,Â at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5) No order under
this section shall discriminate in favour of or against any political
party or
parties.&#146;.</div><a name="06070456000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is probing, but it would do no harm if it were accepted. The
clause relates to the power of the Secretary of State to exempt
political expenditure under this part of the Bill. The Secretary of
State is to be given what seems a reasonable power to declare
particular types of expenditure not political. Such powers are often
required in Bills such as this to allow the Government to deal with new
situations that arise after they become law. I said that it would be a
reasonable use of the power in the clause to exempt very small
expenditure, such as the expense and time taken in writing a
letter.</div> <a name="06070456000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
object to the existence of the power, but the clause as drafted would
allow that power to be used in a political way. It allows certain types
of company and not others to make political expenditure. I do not wish
to predict the behaviour of the current Government, but a hypothetical
future Government might be tempted, having seen the lie of the
political land, to make exceptions in a way that favoured themselves. I
am sure that that is not the Government&#146;s intention, and the
amendment, which would ban discrimination in the use of the power, is
largely intended to allow the Minister to say so, which I hope she
will.</div>
<a name="06070456000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000572"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment touches
on an important point. I originally intended to raise the subject in
the stand part debate, but the amendment provides me with the
opportunity to do so
now.</div><a name="06070456000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
language in the clause reflects the existing wording of section 347B(8)
to (11) of the Companies Act 1985, it appears to allow wide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 389</div>discretion on the part of the Secretary of State. While I am sure that
the current office holder would in no way want to use the power in an
inappropriate or partisan way, we must legislate for the future. Who
knows when we will have an opportunity to consider the matter again? It
is therefore important to consider how protection can be provided
against the eventualities and circumstances that the hon. Gentleman
highlighted. His amendment states that the power should not be used in
a discriminatory way, and he puts forward a fair and powerful argument,
particular considering that clause 359(2) covers political expenditure
and situations in which a company could produce literature or take out
advertisements in support of a political campaign.</div>
<a name="06070456000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have defended
rigidly the need for political expenditure to be controlled, and they
are right to maintain that. However, if through this power there is a
means of exemption, the question that is raised is in what
circumstances would that be used: could it be used to favour one
argument or another? By its nature it must favour one side, otherwise
we would not, in the first place, be making the expenditure that is
viewed to be political.</div>
<a name="06070456000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that the hon.
Gentleman has raised the issue. I am certainly sympathetic to the
desire to address the potential mischief that may arise, and I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s comments.</div>
<a name="06070456000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000573"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I shall give a brief history of why we have the
provision and set out three arguments to show that it is appropriate.
It was originally inserted because we recognised that the definition in
the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 could
inadvertently catch activities that could not reasonably be considered
as political. The power has been used once, and an order was made,
before the 2000 Act came into force, exempting from the need for prior
shareholder approval political expenditure
by</div><a name="06070456000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any company
or subsidiary undertaking whose ordinary course of business includes,
or is proposed to include, the preparation, publication or
dissemination to the public, or any part of the public, of material
relating to news, and to public and political affairs and events, and
to views, opinion and comment on the news and on public and political
affairs and events&#148;.</div><a name="06070456000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
company putting out press cuttings or whatever would be able to do so
under that order.</div><a name="06070456000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that my three specific points give Opposition Members the
assurances that they seek. First, I do not think that the amendment
targets a substantive issue. The order-making power has never been used
in a way that discriminates in favour of one political party or against
another. Indeed, the exemption that I have described is the only time
that we have ever used that order-making power, and we have retained it
only to correct similar unforeseen problems were they to arise in the
future.</div><a name="06070456000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
amendment would not make the order-making power any less partisan as it
stands. I think the hon. Gentleman would accept that the interpretation
of</div> <a name="06070456000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No order
under this section shall discriminate in favour of or against any
political party or parties&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 390</div><a name="06070456000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">would be highly subjective and will
probably have the effect of making it very difficult to use the
order-making power should we ever need to do so.</div>
<a name="06070456000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally and perhaps most
importantly, clause 359(4) ensures that if any order under the section
is proposed, it is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so
Parliament would have the opportunity to reject or accept any order
that is made. That gives the added protection that the hon. Gentleman
seeks.</div><a name="06070456000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="06070456000206"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000574"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I cannot say that I am particularly reassured by
the Minister&#146;s remarks. The point about the requirement for
non-discrimination being subjective is not well made. The concept of
discrimination is well known legally and the amendment would restrict
the validity of orders that were discriminatory. If a discriminatory
order were put into operation, it would be open to any person who so
wished to challenge it in the courts and to have it set aside. The
purpose of that would be to deter the Government from making
discriminatory orders. That would be the object of the
exercise.</div><a name="06070456000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000575"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000576"></a>David

standards of what counts as clear and what does not. Nevertheless,
there is a long history of legal discussion about the meaning of the
term &#147;discrimination&#148;. It has been subject to a degree of
contestation. The issue to be dealt with is the degree to which those
outside this place can challenge orders that discriminate against them.
The use of the affirmative resolution procedure is a safeguard, but not
for political parties that are not represented in the House. The Green

reading of section 347B(4), it did not seem to limit the
&#163;5,000 to a group-wide basis, but related instead to an
individual-company basis. The amendment is probing and is intended to
seek confirmation of whether a change is taking place. Did the
&#163;5,000 limit relate to an individual basis before or to a
group-wide basis? If there is a change, why did the Government feel it
necessary to take that line of
approach?</div><a name="06070456000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 319 raises the matter of small donations, which was highlighted by
the Law Society. It points out that section 52(2)(b) of the 2000 Act
provides that donations of less than &#163;200 are exempt from the
requirements of that Act. However, because of the drafting of clause
360(3), it suggests that it is not clear whether they can also be
disregarded for the purposes of the Bill. The amendment would make it
clear that they can
be.</div><a name="06070456000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
320 and 321 raise a small technical drafting point, because the current
language might, on one interpretation, allow for double counting. The
clause states that</div><a name="06070456000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
this section...&#145;donation&#146; means a donation to a
political party&#148;</div><a name="06070456000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
similar, and that &#147;other relevant donations&#148;
means</div><a name="06070456000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in relation to a

&#147;donations&#148;&#151;that seems to include the donation
itself&#151;made by that company or by any of its subsidiaries. If
there is an initial donation of, for instance, &#163;1,000, and a
subsequent donation of &#163;4,000, taking the total to
&#163;5,000, there should not be double counting of the initial
donation. A donation is to be considered as an aggregate of what the
clause calls the &#147;donation&#148; and &#147;other relevant
donations&#148;, which might lend itself to an interpretation
allowing such double counting. Even if the Minister does not agree with
my analysis, which I am sure she will not, it is helpful to put the
point on record so that we have clarity and
certainty.</div><a name="06070456000473"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000580"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman draws our attention to the
difference in the amounts, and he is correct to do so. The amounts are
different in the two Acts. In raising the level to &#163;5,000, we
wanted to ensure that minor activities, such as meetings with local
councillors or MPs, did not count as political donations. Am I correct
in thinking that that was the point that the hon. Gentleman was
making?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 392</div><a name="06070456000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000581"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> If I may just clarify, my point was that the
&#163;5,000 limit applied on a company-by-company basis under the
original Act. I wanted to test whether a holding company&#146;s three
subsidiaries would each have a &#163;5,000 limit, or&#151;this is
certainly clear in the Bill and this is how I interpret
it&#151;whether the group as a whole would have a &#163;5,000
limit. The point on which I was seeking clarification, therefore, was
whether &#163;15,000 or &#163;5,000 would be the group-wide limit
in my example.</div>
<a name="06070456000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000582"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I shall give the hon. Gentleman the clarification
that I have been given. In earlier clauses, we have tightened up
provisions relating to subsidiaries to ensure that directors of holding
companies do not circumvent their obligations. In the same spirit, we
now include subsidiaries in the annual total, so the annual total for
all companies is &#163;5,000; it cannot be &#163;15,000, and one
cannot tot it up, with the subsidiaries underneath. I hope that that
answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s query on amendment No.
318.</div>
<a name="06070456000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000583"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I understand the Government&#146;s desire
not to allow the provisions to be overly manipulated by, say, a group
with 100 subsidiaries. Each subsidiary might make a donation of
&#163;5,000, and each donation would be within the limit, so one
would be looking at quite a significant amount. However, it is the
interests of the holding company and its shareholders, which own those
subsidiaries, that would be directly affected by the change. Will the
Minister examine whether the &#163;5,000 limit is appropriate in all
circumstances for such a large group, given the liability that holding
company directors would be under for a breach and given that a large
group might not be able to police matters as effectively as a smaller
group?</div><a name="06070456000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000584"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> To be honest, I cannot quite see where the
&#163;5,000 limit originated. If it would be helpful, I shall write
to the hon. Gentleman to explain how that figure was reached in earlier
consultations. We can return to the issue on Report if he feels unhappy
with that letter.</div> <a name="06070456000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 319, clause 346 provides that the definition of
&#147;political donation&#148; is the same as that in the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Authorisations under this
part of the Bill are not needed for donations that fall outside the
scope of that definition, including donations that, in the words of the
amendment, satisfy</div> <a name="06070456000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
provisions of section 52(2)(b)
of&#148;</div><a name="06070456000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">the Act. Amendment
No. 319 therefore does nothing more than restate the existing provision
and is not required.</div>

final amendments provide additional clarity. I thank the hon. Gentleman

the basis on which the &#163;5,000 limit was arrived at. I think that
it reflects the existing arrangements under the Companies Act 1985, and
I was seeking to put on record the issue of whether that fits in all
circumstances. Without wishing in any way to undermine the rightful
intent that lies behind the drafting in the Bill, for a large group,
from a practical and operational perspective, could that be considered
further? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. Given the

purpose of my amendment is to highlight the status of a secretary in a

neither a director nor a secretary of a public company. As such, to my
view, such an offence could be asserted against that secretary only
under subsection (1)(c)
as</div><a name="06070456000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an officer of the

<a name="06070456000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my view, that approach is
erroneous. In an attempt to expunge rigorously from the Bill the
concept of a private company secretary, a potential injustice appears
to arise from the fact that the defence under subsection (4) is not
available. Indeed, a secretary of a public company, and also of a
private company subsidiary, could find themselves in the bizarre
situation of being able to defend an action in relation to the holding
company by virtue of subsection (4), but not in relation to the
subsidiary. The amendment seeks therefore to deal with that lacuna by
ensuring that the defence under subsection (4) is available to all
secretaries, whether of public or private
companies.</div><a name="06070456000248"></a>

<a name="06070456000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070456000589"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): We come now to
company investigations, which are dealt with as additions to the 1985
Act provisions, to be inserted after section 446. That Act gives the
Secretary of State the power to appoint inspectors to carry out
inspections in relation to the affairs of companies, their membership
or control, and dealings in share options by directors and their
families. Clause 676(1) inserts new sections 446A and 446B into the
1985 Act, providing new powers for the Secretary of State to give
directions to inspectors. The explanatory notes state:</div>
<a name="06070456000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Directions...can
either relate to the investigation itself or the inspectors&#146;
reports of the results of their investigations. Regarding the former,
such directions can take two forms: a direction as to the subject
matter of an investigation (whether by reference to a specified area of
a company&#146;s operation, a specified transaction, a period of time
or otherwise); or a direction which requires an inspector to take or
not to take a specified step in his
investigation.&#148;</div><a name="06070456000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are fairly significant additions to the provisions of the Companies Act
1985. Will the Minister please provide the background to explain how
they came about and why they were thought necessary? Is it intended
that the existing provisions of the Companies Act 1985 should be
consolidated into the Bill? I believe that that will happen, but I
should like her to confirm that. Will she also please specifically
explain why, under new section 446B(3),</div>
<a name="06070456000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any direction...given to the
inspector under section 437(1) to produce an interim

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000590"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> May I make a general point? I am very happy to
answer detailed questions such as that last one, but it would be
helpful to have a little notification. I cannot answer the hon.
Gentleman on that point, but I can explain the background to the clause
and why we are introducing the power for the Secretary of State to give
greater guidance to inspectors. That reflects our experience of recent
inspections, and the hon. Gentleman will probably be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 396</div>more familiar with those than I am. The Queens Moat House plc inspection
apparently took 10 years, and there were no powers to obtain an interim
report or any information before that time. The Mirror Group Newspapers
inspection was also prolonged, and that drew our attention to the lack
of any powers to speed things up and prevent inspections from going on
endlessly.</div> <a name="06070456000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
time in question the Prime Minister, I think, commented that when the
opportunity should arise we would need to amend current legislation to
enable the Secretary of State to terminate an investigation when it was
no longer in the broader public interest to continue with it. That is
the answer to the question why we have introduced the clause.</div>
<a name="06070456000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to whether the existing 1985
Act provisions on investigations will be restated as part of
consolidation of the Bill, the answer is no&#151;they go wider than
Companies Act provisions. That is not to say that they could not be
consolidated separately in a free-standing Act. That is the advice that
I am given. Probably, those provisions fall outside the terms
of reference of this
Bill.</div><a name="06070456000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000591"></a>Mr.

investigations will at some point be pulled out of this Act and put
into another piece of legislation, with the existing Companies Act
legislation?</div><a name="06070456000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000592"></a>Margaret

investigations, we will have to consider the position then.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000593"></a>Mr.

it says:</div> <a name="06070456000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any direction
already given to the inspector under section
437(1)&#148;,</div><a name="06070456000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000594"></a>Margaret

subsumed the powers that were previously in that section within the

why that provision is
there.</div><a name="06070456000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000595"></a>Mr.

revoked, to produce documents generated by them during the course of
their investigation. Does the inspector own papers that he or she
produces during the investigation? Presumably, that applies to
sub-contracted investigators, rather than civil servants. Has there
been a problem with that in the past, and have the Government
considered producing terms and conditions under which inspectors
transfer their rights in investigation documents to the state?
Essentially, I am asking whether it is necessary to legislate on that
point.</div><a name="06070456000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000597"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> At present, the Secretary of State has, apparently,
very limited powers to give directions to inspectors. Although the
Secretary of State can require inspectors at any time to inform him of
any matters that come to their knowledge as a result of their
investigation, it is only when inspectors uncover fraud or other
potential offences, and when that discovery is referred to the
appropriate prosecuting authority&#151;for example, to the Serious
Fraud Office&#151;that the Secretary of State can direct the
inspector to take no further steps in an investigation or such further
steps as specified.</div>
<a name="06070456000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are examples of cases in
which that almost unfettered independence has led to protracted
inspections and where, having completed the actual investigations, the
inspectors have difficulty in agreeing their conclusions and
recommendations. The challenge is to widen the powers sufficiently to
allow the Secretary of State to intervene to enable the efficient
completion of the inspection.</div>
<a name="06070456000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the details, the clause adds
new section 446E to the 1985 Act. When an inspector has resigned, had
his appointment revoked or is given a direction under section 446B, the
Secretary of State may direct him to produce documents obtained or
generated during the course of the investigation to either the
Secretary of State or an appointed inspector. It is not that the
inspector owns the papers, but that he has control over them which is
why it has been necessary to take this
power.</div><a name="06070456000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000598"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I query who owns the papers. Normally if someone
produces a paper, they own it. I assumed that the clause dealt with
situations in which people could maintain that they owned the paper.
Perhaps the Minister could
explain.</div><a name="06070456000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000599"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Again, I can come back to the hon. Gentleman if I
have got this wrong, but if an inspector is working under a contract to
undertake an investigation into a particular issue, I should have
thought that the terms of the contract would ensure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 398</div>that the ownership of any papers that emerged from it was vested in the
person who made the contract, in this case the Secretary of
State.</div>
<a name="06070456000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000600"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That was precisely my point. On that basis, I am
asking why the clause is
needed.</div><a name="06070456000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000601"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> What I am told is that the clause makes ownership
clearer&#151;I suppose that one could litigate or
something&#151;and ensures that there is a rapid transfer of papers.
That is the only thing that I can think of. If there is anything more
to it than that, I will come back to the hon. Gentleman. But I think
that it is probably just a question of being absolutely clear, turning
to the clause and saying, &#147;Thou shalt return those papers
immediately.&#148;</div><a name="06070456000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

easily disqualified. If a disqualification order is made on the back of
a court case after full due process, all well and good, but there are
concerns that rapid use of orders organised by Ministers or through
their civil servants, based on, for instance, a few public complaints
may not work in the best interests of justice. To defend against such
an order can be an expensive business and if the process is now to be
made even simpler in evidential terms, as the clause proposes, could
perhaps work against the innocent as much as stop the guilty. We are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000608"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are now dealing with part 28 of the Bill and
overseas companies. The definition of an overseas company is wider in
the clause than in section 744 of the Companies Act 1985, which it
replaces. It changes &#147;Great Britain&#148; to &#147;United
Kingdom&#148;. That is consistent with the rest of the Bill&#146;s
changes to company law to bring Northern Ireland in line with the rest
of the country. However, the explanatory notes explain that this
part</div><a name="06070456000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will replace the
provisions made by Part 23 and Schedules 21A-D of the 1985 Act.
Regulations made under this Part will continue to implement the
requirements of the Eleventh Company Law Directive (89/666/EEC), which
imposes disclosure requirements on overseas companies that set up
branches in the UK.&#148;</div><a name="06070456000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be helpful if the Under-Secretary put on record why it is thought
that the existing regimes need to be
changed.</div><a name="06070456000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000609"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause replaces
the definition of an overseas company in section 744 of the 1985 Act,
which refers to companies incorporated outside Great Britain that
establish a place of business in Great Britain. Clause 699 takes a
different approach by defining an overseas company simply as a company 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 400</div>incorporated outside the UK. The various provisions of part 28 to which
the hon. Gentleman referred or the regulations made under them will
then state to which overseas companies they apply. For
example, regulations under clause 700 must require an overseas company
to register with the registrar if it opens a branch in the UK. Clause
705 enables regulations to impose trading disclosure requirements on
overseas companies carrying on business in the UK. I think that that
explanation is reasonably self-sufficient. We think that the different
format is
advantageous.</div><a name="06070456000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000610"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My question was basically why the Government
think that it is more
advantageous.</div><a name="06070456000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000611"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Presumably, the new format allows for more detailed
consideration of regulations in relation to the separate headings set
down in the appropriate clauses. Under one clause, regulations will be
made that deal with a company that has a branch in the UK. Regulations
under another clause will deal with a company that is carrying on
business in the UK. That seems to provide maximum flexibility. I cannot
see that there is anything more to be said about it, but I am getting
wisdom even as I speak. Strangely, that often happens here. The company
law review made a number of recommendations about overseas companies
and proposed that the current regimes should be replaced with a single
one based on the existing concept of a place of business, and that
complies with the requirements of the 11th company law directive. I
hope that that explanation assists the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06070456000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000612"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause deals with the duty to register
particulars in relation to overseas companies. It forces overseas
companies with branches in the UK to register in the UK. It also
implements the requirements of the 11th company law directive, under
which an overseas company must register if it opens a branch in the UK.
It is designed to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to help
British lenders and other such companies. The clause, and this part
generally, will presumably require a raft of regulations. When and how
does the Minister propose to deal with them? Has consultation
started?</div><a name="06070456000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000613"></a>Vera

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000614"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause provides a framework for the names
under which overseas companies must register, and it appears to be
consistent with the regulations for UK companies. Will the Minister
explain how the provisions interrelate with the provisions in part 5
which deal with the names of British companies? I would particularly
like to know whether a foreign company with a long-established name but
with a different foreign connotation of limited liability&#151;for
example, GmbH or SA&#151;which is substantively the same name as a
British company, could be registered. It seems that the position might
be different for European economic area states, and I ask the Minister
why. If the companies were engaged in totally different businesses,
would that have any bearing on the
position?</div><a name="06070456000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000615"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The only constraints on names in part 5 which do
not apply to overseas companies are the requirements of clauses 59 and
60, which are for the names of certain types of companies to end with
letters such as Ltd or plc. They do not apply to overseas companies
because they are specific to the types of company formed under the 1985
Act. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is, I suppose, whether an EEA
company is free to trade in the UK under a name for which a UK company
would require approval or under one which is very like that of a UK
company. I shall deal with both those aspects.</div>
<a name="06070456000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">All companies carrying on
business in the UK, including EEA companies, are subject to part 34,
which concerns business names and which we will debate in due course.
That means that EEA companies, like all others, require prior approval
for carrying on business in the UK under a name that implies a
connection to a Government or includes a sensitive word or expression.
That is about approval, but a question that might be more relevant is
whether an EEA company is free to trade in the UK under the name of a
UK company. The answer is, yes, it can register with the Registrar of
Companies under its corporate name, even if it is the same as an
existing UK company name, but if it trades under that name, there is a
separate issue of passing off. In any event, the scope for confusion
between the two will be limited by the requirements for trading
disclosures. Regulations made under clause 705 will require overseas
companies carrying on business in the UK to state their country of
incorporation on all their business letters and order forms used in the
UK.</div><a name="06070456000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s third query was: are fewer restrictions imposed
on EEA companies and if so, why? The corporate name of an EEA company
is a matter for the law of the country or territory in which it is
incorporated. We take the view that the freedom of establishment
restricts our ability to prevent registration of an EEA company by its
corporate name unless there is a justification for doing
so.</div><a name="06070456000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern, or curiosity&#151;whichever is a
better description&#151;because clause 701 is very different from
section 694 of the 1985 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 402</div>Act, which enabled the Secretary of State to give notice to an overseas
company that its name would not be registered if it was incorporated
under that Act. Under that system, we can also serve notice on an
overseas company that its name is the same as, or too like,
another&#146;s registered name and that it should register a
different name. The clause takes a different approach. Except in the
case of the corporate name of an EEA company, it applies the same rules
to the registered name of an overseas company as a reply by part 5 to a
UK company, save for the parts about the letters Ltd and plc that I
mentioned. I hope that that is a comprehensive
explanation.</div><a name="06070456000317"></a>

Djanogly:</b> The regulations under the clause will replace
sections 699AA to 703 and schedule 21D to the 1985 Act and will be
subject to the negative resolution procedure. The clause brings
overseas companies with a branch in the UK into line with the UK
accounting requirements, and confers on the Secretary of State a power
to make regulations requiring overseas companies to prepare accounts
and directors&#146; reports, and to obtain an auditors&#146;
report. The requirements must be like those imposed on companies formed
and registered under the Bill. The accounts, directors&#146; report
and auditors&#146; report requirements applying to companies formed
and registered under the Bill appear in parts 15 and 16.</div>
<a name="06070456000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an overseas company
registers in the UK, it must file accounts. Presumably, such companies
that do not want to go the whole way in terms of reporting will have
set up a branch with light requirements. Can it be that by bringing
branches into the net, fewer foreign companies will be encouraged to
conduct business in the UK? I ask that as a probing question rather
making than a statement. Did the Minister&#146;s Department do any
research on that?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000621"></a>Vera

no change.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000624"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Obviously, the approach in the Bill is to have the
basic principles in primary legislation and the technical details in
regulations. The rationale for that, and the consequent choice of the
negative resolution procedure, went before the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee, which concluded that the procedure was
reasonable and appropriate. Indeed, the negative resolution procedure
is the same as that under the previous clause, although the hon.
Gentleman was not concerned about that. Clause 703 also applies to the
registration of overseas companies and replaces section 700 of the 1985
Act.</div> <a name="06070456000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
several constraints on the regulations that can be made under clause
704. They will need to continue the bank branches directive and they
will also be limited by subsection (3) so that they may impose only
requirements that are like those that the Bill imposes on companies
that are formed under it. Consequently, it appears that the negative
resolution procedure is appropriate, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will feel himself persuaded.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000625"></a>Mr.

the power to make regulations under the clause follows the same pattern

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000626"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Regulations can be made under the clause to
replace provisions made by section 693 of the 1985 Act. The clause
confers on the Secretary of State a power to make regulations as to the
information that overseas companies must display in specified
locations, include in specified documents or communications, or provide
to those who may request it in the course of business. Earlier, the
Minister mentioned one way in which the clause would apply.</div>
<a name="06070456000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">To what extent do the
Government intend to differentiate the disclosure regime from that
which applies to UK companies? Is it likely that changes will be
suggested to what happens now? What is the timing on the new proposals?
I appreciate that those issues tie in closely with clause 706, and I
would make the same points in relation to that
clause.</div>
<a name="06070456000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000627"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> As to the timing, I shall perhaps be able to help
the hon. Gentleman in a moment.</div>
<a name="06070456000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
other question was about the difference between the duties to be
imposed as regards the disclosure of particulars on overseas companies
trading in the UK and companies incorporated in the UK. The regulations
will cover the information that overseas companies must display in
specified locations, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 405</div>include in specified documents or communications, or provide to those
who make a request in the course of business.</div>
<a name="06070456000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of example, the
regulations could require an overseas company to display a sign with
its name on outside a branch, include its name and country of
incorporation on every invoice, and provide its name to anyone who asks
for it when doing business with the company. The regulations can impose
civil and criminal sanctions for failing to comply with the trading
disclosure requirements, and those will correspond to the sanctions
imposed on UK companies.</div>
<a name="06070456000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the timing, we shall consult
on the regulations after Royal Assent.</div>
<a name="06070456000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">To complete my answer to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s points, let me add that overseas companies will
be required to provide details of their country of
registration&#151;their nationality, as it were&#151;and their
registered number there.</div>
<a name="06070456000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current requirements will
continue until the new regulations come into force, which I hope is
reassuring. I am informed that the experts think that there is unlikely
to be much difficulty.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000628"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000629"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Are offences for foreign companies compatible
with breaches of the same type of regulations for UK companies? Have
the Government received advice on the human rights implications of
that?</div>
<a name="06070456000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000630"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> We must have received advice on the human rights
implications, because the whole Bill has been certified compatible with
the European convention on human rights. When the hon. Gentleman refers
to compatibility of offences committed by overseas companies as opposed
to those in the UK, is he asking whether the offences will be the
same?</div>
<a name="06070456000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000631"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Basically, if a registration requirement for an
overseas company is similar to a registration requirement for an
English or Welsh company, but slightly out of kilter, could the
overseas company make a claim that it was being treated
unfairly?</div><a name="06070456000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000632"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I suppose I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
If the conditions were more stringent on overseas companies than on
local companies, there might be a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 406</div>suggestion of discrimination or nationalism. I am not aware of any
distinctions that raise that potential mischief, but I shall
investigate the matter further and write to him if I find
any.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000634"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Part 29 deals with the registrar of companies
and unifies the approach for the whole UK. Clause 716 replaces section
708 of the Companies Act 1985 and provides more information on the
issues that the regulations might cover, although the lists are not
exhaustive. Is the Minister pleased with the way in which the registrar
of companies is working? Is it considered to be an efficiently run
function? Are any reviews of its workings
proposed?</div>
<a name="06070456000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000635"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The Registrar of Companies is a she, so she is by
definition excellent. In any event, we do not have any cause for
concern. When we come to what may be an interesting discussion about
compensation for errors made by the registrar, we will find that the
amount of compensation that has been paid during the ex gratia system
is small&#151;&#163;130,000 over the past five years. I am sure
that we will discuss it in more detail, but it does not suggest that a
good deal is going wrong.
</div><a name="06070456000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a complaints
system that rectifies errors quickly anyway, and I am not aware that
any strategic or important changes are going to be made. There is a
quinquennial review of all executive agencies including that one, and
it does not throw up any cause for worry.

notice of issue of certificate of

<a name="06070456000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000636"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause provides for the possibility of an
alternative to publication in the <i class="I">Gazette</i> of the notice of issue
of certificates of incorporation. Will the Minister explain
why publication in the <i class="I">Gazette</i> is still felt necessary? Could an
alternative form of publication be used, or perhaps none at
all?</div>
<a name="06070456000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000637"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Clause 15 ensures that the registrar issues a
certificate of incorporation to a company when it is formed and there
are other stages in a company&#146;s life when a certificate of
incorporation can be issued. For example, when a company changes its
name it will receive a new certificate. The fact that a company has
been duly formed will often be of interest to third parties. The
current law requires the registrar to publish 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 407</div>the fact that she has issued a certificate of incorporation by placing a
notice in the <i class="I">Gazette</i>. The Bill replicates that requirement, but
there are two important changes. The <i class="I">Gazette</i> is a well known and
long-standing publication&#151;it is longer standing than the
Middlesbrough<i class="I"> Evening Gazette</i>, which is my local
paper&#151;and users are accustomed to referring to it for accurate
information, which is not necessarily the case with some other
newspapers, to get news of incorporation. There is no intention that
the registrar will stop publishing information in the <i class="I">Gazette</i> in
the foreseeable future, but we recognise that over time, particularly
as technology develops, it is possible that alternative mechanisms will
become useful. In clause 769, the availability of alternative mechanism
is registered in the
Bill.</div><a name="06070456000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
second change to the previous law which, the hon. Gentleman may wish to
know, was introduced by the Opposition in another place. When
publicising certificates of incorporation the registrar merely uses the
company&#146;s name, but in future she will state the registered
number, which will help users.</div>
<a name="06070456000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that the hon.
Gentleman was asking whether anyone uses the <i class="I">Gazette, </i>whether it
is an arcane publication and whether we should do more. There is a
power in clause 769, which we will discuss when we come to it, and we
could do that as well as or instead of continuing publication in the
<i class="I">Gazette</i>, but we should not dispense with the obligation to
publish notices in the <i class="I">Gazette</i> without careful consultation
about the extent to which it is used. Most of the existing obligations
to give notice in the <i class="I">Gazette</i> derive from EC law, and the
facility to provide alternative means of publication has only recently
been made available. The extent to which it has been used in other
member states is unclear, and we should take that into consideration.
We should not throw the <i class="I">Gazette</i> away, but we should make
available other means of publication. Publication is important because
there is often third-party interest in
incorporations.</div><a name="06070456000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000638"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We will come to a debate on the <i class="I">Gazette.</i>
I am certainly not questioning its historical validity because it is an
ancient and venerable institution, but perhaps we should think about
moving on. However, specifically in relation to clause 717, my point
was that if a certificate of incorporation was published, many more
people would have notice of it if it was put on microfiche at Companies
house than if it was placed in the <i class="I">Gazette</i>, which not many
peoplelook
at.</div><a name="06070456000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000639"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I suppose that it is a matter of belt and braces.
We are terribly fond of the <i class="I">Gazette</i> and we do not propose to
abandon it yet.</div><a name="06070456000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no concrete argument for abolishing it. I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s saying that other ways are available and implicit in
the procedure, but does he have a good reason for simply stopping
publication in the
<i class="I">Gazette</i>?</div><a name="06070456000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000640"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I think I do, Mr. Illsley. The cost of the
<i class="I">Gazette</i> is not insignificant. When we have a fuller debate on
the <i class="I">Gazette,</i> it may be helpful if the Government could look up
and have ready some facts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 408</div>and figures about the cost to the state&#151;Companies House&#151;of
publishing it as well as the cost to companies because I shall ask

<a name="06070456000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that Companies House
periodically reviews the format of its forms, both hard copy and
online, and consults on alternatives. Presumably, once the Bill comes
into force, every form will need to be changed, even if only to reflect
the new section numbers. Will the registrar use that as an opportunity
for a general, thorough review of the format of the forms, and will the
Minister confirm that there will be wide

Minister saying that that will happen, and is there a proposed
timetable for a move to fully electronic delivery? That would be the

would be onerous for small businesses, which might still not use the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 409</div>confirm that a much wider debate will be had nearer the time, and can
she provide us of some idea of when that time is likely to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000645"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> Under clause 722 the Secretary of State, not the
registrar, will have the new power. It is subject to certain
restrictions; for example, it can be exercised only in respect of
classes of documents that are authorised or required to be delivered
and for which the registrar has published rules on electronic
delivery&#151;in other words, where it is clear precisely what the
mechanism for electronic communication is. It is important for me to
make it clear that we have no intention of using the power in the

<a name="06070456000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">Take-up of electronic services
is increasing and we can expect more and more companies to become
equipped and willing to use electronic means of delivery, but we are a
very long way from a position in which a requirement to send documents
electronically could apply to all companies without imposing an undue
burden on some. It is right that the power should be in the clause to
provide for future flexibility. There is a spot of philosophy in my
notes about how quickly the world is changing, with which I shall not
trouble the Committee. We are a long way from the point of making the
requirement in question, and there will be an opportunity to debate
such a requirement because the clause requires the affirmative

it is preferable that all companies play by the same rules on the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000648"></a>Vera

make agreements with companies to deliver information only
electronically. In other words, Companies House and a particular

electronically and how to do so. In practice it is likely, as I am sure
the hon. Gentleman can envisage, that Companies House will draw up
agreements in standard form containing detailed provisions for such

agreements need not be available to everyone in the same form, or at
all. The essential point is that they will be entered only if both
parties think that there is benefit in doing so. It seems sensible that
such arrangements should be
available.</div><a name="06070456000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might
help if I explain that the intention is to prevent fraud&#151;it
actually says in my notes &#147;to present fraud&#148;, but I do
not suppose that that is what is meant. If a company only delivers
documents electronically, Companies House would not usually accept hard
copies. That means that as long as a company keeps its password and so
on secret, it will have complete control over what is filed. So the
agreements will facilitate that extra protection. And why not, if both
parties find it
acceptable?</div><a name="06070456000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000649"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification. I
do not think that I read the clause incorrectly; it could provide for
Companies House to make different agreements with different companies,
which I think that the Minister said was not the intention, as is
sensible. But it does provide for that, so I have concerns that it
could be used for one-off agreements, which could be confusing. Perhaps
the Minister would like to think about that
further.</div><a name="06070456000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000650"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to do so.
Clearly, although the intention is that there be a standard form, the
same agreement need not be required, or any at all, for everyone. I am
not sure what confusion the hon. Gentleman foresees, but I shall
reflect on it, and if I can deduce confusion, I shall write to him to
try and clear it
up.</div><a name="06070456000402"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000651"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 378, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000652"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to
discuss amendment No. 377, in clause 724,
pageÂ 358,Â lineÂ 22,Â after
&#145;(2)&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="06070456000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection
(1),&#146;.</div><a name="06070456000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000653"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Subsection (2) appears to be aimed at providing
for exceptions to the rule in subsection (1). The latter
states:</div><a name="06070456000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
document is not delivered to the registrar until it is received by the
registrar.&#148;</div><a name="06070456000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is
the case, subsection (2) needs to be carved out of subsection (1). That
is the purpose of amendment No. 377. However, the question then arises
about whether subsection (1) is required at all, if the question of
delivery is to be dealt with by the registrar&#146;s rules. So
amendment No. 378 is aimed at deleting subsection
(1).</div><a name="06070456000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000654"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The concept of delivery in the Bill is an important
one. Much depends on whether a particular document has been delivered.
For example, in many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 411</div>circumstances, a delivered document will then be placed on the public
register. If it has not, or has been incorrectly delivered, the
register might need to issue a notice to rectify the
matter.</div><a name="06070456000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
those consequences, it is important to avoid scope for confusion or
argument about whether a particular document has been delivered. For
that to be clear, it is necessary to have a rather precise definition
of delivery&#151;more precise than the definition in common
language.</div> <a name="06070456000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the
clause does two things. Subsection (1) makes clear the central
proposition that for a document to be delivered it must be received. It
is not enough for the company to say that it put it in the post or
pressed &#147;send&#148; on the e-mail. Subsection (2) allows the
registrar to set out in rules further details of what it means for a
document to be &#147;received&#148;. So the first specifies that it
is not delivered until it is received, and the second provides for
rules and further details of what is meant by &#147;received&#148;.
In many ways, that is related logically to registrars&#146; ability
under clause 721 to set out requirements for the delivery of documents.
For example, it might be prescribed that a document is formally
received when it is opened and recorded on to Companies House systems,
or a particular office in Companies House specified for where the
document should be
received.</div><a name="06070456000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that both those elements are necessary. For the avoidance of doubt,
we need the central proposition that for a document to have been
delivered it must be received and, secondly, the registrar must be
able, subject to that central proposition, to set out more details
about precisely what is meant. Taken together, the provisions will
ensure that a clear set of rules that everyone can understand is
available. That will minimise, or eliminate&#151;one would
hope&#151;any risk of misunderstanding. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment would detract from that position, either by removing the
basic proposition in the first place or by enabling the registrar to
have rules to make decisions that contradict it, which would not be
helpful. The position is clear and desirable, so I invite the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070456000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000655"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the hon. and learned Lady for that
run-around&#151;I was quietly discussing the matter with my hon.
Friend the Member for Hornchurch and we also thought that it was
somewhat circular. The point is legalistic rather than substantive, and
on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070456000413"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
725</h4><a name="06070456000030"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Defective

<a name="06070456000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000656"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not sure what the purpose of subsection (1)
is. It says that a document is not delivered unless other things are
done, which are set out separately, but is that not stating the obvious
and repetitive?</div>
<a name="06070456000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000657"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> When the registrar receives documents she has to
decide whether to make the information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 412</div>contained in them available for public inspection. The clause clarifies
her powers in that area and ensures that the registrar has the power to
omit from the register any or all of the information contained in a
document that does not meet the necessary requirements. Examples of
that could be information that is not sent in conformity with the
rules, in a form or manner of delivery that is not properly
authenticated, or where the necessary fee has not been paid. The
registrar will still be able to accept and register such a document at
her discretion, but by accepting it she will not be exempting the
person who is filing it from any consequence that might attach to their
failure to comply with the original requirements for
delivery.</div><a name="06070456000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taken
together, the elements of the clause provide a sensible framework for
ensuring that defective material does not get accepted and placed on
the public register, and that there is appropriate discipline on
companies to ensure that they file documents in the correct
way&#151;that is surely the main point&#151;while providing a
degree of discretion to the registrar in cases of genuine
doubt.</div><a name="06070456000419"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000658"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Although I maintain that the clause is
repetitive, I accept what the Minister said, in terms of setting a
framework for someone to have easier access round the Bill than they
might have otherwise.</div>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000659"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Again, the clause provides the registrar with a
power to amend the register if incomplete details are given. Will the
registrar formulate an amendment process, so that unfairness or
inconsistency cannot slip into the
system?</div><a name="06070456000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070456000660"></a>Vera
Baird:</b> The clause introduces a new provision, giving the
registrar power to correct information that has been supplied by
informal means&#151;for example, by making a phone call to the
recognised contact of the company in question. The ability to make
informal corrections, rather than having to reject the information or
correct it through a more bureaucratic process of issuing formal
notices, is an important one that companies ought to welcome. The
provision will operate in defined circumstances, which could be where
the information originally received is incomplete&#151;for example,
where some fields on a standard form have been left blank by
accident&#151;where information is internally inconsistent, such as
where a company name does not correspond to the company number, or
where unnecessary information has been provided that needs to be weeded
out.</div><a name="06070456000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
informality of the process, there need to be protections in it. The
ability to make informal corrections will apply only where companies
have informed the registrar that corrected information should apply.
The registrar will need to initiate the correction and be satisfied
that the person is authorised to give the information sought. In order
to be satisfied 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 413</div>as to the authority of the person whom she is telephoning, the registrar
will be able to provide for identification numbers or other checks of
identity. There are some precautions but, none the less, maximum
flexibility and a provision that has a good deal of
utility.</div>
