18</h4><a name="08101653000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Exclusion
or expulsion from trade union for membership of political
party</div><a name="08101653000141"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.25
am</div><a name="08101653000008"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000164"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 19, in clause 18, page 17,
line 27, leave out &#145;other exceptional
hardship&#146; and insert &#145;any material financial
disadvantage&#146;.</div>
<a name="08101653000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">We move on to
the part of the Bill dealing with trade union membership. This is not
the first time that I have spoken of my concerns about the clause, and
I fear that it may not be the last. The clause embodies the conflict
between two fundamental civil liberties: the freedom of association and
an individual&#146;s right of political belief unhindered by
arbitrary interference by public authorities. For that reason, we must
ensure that the clause is debated to the fullest extent and that
arguments both for and against are carefully
examined.</div><a name="08101653000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bar on trade unions excluding or expelling individuals from membership
is set out in section 174 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Consolidation) Act 1992 as introduced by section 14 of the Trade Union
Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993. The section was subsequently
amended in considerable detail by the Employment Relations Act 2004,
and the changes made it clear that it was lawful for trade unions to
exclude or expel individuals on the grounds of their political party
activities. I was on the Committee that considered that legislation and
recall the debate in which we went with the right for unions to end
membership on grounds of conduct but not of belief. Despite the best
efforts of this House and the other place when passing that
legislation, the balance of the competing rights of the individual and
of the trade unions was knocked somewhat out of kilter by the decision
taken in Strasbourg by the European Court of Human Rights in ASLEF
<i class="I">v.</i> UK. Conservative Members accept that decision, although we do
not like
it.</div><a name="08101653000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the sake of brevity and to save the Committee from a discussion on a
judgment that many hon. Members will no doubt be well acquainted with,
I will note only the barest bones of the details of the case.
Mr. Lee, for 10 years a member of the British National
party, applied for and was accepted into membership of ASLEF. Three
months later, ASLEF received a report about Mr. Lee alleging
not only that he had stood for the BNP in local authority elections but
that he had been engaged in racist conduct. He was expelled by ASLEF
and took his case to an employment tribunal, alleging breach of section
174 on the ground that he was expelled not for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>his conduct but for his membership of the BNP. The tribunal upheld his
claim. However, ASLEF appealed to the European Court of Human Rights.
The Court&#146;s assessment of section 174 led it to the conclusion
that trade unions should be given greater scope to exclude or expel
members on the basis of political party membership alone. In essence,
the Court said that section 174 as it stands interferes with
ASLEF&#146;s freedom of association under article 11 of the European
convention on human rights. Under article 4 of the convention, an
obligation is placed on the United Kingdom to comply with the judgment
of the Strasbourg Court and adopt amending legislation, and that is
what today is all about.</div>
<a name="08101653000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I want
to express the Conservative party&#146;s deep unease with the
decision in the ASLEF case. To our mind it marks a further erosion of
personal civil liberties by an organisation with a remit that is meant
to protect them. What a topsy-turvy world we live in when a court of
human rights is reining in the freedoms of an individual to be a member
of a recognised political party. Secondly, it seems that the Strasbourg
decision was affected by the fact that the BNP member&#146;s job was
not put at risk by his union expulsion, which would be the case if, for
instance, there had been a closed shop. It seems that there is yet room
for this area of law to be developed further.</div>
<a name="08101653000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee will be aware, following the European Court of Human Rights
decision, the Government&#146;s consultation paper of May 2007
suggested two options for the amendment of the existing legislation.
Option A, which was initially used in the Bill when it was presented in
another place, proposed a broad amendment to section 174 which would
make it lawful for trade unions to expel or exclude on the basis that
political party membership activities were unacceptable to them. That
provided much greater autonomy to the trade unions in deciding their
membership. The vast majority of the 33 consultation respondents were
in favour of that option, but that may have had something to do with
the fact that 26 of them were trade
unions.</div><a name="08101653000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Option
B, we thought, was the more constrained and sensible option, containing
safeguards against abuse. It was proposed in the other place by the
Liberal Democrats and received our support. The Government are to be
commended for their eventual decision to go with that option.</div>
<a name="08101653000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
options were discussed at some length in the other place, as were
almost all aspects of the clause. I will not rerun those debates.
However, I will draw out some key points that it is important to
reiterate. We support the decision to use option B. To my mind, the
likely consequences of option A on trade union autonomy are difficult
to swallow. I fail to see how giving arbitrary powers to trade unions
to bar membership would result in less litigation, as was originally
suggested by the
Government.</div><a name="08101653000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
legal challenge under option A, which would undoubtedly arise given the
BNP&#146;s tendency to grandstand in the courts on these issues,
would be made a common-law breach of union rules and decided on the
arbitrary nature of the rules. That could take us back 30 years to the
days when trade union rules were seen as quasi-legislation that the
court had to interpret, rather than as a contract between the union and
its
members.</div><a name="08101653000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the statutory safeguards in option B are far safer and
more democratic because Parliament, rather than the courts, will set
the parameters. With that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>in mind, we believe that option B is the correct method, or at least the
best of the available choices. The provisions set out that trade unions
should not exclude or expel
members</div><a name="08101653000131"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise
than in accordance with the union
rules&#148;</div><a name="08101653000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
by a decision that is unfair. Option B, as it appears in the Bill, will
ensure a test of proportionality to some degree. Such measures are the
yardstick for any decision about an individual. Openness and
transparency of the criteria must be applied and there must be fairness
in the application of the
facts.</div><a name="08101653000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, the Conservative party thinks that the clause requires further
refinement if it is not to harbour the possibility of unfairness. I
apologise for my somewhat lengthy introduction, but without putting
them in context the amendments would not have made
sense.</div><a name="08101653000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 19 has its roots in the ASLEF decision in the ECHR and the need to
safeguard individual rights. The ECHR decision was that Mr.
Lee had not
suffered</div><a name="08101653000132"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
particular detriment, save loss of membership itself in the
union&#148;.</div><a name="08101653000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
it went on to conclude that he lost
nothing</div><a name="08101653000133"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
terms of his livelihood or in his conditions of
employment&#148;.</div><a name="08101653000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
that was not the turning point of the case, it was a significant point
raised by the Court. There is enough indication, however, that in other
circumstances the Court may have been persuaded that there had been
sufficient detriment to a claimant for a decision to go in his or her
favour. Although the UK employment market is no longer blighted by the
closed shop, this aspect of the decision opens a rich vein of
opportunity for claims to be made by the BNP and
others.</div><a name="08101653000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
important amendment was provided by the Liberal Democrats in the other
place. Its aim is to ensure that appropriate statutory safeguards are
put in place to prevent the abuse of the clause. Furthermore, such
safeguards would prevent the courts from being unduly forced to prevent
abuse by trade unions and deal with the corresponding
litigation.</div><a name="08101653000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the amendment, a trade union would not be able to expel or exclude a
person from membership if the result would be to inflict a
&#147;material financial disadvantage&#148; on the individual. The
Bill uses the term &#147;exceptional hardship&#148;, which while an
improvement on the original concept of &#147;hardship&#148; alone,
is too broad to act as a consistent measure of hardship. I share Lord
Lester&#146;s concern that without a more clearly defined and
qualified concept of &#147;hardship&#148;, the ambiguity of the
term could lead to court cases. We need to spell out a clear and
concise measure so that that cannot
happen.</div><a name="08101653000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
with reference to proposed new subsection (4G)(c), I submit that a
criterion of &#147;exceptional hardship&#148;, with all its
associated problems, as the Government showed in the other place, is
perhaps too opaque a phrase for the purpose. I instead propose
&#147;material financial disadvantage&#148; as the safeguard to be
included in the
clause.</div><a name="08101653000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000165"></a><b class="B">Michael
Jabez Foster</b> (Hastings and Rye) (Lab): Material hardship
is such a low test. I cannot think of an example in which there would
not be material hardship, material being a non-quantitative term, save
that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>exists. It is such a low test that, were it to be imposed, I cannot see
a situation in which a union could ever expel. Will the hon. Gentleman
give an example in which he thinks expulsion would
arise?</div><a name="08101653000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000166"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We believe that an assessment of that phrase is
far easier than what is proposed. Financial hardship is a concept that
we all recognise and I trust it can be judged on an objective basis. It
allows the courts or trade unions to take into account the financial
circumstances of the affected individual without undue
difficulty.</div><a name="08101653000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000167"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give way
again?</div><a name="08101653000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000168"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No, because I am going to answer the
question.</div><a name="08101653000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
regards what is material, the courts in this country have a long
tradition of considering what is material in any case. Commercial
contract disputes often pivot on what is to be considered material.
Given that background, the familiarity of the courts and trade unions
with these concepts and with case law, and the subsequent ease with
which an assessment can be made on the facts, we think it better to
replace &#147;exceptional hardship&#148; with &#147;material
financial
hardship&#148;.</div><a name="08101653000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000169"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b> The hon. Gentleman
talks about material financial &#147;hardship&#148;, but his
amendment refers to material financial &#147;disadvantage&#148;,
which is even milder than the point made by my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="08101653000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000170"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I think the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye was
questioning the use of &#147;material&#148;. We believe that
materiality as a concept is the key. That is why we have moved the
amendment.</div><a name="08101653000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000171"></a><b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): Before I go on to the
substantive issue, I must reiterate a declaration of interest. Perhaps
uniquely among Opposition Members, I had a vote in the Labour deputy
leadership election. It is still stuck on the wall of my office,
uncast. I had it because I happen to belong to a trade union that is
affiliated to the Labour party. The clause, in a sense, has a direct
relevance to me because I am not a Labour supporter, Labour voter or
even a member of the Labour party; I am a member of another political
party and I could be expelled from the Musicians Union for standing
here as a Liberal Democrat Member of
Parliament.</div><a name="08101653000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000172"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Bercow.
The hon. Gentleman has just declared something that may be
unconstitutional. If he does not pay his political levy to the Labour
party, he would not have a
vote.</div><a name="08101653000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000173"></a>The

Hemming:</b> On the point of merriment, I have told the Labour
party that I do not mind it having the &#163;5 affiliation fee, as
long as it stops selling peerages or accepting loans for peerages. In
the interests of pluralism, I am quite happy for the &#163;5 or so,
which is paid by the trade union without my agreement, to continue to
be paid to the Labour
party.</div><a name="08101653000037"></a>

Liberal Democrat party rules, it is possible financially to support
another party while remaining a Liberal Democrat Member of
Parliament.</div><a name="08101653000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000180"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The rules of political parties are absolutely
not matters for points of order and they are certainly not an issue for
the Chair as, I have a hunch, the experienced hon. Member for East
Devon is well
aware.</div><a name="08101653000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000181"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I am not sure that is a point to which I should
respond as it is not necessarily in order.</div>
<a name="08101653000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
mentions material financial disadvantage. It being an amendment
proposed in the other House by my noble Friend Lord Lester, we
obviously continue to support it here. Materiality is quite
straightforward. There is a fee to be a member of a trade union. It
does not all go to the Labour party. Therefore it is quite feasible to
identify a material disadvantage where it exceeds the fee that would
have been paid to the trade union had one been a member of it. That is
quite a reasonable argument. Otherwise, we are pleased with the
solution identified by Lord Lester.</div>
<a name="08101653000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Freedom of
association is important, and not to be discounted when one has what
are effectively voluntary associations. If there is no material
financial disadvantage, that is a reasonable action to permit under the
rules.</div><a name="08101653000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000182"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): There is a genuine conflict
over the issue of liberty, which was well summarised by the hon. Member
for Huntingdon. We all accept that freedom of belief and association is
important. It is not right, in general terms, to combat a legal
political party by harassing its members. To take a parallel on the
other side of the political spectrum, I was one of those who were
concerned by the German Berufsverbot, by which members of the Communist
party were systematically excluded from parts of public service. A
trade union, however, is not an employer or an official body. Freedom
of association allows us to choose with whom we associate. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>Therefore, the test needs to be whether the behaviour of an individual
is such that it renders him unacceptable to members of a union or
association, and whether such exclusion causes him severe hardship, as
mentioned in the Government&#146;s
proposal.</div><a name="08101653000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
listened carefully to the comrade from Birmingham, Yardley. The balance
of interests is satisfied by the rules laid down in the Bill. I do not
say that lightly; the issue is finely balanced. If we had a closed
shop, the position would be different, because one would have to belong
to a union to have a particular kind of employment. We would then see
an indirect Berufsverbot, whereby a union would be able to prevent
somebody from practising their profession because it objected to that
person&#146;s legal political views. Therefore, it is important that
proposed subsection (4G)(c) stays in the Bill so that if a closed shop
were imposed again for a particular trade and for a particular reason,
the law would not be totally static. We do not want an unintended
consequence to arise from this law. With that safeguard in the Bill,
even if I were to be a member of an extreme&#151;or a
non-extreme&#151;group that was excluded from a particular trade
union, I would not feel that my ability to prosper and to pursue my
profession was obstructed. The proposals are reasonable, and I
congratulate the Minister on reaching this point in a difficult and
hard-to-balance
area.</div><a name="08101653000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000183"></a><b class="B">Mr.

it seems particularly unjust. I want to refer to a situation in my dim
and distant youth, when I worked as chief clerk in the Co-operative
bank&#151;when they had one&#151;in Wellingborough. I was a rather
vociferous young Conservative, and vice-chairman of the association
party of Young Conservatives. I had the opportunity to attempt to
become a Conservative agent, and I succeeded. That is one of my
proudest boasts. However, the general secretary of the Co-operative
party allowed me to go for the initial interview and take the
examination on the understanding that, if I failed, I would leave my
Young Conservative work and not be a thorn in his side when some of my
words appeared in the press.</div>

am</div><a name="08101653000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have had experience, therefore, of being a member of a political party
and of that being used in certain ways which perhaps were not quite
legal. I was a young man and my livelihood was important, and I
accepted that agreement when I should not have done. However, if I went
back to the Co-operative party organisation in Wellingborough today,
could it say that, because I had been a member of the Young
Conservatives in Wellingborough 40 years ago, I cannot have that job? I
recognise that there are more detailed legal matters tied up in the
issue, but I want some understanding of what &#147;having
been&#148; means in terms of time. The suggestion that we limit and
define &#147;having been&#148; is important in this respect. There
are many previous members of the Labour party who have now got so sick
and tired of it that they want to join the Conservative
party.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000184"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s career
history may well be illuminating and, indeed, of ongoing interest to
members of the Committee. However the reference to &#147;having
been&#148;, important though it is, is really relevant to a clause
stand part debate. He made the point very clearly, and if he wants to
develop it further in the clause stand part debate I hope that he will
catch my eye and have the chance to do so.</div>
<a name="08101653000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000185"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I seek clarification on the clause. It says quite
clearly:</div><a name="08101653000134"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
individual would lose his livelihood or suffer other exceptional
hardship by reason of not being, or ceasing to be, a member of the
union.&#148;</div><a name="08101653000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Committee is aware, our proposal is to replace &#147;other
exceptional hardship&#148; by &#147;any material financial
disadvantage.&#148; The Government have got themselves into a bit of
a fix over this. They are meant to be the protectors of all employees,
but here they are, sectioning out those who perhaps a union does not
agree with, for political reasons, in a rather pernicious manner. I
should have thought that, in this economic decline, masterminded over
the past 10 years and now, hopefully, reaching its culmination under
the iron Chancellor, that everybody&#146;s employment rights should
be paramount. It is the heavy hand of a rather arrogant Government to
suggest that, in legislation, they can decide what exceptional
hardship, as opposed to material hardship, is.</div>
<a name="08101653000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened to
the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye&#146;s questioning of what
material hardship would be, suggesting that &#147;any material
financial disadvantage&#148; could cover almost anything. Perhaps it
can, but I suggest that a disadvantage is losing one&#146;s job,
being unable to keep up one&#146;s mortgage repayments and the effect
that that might have on family life. These are very serious issues and
I find it quite extraordinary that the Opposition are seeking
clarification on a matter which is more usually within the remit of a
Labour party that purports to support
employees.</div>
<a name="08101653000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000186"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Let me put the amendment in context. The hon.
Member for Huntingdon set out some of the background to the clause. It
was the subject of more debate when the Bill passed through the other
place than any other clause. We can understand why that is, because it
deals with a very sensitive issue, which is the balance between the
rights of freedom of association and of freedom to join a political
party. That is obviously sensitive territory, and we must proceed with
caution and care when legislating in that
area.</div><a name="08101653000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation is necessary because of the ECHR judgment in the ASLEF
<i class="I">v.</i> UK case. As we have heard, that involved ASLEF&#146;s
attempts to expel a member of the BNP&#151;I will not repeat the
background to the case that the hon. Gentleman has set out. The court,
in weighing up the different rights involved, found that UK law as it
stands is not compatible with article 11 of the European convention on
human rights, concerning freedom of association. I hope that the need
to legislate does not divide us. The Government believe that our law
should be compatible with the convention. The question is how to
legislate, which was at the heart of the debates on the clause in the
other place.</div>
<a name="08101653000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
introducing the Bill, the Government consulted on two options. The
first was a deregulatory approach that would simplify the law and give
unions broad 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>powers on the matter. The second was a more specific approach, broadly
along the lines of the current clause 18. The Government originally
adopted the deregulatory approach, but that aroused fierce controversy
in the other place across the political parties. We have heard that
Lord Lester of Herne Hill was very vocal on the issue, as was Lord
Morris of Handsworth, who spoke on the subject at Second and Third
Reading. After a great deal of discussion, with those eminent peers in
particular&#151;one of whom is one of the country&#146;s most
eminent human rights experts and the other is one of the
country&#146;s most eminent trade unionists&#151;as well as
consideration of the views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the
Government agreed to amend the clause to create the current clause
18.</div>
<a name="08101653000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
clause 18 does two things. It restores the provisions relating to
&#147;protected conduct&#148;, meaning membership of a political
party, which the previous clause would have repealed. It then sets out
three safeguards for when a trade union proposes to expel or exclude
someone on the basis of party membership. One of those safeguards
relates to the subject of amendment No. 19. I shall concentrate on that
rather than the other two.</div>
<a name="08101653000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Exclusion or
expulsion should not result
in</div><a name="08101653000135"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;exceptional
hardship by reason of not being, or ceasing to be, a member of the
union.&#148;</div><a name="08101653000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the exceptional hardship must be directly related to not
being a member of a union. That is set out at proposed new subsection
(4G)(c) in clause 18. The phrase &#147;exceptional hardship&#148;
has been the focus of the debate. We did not choose it at random; it
was the phrase used in the ECHR judgment, paragraph 43 of which
states:</div><a name="08101653000136"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Such
abuse might occur, for example, where exclusion or expulsion from a
trade union was not in accordance with union rules or where the rules
were wholly unreasonable or arbitrary or where the consequences of
exclusion or expulsion resulted in exceptional
hardship&#148;.</div>
<a name="08101653000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the same phrase
used by the Joint Committee on Human Rights when it considered the
matter. Its report on how the clause should be amended said
that</div><a name="08101653000137"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
exclusion or expulsion of the individual is permitted only
if...the
decision&#148;</div><a name="08101653000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">is</div><a name="08101653000138"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;taken
in accordance with the union&#146;s rules and a fair
procedure;...the union&#146;s rules are not wholly unreasonable;
and...the consequences of exclusion or expulsion would not result
in exceptional hardship.&#148;</div>
<a name="08101653000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test we have set in
the clause is therefore the same as the test quoted in the judgment by
the ECHR and referred to in the report on that issue by the Joint
Committee on Human
Rights.</div><a name="08101653000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference
has been made to loss of livelihood. Paragraph 50 of the judgment
states that such a case would not result in exceptional
hardship:</div><a name="08101653000139"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
there was no closed shop agreement for example, there was no apparent
prejudice suffered by the applicant in terms of his livelihood or in
his conditions of
employment.&#148;</div><a name="08101653000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
being a member of the union did not mean that the individual would lose
his job, which could have been the case when a closed shop existed in
this country, and that was referred to in the ECHR
judgment.</div><a name="08101653000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000187"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Baron</b> (Billericay) (Con): The Minister is approaching
the issue in the delicate manner it deserves. While I accept what he
says about the importance of there being no closed shop, does he not
feel at least a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>tad uncomfortable with the legislation, because we are talking, despite
all the qualifications, about a trade union being able to expel someone
from membership purely on the grounds of what that person
believes?</div>
<a name="08101653000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000188"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> As I said, this is a delicate area, and we have
to tread carefully when we legislate on it. However, we are legislating
in line with the ECHR judgement, which found that the absence of such a
provision left us wanting in regard to article 11, and that was based
on membership of a political party rather than on grounds of conduct,
which had previously been in the rules.</div>
<a name="08101653000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000189"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Does the Minister personally believe that a union
should have such
power?</div><a name="08101653000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000190"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am happy to legislate on that basis because I
think that our laws should be in line with the convention. When such
powers are exercised, it is important that there are proper safeguards,
and that is why we have put them in the Bill. I have concentrated on
only one of them in this case, but there are three in
total.</div>
<a name="08101653000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000191"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen Crabb</b> (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con): If it were
not for the European Court of Human Rights judgment, would the Minister
have any interest in bringing forward this kind of
legislation?</div><a name="08101653000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000192"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We have the ECHR judgment, which has given rise
to the legislation, and it gave us the test of exceptional hardship.
The amendment mentions &#147;material financial disadvantage&#148;
rather than material financial hardship, a point to which the hon.
Member for Huntingdon referred several times. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Hastings and Rye said, this is an altogether different
test&#151;a much lower test&#151;that could include many detriments
associated with loss of union membership. For example, many unions
provide a limited form of free or subsidised legal advice. Such legal
assistance could of course be purchased by the individual, but he might
end up having to pay more for it, which could result in a loss of some
benefit because he is not a member of the trade
union.</div>
<a name="08101653000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000193"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> The Minister looks rather resigned when I make
these points, but I am only trying to protect the workers. Were a
member of a union to be expelled from that union for reasons of
political membership, would that person still be a member until the
judgment is against him or her? Therefore, would he or she be entitled
to the union&#146;s protection for the legal fees in contesting the
expulsion?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000194"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That would depend on how the union rule book
constructed its free legal advice. My point is that we have chosen the
test for exceptional hardship carefully. We discussed it with Lord
Lester of Herne Hill, and it is referred to in the ECHR judgment and
the report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Were we to agree
to the test proposed in the amendment, it is possible that any expelled
or excluded BNP member would try to argue that the union&#146;s
decision had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>disadvantaged them financially. In practical terms, that could make it
almost impossible to use the provisions in the new
clause.</div><a name="08101653000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000195"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): My union, Unison, has a holiday
home for its members in Croyde bay, Devon, which I highly recommend to
anyone seeking to escape the worries of this place. Is not the
amendment a wrecking amendment? As the Minister said, if it were
accepted a BNP activist could cite not only the loss of legal and
financial services but the inability to take a holiday at the Croyde
bay complex as a hardship
incurred.</div><a name="08101653000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000196"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I note that
the hon. Member for East Devon is here; I am sure that he would enjoy
some respite in the Unison-provided home there.</div>
<a name="08101653000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
serious point at the heart of the matter. No union will take lightly
the responsibilities entailed by a decision to expel or exclude someone
from membership; after all, unions are in the business of recruiting
members. We are setting down rules in legislation on how that should be
done. It should not be done in a way that would give anyone a host of
objections that are not based on exceptional hardship and could tie up
unions in vexatious or similar proceedings. The clause creates
safeguards that concern the union&#146;s rule book, the
person&#146;s capacity to make representations and the test for
exceptional hardship. It is not an arbitrary power; safeguards will
apply that have been discussed carefully in the other place and, by and
large, recommended by the Joint Committee. The amendment would take us
beyond those and call into question the practicability of the clause
and the Bill.</div>
<a name="08101653000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000197"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> Although I accept that in the Minister&#146;s
mind safeguards may apply, there is no disguising the fact that this is
a draconian power. If we believe that the best of unionism aims for
equality and fairness for all, a union can hardly defend the position
that it excludes members purely on grounds of their political beliefs.
That is not equality or fairness for all: it is an infringement of
civil liberties that must be considered carefully. We are going down a
slippery slope if we accept the principle of these measures. What might
come around the corner? Perhaps the safeguards will be diluted. Putting
those to one side, it is still an infringement of civil liberties that
is difficult to defend. Were it not for the ECHR, would the Government
be pushing this legislation? That is a straightforward question; will
the Minister give a straightforward
answer?</div><a name="08101653000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000198"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman is basically saying that we
should not be legislating on the matter. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.]</i>
We have decided to legislate because we believe it important for our
law to be in line with the ECHR.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000199"></a>The

Billericay is the very embodiment of courtesy. I feel sure that he will
return to his natural state of mind.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000200"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I sense that in his heart of hearts the Minister is
slightly uncomfortable with the clause. I am sure that he is honest at
all times, but if he could be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>more so now, I think that he would say that he is uneasy. Was the clause
inserted at the instigation of the  unions, or did it arise out
of discussions with them? If so, was that some time before or after the
Government gave the unions &#163;10 million towards their
modernisation programmes, or before the unions gave the Government
&#163;10 million
back?</div><a name="08101653000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000201"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> As I have said four or five times, the clause is
in the Bill because the Government believe that our domestic law should
be compatible with the ECHR. We have heard this question from the
Opposition a few times, so let me speculate that if they are ever in a
position to decide such matters, they would depart from the convention.
If they would not align our domestic law with it, they are welcome to
say so, but the Government believe that we should legislate with that
in
mind.</div><a name="08101653000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101653000202"></a><b class="B">Barry
Gardiner</b> (Brent, North) (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree
that Conservative Back Benchers are somewhat trivialising the reason
why the convention was brought into this in the first place? The
European Court of Human Rights examining two competing rights and
claims of liberty; indeed, that is why the matter had to go to the
Court in the first place. After due consideration, it found&#151;the
Joint Committee backed it up&#151;that the right of freedom of
association has priority over the right to join a union, which we would
all accept should be a right in our society. Sometimes those rights
conflict, so it is important to take seriously what the court
determined in its prioritising of the two.</div>
<a name="08101653000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000203"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend is right to refer us to the
history of the matter. The judgment tried to balance competing rights
because the right of association was also involved&#151;that is, the
right of union members to decide with whom they associate. The Court
ruled on a situation in which a member of the British National party
held beliefs that were completely at variance with the dominant ethos
of the union.</div>
<a name="08101653000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
that we are setting out is not arbitrary, and there are important
safeguards. I should like to quote the views expressed by Lord Morris
of Handsworth who, I think we all accept, knows a thing or two about
trade unionism and facing up to extremism:</div>
<a name="08101653000140"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Three
key principles have been met: Britain will be able to comply with its
statutory obligations, trade unions will have freedom and democratic
rights in respect of their rule books, while the ability to discipline
their members has been preserved, and members&#146; rights to natural
justice will be safeguarded. On that basis...I wish the Bill well
on its way&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2
June 2008; Vol. 702, c.

his verdict on the safeguards that we have built
in.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000204"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> Of course, Lord Morris could have been
wrong. Given the comments from Opposition Members, does my hon. Friend
agree that, like Lord Morris, he would not want to spend time in a
holiday home with a racist? Why are we looking at the provisions in
terms of exceptional grounds? He keeps referring to the fact that the
court judgment says that the test is one of exceptional hardship. Where
in the judgment does that apply, because that was not the understanding
of others?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000206"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his eternal
patience. Does he agree that the amendment is likely to be incompatible
with the ECHR? Am I right that, as members of the European Union, we
are collectively bound by that, and that if the Opposition were to
press the amendment to a Division they would therefore, in effect, call
into question the whole basis of our association with the European
Union?</div><a name="08101653000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000207"></a>Mr.

illuminate the situation for my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe.
The ECHR pre-dates the EU, and its set of signatories is much wider
than that of the EU&#146;s member states. I am sure that Opposition
Members would wish to question our membership of the EU in many other
areas, but that would not be the case in respect of the

conclusion.</div><a name="08101653000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must tread carefully in legislating on such serious matters. There are
competing rights to do with joining a political party and freedom of
association. We intend to legislate in a way that is compatible with
the judgment of the Court and not to accept amendments that would
render the clause completely unworkable. On that basis, I ask the hon.
Member for Huntingdon to withdraw the amendment. If he presses it to a
vote, I ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000218"></a>John
Hemming:</b><b class="B"> </b>The ECHR is connected with the Council of
Europe. As the hon. Member for Wakefield said, it has been in existence
for much longer than the EU and has nothing do with it. Nevertheless,
we have agreed to work within it, and that is the correct position. The
Government made the right decision in 1998 to legislate to enable
people to use the convention in domestic courts rather than in the
European Court
alone.</div><a name="08101653000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a debate about the judgment&#146;s use of the phrase
&#147;exceptional hardship&#148;. That could include non-pecuniary
hardship and therefore be broader than material financial disadvantage.
To some extent, we may be debating how many angels are on the head of a
pin. However, Liberal Democrat Members believe that the phrase in the
judgment is what we should include in the legislation, even though
there is great difficulty in defining which phrase is narrower and
which is broader. Speaking personally, I am happy with the provision.
It is not reasonable, for instance, to expect somebody who happens to
be of mixed race to associate with somebody who believes that they
should not exist. The BNP&#146;s official party policy is that
mixed-race people should not exist, so it is entirely reasonable for
somebody to be able to say, &#147;I do not want anything to do with
those people.&#148; We are creating a situation where only the
membership of the union is at stake, not any exceptional hardship. I do
not think that there is a big difference between the phrases,
&#147;exceptional hardship&#148; and &#147;material financial
disadvantage&#148;. In some areas, one of those is broader; in other
areas, it is the other one. Nevertheless, if &#147;exceptional
hardship&#148; is the phrase in the judgment, that is what we should
go
with.</div><a name="08101653000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000219"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> I do not want to delay the Committee
unnecessarily, but I would like to clarify the point about the
convention. My understanding is that it was established well before the
EU, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield said. We are signatories
to it, and, as a result, we as individuals have always been allowed to
go to the Court in Strasbourg. However, even were that not the case,
the EU is signed up collectively to the convention, so it would not be
not possible to follow the suggestion of the hon. Member for Billericay
by ignoring a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights because we
do not agree with it without calling into question our membership of
the
EU.</div><a name="08101653000144"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000220"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I agree with the Minister that the question is
not whether we legislate, but how we legislate. We have signed up to
the European convention on human rights and, as far as I am aware, this
country has never failed to follow the rulings of the European Court of
Human Rights, whichever party has been in power. I will not use
today&#146;s sitting to debate whether that should be
questioned&#151;that is an argument for another
day.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div><a name="08101653000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friends have raised legitimate concerns about the nature of this
provision and its intrinsic unfairness, and I agree with nearly
everything that has been said. Unfortunately, we are discussing
maximising the protections given to the Court&#146;s judgment. The
Minister referred to a list of eminent people who took one view or
another. We do not feel that the right balance has been struck. The
issues involved are more fundamental than whether we want to share
retirement homes with racists or people with other nasty
views.</div><a name="08101653000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000221"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> Is not this debate about the ability of BNP
activists or other extreme groups to undo the vital work that trade
unions do in getting out an anti-racism message by working covertly or
overtly in a union to recruit members for their own
purposes?</div><a name="08101653000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101653000222"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I do not think that it is about that in the
slightest. We cannot defend liberties by destroying them. We are trying
to strike a balance between the interests of trade union powers and
those of the individual. That is the crux of today&#146;s debate. As
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley said, how fair that balance is
depends on our political leanings and our beliefs. This process has
already led to a complicated clause of powers and protections. As the
old saying goes, you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow&#146;s
ear, but anyone who has read the nitty-gritty of the clause will
appreciate that it has a go at doing so.</div>
<a name="08101653000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">As matters
stand, we are not confident that enough consideration has been given to
the possibility of material hardship being taken into consideration. On
that basis, I should like to divide the
Committee.</div><a name="08101653000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
