Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): On a
point of order, Mr. Chope. On Tuesday,  the
Government tabled 89 amendments. There were  94 Government
amendments on the amendment paper before that. I am concerned that just
22 days after Second Reading, the Bill is very different from the one
that was agreed by our colleagues. Those amendments have not come from
the Opposition, but from the Government. This is not a good way of
putting legislation through the
House.</div><a name="09031949000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
timetable for consideration of the Bill was agreed on the basis of
there being 256 clauses and certain assumptions were made about the
number of amendments that would be tabled for debate by the Opposition.
We even took into account the erudition of my hon. Friend the Member
for South Holland and The Deepings in calculating the number of
sittings that would be needed to scrutinise the Bill properly. We now
discover that we have almost 200 Government amendments to scrutinise
and debate between now and 31 March. That is not a satisfactory way to
conduct business. Will you advise us, Mr. Chope, on what
procedures we can adopt to ensure that the Bill and the Government
amendments receive the scrutiny that they
require?</div><a name="09031949000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000221"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b> Further to
that point of order, Mr. Chope. I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. I say simply that we have sought to give the
Opposition reasonable time to scrutinise the amendments by tabling them
in good time before they reach scrutiny in Committee. Very few of them
are substantial amendments. The complicated nature of the Bill means
that there are many individual amendments, but the substantive changes
are few and most of the amendments are
consequential.</div><a name="09031949000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031949000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): Further to that point
of order, Mr. Chope. Given the concerns raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, is it possible
for the Committee to come back for a few sittings after the Easter
recess to consider the new amendments?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div><a name="09031949000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000223"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Most of the points that have been made are
essentially about the wisdom of the Government tabling so many
amendments. There is nothing novel about that. If there is a
substantive issue about the shortage of time available for proper
scrutiny of the Bill, it is a matter for the Programming Sub-Committee.
It is for the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the
Minister to discuss whether it should reconvene to change the
programme. It is not a matter for the
Chair.</div><a name="09031949000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031949000224"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): On a
point of order, Mr. Chope. You will recall that at our last
sitting there was an extensive debate about the information made
available to the Committee on the costs of the reorganisation that is
at the heart of the Bill. Have you had notice of any further
information on that? The Minister was invited to make that available to
the Committee in written form to supplement the information we have
already received. If you have not had notice of that, Mr.
Chope, by what means can diligent Committee members obtain the
information that is necessary to ensure proper scrutiny of the Bill? If
we cannot obtain it, I do not see how we can continue to debate these
matters as fully as we would
wish.</div><a name="09031949000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000225"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Chope. As I said in the last sitting, I will write to the Committee. I
will definitely do so before Report. I will try to do so before we
conclude our Committee sittings. I simply repeat what I said last week.
If we need more time, I am happy to work late again next
Tuesday.</div><a name="09031949000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000226"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think that the Minister has answered the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="09031949000011"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000227"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I beg to move amendment 316, in clause 69,
page 43, line 28, leave out &#145;section
15ZA(1)&#146; and insert &#145;sections 15ZA(1) and
18A(1)&#146;.</div><a name="09031978000001"></a><div class="hs_brev"><i class="I">This
amendment requires the YPLA to issue guidance about LEAs&#146;

detention.</i></div><a name="09031949000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000228"></a>The

Government amendment
317.</div><a name="09031949000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000229"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The clause requires the Young People&#146;s
Learning Agency to issue guidance to local authorities about the
performance of their functions under proposed new section 15ZA of the
Education Act 1996. Amendments 316 and 317 will extend that requirement
to include local authorities&#146; functions in relation to securing
education and training for those subject to youth
detention.</div><a name="09031949000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
238 would remove the requirement placed on the YPLA to issue guidance
to local authorities about the performance of their duties and replace
it with a requirement to issue guidance to providers. It would also
remove the ability of the YPLA to issue any other guidance about any
other of its functions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div><a name="09031949000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000230"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Amendments 396 and 238 have not been
selected for
debate.</div><a name="09031949000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000231"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> In which case, I apologise to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="09031949000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000232"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It is not easy to contribute to the debate when we
have had too few words of introduction to the amendments. Perhaps I can
set them in the Committee&#146;s mind more clearly. The amendments
broaden the guidance to include young people in detention. As other
amendments on detention have been passed, it is difficult to object to
these. However, there are questions that should be asked. Perhaps the
Minister will deal with them when he
replies.</div><a name="09031949000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
will the guidance be clear enough to ensure that those in youth
detention have access to a coherent curriculum, and a range of
qualifications consistent with that curriculum, when they move from
home to host authority? The Committee will remember that we debated the
difficulties of a young person being in a host authority away from
their local council and the consequent difficulty of transferring
information between those two local authorities.</div>
<a name="09031949000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
will the guidance ensure that a premium is placed on sharing
information between those authorities, in the way that I have
described? That is, after all, vital to fulfilling local
authorities&#146; duties as set out in the
Bill.</div><a name="09031949000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
will the guidance ensure above all that a premium is placed on the
consistency of training and education that is offered to those in
detention? They are often young people who have been passed around for
their entire lives. If we are to break that cycle of desperation,
access to consistent, equitable and coherent education and training is
absolutely necessary. I refer the Minister once again to independent
and Government analysis, which suggests that a problem with training
and education for those in detention&#151;both young people and
others&#151;is the provision of a consistent diet of education that
leads to qualifications which enable them to change their lives when
they are free to do
so.</div><a name="09031949000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000233"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Clearly, there will be interplay between the
guidance referred to in respect of the youth offender clauses. Our aim
is to ensure that all young people have the right learning
opportunities and support. We have worked with higher education
colleges and employers to develop the new diploma. There are issues
about the availability of diplomas in young offenders institutions and
other youth detention centres, where most young people are detained for
an average of three to four months. It will not be practical for them
to study for the full diploma, particularly given that we have said
that no individual school or college is capable of delivering the whole
entitlement. It therefore stands to reason that no individual youth
detention centre will be able to do that
either.</div><a name="09031949000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the diploma is a flexible course. We are considering how young
offenders might be able to study for some components that can then
contribute to a full diploma when they are no longer in custody. For
example, a small number of young offenders institutions are involved in
pilots on the delivery of functional skills in English, maths and
information and communications technology, which would be an integral
part of all learning routes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div><a name="09031949000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clearly
critical that young people in custody have access to high-quality
education and training consistent with that available in the mainstream
sector. In the guidance to local authorities, we expect education and
training in juvenile custody to place a clear focus on the core
functional skills of literacy, numeracy and ICT. We had a long debate
about the importance of those skills, particularly literacy, for those
young people in particular. The guidance will set out how we expect
that to be delivered, as well as the elements of the additional diploma
entitlements that cannot be delivered, so that there is complete
consistency. Where we can achieve that, we want to do
so.</div><a name="09031949000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000234"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister would not expect a comment about
reading and literacy to escape an intervention from the Opposition.
Will he confirm that the guidance will recommend the use of synthetic
phonics in the teaching of reading, using programmes such as the
toe-by-toe approach, which is a phonics-based programme used in
prisons? Will he also confirm that the guidance will be consistent with
Government policy and the law as far as children are concerned, and
that phonics will be the basis of ensuring that prisoners can read
properly?</div><a name="09031949000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000235"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Just because the hon. Gentleman talks most about
synthetic phonics does not mean that I do not share his passion to
ensure that all children and young people are confident readers and
achieve their full potential in reading. Naturally, the guidance will
be consistent with Government policy and the law&#151;it would be
bizarre to suggest otherwise&#151;and, certainly, we want to ensure
through that guidance that delivery is based on reading schemes that
work. We know from Jim Rose&#146;s work that the consistent
application of synthetic phonics is the best way to teach young people
to
read.</div><a name="09031949000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000236"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Let us be clear about this. So the guidance will
deal with content, methodology, qualifications, and the generation and
transmission of information from one agency to another? Is the Minister
saying that those are the essential elements of the guidance, following
the history of inconsistency and incoherence in the training and
education of offenders? With an assurance on that, we would be happy to
move on.</div>
<a name="09031949000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000237"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> As I said, there is an interplay with guidance
relating to the youth offender clauses, but the whole spirit of the
changes in the legislation covering young offenders&#146; education
is to achieve coherence, consistency and access to the range of
qualifications to which the hon. Gentleman referred. That is what we
will seek to deliver, and the guidance will be an important part of
doing so.</div>
<a name="09031949000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031949000238"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): I have visited New Hall
women&#146;s prison and young offenders institution in my
constituency. The Minister&#146;s proposals are a massive step
forward compared with the days of, perhaps, only 10 or 15 years ago,
when there was a farm around the prison and prisoners were expected to
do farm labouring jobs, which are disappearing because farming is
becoming increasingly mechanised. Before we come to core curriculum
issues, we should consider basic life skills, such as getting up in the
morning, looking after oneself, communication skills and, particularly
for young women 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>in prison who may be mothers, a massive focus on how to care for their
children, not just while they are in prison, but when they
leave.</div><a name="09031949000043"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000239"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Lady can make a speech on this
group of amendments even when the Minister has sat
down.</div><a name="09031949000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000240"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> If my hon. Friend is going to make a speech, I
look forward to it, and perhaps it would be best to respond to it when
she has done so, rather than anticipating
it.</div><a name="09031949000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000241"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I did not intend to make a speech, but I know from
my visits to New Hall prison that it is unrealistic to expect young
women who, as hon. Members have said, come from disrupted and
disadvantaged backgrounds, and who may not have been at school for one
or two years, to go into a GCSE-level curriculum, whether they are 14,
16, 17 or 18, on day one in prison. Prison staff work incredibly hard
with local education authorities and agencies to provide high-quality
training.</div>
<a name="09031949000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been a
trustee of Rathbone for seven years. The life skills training that it
and other excellent training organisations do, in giving young people a
different way of thinking about themselves, is more important than
taking them from a learning institution and putting them in a massive,
frightening institution&#151;there is a very high suicide rate among
young women and other young offenders&#151;and saying, &#147;This
is just like being at school except prison bars surround
you.&#148;</div>
<a name="09031949000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
start working on the inside&#151;I may not be expressing this very
well&#151;and on how people feel about and value themselves. We are
talking about people who have been told throughout their lives that
they are failures, and being in a young offenders institution is a
further confirmation of that. Additionally, however, we then start them
on a GCSE curriculum that says, &#147;By the way, you&#146;re going
to fail again.&#148; I am very keen on the work that Rathbone has
done on entry to employment and life skills courses in prison. Will the
Minister and colleagues talk about
that?</div><a name="09031949000192"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09031949000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000242"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I reassure the hon. Lady that she is making her
case extremely well. Transparent passion is always better than
eloquence. I have also met and discussed those issues with officials of
Rathbone. She is right that many of the people we are talking about
need bite-sized, accessible education and training because they have
been failed by the system the first time around. It would be quite
wrong to shoe-horn them into a system that was inappropriate for
them.</div><a name="09031949000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my brief contribution, I was saying that there should be an opportunity
to provide the kind of training that is responsive to people&#146;s
needs and deals with them as people. Rather than take a rigid approach,
we need to take a lateral and creative approach to bring those people
back into
engagement.</div><a name="09031949000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000243"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I hope that I can be more eloquent as well as
passionate. Rathbone has been doing prison work only since about
2003-04, but it has developed that. Nacro has also been involved in
some excellent work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div><a name="09031949000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000244"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am reluctant to interrupt the hon.
Lady, but the amendment is quite narrow and talks about the guidance
that will be issued by the YPLA. This is not a Second Reading-style
debate on the whole subject matter. I would be grateful if she confined
her remarks to the amendment.</div>
<a name="09031949000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000245"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> The guidance could look at creating bespoke,
individual learning plans for learners as they come into prison. It
could set a reasonable set of objectives for the learner to achieve,
based on baseline measurements when they enter prison and the length of
their tariff. They could then be measured when they leave prison. That
is how to measure achievement and distance travelled, not by imposing a
national curriculum or core skills framework that treats everybody the
same and neglects the fact that young people may not be able to read,
write or speak properly, or dress or look after themselves, when they
arrive in
prison.</div><a name="09031949000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000246"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those points.

I said, the important thing that we are trying to achieve is a read
across between the education that is available to young people outside

the development of the foundation learning tier. One of the foundation

struggle in independent living to develop some of the life skills about

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000247"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Once again, there are important questions to ask.
The Young People&#146;s Learning Agency will be required to prepare
and consult on a policy statement which sets out the detail of its
policy on its powers of intervention&#151;the triggers for, and the
nature of, such interventions. Having considered representations made
during consultation, the YPLA must send a copy of the final policy
statement for approval by the Secretary of State and then publish the
approved statement. The YPLA must then have regard to the latest
published statement when exercising its powers to intervene. Subsection
(6) sets out the instances in which the YPLA has powers of
intervention, which are set out in clause 64.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div><a name="09031949000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">How long will
it take for intervention to move from triggers, through consultation,
to a final policy statement? If we are agreed on giving the YPLA powers
of intervention, surely there is a premium on time to ensure that
failing schools and educational institutions do not carry on failing
their students. How in depth is the consultation likely to be? Who will
be consulted and in what way? It is clear that the triggers for a
failing school or institution are likely to be exceedingly complex,
necessitating in-depth consultation.</div>
<a name="09031949000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">What methods
will the YPLA use to discern triggers? Does the Minister have specific
agencies in mind? If an LEA that commissions education is failing and
receives funding from the YPLA, there may be an incentive for it not to
alert the YPLA to problems. After all, what authority would want to
expose its own faults and weaknesses? I hope that the Minister will
make clearer the purpose and practice of the clause by answering those
few brief and, I hope, pertinent questions,</div>
<a name="09031949000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000248"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Naturally, I am grateful for the opportunity to
provide some of that clarity. The clause requires the YPLA to prepare
and consult on a policy statement that sets out the detail of its
policy on its powers of intervention. The YPLA has powers of
intervention under clause 64, which we discussed on Tuesday. It may
give directions to a local authority where it is satisfied that the
authority is failing or is likely to fail to perform its duty under
proposed new section 15ZA(1) of the Education Act 1996, as set out in
clause
56.</div><a name="09031949000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
proposed new section 56H of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992,
which is inserted by schedule 8, there is power for the YPLA to
intervene in a sixth-form college at which it is securing the provision
of education. The intervention policy, which is what will be consulted
on, will set out the triggers for, and the nature of, the intervention,
the nature of any directions the YPLA may issue to local authorities
under clause 64 and the circumstances when directions will be issued.
The duty to prepare an intervention policy will ensure that there is
clarity and transparency in advance on the circumstances under which
those powers will be used so that there is proper consultation with
stakeholders.</div>
<a name="09031949000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Relevant
stakeholders will include local authorities, education and training
providers, supporting structures, Government offices, regional planning
groups and sub-regional planning groups. The measure ensures that the
policy is drawn up in consultation with those in advance of it being
used so that everybody understands the circumstances anywhere in the
country when the YPLA might use the range of intervention powers that
we have agreed in the Bill. When there is a trigger point, it can then
be applied as quickly as possible. We bow to no one in our intolerance
of failure in the system and the desire to intervene. The consultation
will be guided by the Cabinet Office, and the normal guidelines for
that are a 12-week consultation. It will be with those partners that I
have set out.</div>
<a name="09031949000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000249"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Of particular concern is the timetable. It may
differ to some degree, but what typically would be the timetable for
that process? I mentioned the incentive for local authorities. Will
there be any independent means by which those things can be triggered?
A local authority that is failing in those terms may not be eager to
begin the process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div><a name="09031949000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000250"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> There are some questions about the timetable and
how the triggers will apply. We are still in consultation with people,
before the formal consultation, and some things will depend on the
circumstances in
play.</div><a name="09031949000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
expect the powers to be used as a last resort, following various levels
of support and challenge from the regional planning group, the
sub-regional group, other local authorities, perhaps, Government
offices and, certainly, the YPLA, with its regional level of activity,
when there is a risk that not enough suitable educational training
opportunities will be secured for young people in time. The YPLA will
look first to the local delivery system to resolve issues or
difficulties, and will be aware of any commissioning problems as they
emerge. Local authorities will be expected to resolve those issues, but
we need in our back pocket the intervention powers&#151;set out
clearly so that everyone understands the policy&#151;so that the YPLA
can be
effective.</div><a name="09031949000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000251"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am still not clear how the intervention will be
triggered. I am beginning to understand the process, and the Minister
said that he is still consulting on the timetable, but how will the
intervention be triggered in the first instance if the local authority
is unwilling or unable to initiate the
process?</div><a name="09031949000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000252"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We will use the relevant data sets and the
information that we are establishing from a range of agencies, and we
have the co-operation, which the hon. Gentleman has been scrutinising
carefully, between, for example, the Skills Funding Agency and local
authorities, and between local authorities and the YPLA in the
performance of its functions. That will give intelligence on how
effectively things are working. The triggers might be provided by some
of the data measured, which is often how triggers work, but such issues
are still being discussed with the partners who will be involved in the
delivery. I do not want to anticipate the outcome of those discussions
at this stage. However, I have assured him that there will be a full
and proper consultation on how the triggers will operate, which is when
they ought to be properly discussed and agreed by all parties. On that
basis, I hope that we can agree the
clause.</div><a name="09031949000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000256"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I want to raise a simple matter. The essence of the
amendments is to create greater clarity by the removal of &#147;from
time to time&#148; in respect of guidance issued by the Secretary of
State. I imagine that the original drafting was to create flexibility.
If we are to substitute that for clarity, it would be helpful for the
Minister to explain why. Is it that the guidance issued by the
Secretary of State will be so frequent that &#147;from time to
time&#148; is an inappropriate description? Or is it that the
Secretary of State will be issuing guidance so rarely that &#147;from
time to time&#148; is an
overestimate?</div><a name="09031949000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000257"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> This is about the consistency that we need to
create in references to continuing powers in the Bill. There is nothing
more to it than that. There is no change in thinking about how often
the Secretary of State will issue guidance. Yes, to some extent we want
to have consistency throughout the Bill in how we refer to the issuing

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000260"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Despite protestations to the contrary, it is clear
to most people in the academies movement and to most political
commentators that the current Secretary of State is not a proponent of
academies. He professes to support them because it is politically
expedient for him to do so. When he was an adviser he sought to
undermine reforms that promoted autonomy and choice in the public
services. Since he became Secretary of State we have seen a gradual
erosion of the elements of autonomy for academies that are the
essential ingredients of their success. For instance, he has required
more involvement by local authorities in their sponsorship,
establishment and operation and he has reduced freedoms over the
curriculum. The Bill reduces these freedoms further still.</div>
<a name="09031949000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a letter
to the Minister of 23 February, Mike Butler, chairman of the
Independent Academies Association, generally reflects the wider view
among other academy principals when he
says:</div><a name="09031949000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
appears that with every consultation, each missive and even new
legislation from the DCSF there comes further erosion of the
independent status of
academies.&#148;</div><a name="09031949000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Daniel
Moynihan of the Harris Federation made similar points in his evidence
session, when he
said:</div><a name="09031949000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
want to be fully accountable and fully in the daylight for our
performance, and for that we need to be responsible for decisions about
services and how they are used, and not have them forced on
us.&#148;</div><a name="09031949000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later,
in response to a question about the possibility  of moving
academies back to local authority control, Dr. Moynihan
said:</div><a name="09031949000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
answer would be that local authorities have called in academy sponsors
because the various mechanisms that they have deployed in the past to
improve the schools that they offer us as academies have not
worked.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

</i>3 March 2009; c.46-48, Q117 and
Q126.]</div><a name="09031949000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear from my discussions with academy sponsors that concerns over
autonomy reside at the top of their list of worries about current
Government policy. Amendment 26, therefore, seeks to embed in the
legislation a requirement that the body that oversees them should have
the key objective of protecting the autonomy of academies. If the
Minister genuinely believes in the academies programme, rather than
just paying lip service to it, he should have no problem supporting
this
amendment.</div><a name="09031949000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031949000261"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I share the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concern to ensure that academies keep a good degree
of autonomy. However, how much autonomy is he talking about? For
example, if an academy seeks to use powers to select a higher ability
intake than exists in the local catchment area, how would that be dealt
with under his model of autonomy? Or would he be quite relaxed about
that?</div><a name="09031949000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000262"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> No. Autonomy does not mean that academies should not
obey the law or nationally agreed codes of conduct, such as the
admissions code. I see that admissions code as being very important. It
should not perhaps be as proscriptive as it is, but the concept of an
admissions code is correct and should apply to all schools funded by
the Exchequer. How that code is enforced and who oversees the general
effectiveness of academies should be for a body. I do not agree that it
should be the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>YPLA, but obviously there should be some oversight body, whether it is
the Department or a newly established non-departmental public body.
Local authorities should not perform that function, given that it is
freedom from local authorities that the academies most seek. The letter
from the chairman of the Independent Academies Association goes on to
say:</div><a name="09031949000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Elements
of your Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill are deeply
disturbing in this regard. Of particular concern are the moves to
extend greater powers to local authorities, the role of the YPLA in
performance assessment (thus creating another regulatory
framework).&#148;</div><a name="09031949000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
Ofsted is the regulator charged with monitoring standards, the
academies feel that giving this same responsibility to the YPLA will
just create more administrative burdens. Amendment 25, therefore,
explicitly takes that out of the duties of the YPLA. As far as its
relation to academies is concerned, any role in assessing standards
should be left entirely to Ofsted. If Ofsted gives a judgment that a
school or academy is underperforming, then there is a role for a
national body to have discussions with the academy about how it is
going to deal with those criticisms.</div>
<a name="09031949000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 24 seeks to make
oversight by the YPLA voluntary for each academy. If an academy wishes
to remain under the direct aegis of the Department for Children,
Schools and Families it will, under this amendment, be free to do so.
Much of that echoes the debates that we had during the passage of the
Education and Skills Bill, about the proposal to move the monitoring
and regulation of independent schools from the DCSF to Ofsted, for much
the same reasons. In the end the measure was dropped by the Government
under heavy and effective lobbying by the Independent Schools
Council.</div>
<a name="09031949000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
general consensus that the administration and oversight of academies
should, because of the growing number of academies, be performed by
some form of agency acting for the Secretary of State, as we discussed
with the hon. Member for
Yeovil.</div><a name="09031949000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000263"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful, again, for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s patience. Did I hear him correctly when he said, in
relation to amendment 25, that he does not think that there should be
any body, between the school governing body and Ofsted, to monitor and
assess school performance? If that is his intention, is he not
concerned, given the lighter-touch Ofsted that we have today, that
problems in schools might go unnoticed, and without intervention, for a
longer period than is
satisfactory?</div><a name="09031949000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000264"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> That is a very interesting and important
intervention by the hon. Gentleman. The failings of Ofsted and the
approach that it takes to inspections should not be remedied by having
another body engaged in inspecting schools. If there are problems with
Ofsted&#146;s approach to inspecting schools&#151;and there are
issues to be addressed about the amount of time Ofsted inspectors
actually spend in lessons&#151;then they have to be addressed at the
Ofsted level. We should not have another body to repeat the inspection
of schools, simply because we are concerned about the light-touch, or
different approach that Ofsted
takes.</div><a name="09031949000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
view of Daniel Moynihan in the evidence session was
this:</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div><a name="09031949000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000266"></a>Mr.

said:</div><a name="09031949000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
makes absolute sense and, as the academies programme continues to grow,
it would be anomalous and unusual for a Department of State to take
direct responsibility for a very large number of
schools&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

</i>3 March 2009; c. 43-44, Q107 and
109.]</div><a name="09031949000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
from my own discussions with academy sponsors, and on a textual
analysis of their comments&#151;which the Minister for Schools and
Learners tempts me to engage in&#151;I believe that there is no
enthusiasm for the YPLA to be the body responsible for that work. The
YPLA was set up to secure funding to enable education or training to be
provided to young people over compulsory school age, but under-19. Its
principal role was to take over those particular responsibilities from
the Learning and Skills Council when funding for children&#146;s
education up to 19 was given back to local authorities. Academies, of
course, are schools. Most serve children aged 11 to 18 and some, such
as the King Solomon academy in north London, also include primary
schools. The impression given is that the academy arrangements in
clause 74, which give that oversight role to the YPLA, are a last
minute add-on to the functions of the YPLA, and that it was decided to
use that agency rather than establishing a specific agency to look
after
academies.</div><a name="09031949000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000267"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> For the sake of clarity, is it the policy of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s party to set up a separate quango to be able to
do that for
academies?</div><a name="09031949000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000268"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I think that that would be the approach to take.
There is a need for a specific quango, with specific responsibility, to
look after academies, rather than to lump it in with another agency
that has other responsibilities and a different skill
set.</div><a name="09031949000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000269"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify how that squares
with the criticism that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)
made of the Bill on Second Reading&#151;that it created more quangos?
How can the Opposition criticise us for creating more quangos on the
one hand, while supporting an additional quango on the
other?</div><a name="09031949000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000270"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Just because the Government have engaged in a
spending spree to establish a plethora of new quangos does not mean
that our policies, which might involve setting up one non-departmental
body, should be affected. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for
Surrey Heath that exchanging one quango for three or possibly four
quangos to do effectively the same role is a waste and a concern. That
does not mean to say that there is not a role for a specific
non-departmental body to oversee the increasing number of
academies.</div>
<a name="09031949000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000271"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Given the benefits of autonomy and the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s strong concern about local authority oversight,
would he be happy for existing maintained 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>schools, such as specialist schools, to opt out of local authority
control into the oversight of such a quango if it were to
exist?</div>
<a name="09031949000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000272"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath has
already spoken about the possibility of high-performing secondary
schools being able to opt for academy status, not necessarily with a
new building&#151;outside the Building Schools for the Future
programme&#151;and being able to obtain the freedoms that come with
being a high-performing school. There is a case for that, and in those
circumstances the schools that became academies would be overseen by
such a
body.</div><a name="09031949000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000273"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Given that the academies&#146; programme was
designed to challenge underperformance and that the hon. Gentleman sees
autonomy as a key way of challenging such underperformance, would it
not be more rational to allow some of the underperforming schools to
opt out of local authority control under his model and to come under
this new
quango?</div><a name="09031949000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000274"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> No, because there are two routes to becoming an
academy. One is that the school has already demonstrated effective
management and leadership, in which case a simple vote of the governing
body could transform that school into an academy with the same
leadership team in place. For underperforming schools, it is necessary
to bring in new leadership and a new sponsor to completely change the
whole approach, which is a route to becoming an academy, but it is a
slightly more lengthy
process.</div><a name="09031949000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000275"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Let me be clear about the alternative to the
policy that we are discussing here. In the various interviews that the
hon. Member for Surrey Heath has given, he raised the possibility of
establishing as many as 5,000 academies or free schools. Given what the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has just said about
setting up a new quango, is he not effectively talking about setting up
a new national funding agency for schools, and taking the funding of
school education away from local
authorities?</div><a name="09031949000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000276"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> No, I have not heard figures as high as that being
debated. The initial aim would be to have about 500 or even 1,000
schools becoming academies, out of a population of some 25,000 schools.
Therefore, we are talking about high-performing schools or those
schools that become academies with new leadership because they are
underperforming.</div><a name="09031949000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
339 reflects further concerns raised by Dr. Moynihan during the
evidence session. In that evidence, he cited his experience as a
principal of the Harris Federation of Academies of trying to establish
an academy sixth form. He
said:</div><a name="09031949000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
one local authority, we were told by a different body from the Learning
and Skills Council that we could not open sixth forms in two of our
academies. It was a particularly poor part of London in terms of the
staying-on rate, and the reason why we were told that was that it did
not fit with the plan. Four years later we have 400 sixth-formers and
an outstanding sixth form, but nothing else has changed in the area. As
in that case, we would want to be sure that we had a right of appeal to
the Secretary of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>State, and that it was clear that we could not necessarily be blocked by
whatever the local plan was if it was not an entirely sensible and
objective
one.</div><a name="09031949000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">We
have experienced difficulties on other occasions when local authorities
have not wanted an academy to open for political reasons and in order
to protect underperforming local provision. We would want a right of
appeal so that someone could look at that, and if we lost it, we lost
it. But it is important that it
exists.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

339 inserts into the clause just such a right of appeal to the

important part of the Bill. It may have special significance in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000279"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Thank you, Mr. Chope. I am happy to abide
by your guidance.</div>
<a name="09031949000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make it clear that we strongly support two critical elements of the
academies programme that has been developed by the Government over the
past decade or so. Those critical elements are, first, a greater
devolution of powers to individual schools than is currently the case
and, secondly, that other sponsors should be able to come into the
school system to run individual schools, subject to proper regulation
and oversight.</div>
<a name="09031949000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">A long period
of entrenched educational failure in large parts of the country and
particular communities, which existing schools, the Government and
local authorities could not challenge, formed the background to the
academies programme. That failure was often due to low aspirations and
extremely poor results. Although there is still an enormous gap between
the performance of children in rich and poor areas, it was even wider
prior to 1997. Levels of performance in some communities, particularly
in inner London, were disgraceful, with 90 per cent. of
pupils in some areas failing to get even a minimum set of
qualifications.</div>
<a name="09031949000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We understand
why the Government entered into what might seem to be a centralising
programme to force the establishment of academies in certain areas,
often with the opposition of local authorities. Many of the local
authorities with the largest number of failing schools were in
Labour-controlled areas, which in many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>cases&#151;in parts of the country such as Islington, Sheffield,
Liverpool and Newcastle&#151;are now controlled by the Liberal
Democrats. My discussions with local authority officers and members
have confirmed that there was a culture of low aspiration, and
sometimes, sadly, on behalf of the elected members. It came to be
expected that because children in certain areas came from low-income
backgrounds and households with low levels of educational performance
and qualifications, that would be perpetuated in the future.</div>
<a name="09031949000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The best
academies have helped to raise aspirations. In many cases, they have
been more innovative than some existing community
schools&#151;although not all, as many community schools are
extremely innovative. In most cases, we have seen an injection of good,
highly motivated sponsors who have helped to drive improvement in those
schools. Some of our criticism of the academies movement is based on
the Government failing to follow through the logic of their own policy
by believing in more devolution of powers and authority to individual
schools. We have an odd situation, where the Government must defend the
existing greater freedoms for academies while imposing new duties on
existing maintained schools from which academies are usually exempt.
Some of those new duties&#151;for example, the requirement to have a
certain amount of time for cooking and other parts of the
curriculum&#151;are perfect examples of the dottiness of Government
policy, which insists that most schools do the new things that they
believe are so valuable, while exempting those schools in the most
challenging circumstances from the same obligations.</div>
<a name="09031949000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay tribute
to the noble Lord Adonis, who has moved on to new duties in the
Department for Transport, which he is pursuing with the same energy he
applied in the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Now that
the academies programme has expanded so considerably, and perhaps also
now that the noble Lord who spent so much of his time on it has moved
on, the Government are understandably looking for a new structure in
which to embed it. Indeed, in his evidence to the Committee, that is
what the Minister said the Government were doing. Regarding academies,
he
said:</div><a name="09031949000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do not think it right that they should be run directly from my office.
It would make us by far the largest education authority in the country.
I already have to deal with a lot of issues in respect of open
academies, and I do not think that is the best strategic use of a
Minister&#146;s and senior officials&#146;
time.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>10 March 2009; c. 155,
Q348.]</div><a name="09031949000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree with that. It would be inappropriate for the programme to
continue to grow and to be run from a single Minister&#146;s office.
That would not provide the oversight necessary for such a large
programme. However, the real issue is whether the new structure is a
more sensible way of dealing with that oversight or whether an
alternative should be put in place, particularly as the powers that are
being transferred are so
significant.</div><a name="09031949000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
10 March, the Minister described the YPLA as &#147;principally a
funding agency&#148;, and in our discussion about academies he
described the transfer of powers in this area as relating principally
to funding. However, the explanatory notes indicate that the issue is
much wider than that. Paragraph 197 of the notes states
that</div><a name="09031949000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
YPLA may be required to carry out the following of the Secretary of
State&#146;s functions: calculating and paying grants; supervising
budgets; managing specific cases concerning admissions, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>exclusions and special educational needs; monitoring, enforcing and
terminating funding agreements; monitoring the standard of performance
of
pupils&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09031949000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton touched on;
and&#151;</div><a name="09031949000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;managing
school building work. The YPLA may be required to report to the
Secretary of State in accordance with the
arrangements.&#148;</div>
<a name="09031949000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is whether
all those functions should be exercised by the YPLA or whether some of
them could be exercised at a local level. The hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton feels that some of those powers do not need to
be exercised at all by any particular body. In amendment 25, he
suggests that the functions relating to the monitoring and assessment
of school performance should be taken out of the YPLA altogether, and I
understand why he has that view and why he is concerned that there
might be too much bureaucracy and intervention. However, my experience
of schools and school performance across the country suggests that it
would be dangerous to have no accountability mechanism between schools
and
Ofsted.</div><a name="09031949000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
Ofsted generally does a reasonably good job with schools, it is
becoming increasing light touch, and most of its school reviews are
short and focused on high-level data, which do not often go very deep.
The Liberal Democrats, along with the other major parties in the House,
probably feel that Ofsted should have a light-touch approach to most
schools and a more concentrated approach to those that appear to be
performing poorly. But when schools suddenly go from performing well to
performing badly or very badly, they can quickly fall off that cliff,
and governing bodies and school leaders are often not good at catching
them. They often want to make excuses for the declining performance
rather than being a reliable mechanism for catching the schools. Ofsted
is not a reliable mechanism either, because it always looks backwards
at data rather than at what is happening in a school. It is now trying
not only to assess and monitor 23,500 schools, but to undertake all the
difficult assessment of the wider children&#146;s services area. That
is because of the recent focus on the baby P case and the questions
that have been raised on whether Ofsted is looking at the substance of
what is happening, rather than ticking boxes. I do not share the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s confidence that academies do not need a more local
oversight of their performance.</div>
<a name="09031949000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
predictions that I make with great assurance and certainty is that as
the programme expands, under whatever Government, there will be
academies that fail and that perform badly. There is nothing magic
about granting additional powers to schools, or about every sponsor,
that will ensure that all schools in the academy class will always
succeed. If there is not a proper mechanism in place to catch schools
that are going downhill and to hold them to account, the academy
programme might be discredited in future by having a higher failure
rate than some parts of the maintained local authority system had in
the
past.</div><a name="09031949000128"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000280"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good case for the
problems of how Ofsted conducts its inspections. In fact, he was making
a good case against light-touch inspections, but the answer must surely
be to address our concerns about Ofsted, rather than effectively
creating a new inspection body within the YPLA to deal with those
problems, which is the thrust of his remarks. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>There is, of course, a role for the YPLA or any other non-departmental
body that is set up to monitor academies to ensure that the results
from Ofsted inspections are taken into account and result in action,
but given all the skills and procedures established by Ofsted over the
years, which are based on its experience, it would be a mistake to set
up another body to engage in inspections and to try to replicate that
body within what should be a monitoring oversight
organisation.</div><a name="09031949000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000281"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I agree completely with the hon. Gentleman, but as
he has anticipated, my view is that the oversight function for the
performance of schools should be carried out by local authorities and
that they ought to be the first tier of inspection and accountability.
I know that some people are concerned about whether local authorities
currently do that job effectively.</div>
<a name="09031949000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the evidence from Daniel Moynihan, the chief
executive of the Harris Federation, who largely supported the
Government&#146;s proposed YPLA model. He made some interesting
comments. Responding to my question on whether the oversight should be
carried out by the local authority or the YPLA, he
said:</div><a name="09031949000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
national body that is accountable to the DCSF&#151;a single unit such
as the YPLA&#151;will be a high-quality, high-profile body that
provides strong accountability, without variation. We are more likely
to get that strong accountability and rigour from an organisation such
as the YPLA than we are from myriad local authorities...What I am
saying is that academies are schools in extreme circumstances, which
are often subject to extreme socio-economic conditions and in real
conditions of failure. In those situations, you need a fresh
start&#151;you need something
different.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Apprenticeships,

on to say why academies are a good thing. I understand his views to
some extent, but if it is true that we cannot rely on local authorities
to discharge their oversight function in respect of 23,500 schools
across the country, that is a devastating indictment of the current
system by which we seek to hold schools to account.</div>
<a name="09031949000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
doubt that in the Government&#146;s current model, the local
authority is expected to be the first tier of accountability and to do
the job of holding schools to account. Measures in the Bill give local
authorities extra powers to intervene and the Secretary of State powers
to intervene over the heads of local authorities if local authorities
are not doing so. In my view, we will never get the oversight needed
for 23,500 schools from one single national body, such as Ofsted, and
we are unlikely to get that from the YPLA, particularly if the number
of schools that are covered by the YPLA expands rapidly in the
future.</div><a name="09031949000195"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

Knight:</b> It might be helpful to inform the Committee about
the alternative proposals that other parties in the House are putting
forward. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify that he would like all
secondary schools to become quasi-academies under the performance
management control and accountability of local authorities? If so, has
he consulted academy sponsors on the issue and found support for
it?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div><a name="09031949000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000283"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Academy sponsors are very supportive of the idea
that all schools should be allowed to enjoy the freedoms that academies
have. They cannot understand why it is sensible for 100, 200 or 300
schools to have a series of freedoms to innovate that are denied to the
majority of schools. Our model is not that every school has to become
an academy; many schools will continue to be sponsored by their local
communities, so they will be local community schools, particularly if
they perform effectively, as many such schools do. Under our model,
there would be no need for the YPLA, because the oversight that the
Minister seeks through it would be exercised at a local level. There
would, however, be a devolution of freedoms to innovate to all schools,
not simply the ones that the Government have currently
selected.</div><a name="09031949000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remember debating the future of the academies programme with Lord
Adonis when he envisaged&#151;I touched on this in the evidence
sessions&#151;that, at some stage, the programme could be embedded
under local authority oversight. The programme would not be controlled
by local authorities, because we want to embed academies&#146;
freedoms rather than see local authorities take back control of them.
There is absolutely no reason why we cannot legislate for the embedding
of a whole series of academy freedoms that are granted to protect them
from local authorities under circumstances such as those that the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is worried about, where local
authorities would not only exercise a strategic oversight, but attempt
to meddle in the academies, take away their powers and freedoms, and
suck them back into the local authorities. We do not want that, because
we want schools to have greater freedoms and for those that are doing a
good job to have sponsorship. However, it is not necessarily the case
that the only way of guarding such freedoms is through a body such as
the
YPLA.</div><a name="09031949000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we legislate to embed some of the academies&#146; freedoms and give
powers of independent appeal to the schools commissioner&#151;such
powers would be similar to the commissioner&#146;s current rights in
relation to, for example, a perceived tension between the interests of
a local authority and those of schools and colleges in
expanding&#151;there is no reason why those important freedoms could
not be guarded by legislation and the schools
commissioner.</div><a name="09031949000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000284"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The hon. Gentleman paints a bleak picture of
schools in the past when he speaks of widespread failure. That failure
occurred when local authorities had a key role in inspecting and
advising schools. The genesis of academies was the city technology
colleges and grant-maintained schools that found form in the Education
Reform Act 1988. One of the reasons for that was that the previous
regime, which prevailed under local authority control, was thought to
be lacking. I do not want to damage the elegant veneer of his argument,
but it does seem to be
inconsistent.</div><a name="09031949000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000285"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely important
point, but just this week I visited a grant-maintained school that
opted out in the early 1990s under a Conservative Government. The
school has only recently come out of special measures, having gone
downhill rather rapidly after becoming a grant-maintained school, and
it has now become an academy. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>demonstrated that any changes to the classification of a school or to
the group that sponsors a school do not inevitably mean that that
school will for ever perform
brilliantly.</div><a name="09031949000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the hon. Gentleman that we cannot afford to return to the
situation in, and prior to, the 1990s, when many schools were
performing very badly and many local authorities were not doing their
job properly. Our view of the future structure of the school system is
one in which Ofsted and, indeed, the educational standards authority,
which has not yet been established, should do a much firmer job than
the current body in terms of holding local authorities to account. As
the Minister will be aware, there is still a large number of local
authorities in the country where school performance is extremely poor.
The Government have focused a lot of attention, money and pressure on
inner London, but there are many cities throughout the country where
the level of performance is far too low. The existing mechanisms are
not good at holding some of those local authorities to account. There
needs to be much greater transparency about schools that are failing,
and local authorities that are failing to support and drive school
improvement in those parts of the country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000286"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman.
However, I think that his model would prevent federations of academies
from being established. He envisages an oversight role, ensuring that
management is effective and that there are not endemic or incipient
problems that will lead to poor results, which would then be picked up
by Ofsted. That role should be conducted by federations, such as the
Harris Federation, ARK, the ULT, the Woodard trust or the
Mercers&#146; Company. We envisage that role being undertaken by
those sorts of bodies, not necessarily even the national body
that  will fund these academies, but by the federations that
will evolve if we allow academies to have
freedom.</div>
<a name="09031949000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000287"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that
point, and to you, Mr. Chope, for allowing us, rightly, to
range quite widely on the clause. I understand that the hon. Gentleman
might want these federations to hold their academies to account. Some
of them might do so quite brilliantly, but I can easily imagine that we
might have federations for academies&#151;there might only be two,
three or four of them&#151;run by a sponsor under whom those
federations and academies start not to do well at all. I would be more
than happy if the Minister wanted to park a new academy in my
constituency. In fact, I have one school in mind that I shall talk to
him about later, if he has some spare
money.</div><a name="09031949000142"></a>

name to the backing of such a new academy, I would want to be sure that
there was a level of oversight for the school that I have in
mind&#151;it serves quite a deprived catchment area and most of the
parents in that area send their children to it. I would want to make
sure that if that wonderful new sponsor and its federation of two,
three, four or 10 other schools started to do badly, there was some
other mechanism of local accountability to do something about that. For
example, the periods of sponsorship might be time limited,
or  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>they might be open to new, competitive tender, so that if the sponsor
was doing a bad job there could be a re-tendering for that
school.</div>
<a name="09031949000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As time moves
on and the academy programme continues to expand, there is a real
danger that we will find that some academies are not doing very well,
just as is the case with many community schools. We have got to make
sure that there are mechanisms in place to do something about that
because if we do not, then the whole academy model will end up being
discredited and replaced by something
else.</div>
<a name="09031949000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
challenge the Minister and the Conservative party to think about
whether we really need to be establishing a new quango to oversee these
schools. Further, is there not some better way to embed the freedoms
that we all want academies to have, but in a way that uses the existing
local authority structures to hold those schools to account without
interfering in their freedoms? If we have concerns about the existing
local authority structures and their ability to do that, we should be
worried, because for the vast majority of schools we are still relying
on local authorities to do that job. We need to make sure that if we
are to improve the vast majority of schools, that local authorities can
hold those schools to account and that they have mechanisms for
identifying and commissioning&#151;or brokering&#151;other groups
who can come in and deliver school improvement. It may well be the
case, as John Dunford of the Association of School and College Leaders
often says, that local authorities do not always have the necessary
skills to deliver those improvements in their schools. However, they
should at the very least be able to identify where schools need to
improve, and they should be able to broker in additional
support.</div>
<a name="09031949000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a bit
uncertain about why the Government are so reticent about using the
existing local structures to embed the academy programme. I am unsure
why the Minister is not pursing the same sort of long-term vision as
Lord Adonis. During the evidence session on March 10, the Minister gave
us a clue when he answered the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and
Mexborough, who asked why the YPLA was being created to oversee
academies. The Minister replied:</div>
<a name="09031949000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would have given in to the charge of watering down the independence of
academies if we had handed over their performance management and
funding to local authorities. We did not want to do
that.&#148;&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Apprenticeships, Skills,
Children and Learning Public Bill Committee, 10 March 2009; c. 173,
Q411.]</div><a name="09031949000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether he
said</div><a name="09031949000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
did not want to do
that&#148;</div><a name="09031949000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">because
he genuinely meant that the Government did not want to hand over those
elements to local authorities or whether he did not want to be open to
the charge of watering down the independence of
academies.</div>
<a name="09031949000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000290"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Let me deal directly with that. It is because we
do not think that it is right to give those responsibilities back to
local authorities. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the response that
Daniel Moynihan gave to him in the evidence session:</div>
<a name="09031949000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
answer would be that local authorities have called in academy sponsors
because the various mechanisms that they have deployed in the past to
improve the schools that they offer us as academies have not worked.
The key mechanism that they have deployed is their own management of
those schools. It does not make sense to return those schools to local
authorities.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 48, Q126.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div><a name="09031949000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is at the
root of why we should have this arrangement, rather than the option
that the hon. Gentleman is putting forward.</div>
<a name="09031949000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000291"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Yes, but I am not suggesting that academies should
be returned to local authority control; we are talking about who
exercises the strategic oversight. I am suggesting that the Minister
could embed protections for academies in legislation covering the
intervention that local authorities might otherwise engage in, rather
than creating a new
quango.</div><a name="09031949000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that Ministers would be very concerned if they were supporting and
signing up to the comments of somebody who said, at column 49 of the
evidence session, in the answer to my question, that a body such as the
YPLA was needed because it would be &#147;high-quality,
high-profile&#148; providing &#147;strong accountability, without
variation.&#148; That says that Mr. Moynihan thinks that
local authorities are useless in many cases at doing the basic job of
overseeing the performance of schools in their area and that he does
not have confidence in their ability to do it. If the Minister shares
that view, it is a terrible indictment of the oversight of 23,000
English schools.</div>
<a name="09031949000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000292"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> To help the hon. Gentleman, I am saying that they
are a mixed ability class. Where local authorities have consistently
failed in their oversight and performance management of schools and
failed generations of children, it is right that there should be a
high-level intervention, such as the formation of an academy, so that
the local authority can be relieved of those responsibilities to focus
on the other schools in its area and let sponsors who want to do a good
job take over.</div>
<a name="09031949000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000293"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It is interesting that the Minister thinks that
where local authorities are doing such a dreadful job that one or,
perhaps, two of the schools in their areas are taken out of their
oversight, the rest of the schools should still be overseen by that
grossly incompetent body. That is a very strange view of how we are
going to rely on local authorities, or anybody else for that matter, to
drive school improvement in the future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000294"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> By way of clarification, just because a local
authority has failed that particular school community, it does not mean
that it is incapable of looking after other schools in its area. It
might have had particular problems with aspiration for that community
and believe that it is not capable of achieving in the way that it
should. There might be issues attached to the governance of the school
that the local authority has singularly failed to address. We are
taking other powers in the Bill to be able to address that through
intervention in underperforming schools, but I remain wedded to the
belief that there are circumstances in which academies are entirely
appropriate to move a community on quickly.</div>
<a name="09031949000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000295"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> It is highly unlikely that a local authority so
incompetent that it cannot do anything about a failing school in its
area is properly overseeing the other schools. Maybe the only reason
the academy was established is that one of those schools had
particularly awful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>results. But maybe if the local authority was doing a bad job on that
school, it might also be similarly complacent on other schools, which,
because they have a more affluent catchment area, have results that are
above the national challenge level. There is an inconsistency in the
Government&#146;s belief that local authorities are competent enough
to have oversight of the vast majority of schools, but not of an
academy.</div><a name="09031949000196"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000296"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for being so
patient with me. I recently expressed an interest to start an academy
in Taunton, in his area of Somerset. That is not an expression of a
lack of confidence in the authority&#146;s ability to manage school
improvement as a whole. However, I believe that the authority has not
managed to secure the improvement that is necessary for that particular
school community. That school, therefore, has a much better chance of
success under a different sponsorship
arrangement.</div>
<a name="09031949000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000297"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Yes, but the point is that the local authority wants
that particular academy. It is not, as the Minister indicated, a
failing local authority; indeed, it is one of the most highly rated in
the country, and an improving one. What is it, therefore, that the
Minister fears the local authority would do to that new academy if
strategic oversight was returned to the authority&#151;with, of
course, the proper protection of the independence and freedoms of the
academy?</div><a name="09031949000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000298"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman invites me to intervene again.
It is more about what the local authority has not done in the past than
what it will do in the future. It has not been able to ensure that the
governance of the school is strong enough to support and challenge head
teachers, appoint a leadership team to raise aspirations and
performance, and create the ethos of achievement that is necessary to
do better for that community. That school, over time, has not been
doing sufficiently well to provide the sort of education service that
we all want to see for all our
children.</div><a name="09031949000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000299"></a>Mr.

<a name="09031949000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000300"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are having a good debate, and I have
given a lot of latitude to right hon. and hon. Members. However, we are
going further away from the principle of the YPLA&#146;s role in the
academies; we are going into details of local authority involvement. We
have had some discussion about that, and I hope that we can return to
the core essence of the clause.</div>
<a name="09031949000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000301"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I will of course do that, Mr. Chope, but
you will understand why I am particularly raising those issues, because
it seems that the YPLA, in respect of academies, is completely
unnecessary. I thought that the Minister&#146;s answer to the last
question that I put to him was particularly unconvincing. He is saying
that the reason he wants the YPLA to have oversight of an academy in
Somerset in the future is due to some problem in the past with one
school. He has no concerns about the ability to have oversight of that
school in the future. If that is the case, why on earth introduce
a  new tier of bureaucracy, rather than allowing existing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>mechanisms to work by having a proper inspection of the job that local
authorities do, so that where they are failing to deliver improvement
in local schools, they begin to do it, rather than the
YPLA?</div><a name="09031949000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000302"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The clause transfers extensive powers to the YPLA,
which
include</div><a name="09031949000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;calculating
and paying grants; supervising budgets; managing specific cases
concerning admissions, exclusions and special educational needs;
monitoring, enforcing and terminating funding agreements; monitoring
the standard of performance of pupils; managing school building
work.&#148;</div><a name="09031949000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman seems to suggest that many of those functions should be
handled by local authorities. But when the Minister talked about a
mixed ability class, his metaphor was more apposite than he imagined.
The truth is that we know from history that some local authorities are
good at it, but some are not. Yet the local authority regime that the
hon. Gentleman advocates suggests that they are all of a class of their
own&#151;they are top
class.</div><a name="09031949000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000303"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is surely a shocking view of the oversight of
our schools. The view that has been proposed by both Conservative and
the Labour Front Benchers is that there is no confidence in the ability
of a large number of local authorities to manage and properly oversee
schools. Therefore, 100 or 200 of those schools will be allowed to opt
out and be run by the YPLA, while a large number of existing local
authorities continue to do an incompetent job of managing schools in
their areas&#151;including a large number of schools that have
characteristics of deprivation similar to those of academies and
including many other schools that the Government consider to be
coasting. When I asked the Minister and the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton whether other schools would be able to opt out
of  the existing local authority oversight and into
the  YPLA, the answer, on the whole&#151;certainly from the
Government&#151;was no.</div>
<a name="09031949000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words, the vision of both parties seems to be that the YPLA will be
allowed to do a good job only for those schools that happen to be
classified as academies. Everybody else will be trapped in poor local
authority control. I am suggesting that an alternative to the YPLA is
to ensure that existing oversight through local authorities works and
that the legislation protects academies&#146; independence, so that
local authorities cannot simply suck them back into the maintained
family and compromise their independence. That, I suggest, is a better
way than accepting that a whole load of local authorities will run the
vast majority of schools incompetently and that we will let a small
number of schools, selected fairly randomly from among the
low-performing schools, to escape from that incompetent
management.</div>
<a name="09031949000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">You have been
patient, Mr. Chope, so I will move on to speak to the actual
amendments before you lose patience. Amendments 391 and 392 relate to
our concerns about the YPLA&#146;s role. The briefing notes on the
Bill seem to make it clear that it is not the Government&#146;s
intention to confer on the YPLA the power to enter 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>into an academy funding agreement. That was also made clear in the
discussions that the Bill team kindly held with the National Union of
Teachers and others, but subsection (4) seems to contradict that by
implying that the YPLA might have direct powers to enter into an
agreement. I do not know whether that is deliberate, a mistake or our
misreading, but I would be grateful for clarification from the
Minister.</div>
<a name="09031949000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
amendments to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
spoke, we share his concerns to ensure academies&#146; autonomy
through his amendment 26, although we want to ensure that that autonomy
applies to things that are important in terms of innovation in schools
rather than being the autonomy to select pupils from more affluent
backgrounds in order to make the academy&#146;s job easier, when it
should be serving its local catchment and ratcheting up performance
among youngsters who have been failed. We have some sympathy with the
amendment, provided that it applies in those more defined and limited
terms.</div>
<a name="09031949000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
are not very sympathetic to amendment 25, which would remove
any performance monitoring between the academy governing body and
Ofsted. We think that that could lead schools to go downhill quickly if
their performance is not improved for a period of years because nobody
is exercising oversight. I hope that the Minister will be able to
reassure us on at least some of those
points.</div><a name="09031949000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031949000304"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We have had an interesting, wide-ranging debate in
which we have heard alternative visions for the performance management
and oversight of academies. It began with some assertions, which were
not really based in fact, from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton about the Secretary of State and his view on academies. I
did not see any evidence to support those assertions.</div>
<a name="09031949000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also heard
about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s vision of 500 to 1,000 academies.
That contrasts with the interview given by the hon. Member for Surrey
Heath and the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) to
<i class="I">Th</i><i class="I">e Sunday Telegraph </i>a couple of months ago, in which
they spoke about having one in every community. Given where we are with
children&#146;s centres&#151;we said one in every
community&#151;the Government interpret that as about 3,500. There is
a little confusion about exactly what his level of aspiration and
ambition is for the free academy schools.</div>
<a name="09031949000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">By contrast,
the hon. Member for Yeovil had a slightly confusing&#151;it is
tempting to say a slightly Liberal Democrat&#151;view. He wanted them
all to be academies but at the same time under local authority
oversight. It appears to be an attempt to back both horses at once,
which I am not sure would please anybody. However, I do understand the
constraints that he is
under&#151;</div><a name="09031949000197"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
