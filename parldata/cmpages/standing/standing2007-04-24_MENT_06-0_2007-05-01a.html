							<b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): Welcome, Lady
Winterton&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.].</i> I am not sure where I was
interrupted, so I thought that I might go back to the beginning and
start again. I think that I was just about to explain the case of
Winterwerp <i class="I">v. </i>The Netherlands 1979, which is the basis of the
two amendments to which I spoke for most of the morning. They would
amend clauses that we are not debating at the moment, but that is the
way in which things work.</div>
					<a name="07050167000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Winterwerp <i class="I">v.</i> The
Netherlands 1979 produced an important European judgment on mental
health law. The ruling was that, except in an emergency, the detention
of a person of unsound mind will be lawful only if, first, the person
detained is reliably shown tobe of unsound mind&#151;that
is, by objective medical experts&#151;secondly, the relevant mental
disorder is of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement, and
thirdly, there is a persistence of such a disorder to justify
continuing detention.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>
					<a name="07050167000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I was talking
about the position of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. It asked the
Government to explain further their view that medical expertise need
not necessarily involve a doctor. I am aware that the Department of
Health takes the view that the phrase &#147;medical
expertise&#148;, as referred to by Winterwerp, was used in the wider
sense and the Court was not seeking to lay down which sort of
qualifications available in a national system would be acceptable.
However, the JCHR and a number of professionals do not agree with that.
The JCHR disagrees particularly with the Government&#146;s definition
of objective medical expertise. It says:</div>
					<a name="07050167000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In Varbanov<i class="I"> v</i>
Bulgaria the Strasbourg Court gave every indication...that
objective medical expertise involved reports from psychiatrists who are
doctors. The Court made it clear that the opinion of a medical expert
who is a psychiatrist is necessary for a lawful detention on grounds of
unsoundness of mind. This requirement would have been met had the
doctors present at the admission furnished an opinion that the
applicant needed to be detained for psychiatric examination. This
indicates that the opinion justifying detention should come from a
medically qualified expert...who has recognised skills in
psychiatric diagnosis and
treatment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050167000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
point is that, if the Government get their way, there is every chance
that there will be serious legal challenge of the basis of the
legislation. The Minister has warned on a number of occasions against
having a field day for lawyers. This is a field day for international
lawyers. I would like to know on what evidence the Government have
based their opinion that their proposed change to the legislation is
sound and that it will not be subject to legal challenge. It would be
useful if the Minister would give us details as to which legal opinion
the Government have taken. The Law Society, the JCHR and a number of
others have severe reservations, based on case law, about whether the
changes will be workable.</div>
					<a name="07050167000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There is
another angle to the issue, which is the interaction between the Mental
Health Bill and the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which treats these
matters differently. The mental health assessment, one of the six
assessments required in the 2005 Act for a Bournewood deprivation, must
be carried out by either a registered medical practitioner approved
under section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2005 or a registered medical
practitioner who has special experience in the diagnosis and treatment
of mental disorder. So, in those circumstances, only a doctor has
responsibility. There is clearly an inconsistency between this Bill and
the Act that is already law. Again, it would be useful if the Minister
would tell us how she intends to square the circle on those two
incongruities.</div>
					<a name="07050167000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
BMA does not know of any international precedent for such an
arrangement whereby detained patients do not come under the direct
responsibility of a consultant psychiatrist. It cites Canada,
Australia, the United States and other countries where that formulation
just does not exist. We need to know why things would be different in
this country, and how, if the Government get their way and overturn the
Lords amendments, they expect the new arrangements to pertain without
serious legal challenge.</div>
					<a name="07050167000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is worth
reiterating the training that psychiatrists must undergo. Two years
after leaving medical school, trainees enter a rotational psychiatry
programme, an elaborate passage that equips the would-be psychiatrist
with knowledge of anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology,
medicine, surgery and psychological therapies. During the senior years
of training, most 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>junior doctors will acquire detailed knowledge of mental health law,
teaching, audit, research and management skills. In contrast, mental
health nurse training has moved away from a medical model in the past
decade, so trainee nurses are no longer required to undergo training in
medicine. Different disciplines are brought to bear through the
experience and expertise of the different professionals under
discussion.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07050167000363"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman
saying that in terms of medicine the training takes eight years? Will
he confirm that there are six years of training as a medical student
and two further years of specialty training? Is that what he is saying
about training doctors?</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000364"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I believe that those figures are right on the
training of doctors. For a full-blown consultant psychiatrist, however,
we are talking about 13 years, which means that considerable training,
expertise and experience go into the specific job that psychiatrists
are put in place to do. It is different from what a psychologist and
consultant nurse will do.</div>
					<a name="07050167000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to the premise of the
Lords amendments, it must be in the best interests of a potential
patient if a professional with the most extensive experience possible
is available before the most momentous decisions in a patient&#146;s
life are made: first, the decision to section, with which the
Government take no issue; and, secondly, the decision to renew
sectioning. Some of us contend that the latter is a more serious and
less obvious consideration, which is why the fullest expertise must be
brought to bear.</div>
					<a name="07050167000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Lords
amendments would ensure that, before a detention was renewed, patients
would receive similar consideration to that which they received during
the original sectioning order. Surely, we just need to replicate the
rigour of the original process. The amendments were changed in the
Lords after the Government gave assurances in Committee about the
skills and competences that would be required of a responsible
clinician, which would be included in the code of practice. Again, it
would be useful if the Minister would provide some details on what has
happened since then.</div>
					<a name="07050167000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendments
is to find some accommodation with the Government based on a clear
reference to a legal case&#151;a precedent in medical
law&#151;about what would be acceptable in the courts. We framed the
amendments to refer to the case of Winterwerp <i class="I">v. </i>The
Netherlands, so that the objective medical expertise of mental disorder
would have the same meaning as it has in that case. The amendments are
a belt and braces exercise.</div>
					<a name="07050167000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, I repeat that
the amendments would not debase the role of all other professionals
involved in patient care; they would ensure that at a difficult time
the very best professional expertise was brought to bear on the
patient. When discussing the amendments that gave rise to the clause,
Lord Carlile
said:</div>
					<a name="07050167000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Each
renewal of detention is a fresh deprivation of
liberty.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 19
February 2007; Vol. 689, c.
940.]</div>
					<a name="07050167000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wholeheartedly concur
with that.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>
					<a name="07050167000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There are
glaring inconsistencies in the Government&#146;s case, in having
moved from their original position and now in keeping the medical
conditions pertinent to the original section, and the potential
inconsistency with the 2005 Act. I fear that if the Government get
their way and overturn the amendments, it will be a recipe for
confusion, particularly as to where the buck actually stops on
decisions being made for patients&#146; renewed detention. Surely,
that cannot be in the best interests of patients. Our amendments, which
I propose formally, are a sensible way of accommodating the
Government&#146;s position and achieving a practical and workable
solution in this important part of the
Bill.</div>

						Liberal

have not canvassed opinions individually, so I do not feel qualified to

					<a name="07050167000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise the benefits of multidisciplinary working almost more than
anyone, because I am a pharmacist by profession. Pharmacists and other
primary health care professionals could learn a lot from what has
happened in the mental health sector when developing joined-up services
for patients. The word &#147;patient&#148; is key, because we must
always have the best interests of the patient at heart.</div>
					<a name="07050167000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Minister
rightly highlighted the extent of training that other professionals
must undergo to become responsible clinicians. Unfortunately, the
document to which she referred this morning did not arrive in my office
until after the start of the Committee, but I appreciate her intention
to share the
information.</div>
					<a name="07050167000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said this morning that she did not think that consultant
nurses, for example, had broad enough experience to allow them to start
a section or, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>in other words, to be responsible for the initial deprivation of
liberty. That is fundamental, because it acknowledges
psychiatrists&#146; broader expertise and, to some extent, the 13
years&#146; training that has been mentioned.</div>
					<a name="07050167000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There is an
inconsistency in the Government&#146;s approach to mental health
legislation. They have decided that two doctors are needed to start a
section, and that two professionals are needed to put a person on to a
compulsory treatment order, but that two people, one of whom is a
doctor, are necessary to deprive a person of liberty under the 2005
Act. If the Government had their way, renewing a section could be done
on the basis of only one opinion, which is not necessarily that of a
doctor. There does not seem to be a consistent view throughout the
mental health legislation.</div>
					<a name="07050167000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, this
is not about whether we hurt the feelings of any particular profession,
and I find it hard to believe that the ultimate and professional
recognition seems to hinge on whether that professional is deemed
capable of depriving a person of their liberty for six months.
Psychologists, nurses, occupational therapists are actually bigger than
that. There is more to what they do, and I cannot believe that this is
such a fundamental issue for them, or that they will leave the
professions in droves if they are deprived of the right to do this. It
has been largely overlooked in this discussion that, according to the
House of Lords amendments, those people still have a key role to
play.</div>

brings me on to the shared decision making that the hon. Member for
Bolton, South-East mentioned. Clause 6(3) clearly states that the
responsible clinician and the medical practitioner need to agree. The
legislation does not say anywhere that the medical opinion has greater
weight, and it does not say that the responsible clinician has less
weight either. In other words, there has to be an agreement between the
two. If somebody is to be deprived of their liberty for a further
period, that is a perfectly reasonable thing to
expect.</div>
					<a name="07050167000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause, as
it stands, does two things. It provides reassurance both for those
patients who would want to feel that they had received the greatest
clinical input, but it also reassures those patients who, for whatever
reason, mistrust psychiatrists. We must acknowledge, as was
acknowledged earlier in the debate, that a number of mental health
users mistrust the system. In other words, with the Lords amendment, we
have the best of both worlds. The opinion of somebody whohas
been responsible for looking after the patient for six months is going
to be of equal weight to that of a medical practitioner who, in ideal
circumstances, has some knowledge of the
patient.</div>
					<a name="07050167000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, having the two people decide provides a safety net. I was
reminded of a constituent who came to see me. I know that is sometimes
easy to be taken in, but this woman seemed incredibly rational, and she
made a very good case, pointing out that her husband had put together
evidence that, in effect, had her sectioned. I shall not bore the
Committee with the details, but in such cases someone would have more
protection if two independent-minded professional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>people were involved in further decision making than if the matter were
left to just one person, whom the individual might not
trust.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I want to make a short
contribution to the debate on this clause. I do not profess to be an
expert in this field at all, but if I were a mental health patient,
being detained against my will, receiving treatment against my will, I
would want the person with the most to lose to have the final say on my
future&#151;at least on my immediate future, and whether I would be
detained. We talk about teams working together, so in essence, I would
want the team captain&#151;be it a substantive captain, or a
temporary captain because the substantive captain is away&#151;to
have that final say against my
will.</div>
					<a name="07050167000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
do not think that it is unreasonable for a consultant
psychiatrist&#151;a doctor&#151;to have the final say. After all,
the Bill is not about rewarding people but about safeguarding the
rights of patients. The Minister mentioned earlier that she wanted to
reward professional groups, and that is a noble thing to want to do.
However, ultimately, she should not bow to pressure from professional
bodies, such as the Royal College of Nursing, and unions. Of course, it
is the role of unions and representative bodies to argue in the
interests of their members&#151;we would not expect any less of them.
I am a member of Amicus, and I expect Amicus to argue my corner
vociferously, but that does not necessarily make it right.</div>

							<b class="B">Angela
Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): I have intervened
on others during the discussion on the clause, and I do not want to
repeat too much of what has already been said. The clause gives me
great cause for concern. I sat on the scrutiny Committee on the
previous proposals for a mental health Bill and a lot of the discussion
was about the underlying intention in the Government&#146;s proposal
to reform the Mental Health Act 1983.</div>
					<a name="07050167000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In speaking
on this Bill, both on Second Reading and in Committee, the Minister has
sought to play down what was evident to everybody who took an interest
in the subject a year or two back. At the heart of the legislation is
the right to detain indefinitely. If anything triggers my concern, it
is the renewal of a person&#146;s detention under a different set of
rules and qualifications to the initial detention. Why should the very
careful and historical need for a senior medical input&#151;indeed,
more than one medical input&#151;be changed for renewals? Several
hon. Members have made the case that when someone has been receiving
in-patient treatment for six months, they may present differently from
the way they presented when they were originally detained, perhaps at a
time of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>crisis. Why should the Government wish to water down the qualifications
for renewal compared with those for initial detention?</div>
					<a name="07050167000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am reminded
of our discussions in the scrutiny Committee. As I have told the
Minister more than once, the change in the definition of a mental
disorder at the heart of the legislation concerns something that is
more behavioural than something that has a diagnosis, and it is a cause
for concern that that definition is combined with the right to detain
indefinitely someone who has not committed a crime and who certainly
does not have the due process of the criminal justice system in their
favour.</div>
					<a name="07050167000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Minister that around the time of the Michael Stone case, when there was
great public discussion on how we should deal with people like him,
there was an exchange of letters in the national press between the then
president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the then Home
Secretary, who is now the Leader of the House of Commons. I am
sorrythat I do not have the exact quotations, but I recall
that those three letters went along these lines: the psychiatrists
expressed their reservations about what an Act such as this would
require them to do, in terms of detention, and the then Home Secretary
put it into the public domain that if psychiatrists did not want to
deal with detentions, the Government would seek other ways of dealing
with them and would find others who would. And here we have the
solution in clause 6.</div>
					<a name="07050167000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The clause is
not about creating equal opportunities for nurses, occupational
therapists and psychologists: it is about finding a way around the
difficulty that the Labour Government met when they bravely told the
world out there that they were going to find a solution to the problem
of locking up people like Michael Stone. Of course, that attracted a
lot of tabloid headlines and the tabloids rode in behind that proposal.
It was only when the Government got down to considering what happens in
practice in psychiatry and how difficult these cases are that they
realised that it would be difficult to draft legislation to provide
that solution.</div>

these additional roles are going to turn into people who would lock
others up wrongly, unlike the psychiatrists? Is she saying that if we

be okay, but that the Government will use those health care
professionals to lock people up? It is grossly insulting to them even

							<a name="07050167000395"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> I shall do so in just a moment. I want to make a
point to the Minister, who has just intervened on me. I wish to know
who can provide objective medical expertise, or are we to take it from
the anomalies in the Bill, under which one level is needed at one stage
in the process and a different level is needed at another, that
objective medical expertise is no longer required in the detention of
patients? That is how it reads. It is incompatible to say that one set
of people can provide medical expertise in one set of circumstances,
but that for the same patient with the same period of treatment, it
does not matter at the other
end.</div>
					<a name="07050167000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">My colleagues
have advanced views about why the renewal is perhaps more critical even
than the initial detention. I agree. We also know that there are people
in the health service who sometimes deal with potentially dangerous
mental patients who would worry about their own safety when managing
such people. I can think of situations involving dealing with
constituents in high-security units in the Devon area in which the
police have had to be called. It is not a matter of casting an
aspersion on one set of people, but some cases are complex and a few of
them are extremely dangerous even when the people are in-patients. It
is at the patient&#146;s end that we should be asking questions,
about what is in their best interests. I cannot see that what the
Minister is proposing as her objection to the clause is in the
interests of the
patient.</div>

Naysmith:
						</b> The hon. Lady mentioned the Michael Stone case.
I agree with you, Lady Winterton, that these are serious and important
matters, but whether or not there was any truth in what the hon. Lady
said about the circumstances surrounding the exchange of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>letters, was she saying that nothing could be done for Michael Stone?
Surely there must be some way in which to help people like him. We must
remember that he had asked for help on a couple of occasions and not
received it. Is it not sensible to consider whether there is a possible
way in which to help people such as Michael
Stone?</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000397"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> I am not suggesting otherwise for a moment.
During our debates, I have made clear my concern about the lack of
continuity in the community of people who may or may not have been
treated as in-patients, but who have certainly come under the umbrella
of mental health services. In my experience of looking at
cases&#151;fortunately none was as serious as the Stone case&#151;I
encountered a case in which a constituent fell through the net, did not
receive ongoing attention from the mental health services and murdered
his mother. I do not need to be signed up to the idea that we should be
seeking to help such
people.</div>
					<a name="07050167000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
best form of treatment for the person has to be down to the clinical
judgment of someone who has had many years studying such complex cases.
That is the point. It is not that I am disparaging others and saying
that they do not have a role to play&#151;even a very senior role. Of
course they do. However, I do not see the logic in the idea of taking
decision making away from the person who was involved originally at a
senior level in admitting the person for detention. It does not seem to
make sense. I must therefore ask myself what is behind the
Minister&#146;s motivation for being so opposed to the
clause.</div>

						</b> I want to ask the hon. Lady one simple
question: does she think that there is any role for responsible
clinicians as we have defined them? If she does, will she say why the
Opposition suggest, through their wish to delete clause 11, that that
role of responsible clinician should not
exist?</div>

clause 11
later.</div>
					<a name="07050167000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
inconsistencies in the Minister&#146;s argument on the renewal of
detention make me wonder what is behind clause 6. It is inconsistent,
although that is not to disparage those who have a role to play in
other disciplines of mental health care, who would undoubtedly be
involved in a patient&#146;s treatment and management. We often use
the word &#147;treatment&#148; in this debate when perhaps we ought
to use &#147;management&#148;. Many people can play a role in the
management of a patient; it does not necessarily follow that that would
constitute a treatment. Many disciplines would certainly have a role to
play in making sure that detained patients gained as much as possible
from their detention
period.</div>
					<a name="07050167000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
discussing renewals, and rolling out again after the first six-month
period. That surely has grave significance for the individual
concerned. I cannot accept the Minister&#146;s argument on the
clause. On Report in the Lords, the Government attempted to put some
medical input into the patient&#146;s care. Why was that good enough
for their lordships, but not good enough for this
House?</div>

					<a name="07050167000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like quickly to summarise some of the points made. It is
important to reiterate that we are trying to make sure that we reflect
some of the new ways of working that have been developed for a number
of years&#151;with the royal colleges, mental health care
professionals and so on&#151;so that we can recognise the new roles
that highly qualified nurse consultants and clinical psychologists can
play in a multidisciplinary team. We wanted the ability to give them
that role as the responsible clinician.</div>
					<a name="07050167000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that the
Opposition should be honest about how they really feel. They have
tabled an amendment that would delete clause 11, thereby deleting the
whole idea of the responsible clinician. It is important that we should
see the amendment in that light. Their starting point appears to be
that they do not want the responsible clinician to exist. We are saying
that there is a role and that it is right that in legislation we should
be able to reflect what is happening in many areas of service
development. If the Opposition&#146;s intention is as I have
described, I make it absolutely clear that we fundamentally disagree.
We believe that there is a role.</div>

							<a name="07050167000402"></a>Ms

						</b> Absolutely; that is why they are so bizarre
when read alongside the amendment to delete clause 11. That is what I
find bizarre. On the one hand, the Opposition
say<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i> I think that the hon. Gentleman has
been called out by his adviser, but I hope that he will stay to hear
the arguments.</div>
					<a name="07050167000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start
from the point of view that the Opposition may not want a responsible
clinician to have any role at all; obviously, the Government do. We
come to the issue of the difference, which has been raised. At initial
detention, the responsible clinician, who may not be a doctor, decides
about renewal. There is no requirement in relation to the European
Court of Human Rights for doctors to decide about initial detention.
Indeed, we considered whether two approved clinicians should make that
decision, because we felt that that could be appropriate, but as a
matter of policy, and listening to the points that people made, we
decided to keep doctors as making the decision because, at initial
detention, some patients are not known to services or have disengaged
from services, so a patient&#146;s clinical needs may not be known at
that point. We felt that it was practical that doctors, with their
particularly broad diagnostic skills, should decide whether people
should be
detained.</div>
					<a name="07050167000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
once the patient has been assessed and their needs are known, it is
right, in our view, that they should be given the responsible clinician
who meets their needs best. That is one of the benefits of the
responsible clinician policy. The patient may be allocated a person to
be in charge of their case who has the particular expertise to address

						The
competencies that we have set out for becoming a responsible clinician,
which have been developed in conjunction with stakeholders, including
the Royal College of Psychiatrists, state that a clinician must have
the ability to identify the presence and the severity of a mental
disorder. I stress to hon. Members that if the person lacks that
expertise, they will not qualify to be approved to carry out the work.
It is those competencies, which will be in statutory directions, as
opposed to the possession of a particular medical qualification, that
will ensure that an approved clinician can provide the objective
medical expertise required by Winterwerp. That is also, by the way, the
view of Queen&#146;s counsel. I am sure that hon. Members will have
seen the document from the British Psychological Society&#151;I hate
to mention it again!&#151;which sought independent counsel to verify
that that it is the correct
position.</div>

						As I have said over and over
again, it depends on what is right for the individual. If we are
talking about psychological therapies being right for the individual,
the responsible clinician should be the person who delivers those. If,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport mentioned, there was a case
of paranoid schizophrenia that required medication levels that needed
to be medically assessed, it would be right that a medical practitioner
played that role. We are talking about what is most appropriate for the

						Yes, I will address that. The

involves reports from psychiatrists who are doctors. However, the
Government believe that the specific reference in that case to the fact
that</div>

confirmed the need for a medical expert&#146;s opinion where someone
of unsound mind is to

					<a name="07050167000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let
me just clarify some of the issues, because that might help the
Opposition. Clause 25 already requires the responsible clinician to
consult one other person who is professionally concerned with the
patient&#146;s case before renewing detention. Good practice would
certainly dictate that all members of the multidisciplinary team,
including the doctor, were consulted, and that is generally what
happens. However, I am quite willing to say that we can look at the
code of practice if Opposition Members feel that that would be a good
way of strengthening how decisions on renewal take place. That would,
however, be in the context of there being a responsible clinician, and
the Opposition are currently saying that a responsible clinician should
not exist in the first place. I hope that that explanation is
helpful.</div>

						The hon.
Gentleman made a point about the code of practice, and we need to be
sure about the outcome of the parliamentary process before we finally
consult on what will be in the code. I am more than happy to say that
we can start discussions and put forward wording to show how we might
clarify how a decision to renew detention would be made and how members
of the multidisciplinary team would be involved. Again, however, I
emphasise that we should do that in consultation with the professions.
We should not just do things quickly and involve only parliamentarians,
because the professionals would not find that very
satisfactory.</div>
					<a name="07050167000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To reiterate,
my fear is that the Opposition do not believe in the idea of having a
responsible clinician because they want to delete clause 11, which
actually establishes the responsible clinician. In the light of that, I
think that some of the debates that we have had about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>clause 6 are a bit disingenuous. The Government think that the clause is
patronising to non-medical professionals. The responsible clinician
competencies insist on a high level of skill, including the ability to
recognise the existence and severity of a mental disorder. Yet, the
clause says that despite the clinician&#146;s ability to determine
whether it is necessary for a patient to be detained in hospital
because they have a mental disorder severe enough to warrant it, that
decision must be signed off by a doctor. The Government believe that
that is completely the wrong approach and I will be asking Government
Members to oppose the clause.</div>

with your usual sure and firm touch, Lady Winterton.</div>
					<a name="07050167000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a probing amendment.
Clause 10 amends section 118 of the 1983 Act to insert new requirements
into the existing arrangements for a code of practice. It requires the
Secretary of State to include in the code a statement of principles
that she thinks should inform decisions made under the Act.</div>
					<a name="07050167000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The clause
contains a list of issues that need to be addressed in the preparation
of the statement of principles. Amendment No. 54, which is linked with
amendments Nos. 41, 66 and 55, would amend that list as I shall
describe. Amendment No. 41, tabled by Conservative members of the
Committee, would add another consideration to the list&#151;the
impact on black and minority ethnic patients. Amendment No. 66, tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, would add to that list the
rights of victims. Amendment No. 55, tabled by Conservative Members,
would omit the proposed new subsection (2C) on the efficient use of
resources and the equitable distribution of services.</div>
					<a name="07050167000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft code contains the
proposed principles; on the whole it is a good list, which is well set
out and makes sense. However, amendment No. 54 picks up on two
differences between the draft code&#146;s principles and the list in
clause 10: first, a difference in terminology and, secondly, what I
would say is an omission inclause 10.</div>
					<a name="07050167000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On the
difference in terminology, the draft code refers to an assessment of
risk, whereas clause 10 refers to the protection of the public. The
purpose of my amendment is to include in clause 10 assessment of risk
instead of protection of the public to make the two consistent. I
prefer the description &#147;assessment of risk&#148; rather than
protection of the public for a number of reasons. First, it would make
it clear beyond peradventure that criticism of the Bill on grounds of
saying that it is about social control as an aim is ill judged.
Ensuring that we do not leave protection of the public standing on its
own as a separate item in clause 10 would help to make that clear.
Secondly, such a description would make it clear that the patient
should be the focus of the assessment carried out by the medical
practitioners. The patient and the treating doctors want to limit the
danger of harm to others&#151;for example, relatives, carers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>and strangers&#151;as well as to the patient. Thirdly, such an
approach would make it clear that it is the risk assessment that then
weighs up the various considerations. The amendment therefore suggests
that the change should be to the clause 10 list, to say that assessment
of risk is a matter to be taken into consideration. It is already in
the statement of principles of the draft code that there should be an
assessment of risk, and there is a very good section afterwards that
explains how the assessment should be made to weigh up the relevant
risks better than at present.</div>
					<a name="07050167000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second part of the
amendment would correct the omission to which I referred earlier and
add to the list in clause 10 the word &#147;transparency&#148;. It
is in the draft code&#146;s principles&#151;a good short statement
that transparency is important&#151;but it does not appear in the
clause 10 list. It is an important consideration, not an add-on or a
catch-all. Transparency is much more than simply alerting people to
their rights; it is about explaining to them the procedures that will
be carried out&#151;what will happen and why&#151;the decisions
that need to be made and what will be the consequences. All that is
part of transparency, not just
communication.</div>

						Clause
10 was a Government amendment in the other place, which was accepted by
the Opposition parties. In the House of Lords debates, there was
concern about the status of the code. Proposed new subsection (2D) says
that all those who have responsibilities under the
Act</div>
					<a name="07050167000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall have regard to
the code.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050167000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes tell us that that gives statutory effect to the
decision of the House of Lords, as the final court of appeal, in the
case of R. <i class="I">v. </i>Ashworth. That basically said that people making
decisions should have regard to statute law and try to apply it in most
circumstances, but that practitioners can depart from it with good
reason. Opponents of that last point say that it is a weakness, which
is why many people make strong demands about principles being stated in
primary legislation, not just in a code of
practice.</div>
					<a name="07050167000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it were
possible to find a way to enable the Bill to reassure us with a ringing
declaration of the rights and principles under it, that might well take
away some of the concerns that have led to amendments on treatability,
exclusions and so on. It might be possible to devise a solution
different from the current one, to give the extra guidance to
practitioners that some have appealed for while guaranteeing the
safeguards for service users that others have asked for. That would
mean the Bill being tidier and not needing the amendments that were
made in the other
place.</div>

					<a name="07050167000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question directly, I did make a visit to the Public Bill Office before
our deliberations began and presented a large suggested amendment that
would have put all the relevant principles in the Bill. I shall not
labour the discussion that I had with the Clerk, but suffice it to say
that more work needs to be done on the principles behind the Bill and
their status before we finish our
deliberations.</div>

							<b class="B">Mrs.
Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): I also welcome you to
this afternoon&#146;s deliberations, Lady Winterton. I hope that they
will be calmer and more rational than this morning&#146;s were at
times.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000437"></a>James

						</b> Apologise to the
Minister.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000438"></a>Mrs.
Moon:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman suggests that the apology should
be to the Minister. Instead I commend her for the calmness with which
she has taken all the amendments and the suggestions, at times
hysterical, of hidden agendas behind the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050167000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford explained, the issue of fundamental
principles is critical to calming what has sometimes been hysteria, but
which at other times has been a genuine reflection of fears and
anxieties expressed in many of the submissions that we have received.
One of the most positive things about the new way of looking at
evidence in Public Bill Committees has been the opportunity for people
to express their fears and anxieties, and for hon. Members to read them
and get a clear impression of the views of many different bodies and
professions.</div>
					<a name="07050167000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
questions have been asked during our deliberations about the intentions
underlying the Bill. The clause gives us a good opportunity to be clear
that there are such underlying intentions and that they are set out in
the fundamental principles. The Bill is intended to update legislation
from 1983. Much has changed; we have moved on as a society. Many of the
prejudices towards the mentally ill have changed, as have many of the
ways in which we work with people who have mental health problems. The
training for professionals and the way in which the professions deal
with each other has also changed. In particular, we have far more
community-based care than we had in 1983. Therefore, it is more than
appropriate that the Bill recognises those changes and tries to project
forward into the future to determine how, as a society, we want to
facilitate the care for those who have mental health
problems.</div>
					<a name="07050167000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been
very clear in saying that what we are trying to do is to ensure that
the patient has access to help and support in times of crisis, and that
a patient&#146;s personal identity remains central to the
deliberations that take place during treatment. At times, there has
perhaps been a lack of recognition that the emotional pain that is
often experienced during times of mental ill health is more
excruciating and more debilitating than any physical pain. That
emotional pain can be terrible.
</div>
					<a name="07050167000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly
welcome the fact that, within the underlying principles set out in
proposed new subsection (2B) in clause 10, the first three
principles&#151; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>(a), (b) and (c)&#151;focus initially very clearly on the patient. The
Bill says that there must be</div>
					<a name="07050167000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;respect for patients&#146; past
and present wishes and
feelings&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050167000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have today
tabled an amendment that I hope will also allow greater attention to be
paid to patients&#146; past and present wishes and feelings when we
examine advance directives. I know that another amendment has been
tabled in relation to that, and I have also tabled one in relation to
advance statements, which I hope will allow greater recognition in the
Bill of patients&#146; past and present wishes and feelings, so that
they can be clearly identified and have a status in an advance
statement.</div>
					<a name="07050167000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
said clearly that we wish to minimise restrictions on liberty. I hope
that that will also remove some of the anxiety felt&#151;the belief
that there are hidden intentions to use this legislation as a catch-all
Bill to lock people away, including those chain smokers that still
exist in our society, although I cannot believe that that scenario
really has been suggested in this House.</div>
					<a name="07050167000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular, all of
us&#151;the professionals, patients, carers, anyone who works with
people with mental health problems&#151;should welcome the third
principle, which is principle (c). It is the</div>
					<a name="07050167000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;involvement of patients in
planning, developing and delivering care and treatment appropriate to
them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050167000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">There can be no
clearer statement as to the central role that the patient will play
when decisions are made by professionals in response to the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050167000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
we also need to take into account the feelings of the people who have
not been mentioned so far in our deliberations and the effect of the
Bill on them, because it must address the need to protect, help and
support the wider public. There has been a great deal of discussion
about professional roles, professional tasks, professional
responsibilities, professional training and professional skills.
However, much of the care of the mentally ill is provided not by
professionals, but by carers, and they are responsible for
patients&#146; well-being and safety.</div>
					<a name="07050167000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its submission MH49, SANE
sets out that position well, speaking of the need to safeguard the
rights of those with mental illness or disorder. Legislation should
respect and protect those families and carers who provide support to
people day in, day
out.</div>
					<a name="07050167000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sandra Sullivan
of Justice for Victims wrote a book of poems in memory of her murdered
daughter, Katie. She
said:</div>
					<a name="07050167000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To trust
the unsuspecting with the unaccountable is the policy of an uncaring
government.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050167000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
has been little reference to carers or to the continually stressful
role that they often play in supporting mental health patients. Without
them, many such patients would not be able to cope. In the submission
by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, 47 per cent. of carers are
described as feeling that they have insufficient help to care
efficiently and effectively. The Zito Trust has reported that,
according to 35 independent homicide reports, non-compliance with
medication was a contributory factor in 57 per cent. of cases of
breakdown of care that led to
homicide.</div>
					<a name="07050167000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information
for carers is essential if they are to provide adequate care, and I
believe that the advance statement provides an opportunity to widen the
list of carers to whom information can be provided. Carers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>are a diverse group: they are partners, family, friends, professionals,
home care workers and residential care workers. We must place a duty on
professionals to share information, and that needs to be a part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050167000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
66 is a probing amendment which I felt I had to table after I had met
Justice for Victims. That organisation told me about how the fear of
the unknown&#151;the fear of difference&#151;much of which is
unfounded in relation to people with mental health problems, has for
some people proven to be a nightmare reality. Sandra Sullivan expresses
that well in her poetry when she
says:</div>
					<a name="07050167000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I had my
heart removed today. There is a hole where it used to
be.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050167000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
experience of violence or death as a result of an interaction with
somebody who is in crisis and who has a severe mental health problem
can produce a profound effect in some people, so it is unfortunate that
Opposition Members were unable to meet Justice for
Victims.</div>

I have met many organisations with different perspectives, including
the Zito Trust, which the hon. Lady mentioned. I am not aware of any
invitation having been made by the other organisation that she
mentioned, but I would have been more than happy to meet its
representatives, as I did everybody
else.</div>

							<a name="07050167000442"></a>Mrs.

Justice for Victims informed me that a meeting had been arranged for
Monday but that it had not taken place. I apologise if I have been
wrongly informed.</div>
					<a name="07050167000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Zito Trust has drawn attention to the lack of support or recognition
for victims in the Bill. The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act
2004 has a scheme for providing information to victims of mentally
disordered offenders. However, it applies only to restricted patients
and patients subject to a restriction order, a limitations direction or
a restriction direction. It is concerned with those who are charged
with a sexual offence or an offence of violence and who are convicted,
found not guilty on grounds of insanity, or found unfit to be
tried.</div>
					<a name="07050167000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those
circumstances, the local probation board must take reasonable steps to
ascertain whether the victim, or their representative, wishes to
receive information about conditions in the event of a discharge from
hospital. The board must take reasonable steps also to let them know if
or when a restriction is to cease following a discharge, and any other
appropriate information. Equally, the Secretary of State must inform
the probation board, which in turn must inform the victim or their
representative, when considering whether to lift the restriction on a
patient, to discharge the patient&#151;absolutely or subject to
conditions&#151;or to vary the
conditions.</div>

						As
I am sure the Committee recognises, victims are calling for rights set
out in the 2004 Act to be extended to victims of serious offences,
including violence, at the hands of a mentally disordered person who
has been convicted and subjected to a hospital order, or a hospital or
transfer direction, but not to a restriction order, or limitation or
restriction direction. It is right that the Bill strikes a balance
between our responsibilities to, and protection and justified
restriction of, those suffering from a mental health condition with our
responsibilities to victims of violence. Their voices should be
represented. For that reason, I have tabled my
amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000443"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> I would like to provide some clarification on
what the hon. Lady said about Justice for Victims. We listened very
seriously to the evidence given to the pre-legislative scrutiny
Committee. My memory is that the organisation arranged a meeting with
my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown),
who is not a member of this Committee. His office did not arrange for
us to meet it as well, but I would be more than happy to do that in
future. Certainly, there was no intention not to meet it; it is just
that the invitation was not passed on. That was the problem. However,
we could certainly arrange a meeting. Nevertheless, we have met other
organisations with similar concerns, and I am happy to expand on
that.</div>
					<a name="07050167000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to the case for the amendments, which I think are useful and
thoughtful, and I am interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response.
Let me provide some background to the principles. They were potentially
one of the big battlegrounds, but a sensible compromise on them was
reached in the Lords. However, some people are still unhappy, and that
goes back to the technicalities of this being an amending Bill, so we
are told by the experts, rather than one to which we can apply
principles. However, applying principles to existing legislation poses
technical problems. I am sure that the Minister can confirm
that&#151;she nods her head
helpfully.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000444"></a>James
Duddridge:
						</b> I apologise if I am stealing my hon.
Friend&#146;s thunder, but was it not the case that when the two
draft Bills were introduced, they were Bills in their own right, rather
than amendments to the 1983 Act? The Minister has refused consistently
to allow the principles to be placed in this Bill. It is not about
amending the Bill, but about her view of what should
happen.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000445"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and given
that that happened before he was elected to the House, it is diligent
of him to know the Bill&#146;s origins. Neither of the two draft
Bills, with which we were faced back in the aeons of time and from
where this Bill originates, contained principles, and they were
original Bills. The contention of all concerned and of the
pre-legislative scrutiny Committee was that principles should be placed
clearly in the Bill. I remember that the Minister came before the
pre-legislative scrutiny Committee and was challenged on that. She made
the case that occasionally principles could be disapplied, and we asked
her when the principle of non-racism could be disapplied, because it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>is difficult to think of an instance when that could be the case. Surely
non-racism should apply to this and every other piece of legislation,
and there is no juncture at which, all of a sudden, a little bit of
racism would be acceptable.</div>
					<a name="07050167000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why fundamental
principles that go to the heart of safeguarding the rights and
treatment of vulnerable people subject to sectioning should be clearly
laid out. The point made by the hon. Member for Stafford about
transparency is right. If we are to deprive somebody of his liberty,
the principles on which that liberty is taken away must be clearly
outlined, as well as the basis on which he can challenge the judgment.
Setting out principles to back that up is exceedingly useful. It
provides a good safeguard for the patient and a clear instruction for
both the professional and the lawyer who might seek to challenge it on
a client&#146;s behalf. We have always taken the view that principles
should be on the face of the
Bill</div>
					<a name="07050167000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">For technical
reasons, it was suggested that that posed a problem. Therefore, their
lordships came up with the compromise whereby the fundamental
principles in the code of conduct are mentioned in the Bill without
being principles themselves. Some of us are still not completely happy
with that, because they will not have the cachet of being in the Bill,
but in the interests of achieving some accommodation in order to
proceed, their lordships were content&#151;I shall not say happy or
delirious&#151;to accept the compromise.</div>
					<a name="07050167000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, we will not
return to stage one and say, &#147;Let&#146;s have the principles
on the face of the Bill,&#148; because that would be going around in
circles. However, things can be done to beef up the quasi-principles in
the code of conduct, as the Bill alludes to it. I return to the case
that we made in pre-legislative scrutiny Committee. It would be useful
if the Government could lay out, at an early stage and in as detailed a
form as possible, the code of conduct, particularly as it will be
crucial if things are not in the Bill but in the code. The applies as a
general rule, as I think other members of the Committee will
concur.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07050167000446"></a>
							<b class="B">Hywel
Williams</b> (Caernarfon) (PC): I also have concerns about the
degree of legal protection afforded, given that the principles will be
in the code of conduct. Perhaps another question that might be
addressed is how the principles might be varied, if they are to be
varied, as the Minister said when she came before the Joint Committee.
The mechanism is of interest to many and would need to be
safeguarded.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000447"></a>Tim
Loughton:
						</b>
						The hon. Gentleman makes a
valid point, and he was privy to those discussions in the scrutiny
Committee as well. Most of what we would describe and understand as
fundamental principles are fairly timeless in any case, but codes of
conduct are subject to constant revision. Those are areas of concern on
which we need assurances from the Minister. How will they be
handled?</div>
					<a name="07050167000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On an
interesting point, I attended the Black Mental Health UK presentation
earlier, between the two sittings. It was held in Committee Room 6 and
had a number of eminent presenters, some of whom spoke at our witness 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>session last Friday on the concerns of black and minority ethnic
communities about the way that the Bill is going. My first amendment,
to which I shall come, specifically addresses BME considerations. Black
Mental Health UK said quite clearly in today&#146;s briefing and have
said
previously:</div>
					<a name="07050167000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;BMH
UK believe that mental health law should be framed within both human
rights and race relations legislation and geared towards reducing
discriminatory practices and increasing the protection of the rights of
both patients and carers engaged with mental health
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050167000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
we would all agree with that. It went on to
say:</div>
					<a name="07050167000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The 2006
Mental Health Bill fails on all of these points. BMH UK believe this
Bill is unethical and unworkable and has thrown away the opportunity of
updating the 1983 Mental Health Act so that it meets the demands of a
21st Century multicultural
society.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050167000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">BMH UK still
has serious concerns. Clearly, the fact that the principles are not
included in the Bill has undermined its confidence. It will listen to
the points that we are making. We hope for assurances that the
principles will serve the purpose that we are all trying to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="07050167000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We received
an interesting presentation from a consultant psychiatrist. To
paraphrase him, he said that psychiatrists work around a code of
practice&#151;as long as something is not legally binding, they can
work around it. If it is legally binding, as legislation would be, with
principles included in the Bill, they will follow it. It is interesting
that, according to that interpretation by a practising psychiatrist, a
code of conduct does not carry the same weight and gravitas as primary
legislation. One therefore has slight concerns about how practitioners
view the code of conduct as opposed to something in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050167000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need reassurances from the
Minister about how things will work in practice. I have provided a bit
of background to how we got to this stage on the issue of principles.
We are not tabling amendments to ensure that the principles are put
back into the Bill, but we need some
assurance.</div>
					<a name="07050167000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 41 would add to the fundamental principles a reference to the
particular needs of black and minority ethnic patients and the impact
of treatment on them. The principle of &#147;avoidance of unlawful
discrimination&#148; is included in proposed new subsection (2B), but
that can refer to all sorts of discrimination; there is no specific
reference to racial discrimination. We have tried to adopt a more
positive form to take account of particular needs, because we know that
the black and minority ethnic community has particular mental health
needs and that it is particularly susceptible to the need for mental
health services and sectioning.</div>
					<a name="07050167000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I do not need
to remind the Committee that a King&#146;s Fund study found that
members of the black population were seven times more likely to be
admitted to a medium secure unit. Men from black Caribbean, black
African and other black groups had a rate of detention ranging from 25
to 38 per cent. above average; a similar pattern was noticed for women,
with a detention rate that was 56 to 62 per cent. higher than average
for those from black Caribbean, black African and other black groups.
In 2005, rates of suicide and self-harm were 60 per cent. higher for
young Asian girls than for their white counterparts.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>
					<a name="07050167000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know&#151;I do not
think that there is any contention over this&#151;that people from
black and minority ethnic communities are caught up far more than
others in mental health services. There are particular problems with
getting them to present in the first place. After the case of Rocky
Bennett, there are concerns about the way in which black men are
treated by the mental health services when they are contained and the
fact that black men are subject to sectioning on a scale that far
outweighs their representation in the population as a whole.</div>
					<a name="07050167000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The black and minority ethnic
community clearly has perfectly legitimate concerns about the impact of
the legislation on it. It is worried that some of its members, who are
represented through BMH UK, might be scared off from presenting for
services in the first place, which we know is so crucial. It is
essential that we take account of those needs. In response to this
probing amendment, we need some assurances on how the Government aim to
take care of the requirements of black and minority ethnic community.
From the &#147;Count Me In&#148; census, which was eventually
published earlier this year, we know how the fears of that community
filtered through to have a real impact on the number of its members
caught up in mental health services.</div>
					<a name="07050167000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is particularly important
that those concerns are taken on board in the light of the debate about
exemptions that we had when we considered clause 3. We were trying to
promote exemptions in respect of cultural or religious beliefs, which
are of particular concern to the BME community. We do not have the
safeguards that we wanted, in the form of exemptions in clause 3, so it
is even more important to add something to the principles to give
assurances to people from the BME community that they will be looked
after and given appropriate treatment, and that they have no reason to
fear coming into contact with mental health services. That is the basis
of amendment No. 41.

					<a name="07050167000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
55 proposes to leave out new subsection (2C). I am perplexed as to why
that provision remains in the Bill, but I am sure that the Minister
will clarify the point. New subsection (2C) deals with matters of
funding and general service delivery that do not concern individual
professionals applying the compulsory powers of the Mental Health Act,
so it looks out of place in this list. The presence of a provision in
the principles section of the code of practice that is about service
provision will surely cause confusion. Worse still, such a provision
would be in danger of being misunderstood as providing a reason for
professionals to take less account of the principles themselves. The
Mental Health Alliance does not accept that this should
occur.</div>
					<a name="07050167000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
puzzled about how the provision might work in practice and what the
Government aimed to achieve by its inclusion. Again, amendment No. 55
is a probing amendment, but this provision looks out of place. I have
no problems with the list in new subsection (2B), subject to the
additions that we propose and perhaps to consideration of some of the
additions that Labour Back Benchers have proposed, but we do not see
the rationale for new subsection (2C). I would be grateful if the
Minister would elaborate on both those
points.</div>

As has been stated, the clause tries to address concerns raised in the
other place that principles needed to be in the Bill. The reasons why
that is difficult have been outlined. I want to clarify the position in
the draft Bill, because the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham
said that no principles were outlined in the earlier Government drafts.
I read Baroness Barker&#146;s comments in the other place. She
said:</div>
					<a name="07050167000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Government&#146;s draft Bill of 2004, which was the subject of the
work of the Joint Scrutiny Committee, included at its beginning three
principles&#151;that patients should be involved in decision-making,
that decisions should be made fairly and openly, and that interference
to patients in providing medical treatment and restrictions imposed on
them during treatment should be kept to a minimum to protect their
health and safety and that of others. So the Government themselves, in
2004, could see a case for having principles included in the
legislation.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 8

					<a name="07050167000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Hunt
confirmed that there was no constitutional problem with including
principles on the face of the Bill, but said that the Government were
concerned about the practical impact of those principles. We have also
heard that it is very difficult to put principles in another piece of
legislation when one is dealing with an amending Bill. He considered
that the best way forward would be to incorporate them into the code of
practice, which is where we are with this amendment. He also
said:</div>
					<a name="07050167000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Putting
the principles in the Bill might well lead to a lack of clarity and a
lack of understanding by practitioners who have to operate day in and
day out.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i>
						8 January 2007; Vol. 688, c.
46.]</div>
					<a name="07050167000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I found that a rather
strange argument. Either the principles are clear or they are not. They
are just as clear or unclear whether they are in a code of practice or
a Bill. But any principle should also stand the test of time.</div>
					<a name="07050167000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find it hard to believe that
in a few years hence we will disagree with the notion that, for
example, patients should be involved in the decision-making and that
those decisions should be made fairly and openly. That seems to be what
is widely agreed at the moment. Any such change in principles is surely
a matter of fundamental importance and should be debated by Parliament.
When the Joint Committee on Human Rights commented on the draft 2002
Bill it said that the capacity of a code of practice to give sufficient
protection to the human rights of patients in the decision-making
process was unclear. It would be useful if the Minister could reassure
us about how much weight the code of practice will
have.</div>
					<a name="07050167000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">In new
subsection (2B) we now have a list of principles which could appear a
little contradictory. I have a slight problem with the whole package.
Paragraphs (a) to (d) are broadly akin to the comments made by Baroness
Barker. When a set of principles revolves around the patient, there is
a certain clarity about what is involved and what is intended. But the
Government have included paragraph (h) which is &#147;public
safety&#148;. The cynics could say that this is yet more evidence of
the cold hand of the Home Office on this Bill. Perhaps the Minister
could clarify the reasons for this being included.</div>
					<a name="07050167000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">How does, for example, a
practitioner balance the patient&#146;s wish for liberty, which is in
paragraph (b), against a perhaps not well-founded but nevertheless
expressed caution from a third party about a potential risk to public
safety? To be frank, we are supposed to be dealing with health
legislation. I am somewhat surprised to see public safety expressed as
a core principle. I am much happier with the wording achieved by
amendment No. 54, tabled by the hon. Member for Stafford, as the
transparency element implies a greater level of protection. The
amendment makes it clear that there needs to be a full and proper
assessment of risk. One would assume that that would happen anyway, and
I am sure that most health professionals would be astounded that such a
thing could be suggested, but it is always useful to have such things
clarified.</div>

					<a name="07050167000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman pointed
out, we are talking about the draft code, so it would be helpful to
know what opportunities Members of Parliament, including those in the
other place, will have to have some input. It is right that the code of
practice is widely consultedon by professionals, but it is not
clear whether parliamentarians will have a say or in what format. It
would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that.</div>

						Amendment No.
41 is important. It has been pointed out that the issue could be
covered by paragraph (d), which mentions the &#147;avoidance of
unlawful discrimination&#148;. The concerns of black and minority
ethnic groups have been raised on a number of occasions during the
debate. Document MH23, a submission from the National Black and
Minority Ethnic Health Network, states:</div>
					<a name="07050167000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The differential impact
of the proposed mental health legislation on BME groups is a
well-documented feature of the mental health
system.&#148;</div>

cites the &#147;Count me in&#148; census as the latest in a long
line of evidence. It also comments on the McPherson inquiry into the
death of Stephen Lawrence, which stated:</div>

						&#147;The
collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and
professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or
ethnic origin. This can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes,
and behaviour that amount to discrimination through unwitting
prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which
disadvantages people in ethnic minority
groups&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050167000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
has been pointed out, it is not enough to say that we treat people

a positive duty to ensure that any particular section of society is not

thoughts on that.</div>
					<a name="07050167000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see that amendment No. 66 is well intentioned, but I again suggest
that amending mental health legislation is not the place in which to
deal with the issue. I was pleased that the hon. Member for Bridgend
mentioned the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, because
amending that would be a far more appropriate way forward. I support
the sentiments behind the amendment, but I am not convinced that it is
the best way for her to achieve her aims.</div>

						</b> Before the Division, I pointed out that although
it is important to take into account the efficient use of resources and
the equitable distribution of services, I was concerned that the clause
had crept into a part of the Bill that deals with fundamental
principles. It seems that proposed section (2C) has no place here. It
refers to the Secretary of State, but I am not quite sure how
responsibilities are cascaded down to the people whose work involves
making everyday
decisions.</div>
					<a name="07050167000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, a mental health professional could be put in the position of
thinking that, according to the principle in new subsection (2B)(e), he
must give the most effective treatment, but, as the legislation states
that he is allowed to take resources into account, he could give the
cheaper drug. I am sure&#151;or at least I would hope&#151;that
that is not the intention of the legislation, and I hope that it will
not be a consequence of the clause. I seek the Minister&#146;s
reassurance that use of resources will not be used to hamper, as it
were, the freedom of health professionals to prescribe or provide the
treatment that is in the best interests of the patient. If the
unforeseen consequence that I have described could arise, that would go
against every code of professional ethics under the sun, so I should
like the Minister&#146;s reassurance on that
point.</div>

Williams:
						</b> Following on from your earlier ruling, Lady
Winterton, I thought that I would make some stand part-type remarks, as
well as refer to the amendment, on the issue of principles.</div>
					<a name="07050167000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mental health services are
beset by stigma, fear, prejudice and uncertainty. Principles can be a
forceful and important signal, setting out ethical standards and
thereby improving people&#146;s confidence in the operation of the
law. Having been a member of the Joint Committee, I am of course
disappointed that the principles appear in the code of practice. I
understand the Government&#146;s rationale for that, but we had some
interesting discussions in the Joint Committee about whether the
principles should be in the code of practice or in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050167000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">My preference would have been
for us to follow, if possible, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment)
(Scotland) Act 2003, which I briefly looked at before this debate. I
draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that the phrase used
by the Scottish Act in respect of the principles is &#147;must have
regard to&#148;. Proposed new section 118(2A) of the 1983 Act, in
clause 10, talks
about</div>
					<a name="07050167000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the principles
which the Secretary of State thinks should inform decisions under this
Act.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050167000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand why
that wording has been chosen, but it is of a slightly different order
to &#147;must have regard
to&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07050167000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
should also like to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact
that there are other pieces of legislation that include principles. I
have some experience of the Children Act 1989, which sets out long
lists of principles to which people must pay due regard before, for
example, taking children into care. One of the things listed is
language, which is a particular interest of mine and to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>which I might refer later in the Committee&#146;s proceedings,
although not today. To refer to the point that the Minister made a
number of times, as a former social worker, I never felt that having
principles set out was in any way patronising to me, and I do not think
that my colleagues did either.</div>
					<a name="07050167000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the rationale for
putting the principles in the code of practice, but I have a number of
concerns to which I would like to refer briefly. When we discussed the
matter in the Joint Committee, the Minister said that the fundamental
guiding principles might need to be changed over time and that that
would be easier if they were part of the code of practice. I would like
to know what mechanism would be used to change the fundamental
principles over time. In some ways, if principles are fundamental, they
do not necessarily need to be changed.</div>
					<a name="07050167000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also am concerned that if
changing the principles is a matter of changing a code of practice
rather than legislation, they might be changed without sufficient
parliamentary scrutiny. If times or commissions were changing, that
would very much be an argument in favour of proper scrutiny, rather
than saying that we should just be changing the code of practice, in a
slightly less formal way.</div>
					<a name="07050167000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next point is a basic one.
As I said in an earlier intervention, what legal protection does the
statement in the code of practice afford to service users and
practitioners? If it is not in the Bill, there is a question about that
issue. To use a phrase that has already been used in this Committee, I
am worried about that creating a field day for lawyers, as there could
be many legal
challenges.</div>
					<a name="07050167000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as
amendment No. 66 is concerned, I am the MP who represents Shaun and
Josie Russell. I will say nothing about that particular case other than
that they have demonstrated a quiet dignity and have rebuilt their
lives. However, that is the perspective that I have on this issue. I
worry about what will happen to other victims and the bereaved
relatives of other victims. At the very least, would it be possible to
make available to victims and their families dates of release or any
conditions attached to release? That information could also be made
available to practitioners. I am a former approved social worker and
can still remember the brush of a poker passing my nose when I was
involved in a particular sectioning, of which I am often reminded. I
have subsequently seen the person who was sectioned and she is well and
living a happy life. Fortunately, she cannot remember that particular
incident, but as a practitioner it often comes back to me. I draw the
attention of the Committee to the fact that social workers have been
murdered in the past in the course of sectioning and we must be aware
of the problems that they
experience.</div>
					<a name="07050167000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
amendment No. 41, people from the black and minority ethnic community
have good reason to suspect that they might unintentionally, or perhaps
intentionally&#151;although hopefully not&#151;face differential
treatment. It is reasonable to provide positive reassurance that their
needs have been fully taken into
account.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000459"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b>
						This has been a wide-ranging
and thoughtful debate about the issue of principles. We all agree that
it is important that people who make serious 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>decisions about whether to deprive a person of their liberty should be
guided by a common set of overarching ideas.</div>
					<a name="07050167000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will clarify the issues
relating to the previous Bills. The hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham referred to the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee and the
fact that I appeared before it. It is true that principles were not
part of the Bill, but having looked at the recommendations of the
Committee, I said that I would consider whether it was possible to put
principles in the Bill. I stress that there has never been an objection
to that; it has been a question of trying to do it without upsetting
the balance of the existing Act. As I say, I closely considered all the
issues and tried to look at whether we could address the matter in the
draft Bill, which would have been easier.</div>
					<a name="07050167000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Gentleman also said that I referred to disapplication of principles. I
wish to clarify the actual situation. Every discrimination code has
exceptions and complicated details, including in respect of the Race
Relations Act 1976, and that also extends to the issue of immigration.
The right principle here is the avoidance of unlawful discrimination.
When I referred to disapplication of principles, I was trying to say
that, under existing legislation, it is possible to do that.</div>
					<a name="07050167000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I considered very carefully
whether we could put principle in the Bill, but I want to share with
the Committee one of the issues that came to light when considering how
to do that. When deciding what medical treatment to give to a patient,
a practitioner must consider, among other things, the principles of the
patient&#146;s past and present wishes and feelings, and also the
effectiveness of treatment. If the principles were in the 1983 Act,
they would be given equal weight. That begs the question: what if the
most effective treatment were anti-psychotic injection, but the patient
did not like the side effects and wanted to try a slightly less
effective treatment with minimal side effects? What would take
precedence? Would it be the patient&#146;s wishes and feelings, or
the effectiveness of the
treatment?</div>
					<a name="07050167000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
referring to the code and having the principles set out in them, we can
give guidance on how the practitioner could weigh the two conflicting
principles. For example, the code might say that the decision should
rest on a risk assessment, and that as long as the practitioner is
content that the patient or public would not be at excessive risk if an
alternative treatment option were tried, the effectiveness of the
treatment could take a lower priority to the patient&#146;s wishes
and feelings. That is the sort of flexibility that we
want.</div>
					<a name="07050167000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Placing the
principles in the 1983 Act fixes them in time. They cannot be changed
in the light of changing practice or emerging issues without primary
legislation. However, we can bring the code&#151;the hon. Member for
Caernarfon asked about this&#151;back to the House and put it through
the parliamentary procedure much more quickly than waiting for a Bill,
which, as we know, may take some time&#151;sometimes nine
years.</div>

first there would be a 12-week consultation about any changes with the
ability for input from here on in when drawing up the code, and if

					<a name="07050167000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now want to
address the amendments that have been tabled today. They would
obviously introduce some new fundamental issues to the list that the
Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers must address when drawing up
the list of principles in the code of practice: the assessment of risk,
transparency, the needs of and impact of treatment on black and
minority ethnic patients and the rights of victims. The amendments
would also remove one fundamental issue&#151;public safety&#151;and
the requirement that the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers should
have regard to the desirability of ensuring efficient use of resources
and the equitable distribution of services.</div>
					<a name="07050167000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should probably start by
discussing the amendment that would remove one of the fundamental
issues that was agreed in the other place&#151;public
safety&#151;and replace it with an assessment of risk. I am
sympathetic to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford. His speech was well considered and I know the concerns that
he is trying to overcome. However, the problem of putting assessment of
risk in that way is that it is not in itself a fundamental principle,
buta procedure that is undertaken. We should be transparent
about what we check for when carrying out that procedure; it is
important that we are. All our discussions make it clear that an
important part of that procedure is that we assess the safety of the
patient and of the public, and it is therefore only transparent for
those two issues to be fundamental matters.</div>
					<a name="07050167000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes, I think, hon.
Members feel a bit uncomfortable about public safety, but my hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford made an important point yesterday, which
was well illustrated. Even someone who is suicidal might, by committing
that act, have an effect on public safety. It is important that we have
at the forefront of our minds the fact that when we talk about risk in
these circumstances we must consider the safety of the public. That can
include carers and family members as well as strangers, and it is
important that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>when we consider the individual and the difficult decisions that have to
be made, we do not run away from the fact that public safety is an
issue.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to recognise that some
people and organisations would be worried. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Bridgend said, we met yesterday with Victim&#146;s Voice. If we
were to remove one of the fundamental principles, that group would feel
that we were not listening to some of its concerns or reflecting what
is necessary in drawing up a risk assessment of the patient. That is
why I cannot accept the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford. I would also be unwilling to remove public safety from the
list.
</div>
					<a name="07050167000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Transparency
is one of the principles in the draft illustrative code for England,
which we published when the Bill was first introduced in the other
place. It is an important aspect of decision making, but it is a
procedure that results from the other principles in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07050167000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I want to
address the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend made. As
I said, we had a meeting yesterday with Victim&#146;s Voice, and I
have had meetings with the Zito Trust. I know that they feel strongly
not only about public safety, but about information sharing, and my
hon. Friend quite rightly put her finger on those issues. This is not
the appropriate place to address the issues in principle, but I am
happy to have further discussions with my hon. Friend about how we
might take them forward.</div>
					<a name="07050167000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall address the amendment
that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham tabled on the issue
of black and minority ethnic communities. It would add a fundamental
requirement to address</div>
					<a name="07050167000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the particular needs and impact
of treatment on black and minority ethnic
patients.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07050167000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Again,
I absolutely understand that it is a worthy attempt to address concerns
about the treatment of BMA patients. However, there is a fundamental
issue regarding discrimination. The problem with the amendment is that
it would go further and specify BMA patients as a
group&#151;</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07050167000463"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> BME patients. I am so sorry; that was a
Freudian slip.</div>
					<a name="07050167000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would specify BME patients as a group in isolation from other
groups that may be considered vulnerable. It would also treat BME
patients as a homogeneous group and ignore other characteristics, such
as age or gender, which might also need to be addressed. That is the
basic problem with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment.</div>
					<a name="07050167000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Returning to
the issue about the inclusion of principles in the Bill, quite
honestly, owing to unlawful discrimination, it would not be appropriate
to single out one particular group over another. The amendment would
also make life difficult for practitioners. Although we want them to
take into account a range of issues, whether they are issues of race,
age, gender or sexual orientation, the amendment would cause us some
difficulties if we had to highlight one issue above all others. A whole
programme of work exists, and I hope to be able to reassure hon.
Members at some point about the seriousness with which we take the
issue. I am more than happy to explore the issue further&#151;perhaps
when time is slightly less pressing.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>
					<a name="07050167000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I can also
reassure hon. Members that there is nothing sinister about the wording
of proposed subsection (2C). Clause 10 was drafted to include the
fundamental matters considered most important in England and Wales. The
Welsh national service framework for mental health has four
underpinning principles: the so-called four Es of equality, equity,
efficiency and effectiveness. When drafting the clause, we wanted to
ensure that the Welsh principles were incorporated, given that the
legislation covers England and
Wales.</div>
					<a name="07050167000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my
explanation has reassured hon. Members. All the issues raised are of
course extremely important, but I hope that I have made it clear why we
cannot accept the amendments. However, we certainly need to consider
the issue of the victims. With that, I hope that the Committee will
reject the
amendments.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07050167000464"></a>Mr.
Kidney:
						</b> I thank everyone who has taken part in the debate,
which has been very useful and helpful. I accept my right hon. Friend
the Minister&#146;s explanation about the difficulty of trying to
graft principles on to the 1983 Act using primary legislation. That
subject is well discussed at page 27 of the Library&#146;s research
paper on the Bill, and is a genuine difficulty.</div>
					<a name="07050167000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am less
persuaded, however, by my right hon. Friend&#146;s argument about the
ability to amend legislation easily in the future, because the relevant
matters could be dealt with in a schedule, and the Act could state that
it may be amended by secondary legislation. If hon. Members read
section 118(4) of the 1983 Act, they will find there the negative
resolution that my right hon. Friend described for amending the
code.</div>
					<a name="07050167000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said about the
purpose of his amendment in relation to black and minority ethnic
patients being to impose not only a negative aspect, that there should
not be discrimination, but a positive one, that diversity should be
respected. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>That is why I talked about a ringing
declaration when I spoke to my amendment. I wanted to take account of
the need to be positive. In the Mental Health Alliance&#146;s
briefing for Second Reading, it spoke about having principles on
non-discrimination and respect for diversity, which are virtually the
same thing. However, I point out that the principle about
&#147;respect for patients&#148; principle in the draft code
largely covers those
points.</div>
					<a name="07050167000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the public
protection point, there is a section on assessment in the code that
deals with the assessment of risk and protecting others. Will my right
hon. Friend consider whether the words &#147;public safety&#148;
might be better replaced by the phrase &#147;protection of
others&#148;, which was used in the 1983 Act? Changing those words
might take away the lingering suspicion, which the hon. Member for
Romsey expressed again in this debate, that the measure is about social
control rather than health treatment.</div>
					<a name="07050167000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise that we are making
a difficult decision and that there is a need for flexibility. With
those comments, and given that some of these issues could be considered
again, although not in the same way, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Loughton:
						</b> Lady Winterton, the Minister got very agitated
earlier, as she does occasionally, about our discussions on clause 6
and the responsible medical practitioner. She kept referring to
amendment No. 56, which you very generously did not call out of order,
Lady Winterton, although that amendment has not been selected for
discussion. I did not intend to move it, even it had been selected,
because it was superseded by amendment No. 60, which refers explicitly
to the &#147;responsible clinician&#148; in any place. We hope that
the Minister will look warmly on that amendment when we debate it in
relation to this clause.</div>
					<a name="07050167000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We think that
amendment No. 60 would make clause 11 rather more acceptable, and I
cannot see that the Minister can have any objection to it if she thinks
that the term &#147;responsible clinician&#148; satisfies the
Winterwerp <i class="I">v</i>. The Netherlands test. Our concern is only that the
measure should be legally in order and should not be challengeable
under the law of the European Court of Human Rights. If she is
confident of that, perhaps she will say that the Government will
underwrite the costs of any legal challenge if it turns out that her
definition of the responsible clinician falls foul of the European
Court of Human Rights and that all the sectioning orders are therefore
ruled null and void.</div>
					
					<a name="07050167000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07050167000466"></a>The

Gentleman would move amendment No. 60 formally if he wishes to press it
to a
Division.</div>
