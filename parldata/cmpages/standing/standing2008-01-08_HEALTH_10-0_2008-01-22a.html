							<b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): I am very flattered
that what I was saying this morning was obviously of such intense
interest and attraction that all the Labour members of the Committee
have bothered to turn up again to hear what I say. I am most grateful
to them for
coming.</div>
					<a name="08012351000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning
we were going through our amendments to clause 104 on standards of
proof, and I had just reached my final point, which dealt with some of
the oral evidence from Dr. Laurence Buckman and the British Medical
Association about defensive medicine. I explained that he had not made
the case as effectively as some of us thought he might have done, given
his justified concern that doctors would no longer be practising the
best health care for their patients, but rather the best health care
balanced with the best methods for avoiding any accusations that might
end up in a fitness to practise
hearing.</div>
					<a name="08012351000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I say
&#147;justified concern,&#148; I mean a concern that we all have to
take seriously, because anything said by the body representing doctors
about the way they may practise is something we need to note with care.
This is not a matter of contention in terms of the principle of moving
the standard of proof; it has not turned into something on which the
Committee is seeking to divide, but we owe it to the evidence we were
presented with to look at it with some
care.</div>
					<a name="08012351000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012351000513"></a>
							<b class="B">Anne
Milton</b> (Guildford) (Con): Although I recognise that the
BMA did not represent themselves terribly well during the evidence
hearings, the point about defensive medicine is important and it is a
concern. The Royal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said that the number of
junior doctors wanting to go into obstetrics has dropped to an all-time
low because of fears of litigation; in fact, one of the reasons cited
for the increase in Caesarean sections is that doctors are very nervous
about litigation.</div>
					<a name="08012351000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000514"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is right to
raise that point. It highlights the difficulty for all of
us&#151;particularly when dealing with new legislation&#151;in
understanding how much it arises because of specific items such as the
one we are considering and how much because there has been a general
move toward what is most easily defined as a compensation culture,
where some may be driven by contingency legal fees or the purposes of
the settlement value or whatever it may be. I have some grave
difficulties with that and regret that we have moved to such a state of
affairs, but there we are: the general and the specific are often very
difficult to disaggregate. We all need to be concerned if there is a
trend towards more litigation and it is having an effect on
professional
practice.</div>
					<a name="08012351000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern can range from lowering the level of risk when clinical
decisions are made to doctors prescribing otiose procedures to hedge
themselves effectively, with the NHS footing the bill all the while.
Chapter 4 of the &#147;Trust, Assurance and Safety&#148; White
Paper touched on the issue, stating:</div>
					<a name="08012351000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This argument rests on
the misapprehension that, under the criminal standard, professionals
might choose more risky, but potentially more effective, clinical
interventions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">The counter-argument is that
health professionals, with high professional standards of commitment to
their patients, would guard against that risk. Where there is
doubt,</div>
					<a name="08012351000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;health
professionals, usually working within a team of other professionals,
would generally make such decisions in consultation with their
colleagues to ensure a consensus of expert opinion and agreement. In
addition, where significant doubt or concerns remain about a procedure,
intervention or prescription, clinicians are professionally obliged to
obtain informed consent from their patients...In emergencies, such
an approach may not be possible and the judgement of the individual
clinician in such a situation will be
paramount.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulators
and panels would take that into account. It would be very helpful if
the Minister could give the Committee any further insight on the issue.
I recall the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and
Honiton this morning, so the Minister&#146;s comments may be helpful
to ensure that we do not regard the issue merely as an irritant in our
considerations, but to try and bring things to the level of reality. I
do not want to disclose the name of the doctor who wrote to me about
the defensive medicine issue, but he
said:</div>
					<a name="08012351000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
illustrate this, today I saw 30 patients in surgeries and I have made 3
referrals from this day's work (which is about average for me). That is
a referral rate of 10%. Let's say I get nervous (which I will) and, as
a conservative estimate, I start on a day like this to refer 4
patients. That is an increase to a referral rate of roughly 13%. As an
increase in my workload it is negligible. However, the hospital sector
now has 4 instead of 3 referrals, an increase of 30%. Imagine a 30%
rise in outpatient work, X-rays, scans, and blood tests across the
board, because GPs need to manage the risk that a political appointee
will find them &#145;probably&#146;
incompetent.</div>
					<a name="08012351000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">There may
be other hidden costs. We may prescribe more. Many GPs nearing
retirement age will bail out now, rather than face such a hostile
future.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>
					<a name="08012351000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That may be
the type of sentiment that the BMA was trying to reflect in evidence to
us. To be honest, I am not persuaded that view will drive the way the
system will work, but as legislators we have to take what the BMA has
presented to us seriously. We need to hear from the Minister that he
and the Government have carefully thought the matter through and how
they will make sure that moving the standard of proof does not lead to
unintended consequences&#151;although, because we are debating them,
the consequences could not possibly be said to be unintended. The
consequences would be intended because, having considered the clause,
we shall definitely want to pass it&#151;so we want to make sure that
no intended consequences lead to unfortunate
outcomes.</div>
					<a name="08012351000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
series of arguments, I propose the amendments in the group. I look
forward to what the Minister has to say, in what is after all a broadly
consensual area. However, the Committee needs to have on record a lot
more detail of what lies behind the
proposals.</div>
					<a name="08012351000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012351000515"></a>
							<b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): Most of the debate is a stand part
debate as well, so my comments are generally on the whole principle of
the change to the standard of proof from criminal to civil, rather than
specifically on the detail of the amendment. I fully understand the
concern of the doctors. However, many professional regulators already
operate to a civil standard&#151;my own profession, for example, but
many others as well.</div>
					<a name="08012351000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not particularly aware of cries of injustice over the outcomes of
determinations of fitness to practise. That is only my understanding,
but I have been told that the panels need a great degree of certainty
before coming to the decision to apply the ultimate sanction. However,
there are slight problems with some of the associated changes in the
Bill, which removed the finding of facts, separating them from the
decision as to which sanction should be applied. I want to talk about
that a little more later
on.</div>
					<a name="08012351000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">There appears to
be lack of certainty about whether some sliding scale of proof applies.
Assurances from the Minister before the Bill were that the rules would
be applied flexibly, but that does not, sadly, inspire
confidence&#151;it is not lack of confidence in the Minister, but in
the consistency of the whole process. In addition, it has to be noted
that the profession appears to be divided. The General Medical Council
will be introducing the changes anyway, whatever we decide in the Bill,
but the BMA is opposed to them. I suspect that I am not alone among
members of the Committee in receiving numerous individual
representations from doctors who feel aggrieved. To say that they feel
&#147;got at&#148; is a bit dramatic, but they think that they do a
good job and that somehow there is a small risk that, just by doing
their job, they may get something wrong one day and lose their
livelihood. I am not sure that will happen in practice but I can
understand the concern.</div>
					<a name="08012351000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">In oral evidence the BMA said
that it was up to the Government to provide an evidence base as to why
the changes should be made. I asked the BMA for evidence to support its
claim that various things would go wrong and that there would be all
sorts of consequences. I have yet to receive any evidence that is
concrete proof that the change will lead to the fears expressed by the
BMA becoming a reality.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>
					<a name="08012351000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">What causes me slight concern is
that clause 104 (4) says that the decision&#151;if the clause is
voted on and goes ahead&#151;can be amended only by primary
legislation. If it was fairly obvious that we had got it wrong,
although I do not think that will be the case, it would be helpful if
there were powers to enable us to make a quicker reversal by use of
secondary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="08012351000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
also concerns that, because of the lack of transparency over
consistency, decisions could be made that would not inspire confidence
in the procedure. The proposal for a legally qualified chair in some of
the more difficult cases will probably help to supply some of that
consistency. In the light of our debate this morning it would be
helpful if the Minister could reflect on that
point.</div>
					<a name="08012351000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns have
been raised that there is likely to be considerable additional delay
and expense. There are also concerns that there may be more legal
challenges to protect doctors&#146; interests. If that were a fair
assessment of the situation I do not think it is something to which we
would happily say
yes.</div>
					<a name="08012351000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Medical
Defence Union provided some interesting food for thought. It
claims:</div>
					<a name="08012351000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
argument that the public interest justifies a switch to a lower
standard of proof because public safety would be better safeguarded is
flawed...It cannot be in the public&#146;s, patients&#146; or
profession&#146;s interest for good doctors to be found impaired when
they are not. A lowering of the threshold of proof risks such
unfairness and will undermine confidence in the regulatory
process.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012351000516"></a>
							<b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Does the hon. Lady
agree that the other reason why the point she is making is valid is
that in essence the system will mean that the more serious the breach
by the doctor the higher the standard of proof will be? When the
patient is most at risk, the standard of proof is likely to be closest
to &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012351000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000517"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point but
I will not be sidetracked by it at the moment. One of the points raised
by the MDU is that the standard to be applied needs to be clear at the
outset of the case. We heard some oral evidence to that effect. At the
time I was not sure if I agreed. The MDU
says:</div>
					<a name="08012351000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
prosecution, defence and the FTP panel need to know the standard to be
applied at the start of the case. It is against this standard that the
evidence to be called will be assessed. However, in FTP hearings the
fact-finding stage precedes the sanction stage. In many cases the FTP
panels will not know at the outset whether the allegations, if proven,
are likely to result in suspension or erasure. How then will they know
whether they should be applying the highest civil
standard?&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000518"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The hon. Lady is wrestling with some of the
issues with which we have had to contend. It is important to get things
right because many people will study this. It is clear that we agree in
principle that the standard of proof should change from criminal to
civil, and that there will be a differential standard within civil
proceedings&#151;we had some testimony on that matter. However,
amendment No. 51 was deliberately designed to address some of her
points. It suggests that there should effectively be a criminal
procedure coupled with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>a civil standard of proof. That would mean that if, at the outset or
during the course of a hearing, it were to become clear that the
consequences were much worse than people originally feared or thought
possible, the outcome could be more draconian.</div>
					<a name="08012351000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">A criminal procedure would mean
that the prosecution, for want of a better word, would have to lay out
its case in order, as a matter of justice, so that the defence would
have sight of the case against it and time to prepare before answering
it, whether or not the defendant were put in the witness box,
which is quite a big issue. That is why we would recommend amendment
No. 51, which would overcome some of the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns
through procedure, rather than by affecting the standard of
proof.</div>
					<a name="08012351000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000519"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for clarifying the full
implications of his amendment. I have no problem with the basic
principle, but it is important to reassure the profession that people
will be heard
fairly.</div>
					<a name="08012351000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000520"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am conscious that my interventions are long,
but these are very detailed and complex legal issues. Amendment No. 51
was tabled because those who are accused of something are better
protected by the criminal procedure. A prosecution then has to lay out
its case, and it is up to the accused to decide whether they are guilty
or not guilty and, if they are the latter, whether to put themselves
under oath as part of their defence. That is different from criminal
court proceedings, and some things would have to be amended, but that
would give the professional in the dock a better ability to decide
whether they had a proper defence against the charges, rather than
being ambushed during the hearing, which would cause anxiety and also
lead to the uncertainty of not knowing the standard of proof that was
to be
satisfied.</div>
					<a name="08012351000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000521"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I was not disagreeing with the hon. Gentleman, but
merely reiterating that the confidence of the profession is very
important. It is one thing to have the confidence of the regulator, but
regulators are not always best loved by their professions because they
are sometimes regarded as policemen.</div>
					<a name="08012351000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">What would the change to the
civil standard achieve? Its purpose might be to lower the threshold for
findings of impairment of fitness to practice, thus bringing more
doctors under the FTP panels, yet the GMC itself does not believe the
change would achieve that result. A change to the civil standard would
import some disadvantages without meaningful benefit. Will the Minister
reassure us that this is not just a box that can be ticked as a result
of the Shipman inquiry, and that it will improve matters for patients
in the long run? Ultimately, that is what we ought to consider. While I
do not have a huge problem with the proposed change, I still have to be
convinced of the benefit to patients.</div>

							<b class="B">Kelvin
Hopkins</b> (Luton, North) (Lab): I recently received a
briefing note on behalf of representatives of health care workers below
the level of doctor: nurses and other staff in the health sector. For
the benefit of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>my hon. Friends, I think that it is important to put on record that they
are concerned about the aspect of the Bill relating to fitness to
practice proceedings. The Royal College of Nursing and Unison are
concerned about retaining confidence in the system. On their behalf,
may I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that a sliding standard
will be applied to all fitness to practice proceedings that will be
commensurate with the gravity of the allegation and the seriousness of
the consequences? It might be that these organisations will be seeing
the Minister privately. They might have already seen him
privately&#151;I do not know. However, I thought it was important to
put this on
record.</div>

							<a name="08012351000523"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point of
principle. We heard a significant assurance when the eminent lawyer,
Lady Justice Smith, gave oral evidence. She said that that was integral
to the current common law and, indeed, to the practice of various
tribunals that are already in existence. What is not in the Bill,
however, is any reference to the sliding scale. There is just a move
from criminal to civil. The aim of these amendments is to reflect a
gradation in the civil standard of proof that would meet the
requirements of the constituency that he is seeking to represent. I
hope that he will realise that the important point of principle is the
need to get some sense of the sliding scale reflected in the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="08012351000524"></a>Kelvin
Hopkins:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
helpful intervention. I am not specifically seeking anything in the
Bill, but I want an assurance about these matters from my hon. Friend
the Minister. I hope that my hon. Friend will take note of
representations made both in Committee and elsewhere before coming to a
view on the final wording of the Bill before it becomes
law.</div>

							<a name="08012351000525"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Ben
Bradshaw):
						</b> I congratulate the hon. Members for Romsey and
for Eddisbury on making a better job at putting forward the
BMA&#146;s case than it managed. I think that that would be the
universal view of the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012351000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
slightly confused by what the hon. Member for Romsey said. She started
by saying that her own profession used the civil standard without any
problems, and finished by asking why we were bothering to do this at
all. This was one of the main recommendations of Lady Justice Smith
that came out of the Shipman inquiry. The reason for it, however, is
that which she and even the GMC and others gave in our evidence
sessions. At the moment, because we have the extremes of either
something drastic happening, or nothing happening at all, there is a
reluctance to intervene early in a case. An example would be Shipman,
or cases in which someone&#146;s professional conduct might not be
serious enough to warrant their striking off, but when another form of
intervention and the flexibility to intervene in another way, helped by
the civil standard of proof, might prevent something much more serious
from happening. This relates to a question asked by the hon. Member for
Eddisbury about the numbers of cases that we expect the independent
adjudicator to see.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>
					<a name="08012351000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">With this
system and with the responsible officers in place locally, fewer cases
should need to go to adjudication in the end because more of them will
be nipped in the bud. As Sir Graeme Catto said in evidence, more cases
will be dealt with locally and will not have to be escalated up. This
is also about increasing public, patient and employer confidence in the
regulator&#146;s ability to tackle all types of cases, creating a
system that is consistent across all health and social care, and
setting up a framework that will encourage employers to act more
proactively when previously a practitioner who might have needed help
has evaded action by the national regulator. This was one of Dame
Janet&#146;s main recommendations. In our evidence session, she said
that it was the right thing to do
because</div>
					<a name="08012351000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we are talking
about a protective rather than criminal
jurisdiction&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Health
and Social Care Public Bill Committee, </i>8 January 2008; c. 40,
Q71.]</div>
					<a name="08012351000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The GMC is
already moving towards the civil standard of proof. Professor Sir
Graeme Catto, in his evidence to the Committee, stated that six of the
regulators had already moved to the civil standard, that it was working
well for them, and that he did not see any reason why it should not
work well for doctors. Although the BMA has managed to generate a few
letters to members of the Committee and other Members of Parliament,
Sir Graeme told me that the GMC itself had received only 50 letters
from doctors protesting about a move to the civil standard of proof.
The implication was that that was not very
many.</div>
					<a name="08012351000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right that
there is no sliding scale in the Bill. That will be a judgment call for
the panel, using the civil standard as described by Lady Justice Smith,
which can be applied flexibly and can take account of the gravity of
individual cases and how serious the outcome of proceedings might have
been for the individual. More serious matters would require a
heightened standard of proof, as is the case now. The courts recognise
that the civil standard is a flexible standard that should be applied
with greater or lesser strictness according to the seriousness of what
has to be proved and the implications of proving it.</div>
					<a name="08012351000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 50 seems to be an
attempt to clarify in the Bill that the civil standard of proof would
be applied only to the finding of facts in FTP proceedings, not other
parts of proceedings. However, we do not think that that is necessary
because the clause can apply only to the finding of facts. The standard
of proof is applied by the panel or committee when it is considering
the evidence presented before it, and the evidence relates to whether
the alleged events
occurred.</div>
					<a name="08012351000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Tiverton and Honiton asked whether guidance would be issued
to doctors to help them to get used to the new standard. We expect the
GMC to issue guidance on this. The Office of the Health Professions
Adjudicator will have a duty to make information on its functions
public, and the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence could have
a role in making sure that there is clear guidance, and we have already
asked it to look at doing so.</div>
					<a name="08012351000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Eddisbury raised the issue of consistency in applying the
civil standard. We have also asked the CHRE to look at how it can
ensure that there is consistency. Regarding appeals, individual
practitioners will be able to appeal to the High Court if they feel
that they have been unfairly treated.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div>
					<a name="08012351000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 51 and 57 would
place a new requirement on the regulators to ensure that their
procedural rules are in keeping with those used for criminal court
cases in certain circumstances. We have a problem with that because it
would completely change the way in which regulators approach their
hearings. In practice, that would mean that matters such as disclosure,
jury trial, representations as to venue for hearing, rules relating to
evidence of character and hearsay evidence would be subject to the
types of provisions that apply to the criminal
procedure.</div>
					<a name="08012351000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we accepted the amendments, regulatory bodies that have been
successfully using much simpler approaches in their FTP hearings would
find that they had to use more adversarial, time-consuming and costly
approaches with no added benefit to the individual practitioner or the
public. It is important that we emphasise that the hearing panel is
undertaking a protective role. It is not acting as a criminal court or
applying the criminal law. The purpose of the regulatory action is to
protect the public, not to punish the practitioner, and that is almost
exactly what Lady Justice Smith said in her evidence. It would
therefore be wholly inappropriate to impose the rules of criminal
proceedings on professional regulatory proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08012351000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate the hon. Member
for Eddisbury on doing a better job that the BMA of trying to make its
point about defensive medicine. I found it very difficult to appreciate
the exact point that the BMA was trying to make, but I think it was
that, under the criminal standard, professionals might choose more
risky, but potentially more effective, clinical interventions. We do
not believe that health professionals will behave in that manner as a
result of the change. We are confident that their high professional
standards and commitment to patients will guard against the risk.
However, when there is doubt, uncertainty or significant risk in making
such judgments, health professionals who usually work in a team of
other professionals would generally make such decisions in consultation
with their colleagues to ensure that there was a consensus of expert
opinion. In addition, when such circumstances exist, clinicians are
professionally obliged to ensure that they receive informed consent
from their patients. I hope that my comments have reassured the hon.
Members and that the hon. Member for Eddisbury will see fit to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08012351000526"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I listened carefully to the Minister and I am
grateful that he took us carefully through those items. I am glad to
hear that the CHRE is looking at the potential worries about the
question of fairness both between hearings and within hearings, where
there might be different applications of different standards by
different chairmen. The debate on clause 93 about the potential for a
legally qualified chair of the panel could be important. The Minister
has undertaken several times to go away and think that through, and we
will possibly revisit it on Report. I would welcome that, and the need
for it is reinforced by what we have just heard. There is an
expectation that there will be fewer fitness to practise hearings, and
if the chairs were legally qualified I suspect that the hearings would
rattle on nicely and be unlikely to be lengthier.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>
					<a name="08012351000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise a point that the
Minister did not touch on, as I think it is vital. It was also brought
up Lady Justice Smith. For the chairmen&#151;legally qualified or
not&#151;to work well, particularly given the approach that he is
taking on procedure, training will be key. If training is seen as a
priority, and that is vital, I will be
happy.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000527"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I apologise for omitting to respond to that. I
can reassure the hon. Gentleman that we have requested advice from the
CHRE on how to make the transition to the civil standard as
smooth as possible, including the need for training and any other needs
of panel members. We have also asked for advice on changes in the
procedural process and the administrative arrangements, and on how
best, in the council&#146;s opinion and that of individual regulatory
bodies, any difficulties in the areas that he has mentioned can be
overcome.</div>
					<a name="08012351000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000528"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful for that. It is helpful. I noted
that the Minister was not keen to adopt the criminal style of
procedure, notwithstanding application of the civil standard of proof,
to give better potential protection to professionals who find
themselves under scrutiny. However, I will not press that
point.</div>
					<a name="08012351000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that as a result of the debate the Minister and his officials will
reflect that it was not a question of tilting towards&#151;although I
fully understand the phrase&#151;making sure that we are focused on
protecting the public and therefore not seeking to punish the
practitioner. I practised at civil courts and in arbitrations for some
years. The point about the criminal process as opposed to the civil
standard process is that there is always the hope that during
cross-examination, despite the rules of discovery, one will end up with
a wonderful nugget of a time bomb or an ambush in order to achieve
success of the law. The whole point about the criminal procedure is
that it is up to the prosecution to lay out its case so that the
defendant can make sure that he is fully aware of what is against him
and can prepare to make the best defence
available.</div>
					<a name="08012351000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
protection of the practitioner&#151;in fact, the whole process that
we are discussing&#151;is secondary to protecting the public. That is
consistent with what Lady Justice Smith was absolutely determined to do
as a result of her reports on the Shipman inquiry. To make sure that we
hold on to her priority, it is right that we enable a sense of fairness
and justice in the process with the profession. That is the best answer
to the BMA&#146;s issues about defensive medicine. While I am
grateful for the Minister&#146;s flattery about making the case, I
was as unpersuaded as he was about that particular risk. He also read
out what I had cited as good reasons for not accepting that evidence.
The BMA raising the issue on behalf of practitioners made it incumbent
on us to look at the matter seriously, which we have done. On the basis
of our discussion, it is wholly appropriate to beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>

&#147;Protect&#148; is a stronger word and conveys what we want the
CHRE to do. We also want to make more definite and specific the role of
the CHRE in its operations. The proposed wording would be a significant
improvement and I hope that it will be accepted. The word should
clearly be &#147;protect&#148;, for the CHRE is the overarching
body charged with being
the</div>

					<a name="08012351000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulators,
such as the GMC, have had public protection as part of their remit, and
that should not be weakened in the CHRE by merely
requiring it to promote the health, safety and well-being
of the patients. We should be strengthening patient protection.
I hope that my hon. Friend will look again at the wording of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="08012351000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
generally, the Minister will be aware that ever since the community
health councils were abolished Labour Members have been concerned about
the strength of protection for patients and of patient representation,
and about the opportunities for patients to seek redress in their
problems with the health care sector. I am still concerned that we do
not have strong enough protection and representation for patients. I
want the shop-front approach to patient representation that was
provided in my community by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>the community health council. Ordinary people&#151;not necessarily
skilled or articulate&#151;could go and talk to someone who was
sympathetic about their problems. The patient advice and liaison
service inside hospitals has to some extent compensated for that, but
it is not the same as the community health councils. We need stronger
representation.</div>
					<a name="08012351000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
wording would reassure me and others, such as my hon. Friend
the Member for North-West Leicestershire, who are concerned. He spoke
at length on Second Reading and made the points more effectively and
strongly than I can. I agreed with his speech, which I have since read.
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will think seriously about

							<a name="08012351000532"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> The Liberal Democrats have tabled amendment No.
127, which has a broadly similar aim to amendment No. 249. The
definition for the main objectives of the CHRE as it stands says that
the council is</div>
					<a name="08012351000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
promote the health, safety and well-being of patients and other members

					<a name="08012351000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Health
promotion is laudable, but it is not the same as protection. There is a
need for consistency between the objectives of the CHRE and those of
the regulators. The Bill as drafted does not replicate the precise
wording of the objectives set for regulators, which recently amended
legislation describes as to &#147;protect, promote and
maintain&#148; the health, safety and well-being of members of the
public and patients. Our fairly simple amendment would bring those

conflicts and everybody is clear about what the duty

							<a name="08012351000533"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> On this occasion I also have to disappoint the
hon. Lady. I have looked carefully at the amendments, and pay tribute
to the hon. Members for Luton, North and for North-West Leicestershire
for their wonderful support when we had the great campaign on community
health councils, with which I was particularly involved.</div>
					<a name="08012351000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have difficulty with the
amendment, but not because I do not agree with the sentiment or the
ambition behind it. I note that the next group of amendments covers
whether the CHRE should have more teeth in its investigative powers,
but it strikes me that &#147;promote&#148; is more relevant to the
purpose for which the CHRE is designed&#151;in other words, advocacy
rather than protection. The intention is not for it to be the ultimate
regulator with teeth. While we have this current design of the CHRE,
&#147;promote&#148; probably accords with the advocacy role more
precisely.</div>
					<a name="08012351000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
wholly appropriate and proper debate for hon. Members to advance,
because we still have an outstanding issue about patient and public
involvement and about having sufficient independence to move from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>pure advocacy to a hand-holding job, particularly for the vulnerable,
that helps them to chart their way through a difficult NHS access or
complaints procedure. Those vulnerable people often continue to have
the greatest need of that. They are therefore reluctant to get offside
of the very body about which they have concerns.</div>
					<a name="08012351000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps there is another debate
to be had about whether we should be looking to get something more
independent&#151;the CHCs&#151;back in the frame. That is for

						</b> The Government agree that the council needs to
be an authoritative, independent voice for patients and members of the
public on the regulation of professionals. We made that clear in the
White Paper &#147;Trust, Assurance and Safety&#148;. We believe
this new objective achieves the intention set out in the White Paper.
The Bill gives the CHRE a new main objective that underlines the
exercise of its duties with the interests of both patients and the
wider public in clauses 1 and 5. This will allow it to act as the
independent voice for the patient and the public on health care
professional regulatory issues. The CHRE&#146;s new board structure
will be mainly lay with no regulatory body representatives, as is the
case currently, and the CHRE will have a new duty to inform and consult
the public about the exercise of its functions</div>
					<a name="08012351000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 105 inserts the new main

					<a name="08012351000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North would extend and
change the council&#146;s new main objective from promoting to
protecting. Amendment No. 249 also specifies that the council&#146;s
function should be undertaken by encouraging consultation between the
regulators and other regulatory agencies, and would confer a new power
on the Secretary of State to define in regulations such bodies as the
council should be required to consult and/or to cooperate
with.</div>
					<a name="08012351000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
are not necessary. The council is already required to promote the
health, safety and well-being of patients and other members of the
public. That duty already encompasses protection of the public. I would
emphasise that, in fact, the use of the term &#147;promote&#148;
rather than &#147;protect&#148; confers a wider duty on the
council. The term &#147;protect&#148; might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>also imply direct contact with patients and the public, which might
misrepresent the function of the council, which, as the hon. Member for
Eddisbury rightly said, is an advisory rather than regulatory body. We

than a regulatory one, that would not be appropriate. In view of that,

There was some suggestion that the wording was an oversight, and it is
interesting that he has said there was at least some discussion about
the alternative wording. I hope the spirit of the amendments will

							<a name="08012351000537"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> In many ways, it is amendment (a) that I need to
address, as that is our amendment to Government new clause 6, which the
Minister will no doubt give his reasons for in a second. The new clause
amends the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions
Act 2002, and relates to the investigative powers of the CHRE. The
White Paper &#147;Trust, Assurance and Safety&#148; specifies that
the Government will ask the CHRE to review a sample of cases. The
Government&#146;s new clause could be interpreted as giving the CHRE
a power to investigate individual cases, which is not consistent with
the general purpose of audit. The amendment to new clause 6 would
therefore remove any confusion about how this audit would be
conducted.</div>
					<a name="08012351000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
real concern that, as it stands, the drafting of the legislation could
give rise to confusion about the purpose of a power given to the CHRE.
The powers would allow the CHRE to look at individual cases as a
quasi-appeals process, rather than for the purposes of identifying
suggested improvements in performance. Patently, if one looks at
individual cases&#151;from which, it may be claimed, lessons might be
learned&#151;rather than at a sample of cases, the danger is that it
could become a quasi-appeals process and start to be hijacked,
particularly by some eagle-eyed lawyers who, no doubt, will pore over
all this. Of particular concern is that it could also cause confusion
with CHRE&#146;s current powers, but not when OHPA is set up to
appeal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>against decisions by the fitness to practise panels of each regulatory
body. We need to look at both the transitional arrangements and that
potential overlap. There will, of course, be ongoing cases, and we need
to be very careful that we do not end up with parallel tracks, at least
for a period of time, operating under different systems. One could only
imagine the number of challenges there might be to that
process.</div>
					<a name="08012351000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
the further question of independence. CHRE is an organisation that is
directly accountable to the Secretary of State, and it would be better
if any appearance of political pressure for CHRE to look at individual
cases were removed. That is a fairly comprehensive justification for
the amendment, which would clear up hon. Members&#146;
concerns.</div>
					<a name="08012351000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will outline why the CHRE is limited to health
care only. We touched on this, but it remains unresolved. Its role is
not to oversee social care regulators. There is no independent
oversight of the four social care councils, whereas the nine regulators
of health professions are scrutinised by the CHRE. The social care
councils regulate 110,000 registrants and there are more than 2.3
million service users in the UK. Each council has its own plans for
phasing in new additions to their registers in the coming years, which
on their estimates could total over 250,000 new workers. Health and
social care work is an increasingly integrated process. Patients and
service users should be confident in shared standards of behaviour and
procedures when things go wrong.</div>
					<a name="08012351000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000538"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I wanted to raise a few general stand part
comments, which are similar to those raised by the hon. Gentleman. The
clause officially changes the name of the Council for the Regulation of
Health Care Professionals to the Council for Healthcare Regulatory
Excellence, although in practice it has had the latter name for some
time. Currently, it promotes best practice and consistency of
regulation among nine bodies representing medical professions:
chiropractors, dentists, doctors, opticians and related people,
osteopaths and the Health Professions Council, which encompasses a
range of professionals, nurses, midwives and pharmacists.</div>
					<a name="08012351000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim
elsewhere in the Bill is to join up health and social care inspection,
but it seems that that has been missed in this part. What is lacking is
any kind of joined-up thinking between the regulation of health
professionals and regulation of social care professionals. It makes
sense, therefore, at some stage, to bring the General Social Care
Council for England and the related devolved bodies under the
umbrella.</div>
					<a name="08012351000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought
that rather than try to move an amendment at this stage, as all the
others have failed, it would be useful to introduce the principle as
part of the stand part debate. I hope that the Minister will
acknowledge that this is a very good idea, because it cannot be right
that a nurse in a nursing home and a social care worker in the same
environment are regulated by two bodies which may not be united in the
way they oversee their respective professions and understand best
practice.</div>
					<a name="08012351000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I admit
that, when I met the CHRE, I questioned whether it had given any
thought to this matter. It said that it had not. It later got back to
me saying that it had spoken to a few people in the social care
environment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>and the feedback had been positive. If the Minister thinks that this is
a good idea, perhaps he will consider tabling an amendment on Report,
which we may be minded to
support.</div>
					<a name="08012351000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000539"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> New clause 6 amends section 26(3) of the 2002
Act to clarify that the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence
can investigate individual cases solely for the purpose of providing
general reports on the performance of regulatory bodies. Amendment No.
122 is a necessary consequential amendment, because the new clause has
a UK
extent.</div>
					<a name="08012351000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause does not confer any additional functions on the council, but
means that we will avoid possible disputes about whether the council
has the power to consider individual cases when making investigations
and reporting on the performance of statutory functions of regulatory
bodies. Amendment (a) to new clause 6 would replace the words
&#147;investigating particular cases&#148; in proposed new section
26(4)(c) of the 2002 Act with the
words:</div>
					<a name="08012351000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reviewing cases
for the purposes of
audit&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012351000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention in the amendment is
the same as ours&#151;to avoid extending the competences of the new
body. However, we are concerned about the word &#147;review&#148;,
because a review is usually associated with the ability of an
organisation to reconsider the evidence and facts of a case with a view
to confirming, amending or overturning a decision. New clause 6 has the
same intention, and will make it clear that we are not giving
additional functions to the council that would provide it with the
power to overturn decisions, to re-examine evidence in individual cases
or to reconsider the original decision. Indeed, such a power would be
inconsistent with the general functions and purpose of the
council.</div>
					<a name="08012351000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Romsey asked why we are not extending the remit of the
CHRE to social care workers. I am advised that that was carefully
considered during the Bill&#146;s early stages. However, because
social care workers are not generally regarded as health professionals,
the regulation of whom is the subject of this discussion, the view was
taken that the remit of the CHRE should not be so extended. However, I
shall ask for more information on that and maybe write to her about
it.</div>

							<a name="08012351000540"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am conscious that this is a clause stand part
debate, but we are also talking about amendment (a). I am equally
concerned that &#147;review&#148; carries some of those
implications mentioned by the Minister&#151;perhaps that is my legal
training coming back to haunt me. I am more than happy, therefore, not
to press amendment (a) to a Division. However, I also think that
&#147;investigating&#148; implies that there will be an outcome to
an investigation. It might be worth reconsidering that in order to
determine whether more felicitous language could be used to achieve
what we both
want.</div>

						</b> The amendments deal with the membership and
composition of the CHRE, and would, among other things, increase the
number of Scottish members from one to two and the number of English
members from three to seven, and cut the number of CHRE executive
members from two to one. If the overriding objective is a UK-wide
approach to professional health care regulation, we need to acknowledge
the need to continue and strengthen the relationship with Scotland,
something that I suggest is politically important at the
moment&#151;I do not think that any Scottish Members are present
today, but I hope that if there were they would support what I am
saying&#151;by having a more Scotland-specific view. Other UK-wide
bodies, such as the Food Standards Agency, have two non-executives from
Scotland, so why not the
CHRE?</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08012351000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
increasing fragmentation of health care across England, and CHRE needs
to be able to reflect that in its composition, diversity and size. The
extra English members will also provide reassurance that the CHRE
council has the capacity to reflect a range of experience and expertise
to span existing and additional functions indicated in the Bill. The
CHRE&#146;s senior executives already prepare council papers, attend,
contribute and sit alongside council members and have considerable
opportunity to influence CHRE decision making before, during and after
council meetings. It would be more appropriate, and in keeping with the
spirit of the White Paper, to focus on strengthening the CHRE&#146;s
lay membership. Our amendments are designed to achieve that through
increasing English and Scottish membership, and therefore the
council&#146;s capacity to be, in the words of the White Paper, a

							<a name="08012351000544"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I think that what the hon. Member for Luton,
North is trying to achieve is not dissimilar to what we want to
achieve. The power of appointment is always a difficult area, because
at this stage it can look rather benign, but it can in practice prove
very influential and representative.</div>
					<a name="08012351000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment. No. 52 would limit the Secretary of State to appointing one
non-executive member in line with one from Scotland and one from Wales.
Amendment No. 53 is consequent on that, giving the Appointments
Commission the power to appoint the other two. The question that the
provisions pose to a Government who purport to believe in devolution is
why the devolved Administrations are in this context subordinate to the
Secretary of State. Our amendments Nos. 52 and 53 are intended to
obtain equality, in effect, between the Secretary of State and his
counterparts in the devolved Administrations, notwithstanding the fact
that, to go by the Secretary of State&#146;s response when challenged
on Second Reading, all appointments are likely to be devolved to the
Appointments Commission in any event. I seek some guidance about
representative capacity.</div>
					<a name="08012351000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 163 would leave
on the CHRE some representative of the regulators. While in my view,
currently, the council of 19 members, with every regulator represented,
might be unwieldy, surely it is not right that their voice should be
completely silenced, which is why the amendment would preserve
it.</div>
					<a name="08012351000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000545"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The reason we are reforming the Council for
Healthcare Regulatory Excellence is to ensure that it fits with the new
regulatory landscape, including shifting its role from being the sum of
the existing regulators to being the independent voice of the patient.
Part of the change, we believe, merits reducing the size of the council
from the rather large membership of 19 to nine&#151;seven
non-executive and two executive. That is consistent with the
Government&#146;s general approach in trying to make the professional
regulatory bodies more board-like and strategic.</div>
					<a name="08012351000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would significantly increase the size of the council,
bringing it back up from nine to 16, and would alter its make-up by
adding a non-executive member representing the regulatory bodies.
Amendment No. 53 specifically would add two further non-executives
appointed by the Appointments Commission alone. As I have said, it is
already our intention for the Secretary of State to arrange for his
appointments functions to be exercised by the Appointments Commission
anyway, which I hope renders the amendment unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08012351000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
particularly concerned about amendment No. 163, because of the point
that I have just made. I am not clear whether the regulatory bodies
would collectively nominate the member. The important point to note,
however, is that the function of the council is changing, so that the
CHRE can promote the interests of patients and members of the public in
relation to the performance of regulatory bodies and be an
authoritative independent voice on the regulation of professionals. It
is not appropriate for regulatory bodies themselves to delegate or to
send a representative to the body that regulates the
professions.</div>
					<a name="08012351000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
point about Scotland, I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend the
Member for Luton, North. The change has already been agreed, and the
Scottish Parliament has agreed to legislate a consent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>motion for the Bill. It is therefore content with the level of Scottish
representation. I was trying to find out about the size of the FSA
board and whether there are similar plans to downsize it, but I have
not managed to do so in the time available. If I can find that out
offline, I will let my hon. Friend know.</div>
					<a name="08012351000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 252 would
decrease the number of executive members to just one. That would not be
consistent with usual practice among other arm&#146;s length bodies
sponsored by my Department and others. For example, it is common
practice for regulatory bodies to include their finance director on the
board or council, and it obviously makes sense to allow the CHRE to
follow that example if it so
wishes.</div>
					<a name="08012351000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light

importance of having diverse representation on all health bodies,

people from minorities to be genuinely represented. I will not press my
amendments to a vote, but I hope that my hon. Friend will seek to

					<a name="08012351000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to remove the Secretary of State&#146;s power to direct the
CHRE. The council is another of those so-called independent bodies in
the Bill whose governance leads inexorably back to the Secretary of
State. In response to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for
Tiverton and Honiton during the evidence sessions, Lady Justice Smith
said that,</div>
					<a name="08012351000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is
important, particularly in the health sphere, that the adjudicatory
body should be seen to be independent of Government because the
Government are a huge customer of healthcare; the biggest customer of
healthcare. Therefore, it is important that there should be no
suspicion that the Government are in a position to pull strings behind
the scenes, as to what goes on. Absolute clarity and absolute
independence are really important. <i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report,

just to the CHRE but to the Healthcare Commission, there is no
intention to fetter the body&#146;s freedom. The reason for this
power is to ensure that, where necessary, a Secretary of State can ask
the council to prioritise certain areas of its work load over others:
for example, in cases in which there is particular public concern about
a certain regulatory issue, or in which the expert input of the council
is required in a particular Department of Health project. The powers
could also be used to require the council to consult specific bodies,
including the public, in undertaking its duty to inform and consult,
which we discussed earlier. I hope that in the light of that

Hopkins:
						</b> The amendments seek to strengthen clause 108 by
inserting in subsection (4) the word &#147;consult&#148; instead of
&#147;seek the views of&#148;. It seems strange that the word
&#147;consult&#148; is included in the clause heading and is then
softened further down to &#147;seek the views of&#148;. The process
of seeking views is less active, less mutual and weaker than the
process of consulting. Consulting is a two-way process; &#147;seeking
the views of&#148; is a one-way process. I, therefore, ask my hon.
Friend the Minister to consider seriously this
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012351000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
component of my amendments would give more powers to my hon. Friend, or
the Secretary of State, to specify other organisations that might be
consulted. Proposed subsection (4)(c) would give the Secretary of
State&#151;in addition to the council&#151;powers to specify other
bodies that might represent patients and the public. It seems to me
that giving extra powers to the Secretary of State might appeal to my
hon. Friend, and I hope that he accepts the amendments. The firming up
of the clause would be welcomed by those who are concerned about public
and patient representation in health.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000560"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As my hon. Friend has rightly pointed out, the
CHRE will have a new duty to inform and consult the public about the
exercise of its functions in the clause. That comes on top of the new
main objective that we have already discussed about aligning the
exercise of its duties with the interests of both patients and the
wider public, and the improvement in the new board structure, which
will be mainly lay with no regulatory body representatives. His
amendment, however, would tie the CHRE&#146;s hands as to how it
consults. The view of the council&#146;s current chief executive,
which we share, is that such formal consultation as my hon. Friend
refers to may not always be the most appropriate way to take soundings
from
people.</div>
				
					<a name="08012351000482"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012351000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
my hon. Friend will know from his own experience that formal
consultation with particular groups can be dominated by what one might
unkindly call groups of self-selecting busybodies, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>rather than reflect a true sense of public feeling in a particular area.
The council&#146;s chief executive thinks that it may need the
flexibility to use a quorum, academic studies, focus groups and other
means of engaging with patients, the public and stakeholders, depending
on the gravity and complexity of the issue at hand, as well as
traditional formal consultations. It would not be helpful to tie the
council to the
latter.</div>
					<a name="08012351000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the CHRE will be capable of making the right decisions about how
to consult on particular issues, but as my hon. Friend has probably
noticed, it will be possible use the new Secretary of State power to
issue directions to the council on the manner in which it must exercise
its functions. We have that safeguard if we feel that it is not
consulting properly. As we discussed earlier, the council also has the
obligation to promote best practice and good regulation, which will
include good
consultation.</div>

							<a name="08012351000561"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> As the Minister has seen, I did not participate
in the debate on the amendments, but he has just prayed in aid the fact
that he could use the Secretary of State&#146;s reserved power to
direct. That is what causes us some concern about independence. There
is tension in the Bill between seeking to protect by having a power of
direction and convincing many of us that there will be sufficient
independence.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000562"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> We think it a sensible balance, which will meet
the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend that the body might not
consult adequately. It will provide a way for hon. Members to express
their concerns, so we think that it is a sensible power to keep. We do
not expect to have to use
it.</div>
					<a name="08012351000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment No. 258, paragraph 16 of schedule 7
to the 2002 Act already requires the council
to</div>
					<a name="08012351000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prepare a report on
the exercise of its functions during each financial
year&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08012351000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
we do not think the amendment on that matter is necessary. The report

details about how it has undertaken its duty to consult and inform the
public.</div>
					<a name="08012351000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
amendments in the group are well intentioned, they are not strictly
necessary. They are more prescriptive than the proposals in the Bill
and would not enable anything that is not already possible given the
council&#146;s existing powers. In that light, I urge my hon. Friend
to withdraw the

a difference, and I know from my experience of dealing with health
bodies in my constituency and local area that some health
officials&#151;I shall not name names&#151;are less than
enthusiastic about consulting the public. They will receive a letter
and say, &#147;Thank you very much&#148;, but when it comes to
consultation they are less enthusiastic. Sometimes we want to get our
point across; we have an active patient and public involvement forum,
with a redoubtable chairperson who would undoubtedly be considered a
busybody by the health authority but is a fine representative of my
constituents and a personal friend of mine.</div>

						</b> This is a probing amendment. Clause 109 amends
section 29 of the Health Care Professions Act 2002, extending section
29 of the Act to enable the CHRE to refer to the High Court cases
relating to impairment of fitness to practise on grounds of ill health.
That is in addition to its existing powers to  refer cases
relating to misconduct and professional
competence.</div>
					<a name="08012351000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled
the amendment because of concerns relating to the fact that, currently,
health cases are generally private proceedings. I have concerns about
sensitive details on an individual&#146;s health eventually being
made public in ways that might not be helpful to that individual. My
concerns might be covered by clause 98(4)(d), but I am still not sure
whether that is the case, despite some discussion about it this
morning.</div>
					<a name="08012351000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hesitated
slightly about drafting the amendment in this way, as I did not want to
create a loophole whereby an individual who realised that they had done
wrong could somehow try to present a case as a health case. An argument
might be made for something to be heard by a health committee rather
than a disciplinary committee. I was not sure how that might work in
practice. Clearly, if that was a consequence of my amendment, it would
be problematic, because we are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>trying to achieve greater openness about misdoings generally and it
would be contrary to that
spirit.</div>
					<a name="08012351000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
would be helpful if the Minister could explain why it was thought
necessary to widen the scope of CHRE referrals. Has he any examples of
where the system has failed? Bearing in mind that the cases referred
are those the CHRE believes too lenient, does he not have concerns that
if the CHRE has got it wrong the personal details of people on whom a
judgment has been made may be subjected to greater public view than
necessary? Can the Minister clarify how many cases have been referred
to the High Court to date by the CHRE and what proportion of them have
been judged by the Court to be too lenient&#151;in other words, where
it has upheld the concerns of the CHRE to a certain
extent?</div>

							<a name="08012351000569"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I cannot give the hon. Lady the figures that she
asks for but I shall endeavour to find them and let her have them.
However, she accepts in her comments that there may be circumstances in
which the physical or mental health of a health care practitioner may
impact on their conduct or ability, and consequently have implications
for the safety of their patients or the wider public. We believe
therefore that the health committees of regulatory bodies have a role
in ensuring patient and public safety in the same way as conduct and
competence committees, because patient safety must be the
priority.</div>
					<a name="08012351000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
fully support the need to handle cases of ill health with sensitivity,
as we discussed when we covered hearings in private. The need for
better support and rehabilitation for professionals struggling with
health problems was recognised in our White Paper, but whatever the
cause of poor performance, patient safety must come first, and we are
clear that professionals who pose a risk to patient safety must be
identified and dealt with appropriately but
sensitively.</div>

							<a name="08012351000570"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I am still not entirely clear about the
circumstances in which private details, such as mental health details,
will be kept private. All the professions will be interested in greater
clarity about how the provision will work in practice, because we are
talking about somebody&#146;s potential livelihood, and about
cases  in which people might get better. Mental health 
problems are rarely understood and are often viewed unsympathetically
by those without expertise, and I do not want to be party to
legislation that has the potential to lay details of somebody&#146;s
mental health problems open for all to see. At a later date, the person
might fully recover, but that knowledge of their problem might prevent
them from obtaining employment. I understand that it is a stigma
problem, but it is essential that we get the balance right. However, I

with bated breath to reach this crucial aspect of the Bill. Amendment
No. 54 would ensure that the responsible officers were clinically
qualified professionals&#151;to be determined by regulations.
Responsible officers should be medical professionals rather than health
care managers or management consultants, for example. Doctors have also

PCT medical directors are also the responsible officers, it will give
them too much power over individual doctors, and they will have the
power both to discipline and to sack the doctors on their patch. PCT
medical directors are already busy, and they have many priorities. In
her oral evidence, Lady Justice Smith said:</div>
					<a name="08012351000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am really unhappy
about that for several reasons...I do not like the idea of a

that that is too
much&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012351000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her desire for

					<a name="08012351000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of the responsible
officer could cause serious conflicts of interest. Suppose that a local
doctor prescribes an essential cancer drug for a patient, which puts
strain on the PCT&#146;s budget, and he suddenly finds himself at the
wrong end of an inquiry by the local GMC affiliate medical director.
How would the GP know that the inquiry was genuine rather than
contrived? How would the GMC affiliate medical director know that his
regulatory decisions were not being influenced by pressure from the PCT
chief executive? Lady Justice Smith noted the reverse situation. She
said:</div>

Browning:
						</b> We discussed that matter when we took oral
evidence and it is important to get the clause right. Within certain
disciplines, particularly in hospitals, there are often shortages of
doctors. Because of the need to meet targets and keep patient
throughput, the medical director who undertakes revalidation is going
to be in a difficult position. He must do his job as required by the
primary care trust, or according to the Government&#146;s
requirements sent from on high, and, at the same time, he must be
responsible for revalidation. One could see all sorts of tension
arising in such a situation. I am talking narrowly about doctors in a
narrow sense, but there are many different types. The Government need
to get the measure right, so that the pressure I described does not end
up on medical directors. Their role should be clearly defined and the
problem I described, which was clearly identified in the oral evidence,
should be resolved in the Bill.</div>

							<a name="08012351000575"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I saw the Minister nodding when my hon. Friend
talked about getting it right, so, in that sense, we are at one. My
hon. Friend highlighted the fact that every system in the world and
every law that we pass here deals with human motivation and is
man-made&#151;nothing comes down from on high. However professional,
experienced, responsible or extraordinarily intelligent the people we
are talking about are, we cannot escape the fact that people are
influenced by motivational factors.</div>
					<a name="08012351000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only way
to address my hon. Friend&#146;s point is to take an extreme
case&#151;it is absolutely germane to what I am saying. We might find
such an event inconceivable, but, tendentiously, we live under a regime
of top-down targets rather than the bottom-up approach that we keep
urging the Minister to adopt. Targets drive the performance criteria
and measurements. However, anyone in any walk of life who is involved
in management knows that what one measures is what one gets. If
measures and targets are put in place, and if, as in so many cases,
they have year-end performance bonuses and money attached, and if one
is desperately hoping that by achieving those targets, one will have a
sufficient bonus that means that one can at last put the new kitchen in
place, one would have a motivation to aim for the targets. That is what
targets are for. However, if that motivation runs counter to the
shortage of doctors in hospitals, for instance, we end up with a
tension. The latter situation might lead to a target being missed and a
bonus not being paid. Whatever explanations may be given or whatever
exceptional circumstances might be pleaded at the time that that is
negotiated, on a human resources department basis, it is insufficiently
clear in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012351000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend pointed out this issue in her very timely intervention, and
in reply I referred to an extreme circumstance, which I obviously do
not believe would or should happen. None the less, in doing so I have
rather put it on the record that it is not completely beyond the realms
of possibility. That highlights the issue that we are trying to address
here. I accept that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>the Minister is trying to push this issue forward, so that we get it
right. However, it is only right that we understand the tension that we
are up against.</div>
					<a name="08012351000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
probably as well to remind ourselves that  Dr. Meldrum of the
British Medical Association
said:</div>
					<a name="08012351000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It comes
back to the whole business of having confidence. We are aware of
people&#151;medical directors in trusts, or whoever&#151;whose
loyalties have been primarily to their trust. We are not saying that
their loyalties should be to the profession, but they should be to the
wider benefits of health care. It is about achieving that balance by a
degree of separation of function and a degree of separation of
loyalties from the employer, and having an effective and practical
operation. That is quite difficult; I accept
that.&#148;&#151;<i class="I">[Official Report, Health and Social Care Public

					<a name="08012351000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Primary Care
Trust medical directors are employees of PCTS, so their impartiality in
the regulatory management of local doctors cannot be guaranteed; it is
very much of a piece, this. The responsible officer should be
completely independent of the local PCT. That way, he or she is more
likely to command the trust of local doctors, which, in my view, is an
absolutely essential element of making this process work well and
ultimately making the scheme more successful. I hope that the Minister
will take the opportunity to confirm whether the medical directors will
be, or are likely to be, the responsible officers, and also whether
they will be the GMC affiliates.</div>
					<a name="08012351000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">During his oral evidence

said:</div>
					<a name="08012351000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
not making a specific ruling as to who it should be, just as to what

					<a name="08012351000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that we would all
sign up to that. He
continued:</div>
					<a name="08012351000456"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
was much discussion on Tuesday as to whether it should be a medical
director, and that would be perfectly appropriate. In fact, a lot of
the good medical directors are, in practice, already doing this job on
the ground. Yet we are not saying that it has to be a medical
director.&#148; <i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and

					<a name="08012351000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, I hope that the
Minister will take this opportunity to clarify that his statement means
that there will be true freedom at a local level to choose not to have
the medical director as the responsible officer and that the PCTS will
not be encouraged, or even coerced, either by policy or funding issues,
to merge the two roles.</div>
					<a name="08012351000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is that funding issue that
really needs to be thought through, so that there are no perverse
incentives, or indeed target-driven issues, that then drive behaviour,

extreme example that I gave, by way of argument, is highly unlikely to
happen in practice; I would like to believe, anyway, that it is
unlikely to happen.</div>

think at the time that that was an adequate response and I hope that
the Minister will take the chance now to flesh out what he thinks will
actually be the case.</div>
					<a name="08012351000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only will this measure
impact on how PCTs will choose to interpret the responsible officer
role, but it goes no way to addressing the concerns about training. I
accept that the Minister gave me a positive response when I raised the
issue of training before, so I hope that I can be optimistic about the
way that he tackles the issue in this context.</div>
					<a name="08012351000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I raised the issue of training
when the Minister was giving his oral evidence. I should be grateful if
he would tell the Committee, first, who will be funding that training;

					<a name="08012351000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, during the GMC&#146;s
evidence, the Committee also touched on the issue of soft information
sharing. I do not want us to get into all the jargon that surrounds
data sharing, but I suspect that this matter will be debated by others
at a later stage. I think that the Liberal Democrats have tabled an
amendment to clause 112.</div>
					<a name="08012351000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there are concerns
that if the responsible officers, without the employee&#146;s
knowledge, share information that is unproven, in the sense that there
has been no investigation, or damaging, in the sense that it might
affect an employee&#146;s reputation, that could be the basis of a
claim that the employer had breached an implied term of trust and
confidence in their contract. Those points often lead to the most
contentious and litigious issues, so it is advisable that they should
be avoided if possible. If we can design measures to avoid them at this
stage, we will have done our job
better.</div>

							<a name="08012351000576"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> The establishment of responsible officers at local
level is an attempt to have greater local resolution of problems, and
we generally support that broad aim. However, I concur with many of the
reservations highlighted by the hon. Member for Eddisbury. I do not
want to repeat too much of what he said, but even as he was talking,
more questions were being asked in my mind. For example, it is all very
well having a responsible officer who might be a medical director or a
director of PCT, but a portion of the work force might do local work or
work across PCTs, and I am not entirely clear who will be the
responsible officer in that case.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>
					<a name="08012351000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a problem is highlighted in
an area, will the responsible officer deal with it, or will an
individual living in a certain area have to have an overall responsible
officer. I ask that because I am aware that the responsible officers
for some of the GPs in my constituency would be in the primary care
trust, but a small number work a couple of sessions at the local
hospital in specialisms where there is a demand. If there is a problem
in the hospital, will they have to answer to the responsible officer in
the hospital, as it is not clear what will happen in those cases or how
those people will join up the thinking if there are concerns about an
individual?</div>
					<a name="08012351000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
also a problem with responsible officers having powers to put recorded
concerns on a doctor&#146;s record. Those concerns need to be
substantiated in some way to avoid personal vindictiveness&#151;let
us not pretend that it does not happen&#151;and so that there is a
right of challenge by the individual, because a doctor could almost be
held to ransom by the threat of having something put on the
record.</div>
					<a name="08012351000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">There can be
disagreements about the way of practising, and I can think of a local
case where there was a big disagreement between a consultant and a
couple of other consultants concerning procedures that he was using. It
was difficult to say who was right and who was wrong. One consultant
was convinced that he was right and had good evidence to prove his
practice was appropriate, and the other felt that the behaviour of
consultant A was irresponsible. I do not want to go into too much
detail on that, but in such cases it is not clear who provides the
ultimate sanction. One of the problems in that case was closely
associated with the medical director, so where is the right to go
elsewhere if someone is
unhappy?</div>

					<a name="08012351000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
training, it is highly likely that a responsible officer could
recommend that an individual whose practice, although not dangerous,
was thought to be of concern and was in need of certain training if a
few alarm bells had been sounded. We all know what happened to training
budgets last year. Within a primary care trust, would there be tension
between the financial pressures? Would a responsible officer in a
senior position feel that he had a duty to balance that in some
way?</div>

Milton:
						</b> I reiterate my interest in that my husband is a
medical director and, arguably, a responsible officer&#151;before
their invention. The hon. Lady has highlighted the crux of the problem,
which is the tension between competency&#151;that is what the
responsible officer will be looking at&#151;financial pressures and
the resources available. During the evidence session we did not hear
from the Minister how he intends to resolve that. Does the hon. Lady
agree that, until we can take the step of employing responsible
officers, that does need to be
resolved?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000578"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> The hon. Lady has hit the nail on the head, which
is why I am posing some questions here and now. I am not sure how this
will all be resolved in practice. Bearing in mind that where doctors go
other professions are likely to follow&#151;with different employment
models&#151;my overriding concern is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>potential blurring between employment and regulation functions. I was
quite surprised when I heard Lady Justice Smith say that responsible
officers would have an interest in keeping their staff because my
immediate concern was the exact opposite, in that if a member of staff
was proving problematic, there could be a search-and-destroy
attitude.</div>
					<a name="08012351000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look
at the example of a whistleblower who highlights to their local Member
of Parliament certain hospital practices with which they are not happy.
The hospital would obviously not be happy with the fact that those
practices were being highlighted and the medical director might be put
under pressure to find some problem with the whistleblower that could
be used to bring pressure to bear, such as a threat to their employment
record. It is essential that there is a dividing line between those
functions. It is easy to see how the role of the responsible officer
could be abused. I would like to think that all responsible officers
would resist such temptations, but I suggest that there is a finite
chance that the pressure put on the responsible officer would mean that
the laudable aim of local resolution would not be achieved whereas
games playing could be achieved. Potential manipulation of health
professionals in that way is a dangerous road to
take.</div>

							<a name="08012351000579"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> It is worth reminding ourselves that the setting
up of responsible officers to improve clinical governance at local
level was another of Dame Janet&#146;s main recommendations. Far from
the examples given by the hon. Lady, of which we do need to be
cognisant&#151;I will come on to some of the safeguards in a
moment&#151;most of us will have come across examples in our
constituencies, in either the primary care or acute sector, where
certain practices have been allowed to continue for far too long and
issues have not been addressed. We have come upon some such examples
ourselves. That is exactly what the role of the responsible officer is
intended to try to address.</div>
					<a name="08012351000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was grateful to the hon.
Member for Eddisbury for reminding me of my words in the
evidence-taking session. I do not intend to repeat them, but I do wish
to reassure the hon. Gentleman that it is our intention that
responsible officers will be medically qualified and a registered
medical practitioner. We shall lay that down in regulation. Indeed,
many of these issues will be resolved in regulation. I would also like
to point out to him that the amendments would not achieve the objective
that he seeks. Although they would restrict the role of a responsible
officer to those who were clinically trained, it would still be
possible for responsible officers&#146; duties to be undertaken by
members of other professions or professionals who have allowed their
registration to lapse, or indeed, people who have never been registered
with the national regulator. Even if the hon. Gentleman wanted to press
the amendments, they would not achieve the ends that he
seeks.</div>
					<a name="08012351000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
potential conflict of interest if responsible officers are medical
directors, we have made it clear that while we do not seek to be
prescriptive, we think that a medical director would be perfectly
appropriately for this role. Many of the best medical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>directors are already carrying out most of the duties that responsible
officers would be expected to carry out, in that they already have an
important role in clinical governance. It is important that all
healthcare organisations have effective clinical governance to protect
patients, and the role of responsible officer will strengthen that by
putting some of these functions on a statutory footing. The responsible
officer will be responsible for identifying and managing cases in their
organisation where there are concerns about a doctor&#146;s
performance. The management of those cases would include investigating
the circumstances, instigating remediation and, where appropriate,
referring cases to the GMC for further action. To respond to questions
asked by hon. Members earlier, responsible officers will not
take the action or refuse the revalidation themselves. We believe that
the role is entirely consistent with any good health
organisation&#146;s role in protecting patients.</div>
					<a name="08012351000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Eddisbury
made a plea for the system to be bottom-up rather than top-down, and I
entirely agree with him. I refer him to comments made by Sir Graham
Catto, who I quote in preference to Hamish Meldrum of the BMA. He
said:</div>
					<a name="08012351000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;From our
perspective, the concept of the responsible officer helps us to bridge
what Liam Donaldson described as the &#147;regulatory gap&#148;
between what happens locally and what happens centrally. We believe
that quite a number of cases that come to us might be much better dealt
with at local level before necessarily being escalated up to
us.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went on to
say:</div>
					<a name="08012351000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It would
be very helpful, from our perspective, to have people working in the
local areas who understood the GMC processes, knew when it would be

more effectively with our own
staff.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Findlay Scott,
his colleague from the GMC, went on a little later to say:</div>
					<a name="08012351000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We see the appointment
of responsible officers as a further strengthening of local governance
and as a reinforcement of local

went on:</div>
					<a name="08012351000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There

					<a name="08012351000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
how the responsible officers would fit in with the GMC and its
affiliates at national level, they would have statutory
responsibilities to ensure that doctors in their organisation are fit
to practise and that the right processes are in place to protect
patients. The GMC would still be the national regulator for all doctors
in the UK. As I have said, responsible officers would not decide
whether a doctor was re-licensed. They would make recommendations to
the GMC, but the GMC would continue to be the regulator in that regard
and responsible officers would be required to liaise with the GMC on
individual fitness to practise cases, where responsible officers judged
that national sanctions may be required.</div>

						</b> I do not doubt that the theory is good, nipping
poor practice in the bud, but does the Minister envisage it being a
full-time post for the average PCC? Will it be one full-time post or
two? It would be useful to have some indication as to what he thinks
will happen in practice.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000581"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> My current thinking is that it would not require
a full-time post. However, an existing medical director, part of whose
job is to carry out such functions, might need to employ some support.
The role would need to be devised locally. I shall say in a moment why
we believe that there will be a need for extra resources and extra
support. It will be a requirement under the Bill. Indeed, we are
providing for that support through the comprehensive spending review to
be announced in the autumn.</div>
					<a name="08012351000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept that there will be an
additional work load, but we expect that those burdens will be
containable, the costs being offset by the benefits of improved quality
and patient safety, and by obviating the need to escalate the sorts of
cases to which I referred earlier and to which the GMC drew attention.
Under the Bill, we require organisations to provide the
necessary resources for responsible officers to carry out their
role and to ensure that organisations that provide responsible officer
functions to others are not disadvantaged. The Bill makes
provision for responsible officer costs to be provided by those
receiving the service.</div>
					<a name="08012351000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Training will be developed,
through the expert advisory group that we are developing, on deciding
the necessary competences for responsible officers. Once we have agreed
those competences, we will negotiate with the pension providers to
develop and deliver specific training on the role of responsible
officers. The sub-group doing that work will include medical directors
and GMC, BMA and NHS management, including HR specialists.</div>
					<a name="08012351000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have reassured
hon. Members on the role of responsible officers and how they fit into
the general system, and on the support that will be available to them
and to local trusts in order for them to do their jobs properly. It is
so long ago now that I have forgotten whether we are debating one or
more amendments, but however many there may be, I hope that the hon.

							<a name="08012351000582"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I listened carefully to the Minister. To put it
in context, the Minister rightly pointed out that this provision comes
on the back of a recommendation from the then Dame Janet Smith, now
Lady Justice Smith. In her evidence she said that she could not see
from the Bill how it would work, and given the way that the Bill is
drafted, one can understand that. The Minister sought in his response
to give us some finer grained detail.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>
					<a name="08012351000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard about
pressure, and not only from my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and
Honiton, meaning that in certain settings it might be too much of a
problem to get rid of somebody. We then heard from the hon. Member for
Romsey, who if I interpreted her remarks correctly sought to show why
there might be too great a risk of victimisation. A spectrum of risk is
obviously being contemplated, and although I welcome what the Minister

potential misunderstandings.</div>
					<a name="08012351000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said that he
expects to see a lot of these matters dealt with in regulation. Given
the genuine concern expressed in our debate, I rather hope that the
Committee will have the opportunity to see those regulations, at least
in draft form, on Report. If that is not feasible, I hope that they
will be ready for those who will be considering the Bill in another
place. I am sure that that will be an important way of setting the
matter in
context.</div>

hope to keep the Minister&#146;s feet to the fire on that point. I
hope, too, that we may see the regulations, at least in draft, brought
forward when we are considering the relevant measures in the Bill. It
is such an important area to get right, not least because we are
putting such responsibility on the responsible officer. We must ensure
that they are in the best position to carry out the functions

seeks to include in the responsible officer&#146;s role
responsibilities for patient safety and the continuing professional
development of doctors and health care managers, insofar as they impact
on doctors&#146; performance. I hope that the Minister will find that
of interest, given the training commitment that he has so assiduously
sought to lay
out.</div>
					<a name="08012351000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Responsible
officers provide the opportunity for a dedicated individual to pick up
the early warning signs in, for example, prescribing practice, and to
alert for an improvement in performance. In an open system of
benchmarking, something on which I am particularly keen, that could be
an effective asset to the local and national health economy, and to the
professionalism and morale of local
doctors.</div>
					<a name="08012351000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other
hand, as we have discussed, the responsible officer could be little
more than a revalidating rubber-stamper and a &#147;copper&#146;s
nark&#148;. That would have the reverse effect on the profession and,
ultimately, would fail significantly to benefit patients and the
public. I hope that the Minister will see the point that, by outlining
what he expects the day-to-day role of the responsible officer to be,
he is thereby able to include experience of and responsibility for
continuing professional development in the competency framework
currently being discussed by his Department, of which I am aware. The
amendment would be useful to help to underpin many of the points that I
acknowledge that he has set
forward.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000600"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As we discussed earlier in the Committee,
patient safety and the quality of care are the core business of every
health care organisation, and the new regime set out in part 1,
particularly the obligation to register with a national regulator, is
intended to enforce that fundamental responsibility. Health care
organisations will need to comply with statutory safety and quality
requirements, which will include ensuring that all staff, both clinical
and managerial, are appropriately skilled and trained to carry out
their duties. Patient safety and the professional development of
doctors lie at the heart of the responsible officer&#146;s role, both
in relation to the duties under this clause and those proposed under
clause 111.</div>
					<a name="08012351000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would require a designated body to have regard to patient
safety and</div>
					<a name="08012351000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
continuing professional development of medical healthcare
professionals, and...healthcare
managers.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">when giving a
responsible officer additional duties. That would be in addition to
having regard to the responsible officer&#146;s statutory
responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="08012351000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Members intended that responsible officers should consider the
impact on patient safety and on continuing professional development
when carrying out their primary duties, the amendment would not achieve
that. It places a responsibility on the organisation to take those
factors into account only when they decide to assign additional
duties.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div>
					<a name="08012351000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not want other duties that
might be given to  a responsible officer to interfere with the
proper functioning of statutory responsibilities. Beyond that, I do not
see any advantage to patients or to health care staff in unduly
constraining the freedom of health care organisations to combine the
responsible officer functions with other appropriate duties&#151;for
example, clinical duties or a broader clinical leadership role. The
clause would preserve that freedom and I therefore hope that the hon.

Gidley:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 267, in
clause 112, page 60, line 25, leave
out &#145;may show&#146; and insert
&#145;shows&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08012351000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause has the generally laudable aim of ensuring that there is a
mechanism for sharing information about health workers. As a general
principle, that is to be welcomed. There have been occasions where the
system has failed in the past because it has not joined up and earlier,
I cited an example of a nurse in a nursing home who was able to
practise for some time before her regulatory body caught up with
her.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div>
					<a name="08012351000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a concern about the
current drafting. The aim of the amendment is to ensure that the
sharing of any information that relates to the conduct or performance
of a health worker could happen only if it actually shows that the
worker is likely to constitute a threat to the health and safety of
patients. The current wording in the Bill says &#147;may&#148;, and
that seems to encompass a range of levels of proof. It would only
potentially show that a worker may be a threat, and it is not clear how
robust that evidence has to be.</div>
					<a name="08012351000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulations will require
NHS trusts and other bodies to provide and share information about
health care workers in circumstances where a person may constitute a
threat to the health and safety of patients. The BMA identified a
potential problem with the clause from an employment law perspective.
Clause 112(1)(a) refers to information that</div>
					<a name="08012351000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may show whether a worker is
likely to constitute a threat to the health and safety of
patients.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Legal advice
received by the BMA shows that if an employer were to pass on an
unproven or damaging piece of information without the employee&#146;s
knowledge, it could be the basis of a claim that the employer had
breached an implied term of trust and confidence in his or her
employment contract. The use of unproven information does not indicate
what level of investigation there has to have been. Obviously any
comments that raise concerns are potentially damaging to an employee's
reputation, so the matter would need to be carefully looked into. There
is a case for saying that information should be shared only where the
employer can demonstrate cause. In effect, that means that there would
be a full and proper investigation and that the employee would
be informed of the allegations.</div>
					<a name="08012351000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be helpful to know how
and when those powers will be used. Can the Minister
clarify the procedures for the sharing of such information, including
the need to inform the subject of the investigation at the earliest
possible stage about the allegations that are being investigated? What
assurances can the Minister give that the information shared would be
kept in strict confidence, and to whom will that information
be restricted?</div>
					<a name="08012351000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Page
61, line 4 defines a &#147;designated body&#148;. Will the Minister
clarify what other bodies he intends to prescribe for the purpose of
that measure? It is right to say that protecting patients is vital, but
the human rights of the health professional also need to be taken into
account. At this stage, can the Minister outline the content of the
secondary legislation and guidance?</div>
					<a name="08012351000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a couple of further
questions. What are the appropriate circumstances in which unproven
information should be shared? If the intention is that the powers will
be used only in cases where there is evidence of a significant risk to
patient safety and where appropriate investigations are under way, can
the Minister give examples of cases where information sharing would be
an integral part of the investigation? What guidance will PCTs be given
on considering all relevant factors, including assessing the degree of
urgency and potential threats to patient safety, and examining the
contribution that information from one organisation could make to the
investigation before making the decision to share the information? Will
the Minister clarify the circumstances in which it may be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>necessary to share information that is unproven at the time the
information is shared? What onus will be on the organisation receiving
the information to use the same confidentiality safeguards that it
would if it had received the allegation directly from a member of the
public?</div>
					<a name="08012351000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
general happiness about the overall intent of the Bill, but the use of
the word &#147;may&#148; has given rise to some significant
concerns, on which I seek the Minister's
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="08012351000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000605"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The amendment would prevent organisations from
sharing information&#151;even where proven&#151;that on its own may
not be enough to demonstrate a threat to patient safety. However, when
such information is put together with other information a pattern of
behaviour may be revealed that could put patients at risk. For example,
the settlement of a clinical negligence claim does not in itself show
that the worker was a threat to patient safety, but repeated claims may
show that there is likely to be a threat to
patients.</div>
				
					<a name="08012351000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012351000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">A common
conclusion of recent inquiries, including the Shipman, Ayling and
Kerr/Haslam inquiries, was that health care organisations failed, both
singly and collectively, to join up information that was
available to them. We are concerned that the hon. Lady&#146;s
amendment would limit their ability to do so. I will come on to the
safeguards that she sought in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="08012351000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I absolutely
understand and sympathise with the need to protect health care workers
from unfounded allegations and we will therefore ensure that any
regulations made under the clause are accompanied by
robust guidance, which sets out the necessary
safeguards regarding the way in which the shared information is stored
and used in the receiving organisation. The basic principles
should be that any uncorroborated information be held in strict
confidence by the receiving organisation, and that health care workers
be told, at the earliest possible stage, of the accusations against
them and of the proposed way in which they will be
investigated.</div>
					<a name="08012351000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the hon. Lady&#146;s specific questions, information on
unproven allegations will be shared only under strict conditions of
confidentiality and on a need to know basis. There is no question of
taking disciplinary action against any professional without a full
investigation, in which the truth of such allegations can be rigorously
tested through a fair
process.</div>
					<a name="08012351000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000606"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> Information could be passed on to another body and
later not be proven. It is not clear what means there is of withdrawing
such information so that a slur does not unnecessarily stay on a health
professional&#146;s
record.</div>
					<a name="08012351000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000607"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> That is exactly the sort of thing we would need
to make plain in the secondary legislation. Soft information should be
kept subject to strict controls and confidentiality so as not to harm
the reputation of health professionals. Where on the basis of the
information available a health care organisation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>decides that there is a need to investigate further, the professional
concerned must be told of the allegation and given an opportunity to
give his or her side of the
story.</div>
					<a name="08012351000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The procedures
will be set out, as I already said, in regulations. Guidance will be
based on the advice of an expert group that will include the BMA, and
that legislation will also be subject to full public consultation. We
expect to carry that out later in the year. It is our intention that
the guidance include the need to inform the subject of the
investigation at the earliest possible
stage.</div>
					<a name="08012351000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
hon. Lady sought an example of where unproven information may be
shared. One example is where a doctor is employed by two or
more organisations and an investigation into a serious allegation has
been initiated by one of them. In deciding whether to share that
information with a second organisation, the organisation will need to
consider the central issues of the nature and strength of the
allegation, the degree of urgency and the vulnerability of those to be
protected. I hope that on the basis of those reassurances the hon. Lady
will feel able to withdraw her
amendment.</div>

when dealing with legislation whose detail is to come after, and when
there are relatively few opportunities for parliamentarians to change
the fine detail of the final product. I am happy to withdraw the
amendment at this stage but I will reflect further and look closely at
the Minister&#146;s words to check that all my concerns have been
allayed. I am not convinced that they have been and it is possible that
we may wish to return to the point on Third

<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>this is a Henry VIII clause&#151;our old friend whom we discussed
earlier. I shall refrain from reading out the remarkably humorous
contribution I made at the
time.</div>
					<a name="08012351000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our memorandum
of information
notes:</div>
					<a name="08012351000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It has
hitherto not proved possible to make amendments as promptly as would be
desirable in that changes require an appropriate legislative vehicle
and sufficient Parliamentary
time.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I felt quite
irritated and irked by that. It is not a strong argument. For a
Government it is a very weak argument, because not only is control of
both elements wholly within their power, there has not been one
parliamentary year since Labour came to office when an Act meddling
with the NHS or social care sector has not gone through the House, any
number of which might have contained the proposed provision. Committee
members need only look at part 5 of the Bill for
examples.</div>
					<a name="08012351000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
remains a moot question, therefore, whether the Committee should vote
away even more of Parliament&#146;s democratic role solely because
either the Government are not on top of their policy making in advance
of their proposed legislative programme or they have some problem with
their parliamentary timetabling, such that we need this extraordinary
catch-all definition of social care workers who are not currently
social care workers. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

Browning:
						</b> I support the amendment. It brings us back to
something about which the Minister has given us verbal reassurance
throughout the course of the Bill, but subsection (4)(c) seems to catch
all the people we have talked about. I am particularly concerned about
the flexibility, which I have already said I support, of direct
payments. Many people are employed directly by people who need a
package of social care paid for through direct payments from public
funds. We have just started to get a breakthrough in that flexible
arrangement for people who are befrienders, such as those helping
people with mental health problems or with autistic spectrum disorders,
who need a package of care that is not the sort we have historically
identified with physical disability or old age, but which makes a huge
difference to their lives whereby their needs are recognised and they
can at last start to take their place in society and do the sort of
normal things that the rest of us enjoy but from which they are
precluded.</div>
					<a name="08012351000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take
as an example people who need a care package so that an age-appropriate
or gender-appropriate person can accompany them socially&#151;perhaps
to go to the pub with them once a week. That may sound rather minuscule
and trivial, but it makes a difference and I cannot see how such
befrienders and people officially employed with public money will not
fall foul of subsection (4)(c). They are just the sort of people who
will be caught by that catch-all. Once they are subject to a lot of
regulation they will be discouraged from doing those jobs and making
themselves available one or two evenings a week. This is important, so
I must ask the Minister to address what is on the face of the Bill, as
it seems to fly in the face of some of his earlier
reassurances.</div>
					<a name="08012351000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000611"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The clause will only enable regulation of
activities carried on by people who are not social care workers within
section 55 of the Care Standards 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>Act 2000 if the activities are carried on in connection with the
activities of social care workers. Provision in subsection (4)(b) and
(c) measures the equivalent provision that we have already discussed
under schedule 3 in relation to the Health Act 1999, which sets out
what regulation in relation to a health care professional may
include.</div>
					<a name="08012351000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer
to the hon. Member&#146;s question, it may include other groups who
will need the flexibility to register in future. We have already
announced that the first new group to be registered will be staff
working in domiciliary care. The Government have also accepted GSCC
advice on further groups, which include residential care workers. Those
two groups cover staff in Commission for Social Care Inspection
registered children&#146;s care homes, residential family centres,
care homes for older people, care homes for adults, domiciliary care
agencies that provide personal care in people&#146;s homes, fostering
agencies, voluntary adoption agencies and so on. They are not the sort
of individual contractual arrangements we discussed earlier and which
the hon. Lady has just raised
again.</div>
					<a name="08012351000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why we are seeking the flexibility that the clause would give us.
The difficulty we have with the hon. Member for Eddisbury&#146;s
amendment&#151;notwithstanding his concerns, which I share, that we
would not want the flexibility to be limitless&#151;is that it would
create uncertainty for the groups I have just referred to and may mean
that those people or activities would not be brought within the
regulatory framework or their regulation modified without primary
legislation. I do not think that would be a sensible restriction so I
hope he will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000612"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I have listened carefully. Although it has
unquestionably been helpful for the Minister to say that he has in
mind, for instance, staff working in domiciliary care, residential care
workers and a number of others, it is either appropriate to define
them, which would be possible, or, given that so much is in
regulations, it could be done by regulation. What I do not like is that
the provision is so general and unspecific that it could possibly
capture more.</div>
					<a name="08012351000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
not a vote against the Government as a matter of principle but a vote
against on the basis that we have made a sensible point that has not
yet been fully addressed. I encourage the Minister to think afresh with
his officials as they look at the next stages of the Bill. On a
feet-to-the-fire basis, I seek to divide the

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(8) All orders

					<a name="08012351000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
it feels late in the day, may I say what a pleasure it is to serve on
this Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Conway? I have
not had the opportunity to say that
before.</div>
					<a name="08012351000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am hoping
that we will have the opportunity to have a stand part debate. There
has been a bit of a leap in subject matter. Part 3 of the Bill will
update the Public Health (Control of Diseases) Act 1984 and has been
widely welcomed. This part has not had a huge amount of publicity, but
concerns have been raised about some of the powers that it gives.
However, I re-emphasise that it has been largely
welcomed.</div>
					<a name="08012351000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public
health measures have been used since ancient times. The Chinese had a
technique that was very similar to vaccination to prevent the spread of
smallpox. Many of us are familiar with the public health measures in
Roman times. It is as well that from time to time Governments update
public health
laws.</div>
					<a name="08012351000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
essentially very simple. It reflects concerns that have been raised,
not least by the National AIDS Trust, the Terrence Higgins Trust and a
couple of other bodies. They are not against the powers and feel that
it is important that they are substantial, but it could be said that
the powers are draconian, albeit necessary, unfortunately. The National
AIDS Trust was disappointed that those who had submitted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>views to the consultation process were told of the Government&#146;s
conclusions and the consequential legislative provisions only the day
after the Bill was presented to
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08012351000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
some concern about the extension of the powers. In particular, a
justice of the peace could previously make an order for a medical
examination and move someone with a notifiable disease to a hospital or
detention hospital. Under the Bill, a justice of the peace will
additionally be able to order quarantine, disinfection or
decontamination, and the wearing of protective clothing, and to require
an individual to provide information and answer questions, require the
monitoring of an individual&#146;s health, require an individual to
attend training or advice sessions on risk reduction, restrict where an
individual goes or with whom they have contact, and require that they
abstain from working or training.</div>
					<a name="08012351000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure the Minister would
agree that while all those powers might be necessary, they are
draconian. Many of the organisations that I mentioned, especially the
Terrence Higgins Trust, have welcomed the Government response to the
consultation. It is clear that the Government have been measured. The
amendment would simply ensure that there was a safeguard in Parliament
by giving Parliament an opportunity to look at orders that are made. A
great deal of publicity has been given to the detention of people in
recent years, albeit in relation to matters other than public health.
Our society will be significantly interested in monitoring the
situation.</div>

						<a name="08012351000629"></a>
							<b class="B">Greg
Mulholland</b> (Leeds, North-West) (LD): We think that this is
a sensible amendment, but is it really supposed to introduce subsection
(8)? There is no mention of deletion, so should it not refer to
subsection (9), or possibly (8A)? The key point is clearly that when
there is a risk of significant harm to human health, it should be
reported to Parliament. We broadly support the aim of the
proposal.</div>
					<a name="08012351000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000630"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I completely accept that the restrictions or
requirements that justices of the peace can place on individuals could
impact on their human rights, so it is very important that we are
debating this and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Guildford for
raising the issue. We agree that the powers must be used responsibly,
which is why we have put them in the hands of an independent JP and
included the requirement for the Secretary of State to make regulations
about the evidence that should be presented to the JP before he or she
makes a decision.</div>
					<a name="08012351000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the amendment would
require all orders made under new section 45G of the 1984 Act to be
reported to Parliament and we think that that would be a little
excessive. For example, we do not require social workers to report to
Parliament each time they detain a person with a mental illness, or the
police to report to Parliament each time they arrest a potential
criminal. We are very well aware of the concerns of the organisations
that the hon. Lady mentioned, including the National AIDS Trust, and my
officials have been working very closely with them in developing the JP
order regulations, which we will debate at a later stage. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>Given that, and the existing safeguards in legislation, we do not think

Mulholland:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 138 to 149&#151;I do not
understand why the group is listed as &#147;138+139 to 149&#148;,
but I accept that there is a lot I need to learn about parliamentary
procedure&#151;are really about a point of principle, but, more
importantly, they attempt to question the practical changes in this
part of the Bill. The Minister will be well aware that there are
serious concerns about the implication of those
changes.</div>
					<a name="08012351000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
of principle, we believe that the power to impose health control
measures in relation to objects and premises to prevent the spread of
infection or contamination, which we all agree is important, is better
in the hands of local authorities than of justices of the peace. The
amendments would make that change. The intention is to remove the
requirement that the Bill would impose on local authorities to seek a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>legal ruling before taking measures in relation to things or premises to
prevent the spread of infection or
contamination.</div>
					<a name="08012351000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister will know, we have not tabled amendments to proposed new
section 45G, which addresses the power to order health measures in
relation to persons. That is quite deliberate so that a higher standard
of proof would be necessary in those cases before health measures could
be ordered. We believe that councils, as the bodies in control of local
areas and the only bodies that can put measures into practice quickly,
need the power to protect the people whom they serve from contamination
and infection.</div>
					<a name="08012351000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be well aware that the Local Government Association and
individual councillors have broadly welcomed the changes to public
health legislation. The LGA believes that they

					<a name="08012351000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;mainly sensible and

							<a name="08012351000635"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman might recall that during the
oral evidence sessions, the Minister was not
persuaded that there would be a requirement for
repeated applications to a justice of the peace. I suggested&#151;not
that I got an answer, because it was more a rather loud
aside&#151;that one problem in the case that I had mentioned was that
it involved a series of licensed premises. I wondered whether that
might have made a difference to whether there would be separate or
combined applications by the local council, notwithstanding the change
in the role and responsibility of magistrates in relation to licensed
premises. I wonder whether the Minister has had a chance to reflect on
that and to establish whether there will be a problem of licensed
premises giving rise to a serial need for applications, rather than a
collective
application.</div>
					<a name="08012351000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000636"></a>Greg
Mulholland:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful
intervention, which has saved me from mentioning that part of the
evidence sessions. As far as I am concerned, the question remains up in
the air. I hope that the Minister has had a chance to reflect on it and
that he will be able to
respond.</div>
					<a name="08012351000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister knows, the key issue is whether he challenges the view of
local authorities that the provision will be an additional layer of
bureaucracy and an extra step in the process that could lead to delays
in the response to incidences of infection and contamination. That is
clearly a valid concern. On top of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question
to the Minister about repeated applications, I wish to ask him, first,
why he believes the change will speed up the process and improve its
effectiveness. If it will not, it would clearly be foolish to introduce
it. Secondly, what are the costs involved? They cannot be nothing, and
I would be surprised if they were negligible. Has a cost assessment of
the changes been carried out, as well an assessment of their
effectiveness?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000637"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As hon. Members will remember, the Local
Government Association told us, during its evidence session, that
requiring a local authority to seek an order from a justice of the
peace in order to carry out measures in relation to infected or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>contaminated things or premises would cause a delay. However, that was
wrong, because it suggests that the local authorities had those powers
all along, and that the new safeguard provided by the justices of the
peace would be a hindrance to an otherwise smoothly-running system.
However, that is not the case. The Public Health (Control of Disease)
Act 1984 does not extend to any premises or things that are
contaminated, which is why we are taking these powers. The powers in
relation to infected premises and things are patchy, which again is one
of the reasons we need to amend the 1984
Act.</div>
					<a name="08012351000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many cases,
local authorities have had to rely on other legislation, such as food
safety, environmental protection or health and safety legislation, to
deal with infected or contaminated premises and articles. Where there
have been gaps, local authorities have had to rely on voluntary
co-operation. The provisions in proposed new sections 45H and 45L will
fill those gaps. However, we think that significant interference with,
or even loss of a person&#146;s home or property, deserves a degree
of judicial oversight. Hon. Members will be interested to know that the
responses to the consultation supported that view by
10:1.</div>
					<a name="08012351000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers in
new section 45 are to be used only when necessary. A justice of the
peace is unlikely to reach a decision that an order is necessary, if
the local authority has not already exhausted other reasonable methods.
In addition, a JP is unlikely to deem an order necessary if it is
sought as an alternative to using other more appropriate legislation,
such as that on health and
safety.</div>
					<a name="08012351000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the timing
issue, hon. Members will remember that the LGA implied that the 1984
amendments would force local authorities, at great expense, to apply
individually for 47 separate orders. That is not correct. New section
45J makes it clear that the local authority could seek a single group
order for all premises relating to a single contamination incident. I
remind hon. Members also of the evidence given by Pat Troop, from the
Health Protection Agency, who was very relaxed about the speed of
process involving a JP, in contrast to the speed of process involving
local authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012351000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the point raised by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West
about powers relating to things and premises, rather than to people, we
agree that direct interference in the rights and freedoms of people is
of a different order and requires the oversight of a JP. However,
interference with a private dwelling or other premises, or with the
enjoyment or possession of private properties, is also quite serious
and deserves such oversight. Given that, I hope that he will withdraw
his
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000638"></a>Greg

one point; it might be the first time that he has in this Committee
stage.</div>
					<a name="08012351000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I made
clear, the LGA, local authorities and&#151;I am sure&#151;the
Committee, agree that the tidying-up, to which the Minister alluded, is
very important for the process. However, he has a little more work to
do to convince, certainly, the LGA and local authority leaders that
this is not an additional step in the process and that there is no
possibility of delay. I urge him to engage in further dialogue to allay
those concerns. I did 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>not get an answer to the question about costs, and I
ask him to bear them in mind and to respond at some stage with an idea
of how much the changes will cost. That is an important point. However,
we have teased out the main points, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012351000640"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am grateful to have the opportunity to debate
the amendment and beg the indulgence of the Committee. I am afraid that
the only thing as a lawyer that I, apparently, excel at is
international public law, especially the law of the sea. This amendment
does not, as it happens, relate to my
speciality, which is the configuration and operation of the law
of the sea as applied to archipelagic states, which, as
one can imagine, is both geographically and legally
extraordinarily fraught when one considers states such as the
Philippines or Indonesia.</div>
					<a name="08012351000471"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here I see, for the first time
applied to the UKas a matter of law&#151;although I hope the Minister
will be able to prove me wrong and show how far
behind I have become in my legal understanding of these
areas&#151;the question of territorial sea, as applied
internationally and in recognised terms through the treaty, under the
auspices of the United Nations law of the sea. Because of devolution,
we have to look carefully at how the measure applies to England and
Wales. The amendment
says:</div>
					<a name="08012351000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the territorial
sea adjacent to England and Wales.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">It certainly begs the question of such
places as the Isle of Man, which sits between measurements relating to
both Ireland as well as the Province of the United Kingdom, namely,
Northern Ireland.</div>
					<a name="08012351000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
one measurement, the Isle of Man is closer to the landfall of Scotland.
One only has to think of the Mull of Kintyre to recognise that that
poses a challenge, given that Scotland is not mentioned in the clause.
I am not seeking to be picky, but I do think that this is a serious
issue. Devolution often poses many questions where the whole of the law
internationally has been framed upon the basis that the United Kingdom
is a nation for the purposes of application of treaty law.</div>
					<a name="08012351000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">We domesticate that law and
make it enforceable. If we then reflect on the devolutionary settlement
that has taken place over the past decade, that poses a question. For
example, the boundary between England and Scotland is in the Solway
Firth. Is that a direct division 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div>and an equal length of measurement between the coast of north-west
Cumbria and the south-eastern coast of Dumfriesshire? What does one do,
for instance, with Lindisfarne, assuming that that is an English
territory?
</div>
					<a name="08012351000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
it is important to recognise that this can get bogged down in a
geography lesson, and as is patently clear to all, I probably left out
the most convenient example because I have reached the limit of my own
geography off the top of my head, the amendment seems to beg questions
about whether the measure has been imported without genuinely
recognising the complexity of the international treaties that give rise
to the law of the sea and therefore the definition of territorial
waters. Interestingly, &#147;territorial sea&#148; as a term has
not normally been recognised. Normally it is territorial waters that is
applied to the British Isles, remembering that that includes the
international state and neighbour of Ireland, across which we have our
only land border. It also relates to the fact that we have a
continental shelf measurement. That is different from the normal laws
of the sea as would apply, say, to the Philippines, if one were
measuring the territorial waters that extended to the normal 200-mile
limit in an archipelagic state. Therefore, we have some serious issues
to contend with here. I am sorry to take up the Committee&#146;s
time, but having seen the amendment, I could not resist ensuring that
that matter has been thought through.</div>

our coastal waters when dealing with the Marine Bill. I am well aware

working to develop its ship regulations so that they mirror the English
provisions and Northern Ireland will develop its own regulations once
it has a public health

Milton:
						</b> I am conscious that I must not keep the Committee
unnecessarily but think I that, in the light of the amendments that we
have discussed, it is important to go through a few of the issues. I am
not one to quote large sections of text, but I think it is worth
drawing attention to a recent article in the <i class="I">Medical Law Review</i>
which described a Swedish case where the enforcement of public health
legislation was judged to conflict with the European convention on
human rights. In the conclusion, the author wrote:</div>
					<a name="08012351000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Law has the potential
to be a very useful tool for the attainment of public health. Bad law,
however, can serve to create obstacles to public health. Public health
consultants in England and Wales have been cautious in using detention
powers, even in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>cases of serious risk of disease spread by a non-compliant patient,
because of lack of clarity of the status of these powers in relation to
human rights. Enhorn illustrates that similar concerns exist in
relation to legislation elsewhere in Europe. There have been many calls
for reform of public health legislation in the United Kingdom by
academic commentators and public health consultants...Public
health law has undergone a process of reform in other jurisdictions
that had adopted their public health laws from English law, following
the SARS scare in 2003. Any doubt as to the implications of the Human
Rights Act 1998 for the Public Health Act 1984 must now have been
settled by the decision...Once again we can only call upon the
government to make reform of public health an issue of the highest
priority and not to wait for the threat of a new or re-emerging disease
in order to pass with haste emergency
legislation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
part of the Bill serves to do exactly that. The Minister mentioned
human rights issues, which have come up from time to time during the
Committee&#146;s discussions, and the amendment relates to that. It
is important to be mindful of that and of the continuing public concern
about the use of powers by officials to detain people.</div>
					<a name="08012351000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was pleased to see that there
was unanimous agreement in the responses to the Government&#146;s
consultation on updating the law, but as in so many parts of the Bill,
the devil will be in the detail. Although we have had some of the
regulations, we have not had all of them, so I look forward to seeing
those and ensuring that they do not cause any further concerns than
those that have already been
raised.</div>
					<a name="08012351000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">To skip
through various aspects, new section 45A deals with the definition of
contamination or infections and, I believe, for the first time
introduces radiation as a form. Global security is seriously
threatened, which has made it necessary to include radiation, but we
must also be aware of our own concerns about radiation, regarding not
only nuclear power stations, but much hospital equipment that is in
use.</div>
				
					<a name="08012351000489"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div>
					<a name="08012351000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section 45B
deals with international travel and allows the appropriate Minister to
update UK law without recourse to Parliament, or when there may be
amendments to, or developments in, the law. For those who cannot sleep
this evening, I recommend the World Health Organisation website, which
describes the main features of the measures.</div>
					<a name="08012351000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section 45G has been
referred to, and the LGA and HPA have raised concerns, but I shall
reiterate some points. My greatest concern is about what the Minister
said in oral evidence about the LGA not being clear about what was
needed in the Litvinenko case. He will have to go to considerable
lengths to ensure that local authorities and public health physicians
do have very clear guidance. Many powers will be used in an emergency,
in haste and rarely, making it imperative that council officers and
public health physicians are fully conversant with the law and where
they stand. It was worrying to hear what the LGA said.</div>
					<a name="08012351000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section 45L will govern the
length of detention, which is currently 28 days, so it will be helpful
to compare this legislation with the emergency procedures for
sectioning a patient with mental illness. Emergency sectioning of a
patient with mental illness in the community requires one doctor and an
approved social worker or nearest relative. If the patient is already
in hospital, the patient&#146;s consultant&#151;currently, a
doctor, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>but in the future from any profession&#151;or their nominated deputy
can make the section. In both instances, the patient can be detained
for no longer than 72 hours. For detention longer than that, two
doctors, one of whom must be approved, and an approved social worker,
or possibly the nearest relative, are required. If the patient has not
already appealed against detention, the hospital must arrange one after
six months. Renewal of detention is required at six-month intervals for
18 months, and after 18 months, sectioning is done annually.</div>
					<a name="08012351000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that comparison, and the
72-hour limit on someone needing to be detained under the Mental Health
Act 2007, 28 days appears somewhat extreme. Will the Minister elaborate
on that provision and tell us why he feels that 28 days are needed?
Several issues have been raised, and on Second Reading my hon. Friend
the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) raised the issue that
Liberty also raised. He said:</div>
					<a name="08012351000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When a magistrate signs
a detention order&#151;which is only one of the powers available to
him&#151;it may be challenged, although on many occasions it will be
accepted. If the order is challenged, could it not be put to the
magistrates&#146; court for confirmation?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 26 November 2007; Vol. 468, c. 74.]</div>
					<a name="08012351000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Picker Institute&#146;s
head of policy, Don Redding, said:</div>
					<a name="08012351000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Patients could be
subject to quite draconian orders. There&#146;s an evident danger
that patients will not want to report concerns to their GPs if they
think it may lead to these
actions,&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012351000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">which may be an
unintended consequence of the powers. He continued:</div>
					<a name="08012351000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This should be tested
quite clearly in Parliament so the government gives a clear explanation
of why these powers have been
developed&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012351000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain exactly what future scenario he envisages, with
particular reference to those 28 days? I see the Minister nodding, I do
not need to reiterate the fact that the powers are draconian, very
serious and must not be taken lightly.</div>
					<a name="08012351000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome an updating of the
law. I note the concerns raised by the Liberal Democrats in their
amendment, about allowing local authorities rather than JPs to hold
power. The seizure of somebody&#146;s premises is very
serious&#151;it could involve taking away their livelihood and I
think that having that power resting with JPs is a positive measure. I
would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on whether,
particularly in the case of an appeal, the matter could go to the bench
rather than one JP.</div>

						</b> In respect of the 28-day detention and the
comparison with the Mental Health Act, my understanding is that the
Mental Health Act is not restricted to 72 hours, but is 28 days as
well. I do not know whether that helps reassure the hon. Lady. The
28-day duration is based on the potential length of incubation for
certain diseases. On her concerns that the law might be updated without
recourse to Parliament, let me reassure her that new section 45F(3)
allows UK law to be amended, but only through affirmative resolution
agreed by both Houses. In an emergency, the regulations can be in place
for 28 days, but will fall as soon as they are rejected by Parliament
or if they are not debated within that time.</div>

sought reassurances about the safeguards. On the appeals concern, yes,
one will be able to appeal to the Crown court under section 67 of the

Amendment No. 243 updates section 5 of that Act by removing the

authorities.</div>

created by an order of the Secretary of State and such an order may
state how the expenses of a joint board are to be defrayed. If the
order does not state how they are to be defrayed, section 5 sets out a
mechanism that uses a common fund to which the constituent districts or
rating districts contribute. However, as the relevant definition of
rating district in the General Rate Act 1967 has been repealed, the
provision is out of date. Amendment No. 243 simply removes the
