								Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): It is a great
pleasure to serve again under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow.
I am sure that the deliberations of the Committee will be presided over
with the light touch and the charm that you showed last
week.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000415"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. To refresh the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
memory, we are continuing the debate on an amendment initiated by the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. No ministerial reply
has yet been extracted and no opportunity for the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>to provide it has been given, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will
want to continue his remarks until their
conclusion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000416"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> Indeed, and on that basis I am happy to hear
what the Minister has to
say.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07032064000417"></a>
							<b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): With
respect, Mr. Bercow, it was not a debate that I initiated. I
was just intervening before we adjourned. I apologise if I put the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk in the firing line, but I am grateful to
him for trying to sweep up, as it
were.</div>
					<a name="07032064000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">My simple point
was to ask how we could create a system wherein others in the household
can have the authority either to take responsibility for a notice, or
to accept a bailiff saying that he will take possession of the goods
but that he will leave them there, in a way that is compatible with the
fact that those people may be independent of the person in relation to
whom the obligation first arises. &#147;It is not my
responsibility&#148;, is a common response to bailiffs on the
doorstep and happens frequently. I described such circumstances before
we adjourned. I wonder what the Minister&#146;s thoughts are and what
advice officials have come up with on the best way to secure both the
interests of those who are seeking to enforce their debts and ensure
that money is paid and the interests of the household. Those in the
household may be unrelated to each other and someone might wittingly or
unwittingly take responsibility without necessarily having the
authority of the person whose goods they are to do more than be the
receiver of the message. Historically, it has been a fairly intractable
question. I should be grateful to hear the hon. and learned
Lady&#146;s views on how the matter can best be dealt with in
everyone&#146;s
interests.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000418"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (Vera
Baird):
						</b> I, too, welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr. Bercow. I echo everything that was said about your
charm.</div>
					<a name="07032064000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
90, tabled by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, is not necessary.
Paragraph 28(1), to which I have already referred, stipulates that an
enforcement agent must provide a notice for the debtor on entering the
premises. We have covered that territory. Regulations will be made
under paragraph 28(2) to determine the form and content of the notice,
and further details of its contents are contained in paragraph 160 of
the statement on delegated powers. We had a gallop around that course
this morning. The notice will set out details of the debt, how it can
be paid, any charges and any avenues of appeal or complaint, all of
which are essential.</div>
					<a name="07032064000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the concerns behind amendment No. 91 about not
causing undue hardship, but those, too, are covered adequately, and we
have already considered them. We will regulate to exempt goods from
seizure when they are necessary for a debtor&#146;s basic domestic
needs. We have been through the list as it is currently composed, and I
have said that I am happy to hear representations about anything that
should be added to it for the sake of completeness and
comprehensiveness. Anything that is necessary for the basic domestic
needs of the debtor can be added to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>list, as can those things that are necessary to enable him to carry on
his business, his work or his
vocation.</div>
					<a name="07032064000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 12
of schedule 12 limits the enforcement agent to take control of goods to
the value only of the outstanding debt and any future costs. One
expects that such a provision will not result in the cleaning out of
everything except the exempt goods, except on rare occasions. I believe
that the Bill finds an appropriate balance between creditors and
debtors and will not cause undue hardship to the debtor or his family,
or impair his ability to carry on his business or education.
</div>
					<a name="07032064000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment Nos. 92 to
94 seek to provide that a controlled goods agreement&#151;the new
name for the walking possession arrangement that we have discussed in
those terms&#151;can be signed by a person other than the debtor. It
is the wish of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition that that should be so
if a competent person who is over 18 lives on the premises or works on
them where the premises are business premises, as long as he fully
understands the consequences of the procedure. As my noble Friend
Baroness Ashton has said many times in the other place, the Bill does
not preclude the possibility of another person signing for a controlled
goods agreement. In addition, paragraph 13(3) of the schedule provides
for regulations to make further provision about taking control of goods
by way of a controlled goods agreement. I am happy to confirm that the
regulations will specify that a controlled goods agreement may be
signed by a person other than the debtor, but such regulations would
also need to clarify that that person would require the debtor&#146;s
consent.</div>
					<a name="07032064000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lest anyone
be troubled, I shall set out how we hope the procedure will work. Where
a person on the premises volunteers to sign the agreement saying that
they have the authority to do so, the enforcement agent will have to
ascertain their relationship to the debtor and, if satisfied, may
accept the statement at face value and allow the person to sign. It is
in the debtor&#146;s interest to allow that to happen, as the
alternative might be that the goods are removed.</div>
					<a name="07032064000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where no one on the premises is
willing to claim the authority to sign, the enforcement agent should
try to contact the debtor by telephone to explain the situation and to
ask whether the debtor can instruct someone who is present to sign the
agreement or come over to sign it in person. Where it is not possible
to authorise someone who is present or no one is willing to sign the
agreement, the enforcement agent would be within his rights to take
control of the goods immediately by securing them on the premises or by
removing them for storage and sale.</div>
					<a name="07032064000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">A person who could sign in
those circumstances should not be someone under the age of 18 or
someone who is incapable of understanding the serious nature and
consequences of what they are signing. All of that is intended to be
put into regulation, and given that, I hope that hon. Members will not
press their amendments to a Division.</div>

							<a name="07032064000437"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> The amendments go to the heart of an important
part of the Bill and are vital to the powers of bailiffs. I can deal
with amendment No. 97 fairly swiftly. Our aim is to prevent bailiffs
using entry methods that might be in any way underhand or
unconscionable. Anyone who saw the recent BBC
&#147;Whistleblower&#148; programme on bailiffs would have noticed
with dismay bailiffs gaining access through windows and managing to get
their foot inside the door when it was half open. That is why I wish to
insert a reference to</div>
					<a name="07032064000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;normal methods and places of
entry used by visitors to the
premises.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words, getting in through an attic window or a window at the back of a
house is simply not acceptable. Amendment No. 97 is a bit out on a limb
from the others in the group.</div>
					<a name="07032064000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 98 is important.
The schedule contains the heading &#147;General powers to use
reasonable force&#148; and in the following paragraphs, the
Government give bailiffs a general power to use reasonable force. Our
amendment would strike out paragraphs 17 to 22, thus removing that
heading and another, &#147;Application for power to use reasonable
force&#148;, and the paragraphs to which they apply. We would
reinsert the title &#147;Application for power to use reasonable
force&#148; and our own remodelled paragraphs, which make it clear
what the bailiff can do. I shall not run through it in a lot of detail,
as it is there in the amendment for members of the Committee to look at
carefully, but I shall pick up on a few points. We say in the
amendment:</div>
					<a name="07032064000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
paragraph applies if an enforcement agent has the power to enter the
premises under paragraph 14 or 16 or under a warrant under paragraph
15.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 14, of
course, concerns entry without warrant, paragraph 16 concerns re-entry
and paragraph 15 concerns entry under a warrant. The amendment goes
on:</div>
					<a name="07032064000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the
creditor applies to the court, it may issue a warrant authorising an
enforcement agent to use, if necessary, reasonable force to enter the
premises for the purpose of taking control of goods... The court
may issue a warrant under sub-paragraph (2) only if it is satisfied
that there are exceptional
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
put the emphasis on the requirement for exceptional
circumstances.</div>

					<a name="07032064000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
goes on to require that</div>
					<a name="07032064000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In considering whether
to issue a warrant under sub-paragraph (2), the court shall have regard
to the matters set out in sub-paragraph
(5)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those matters are
listed in a way in which that would be helpful to the implementation of
the system, as
follows:</div>
					<a name="07032064000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those
matters
are&#151;</div>
					<a name="07032064000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) the
nature of the debt</div>
					<a name="07032064000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
whether the debtor resides at the premises specified in the
application</div>
					<a name="07032064000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
whether the debtor carries on a trade or business at those
premises</div>
					<a name="07032064000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d) the
personal financial circumstances of a debtor and their
family.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
goes on to list a few more items for consideration and goes on to
define &#147;exceptional circumstances&#148; as:</div>
					<a name="07032064000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) that the debtor has
been given a reasonable opportunity to repay by affordable instalments
but has deliberately or wilfully chosen not to do
so;</div>
					<a name="07032064000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) that the
debtor is not a vulnerable
person;</div>
					<a name="07032064000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) that there
is a reasonable prospect that the sum recovered from the sale of a
debtor&#146;s goods would be at least be equal to an amount
prescribed by order of the Lord
Chancellor.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would also tidy up other provisions.</div>
					<a name="07032064000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 100 would remove
paragraph 24, which appears under the title &#147;Other provisions
about powers of entry&#148;. Sub-paragraph (1)
states:</div>
					<a name="07032064000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
power to enter and any power to use force are subject to any
restriction imposed by or under
regulations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sub-paragraph
(2) states:</div>
					<a name="07032064000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
power to use force does not include power to use force against persons,
except to the extent that regulations provide that it
does&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">which, it seems to
me, is extremely verbose. We wish to take those paragraphs out and
insert the text of the amendment so that sub-paragraph (1) would
read:</div>
					<a name="07032064000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in this Act shall permit the entry by force to a dwelling house by a
civil enforcement agent where...the door is locked or secured

					<a name="07032064000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment also
proposes a paragraph (3) that mentions a number of important
points.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>
					<a name="07032064000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 99 would preserve
the common law rights that restrict entry by force. Why is that so
important? There are a number of reasons. The Bill as it stands will
overturn two fundamental principles of our common law on
bailiffs&#146; power to enter private property: that bailiffs may
only enter peaceably and with the permission of the debtor. Those
rights are fundamental.</div>
					<a name="07032064000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">That force may not be used to
effect entry has been established in law since at least the 14th
century. The case most often cited in relation to the rule that an
Englishman&#146;s home is his castle is Semayne&#146;s case. That
laid down very clearly that an individual householder has every right
to deny entry to a bailiff or agent of the Crown. There have been many
famous comments on the case, but none are as well known as that from
William Pitt the Elder, first Earl of Chatham. It is a classic passage
that sums up why it is so important to preserve that part of common
law. In Southam <i class="I">v.</i> Smout in 1964, Lord Denning quoted Pitt, who
said:</div>
					<a name="07032064000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;The
poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the
Crown. It may be frail&#151;its roof may shake&#151;the wind may
blow through it&#151;the storm may enter&#151;the rain may
enter&#151;but the King of England cannot enter&#151;all his force
dares not cross the threshold of the ruined
tenement&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
there are circumstances in which the police can launch dawn raids on
people&#146;s property and in which the uniformed services of this
country can enter a property, but that established right in our common
law makes it clear that if entry is refused, force may not be used to
make that entry.</div>
					<a name="07032064000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth bearing in mind that, in that respect, the pass was arguably
sold in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which
introduced the right of forcible entry in respect of some fines levied
under that Act. We are asking for that implicit reversal of common law
to be overturned. We feel that that is important, because it goes to
the heart of the protection that people need. We are talking about some
of the most vulnerable people in society. If we are to give them more
power, surely that common law right should be
reinstated.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000438"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I am sympathetic to not giving up people&#146;s
right to resist other people entering their property to enforce civil
debts and so on, but I have also believed for a long time that we ought
to codify our law so that people can find it all in one place. Is not
the weakness of the argument for keeping the common law as it is the
old problem that people will not know what the law is as clearly as if
it were all written down in one place? I do not dissent from the
objective, but I am concerned about the
means.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000439"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> That is a fair point, and one could
debate it. It is a pretty academic subject, but I submit that if we use
amendment No. 99 to preserve the common law rights, combine it with
amendment No. 98&#151;which would rewrite the application for power
to use reasonable force and which the hon. Gentleman signed, for which
I am grateful to him&#151;and combine their provisions with the
changes made by amendment No. 100, the package that we are presenting
for inclusion in the Bill would provide extra protection, which would
not otherwise be available.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>
					<a name="07032064000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should mention the other
common law right that the Bill will overturn. The first common law
right that I mentioned in connection with Semayne&#146;s case is one
on which the pass was sold in the 2004 legislation, but as I understand
it, at present, entry may take place only with the permission of the
occupier. Paragraph 14 of schedule 12 aims to overturn that right, and
I ask the Minister to comment on that. I submit that if bailiffs are
granted a power to enter or remain against the wishes of the occupier,
they will actually be in a more privileged position than police
officers executing warrants of arrest, despite the fact that they will
be immeasurably less well regulated and disciplined than constables. I
find that worrying. The provision needs to be discussed and debated in
detail.</div>
					<a name="07032064000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to test your patience, Mr. Bercow, by considering what
regulation we need. I would certainly regard clauses on regulating and
rewriting the certification system as part of a wider response to the
Bill to help people in a vulnerable position. We are discussing people
who are facing crises in their lives&#151;those who have the bailiffs
on their doorsteps. Furthermore, bailiffs are to have more rights. In
that context, it is of fundamental importance that the Bill contain
more
protection.</div>
					<a name="07032064000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
legislators we should be extremely wary of overturning common law. I
understand the comments of the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey: common law is often difficult to understand and gives
lawyers a field day, and one can conclude that codification would be
better. However, if a Bill does not include appropriate codification,
and instead gives additional powers, the Opposition believe that it is
a retrograde step to tear up hundreds of years of common law. That is
why we are proposing the amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000440"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I shall make a short contribution now. After that
I believe that it would be helpful if the Minister were to put on the
record her understanding both of the current legal position regarding
citizens&#146; right not to open their doors and let people in, and
of the effect of the proposed change. The provisions that we are
considering are the most controversial in the Bill, and they combine
two elements. The first relates to the rights that people have to stop
others entering their property, and the second to the occasions on
which someone seeking entry has a right to use reasonable force. Will
the Minister explain the current status of the law and its defects, as
well as, in the context of amendment No. 98, the reason why paragraphs
17 to 22 and the following paragraphs should remain in the
Bill?</div>
					<a name="07032064000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
representations that I have seen suggest that bailiffs and the rest of
the enforcement fraternity do not want an additional right to use
reasonable force. They do not want to use any more force than the
criminal law allows. They fear that if they are given the right to use
reasonable force, altercations might be precipitated that might
escalate and make matters worse. At present, if someone lawfully enters
a house and someone else attacks them unreasonably, they are justified
in using force to defend themselves. However, my understanding is that
there is no lobby for the statutory availability of greater powers to
use force, as is being proposed.</div>

Baird:
						</b> The provision is not about the use of force on

powers to do anything to anyone behind the door. I therefore think that
there is an agreement between us. I am not dissenting from the

are two

						</b> As other people will hear and read the report of
this debate, it is very important to make it clear that we are not
talking about the use of force against people. We are talking about an
application to a judge to be permitted to use reasonable force to gain
entry under very confined circumstances, which we will talk about in a
minute. It is terribly important that we do not muddle the two uses of
force or we will mislead the public and worry them completely
unnecessarily.</div>

							<a name="07032064000448"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I am happy to ring-fence the debates separately.
May I make two additional points? In this group, amendment No. 97 makes
it clear that entry by an agent is restricted to what is described
as</div>
					<a name="07032064000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;normal methods and
places of entry used by visitors&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>
					<a name="07032064000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will be
sympathetic to that; it is the conventional argument. If an agent is
seeking entry, they should do so by knocking at the door or at the
French windows&#151;they are doors as well&#151;but it is not
acceptable for an agent to seek to get in by a window, a skylight, or
by the top window on the latch. They have to get in
conventionally.</div>
					<a name="07032064000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last point relates to the comment I made this morning about the
confusing nature of this part of the schedule. I was not seeking to
damn the whole of schedule 12. However, the sequence in this part of
the schedule and in paragraph 14 is confusing. I can see how the
draftspeople have sought to put this on paper. We start with a section
called &#147;Entry without warrant&#148;, then &#147;Entry under
warrant&#148; and then &#147;Re-entry&#148;. I understand that
triple division. Then there are paragraphs on</div>
					<a name="07032064000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;General powers to use reasonable
force&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyone who does
not carry around a copy of &#147;Halsbury&#146;s Statutes&#148;
would probably not understand what that means, because it implies that
there is a general reference to powers to enter the premises under two
earlier paragraphs or under a warrant under another paragraph. There is
then a power to enter under an enforcement power conferred by the
Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980 and another power, which is an
entitlement to execute the warrant by virtue of two other sections of
the 1980 Act. Then there is a whole set of conditions.</div>
					<a name="07032064000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule then goes back to
talk out of sequence about the fact that an agent would need to apply
for permission. Therefore, if we are really trying to clarify the law
and represent what the public wants, we must start with the presumption
that people cannot enter someone else&#146;s property. After that, we
have to set out the occasions when they can. Before that, however, we
need to set out the procedure that gives people permission to enter
someone else&#146;s property. Therefore, we say that people cannot
come in.</div>
					<a name="07032064000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an agent
goes to court, however, and makes the case&#151;that is the subject
of another amendment in this group&#151;and they persuade the judge
of the circumstances, they will be given permission to go in. If the
agent goes in, they are entitled to go in by the front door or the
French windows. They are even entitled to push the door in. I make my
case for that in a constructive way. That is one of the most
fundamental bits of our unwritten constitution. The civil liberties of
people in their own homes include having their own territory, which is
not entered into by other people, other than in the most exceptional
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07032064000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I,
like the Minister, am arguing that we should seek to consolidate and
codify&#151;I generally start from that proposition&#151;we need to
be doubly clear about what we mean. If the legislation goes through, my
presumption is that common law will not be as easily prayed in aid, so
we must ensure that the guarantees that make the Englishman&#146;s
home his castle&#151;or, as discussed in the Lords, the
Welshman&#146;s home his castle&#151;are defined in a way that
everyone understands. That is my reflection. Will the Minister help us
by setting out the law, common law and all, and the changes to the law
and whether we are right in thinking that the measure disadvantages the
civil liberties of a citizen, because it takes away some of their
current rights?</div>

						</b> I should be intrigued to know what it said. I shall
deal with that point presently, but my hon. Friend has put her finger
on the next point with characteristic accuracy. It is highly germane to
the amendment, and I shall state the Government&#146;s position.
First, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk referred to what he
called a separate point in amendment No. 97, to which the hon. Member
for Newbury has just referred. The amendment would restrict entry to
normal methods of entry&#151;through doors and French windows. We
will undertake exactly that provision, and regulations in paragraph
14(3) will restrict that entry.</div>
					<a name="07032064000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remaining amendments in the
group are amendments Nos. 97, 99, 128 and 129, and the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk has said little enough about the latter two. Their
essence is the preservation of common law rights, but the trouble is
that, if those rights are preserved, they will also preserve the modes
of entry discussed by the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey. In certain circumstances, using a skylight or getting a
foot in the door to enter are not violations of the law, but elements
of the common law that bailiffs have gained over the years. It is
imperative that we repeal and take out of use all that common law, so
that there is no mistaking bailiffs&#146; powers, which will comprise
those in schedule 12 and in the Bill, and no others at all. That is the
way forward.</div>

								Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> If entry to a premises by what I would
describe as unconventional methods is established in common law, I
accept entirely what the Minister says. However, I should like her to
focus on the two areas of common law in which force may not be used to
effect entry and in which entry may not take place without the
occupier&#146;s permission, because they are fundamental. Although
much of the Bill&#146;s codification is welcomed, if those two extra
items of common law were preserved, we would have a stronger Bill that
worked better in the interests of the wider
public.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000454"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I thought I had made it clear that if we were to
preserve the common law as the amendments request, we would preserve
the queer old precedents 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>that allow people to put their foot through the skylight and enter. They
are odd cases that have occurred over the years, and this stuff is very
old, as everybody has conceded, but the notion that oldness and
veneration are virtues is completely misplaced when it comes to such
matters. We must prescribe the way in which people can enter the
property and totally erase from the law the remaining modes of
entry.</div>

							<a name="07032064000455"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> The Minister is being very patient. We do not
want to turn this debate into a lawyer&#146;s discussion, although I
appreciate that she is a learned QC and I am only an unknown junior.
Would she be more sympathetic to the amendment if we had proposed
preserving one or two of the more fundamental common-law rights, rather
than all of them? I entirely take on board her point about preserving
all common-law rights, because doing so would have the consequences
that she has outlined. In the spirit of a probing amendment, we are
discussing the issues around the amendment, so would the Minister be
happy to preserve any of the common-law rights that currently
apply?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000456"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> No; the purpose of the legislation, as has been
said many times, is to consolidate and clarify bailiff law and put it
all in one place. It should be in everyone&#146;s interests that that
law should be easily accessible, in much the same way as we discussed
during this morning&#146;s sitting the need for complete
accessibility to what the law is generally.</div>
					<a name="07032064000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the long-standing
objective of the civil enforcement review to make enforcement law
completely straightforward and understandable, and the Bill will
achieve that. It will put in one piece of legislation a consolidated
code of enforcement agent law, setting out the legal structure for
virtually all the enforcement of civil debts, judgments and criminal
fines. The Bill is written in terms that clearly outline the rights and
responsibilities of creditors, debtors and enforcement agents alike,
and it is written in good statutory language.</div>
					<a name="07032064000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Even picking
and choosing which common-law rights to retain&#151;that is certainly
not what the amendment provides for&#151;would run contrary to the
main objective of the Bill. One would then have to run through the
precedents to try to find out whether somebody was indeed allowed to
make a queer entry in 1384, or whether we had repealed that
incidentally, as part of getting rid of another precedent. Chapter 1 of
part 3 will replace all the common-law rules on the exercise of the
powers that, under chapter 3, will become the powers to use the
procedure as set out in schedule 12. That is the situation, and it is
our deliberate
intention.</div>
					<a name="07032064000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk talked about paragraph 14 of schedule 12
overturning the common law that a debtor&#146;s permission is needed.
Under paragraph 14, a debtor must agree to entry when an approach is
first made, so people cannot disregard the need for a person&#146;s
authority to enter. They must ask first and then use the powers under
paragraph 14. People will be able to apply to the court only if they
cannot gain entry in any other way. However, people cannot disregard
what a creditor says 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>and run in&#151;of course not; they should try peaceful means first,
and if the creditor agrees, that is the end of the matter.</div>
					<a name="07032064000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most people agree to let
bailiffs in for the purposes of making an inventory or enforcing a
controlled goods agreement. If the creditor does not agree, however,
one has recourse to the court. Only the court can authorise a single
step further. It is hugely important to say that strongly and
repeatedly. Although it has been put out by responsible bodies, an
impression has been created at large that we are licensing bailiffs to
knock once and then break in. That is completely contrary to what we
are
doing.</div>

Hughes:
						</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central
just pointed out to me that the sequence that the Minister has
described is not clearly set out in the schedule. The sequence that she
has outlined is that the bailiff can knock on the door and is allowed
to enter if given permission to do so by the person behind it. That is
obvious&#151;it would apply to anyone knocking on a door. If the
person behind the door lets them in, they can go in. However, it is not
clear what right the citizen has to ask, &#147;Who are you?&#148;
and if the answer is &#147;I&#146;m a bailiff&#148; to say,
&#147;I&#146;m not letting you in&#148;, or what sequence of
events would have to happen next for that to be overruled. I put it to
the Minister that nobody reading the schedule would discover that. I am
with her in wanting to consolidate matters, but I ask her to look again
at the proposal, because it does not match the sequence that she
has set out.</div>

							<a name="07032064000458"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is wholly incorrect. For
example, paragraph 15 states:</div>
					<a name="07032064000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If an enforcement agent
applies to the court it may issue a
warrant&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div>
					<a name="07032064000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before issuing the
warrant the court must be satisfied that...conditions are
met&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">It then sets out
the conditions, the situation in which there may be re-entry and the
general power to use reasonable force. It provides that the application
to use reasonable force may be made if such authority exists under
paragraphs 14, 15 or 16&#151;I particularly alluded to paragraph
15&#151;and it goes on to say that a person may make an application
and there will be certain conditions, and so on. It is as clear as day
that a person has a right to do what they have to do, either under
warrant or in some other way. If they need further powers they must
apply to the court, when the conditions under which the court can even
consider their application come into play. That is not only
transparently clear as a sequence, but it is actually in sequence, so
it is not difficult to
follow.</div>
					<a name="07032064000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
want to mention a couple of other aspects of common law raised by the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk. Common law allows forced entry to
commercial premises and forced re-entry to domestic premises in certain
circumstances. If a person has obtained, under the ordinary provisions
and with the individual&#146;s permission, a walking possession
agreement&#151;its name will soon change&#151;and they withdraw
satisfied that the goods are secure but is then refused further entry,
they have a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>power to break in. The Englishman&#146;s castle is not totally
surrounded by a moat and high wall, as envisaged by Opposition Members
and various propagandists against the proposals, who, I venture to
suggest, have not entirely followed their
purpose.</div>
					<a name="07032064000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
Englishwoman wants to have a right to enforce her debts against
somebody and she does not want that person, whoever he may be, to be
able to defy her for ever, simply by closing his front door, when he
owes her money. This Englishwoman wants a right to be able to apply to
a judge and say, &#147;May my bailiff have permission under very
restricted circumstances to break in to get my money back?&#148; That
is what the proposal is about, and only that.</div>
					<a name="07032064000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to mention one more
thing before I turn to the change in powers. There has been much fairly
casual reference to the increase in bailiff powers. The phrase
&#147;reasonable force&#148; was also bandied about, although the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey and I have agreed that
we are talking only about force to break in. I make it clear that there
are no increases in bailiff powers in the Bill, save for this one: if,
in due course, there is a consultation exercise and anyone wants the
ability to use restraining force on an individual, that will be a
completely separate matter, and we will consult on it and consider it.
My best guess is that nobody would want that ability, as the right of
self-defence is sufficient to satisfy most people who have to deal with
others in heated situations.</div>
					<a name="07032064000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make it clear that
loose talk about increases in powers is inappropriate, because this
power is the only one and it is extremely heavily regulated, as I will
now describe. Its use must be fair and reasonable. It cannot be right
for a debtor to evade payment just by closing the door, thus making a
mockery of the creditor and the judge who has ruled that the debtor
must pay and of every other means of enforcing the will of justice
against that debtor. That simply cannot be
right.</div>
					<a name="07032064000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is to
be a right to enter someone&#146;s premises as a last resort, it must
be very carefully regulated. That is exactly what the Bill
allows&#151;a heavily circumscribed power of entry, using reasonable
force, with prior judicial authority. The necessary conditions for that
power include those to which I have alluded: under paragraphs 14, 16 or
15, a power to apply for consent to enter must already be in place,
which, in some circumstances, will require going to court for an
express warrant to enter the premises with consent. Those statutory
requirements must be complied with first.</div>
					<a name="07032064000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">After those conditions are met,
an application must be made to a judge. As all hon. Members who were
present on Second Reading know, there is a strict list of conditions to
which a judge must have regard before he or she can consider granting
leave to enter. They are outlined in paragraphs 149 and 150 of our
detailed policy statement on delegated powers, and they will be put
into regulations. If hon. Members think that further restrictions are
necessary, they should let us know and we will consider them. I had a
meeting with the citizens advice bureaux yesterday, and I think that I
satisfied them that those conditions will be enough, but that is not
the last word.</div>

					<a name="07032064000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a condition, the judge will
have to be satisfied</div>

					<a name="07032064000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

Can bailiffs use force in a different way when dealing with a fine, as

civil creditor, not a criminal fine debtor. I shall carry on to discuss

the Minister wants to talk about the powers in the Bill, but we are
talking about enforcement and bailiffs in the Bill as a whole. The
Minister argued that the Government want to put everything together, so
there seems to be a strong argument for putting all powers under
English and Welsh law in the same Bill from now on and for repealing
all previous legislation dealing with that&#151;both common law and
the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004&#151;and then
making a political decision on whether we want one form of process,
irrespective of whether the debt arises from a criminal fine or a civil
bailiff, or two different forms of process. What is the argument
against putting everything in the Bill and having one form of
process?</div>

							<a name="07032064000467"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> There is no argument against that, and it is in the
Bill. We have repealed, or will repeal, the provision and have put it
in the Bill for the sake of having everything under one roof. That is
important, because a great deal of concern has been raised about the
exercise of the powers, and it must be made clear how they will
function.</div>
					<a name="07032064000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
was about to say something that needs saying. In our original
proposals, the detailed policy statement on how we intend to use our
delegated powers set out two circumstances that the judge must look at
before granting the right to use reasonable force to enter. I have set
out all the conditions that he must consider. It is also provided that
the judge may then take other factors into account when making his
decision, including the size of the debt, the type of debt and any
other information about the debtor&#146;s personal circumstances.
Clearly, the third of the relevant paragraphs is the important one, and
I was able to assure a Labour Member on Second Reading that the
phrase</div>
					<a name="07032064000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other
information about the debtor&#146;s personal
circumstances&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">was
intended to embrace all aspects of vulnerability that he then raised
and which are recorded in <i class="I">Hansard</i>. I have made it clear that the
terminology is intended to be very
wide.</div>
					<a name="07032064000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I proposed to
Citizens Advice yesterday that we should change the reference in the
policy statement that</div>
					<a name="07032064000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The judge may also take
other factors into account when making his
decision&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07032064000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">so that the
judge must take those factors into account, to make the
individual&#146;s vulnerability&#151;the size and type of
debt&#151;a first order consideration and not an additional one. That
is important, and it will ensure that people are comfortable that a
judge must take into account every aspect of the individual when
considering whether reasonable force may be used to enter their house.
All their vulnerabilities will be taken into account before a judge
allows the use of
force.</div>
					<a name="07032064000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the judge may put conditions on the entry power. I note that when an
application is granted under paragraph 20(2) of schedule 12&#151;this
plays on an issue raised by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk this
morning&#151;the warrant given to the bailiff may require a constable
to assist the enforcement agent to execute the warrant. Paragraph 22
refers to &#147;any constable&#148;, which may be a useful adjunct
in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>circumstance that the hon. Gentleman was worried about this
morning&#151;namely, that if it were known that the debtor was a
women on her own or a women with children in the house, one could
ensure that a police officer also attended, preferably a female
officer. All sorts of conditions can be imposed to ensure that there is
no disproportionate treatment of anyone, whether vulnerable or not, but
that is particularly important when vulnerable people are
involved.</div>
					<a name="07032064000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury raised a hugely
important point. It has not yet had much airspace because it is yet to
be discussed, but the Government envisage the question of regulated
bailiffs as a double-decker process. As is well known, the Security
Industry Authority was not ready to take the responsibility to regulate
bailiffs, so that they could be part and parcel of the
Bill.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07032064000387"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="07032064000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
what I call a beefed-up version of the county court certification
process. That will require a lot of investigation by a county court
judge before he certifies a bailiff and the training to which I have
alluded in diversity, vulnerability and dealing with conflict
resolution. It should be a powerful source of regulation, but it will
not be as good as when bailiffs are regulated properly within the ambit
of the Private Security Industry Act 2001. The regulation will then be
as tight as one could hope and will provide as good a set of
protections as my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon rightly said
that the SIA has given to doormen.</div>
					<a name="07032064000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I intend that the power even to
apply to use reasonable force in domestic premises should not come into
force until the industry is properly regulated by the SIA. That is a
useful reassurance, and I hope that it comforts those who have been
concerned. That seems to be what the press release mentioned by the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said before I even
announced it. He is quite a remarkable man.</div>

							<b class="B">Anne
Snelgrove</b> (South Swindon) (Lab): I thank my hon. and
learned Friend for that reassurance. She will know from our discussions
this morning that concerns have been raised with me by my citizens
advice bureau about the powers of the SIA. It will reassure citizens
advice bureaux up and down the country if the regulations will not come
into force until the SIA is ready to take them
on.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000469"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I need to make it clear that what will not come
into force is the new power to apply for reasonable force to gain
entry. The application of the power under the Domestic Violence, Crime
and Victims Act 2004, which is to be transferred to this legislation,
will not be affected. Only that single example of how bailiffs&#146;
powers will be increased in the Bill will not come into force until the
industry is regulated by the SIA.</div>
					<a name="07032064000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I talked about amendment No.
97. The rest of the concerns of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk
rested&#151;I am not being unkind&#151;on tinkering with the
conditions under which we have said judges may grant the warrants and
putting those conditions on the face 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>of the Bill. We think that it is better not to have them in the Bill but
to have them in clearly set out regulatory forms, so that they can be
changed if they need to be. It is not impossible that we will put the
provisions into regulations and find that we want to add something
more. We could do that if they were in regulations, and we would not
have to legislate.</div>
					<a name="07032064000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 100 concerns the
powers to enforce a criminal fine. We intend not to reduce or remove
the powers in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, but to
bring them into the Bill. The introduction of those powers has played
an important role in the ongoing improvement in the recovery levels for
unpaid fines. My understanding is that the powers have not been used
often, but the fact that they exist has played a significant role. As
my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales said in closing
the debate on Second Reading, they have been used sparingly.</div>
					<a name="07032064000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no intention to
introduce any new power that would allow physical body searches on a
debtor, or forcible coercion for the removal of clothing or jewellery
or wedding rings; neither is there any intention to force debtors to do
anything against their will. That includes not removing debtors from
premises and not escorting them to other premises where they might be
holding goods.</div>
					<a name="07032064000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not sure whether the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk addressed
amendment No. 101 and the following amendments in the
group.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000470"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> In fact, amendments Nos. 101 to 104 are all
concerned with consequential deletions, as are amendments Nos. 128 and
129. They flow from the earlier key amendments, which I
addressed.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000471"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> One or two of them go a tiny bit further. For
instance, amendment No. 101 would restrict the people who were
permitted to accompany an enforcement agent on entry. The point of
allowing agents to be accompanied is that if one goes into large
business premises to take an inventory, one needs to take another
person, or possibly two or three people. For that reason, we do not
want the amendment to proceed. The enforcement agent would of course be
responsible for the actions of those who accompanied him to assist in
the exercise of his powers unless those accompanying the agent did
something absolutely outwith the ambit of the exercise. If an
individual hit somebody, for instance, it would be he rather than the
bailiff who was responsible.</div>
					<a name="07032064000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is sometimes necessary to
take a locksmith to assist with the removal of locks and thereby avoid
a more brutal, forced entry. Enforcement agents therefore need to be
able to call for assistance. Amendments Nos. 102 and 103 would restrict
their ability to take equipment on to premises and, if necessary, leave
it there. However, the type and nature of the goods and assets in the
commercial and industrial premises of some large-scale businesses mean
that an enforcement agent often has to take equipment on to premises to
get access to goods, take control of them or secure or immobilise them.
That might require the carrying of tools for the purpose and the
leaving of equipment on the premises. There seems to be no reason why
we should restrict that ability&#151;it is part and parcel of
entering premises.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>
					<a name="07032064000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 104 concerns the
way in which reasonable force can be used to control goods on the
highway, but the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has not mentioned
it at all, so I imagine that having probed what he wanted to probe by
means of the other amendments he intends not to press
it.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members now feel secure that the single increase in
bailiff power will not come into force until the whole industry is
properly regulated and governed by a judge. That judge
will&#151;himself or herself&#151;operate under strict conditions,
including a requirement to have due regard to the vulnerability of the
individuals involved. I hope that the amendments will therefore not be
pressed.</div>

							<a name="07032064000472"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b>
						In answer to the
Minister&#146;s question, it was not my press release or news release
from the Department for Constitutional Affairs&#151;it was hers. It
is not timed, but it has today&#146;s date. It gave me the exciting
anticipation that the Minister was going to make an announcement. It
also meant that the question planted with the hon. Member for
Islington, South and Finsbury was entirely expected, and I was ready
for it. Nevertheless, I am very glad that we had both the paper version
and the spoken words on the same
day.</div>
					<a name="07032064000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
to the substance of the matter, I am pleased that, regardless of our
debate on the merits, the Minister has accepted that the powers will
not come into force until the new system is in place. I shall talk to
my colleagues and no doubt the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk will
talk to his. I think that the Minister is right&#151;the powers
passed by Parliament under the 2004 Act were in general
supported across the House. There may be a view that they ought also to
be encompassed in the general regulatory framework, but that is a
matter to which Liberal Democrat Members will return.</div>
					<a name="07032064000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has been
straightforward in telling the Committee that the proposal is a step
forward and puts on a statutory basis further powers for bailiffs to
obtain permission from the courts to enter people&#146;s houses in
certain circumstances. That is clearly the case. I know that the
Minister has not accepted the point, and I shall not argue line by line
with her now, but my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central and I
still contend, as would most people who examined the proposals, that
the schedule, the sequence and the conditions could be much clearer and
much more
straightforward.</div>
					<a name="07032064000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, have examined the detailed policy statements and delegated powers
that anticipate what is coming. I am glad that the Minister anticipates
saying that judges &#147;must&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;
take things into account. The more I hear of this debate, the more I am
clear about the fact that the conditions that the judge must apply
before granting permission should be in the Bill. Unless I have
misinterpreted things, that is exactly what the Joint Committee on
Human Rights said when it examined this part of the legislation. I
understand that it recommended that both Houses examine these matters
again, using the normal and fairly courteous phrase that it draws them
to the &#147;attention of both Houses&#148;. It clearly argues that
such conditions ought to be in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07032064000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2.31 of that
Committee&#146;s fifth report of session 2006-07, published on 12
February, states:</div>
					<a name="07032064000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We reiterate our view
that where safeguards are necessary to ensure the protection of
Convention rights, those safeguards 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>ought to be clearly identified on the face of the Bill. In cases where
the State is using, or authorising the use of, intrusive powers such as
entry, search and seizure, we consider that the case for including
minimum safeguards (such as the requirement that an enforcement agent
should identify himself and the authority for his entry the premises to
an occupier without need for a request; the minimum period of notice
required; the requirement that entry take place at a
&#145;reasonable&#146; time, and protection for material subject to
legal professional privilege) on the face of primary legislation is
particularly strong. We draw this to the attention of both
Houses.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that many of those things are in the schedule, but people ought
to be able to find the law setting out what happens when somebody goes
to court requesting permission to enter the house of Vera Baird QC MP,
John Bercow MP or Henry Bellingham MP in an Act of Parliament, so that
they know the score and the process. Such things are not variables, and
we will not be coming back to them every two minutes; they are not
detailed procedural matters.</div>
					<a name="07032064000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sorts of things that seem
to be fundamental preconditions, without prejudice to the general
argument, are: that other methods of enforcement have failed; that the
property is inhabited by the debtor; that normal entry attempts have
been unsuccessful; and that there is reason to believe that suitable
goods should be on the premises. I see no reason why such things cannot
be provided for in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07032064000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not one of those people
who argue that we have more and more legislation and more and more
stuff in it, but people&#146;s rights and liberties&#151;the right
of people to close their door to someone and the right of others to
enter a person&#146;s home&#151;are among the rare cases where one
should start from the presumption that the relevant provision is made
in an Act of Parliament that someone can refer to, examine and
know.</div>
					<a name="07032064000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk started by saying, we are discussing an
area of great legal tradition and the historic and famous presumption
that an Englishman&#146;s home is his castle. If we are changing
that, even in limited additional circumstances, we must do so
explicitly in the Bill, and not in regulations, whenever they may come
into
force.</div>

							<a name="07032064000473"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> We obviously need to try to make some
progress. I appreciate what the Minister said about a judge having to
take into consideration what will be in the regulations and common law.
We could debate this for a long time. In spite of what she
said&#151;I support the argument of the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey&#151;many of the provisions under the
headings &#147;General powers to use reasonable force&#148; and
&#147;Application for power to use reasonable force&#148; are
vague. The schedule gives substantial new powers and, even having
listened to the hon. and learned Lady, I believe that there is an
argument for her accepting amendment No. 98 to which the hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey has added his name. It is our wish
to press it to a Division so, on that basis, I want to withdraw
amendments Nos. 97, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 128 and
129.</div>
					<a name="07032064000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I wish
to put some quick points to the Minister. We have discussed force being
used, but the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>Bill prohibits force against a person by bailiffs unless permitted by
regulations. My concern is that regulations might permit restraint
against debtors who interfere with the seizure of their goods.
Different trade associations were worried about that force. What effect
will the new proposal have on Wheatham orders that have been signed by
magistrates courts? Will the Minister clarify the situation? Despite
what she has said, I am not satisfied with the response that we have
received to amendment No. 98 because the way in which this part of the
Bill is written will provide more specific
protection.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000474"></a>Vera

						</b> I shall deal first with the issues raised by the
Joint Committee on Human Rights, and will quote what it said as the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey did. It
stated:</div>
					<a name="07032064000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
cases where the State is using, or authorising the use of, intrusive
powers...minimum safeguards (such as the requirement that an
enforcement agent should identify himself and the authority for his
entry on the premises to an occupier without need for a request; the
minimum period of notice required; the requirement that entry take
place at a &#145;reasonable&#146; time, and protection for material
subject to legal professional
privilege)&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">should be
included on the face of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07032064000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 26 states that the
enforcement agent should be asked to prove his identity. He has to show
his authority to be on the premises. Under paragraph 8, he must provide
a notice as to what he is doing when he has entered the premises. The
times when an enforcement agent can call will be contained within
regulations, for the sake of flexibility. Again, that seems pretty
sensible. We have met the demands of the JCHR, save for the protection
of materials subject to legal professional privilege, which is a fairly
arcane point to make. It is pretty unlikely that materials subject to
legal professional privilege are likely to be the target of a bailiff
looking for assets to realise or to freeze for future
realisation.</div>
					<a name="07032064000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

made under paragraph 34(4), covering the inventory of goods to be given
to the debtor when goods are seized, will include the provision for
ensuring that the inventory takes the form of a receipt for any cash
that an enforcement agent takes. I am happy to restate that commitment
today.</div>
					<a name="07032064000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should add,
however, that the schedule also deals with non-court debts such as tax
and commercial rents, so it would not make sense for an enforcement

Notwithstanding that fact, I hope that the reassurance that I have
given the hon. Gentleman will persuade him to withdraw the

							<a name="07032064000494"></a>Mr.
Kidney:
						</b> It is a pleasure to serve on a Committee chaired
by you, Mr. Bercow, with your assured touch and good humour.
Although you were not present this morning, I shall treasure for a very
long time the praise that I received from my hon. and learned Friend
the Minister for my perspicacity. However, on the very point to which
she referred, I should like to ask her a question before we approve the
schedule.</div>
					<a name="07032064000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning we discussed offences, and paragraph 68 includes a couple of
offences that relate to the obstruction of enforcement agents carrying
out their lawful duties. My hon. and learned Friend mentioned paragraph
66 as including the remedies that are available to a debtor who feels
wronged by the actions of an enforcement agent. I thought that she had
said &#147;offences&#148;, and that it was a slip of the tongue,
but when I pointed it out, she said that she had meant
&#147;remedies&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 62 is about cost, and
my hon. and learned Friend said this morning that there will be
regulations so that enforcement agents do not make up fees that they
say they are entitled to receive. In my time as an MP, the most common
complaint has been from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>constituents on the receiving end of such enforcement action, and in
fact, the most recent complaint was at my advice surgery just last
month, so it is a current and constant matter. My hon. and learned
Friend quoted some statistics about a high proportion of complaints on
that point, so when we have regulations that say that someone cannot
abuse their position of authority as an enforcement agent by claiming
costs and charges beyond the regulations, what will be the remedy? Will
debtors have to go to county court to stop them claiming that money, or
will they be able to do something more?</div>
					<a name="07032064000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to think that in
the most abusive cases a criminal offence will be deemed to have been
committed, and that in the least abusive cases there will be a remedy
such as alternative dispute resolution by which to solve the problem
there and then. Nowhere in the Bill, never mind in the schedule, do I
see any offences except the one in clause 58 about a person claiming to
be an enforcement agent when they do not have the authority to do so. I
cannot see any controls over them. My hon. Friend the Minister
mentioned the Security Industry Authority this morning. I know that
there is a consultation process about that organisation becoming the
licensing or regulatory body for enforcement agents, but I cannot see
anything to tie the Bill to that, if it happens, so how will people get
an easy, simply remedy when they think that they have been ripped off
by an enforcement
agent?</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000495"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I have two or three questions for the Minister,
two of which are along the same lines as those of the hon. Member for
Stafford. Like him, I discovered in clause 58&#151;I appreciate that
we will come to that clause later, but it is tied to the schedule so I
hope that you will permit these comments, Mr.
Bercow&#151;the proposed, presumably new, offence of purporting to
act as an enforcement agent. Is that the only new offence either in the
Bill or that is envisaged to apply to enforcement agents, bailiffs and
that family of individuals? There is an argument for considering what
the proper sanctions should be and how best to get the message out that
someone who abuses this power is likely to be caught. I assume that any
such criminal offence will be actionable in the normal way, with
someone making a complaint that the police then pursue, and would not
require the person to take action
themselves.</div>
					<a name="07032064000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
paragraph 68, &#147;Offences&#148;, there are four sub-paragraphs.
Sub-paragraph (1)
proposes:</div>
					<a name="07032064000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person is guilty of an offence if he intentionally obstructs a person
lawfully acting as an enforcement
agent.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sub-paragraph (2)
states:</div>
					<a name="07032064000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person is guilty of an offence if he intentionally interferes with
controlled goods without lawful
excuse.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rest of the
paragraph sets out what the penalties will be and makes adjustments in
relation to a transition period. Are those two offences new or are they
existing offences that have been pulled from elsewhere? Are they the
only offences that can be committed by a debtor as a consequence of
this legislation?</div>
					<a name="07032064000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last point is about paragraph 66. Like the hon. Member for Stafford,
and probably every other hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>Member who has constituents come and see him or her, one of the most
frequent complaints that I hear is that constituents cannot take action
against what they believe to be inappropriate behaviour. Clause 66 is
entitled &#147;Remedies available to the debtor&#148;, but the
sanctions in it strike me as being pretty bureaucratic and not very
user-friendly. People will have to bring proceedings</div>
					<a name="07032064000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the High Court, in relation to
an enforcement power under a writ of the High Court&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">or in a county court to take action. Is
there not an easier way of doing things without requiring people to go
through a long and complicated court process with a course of action, a
claim, a defence and all the proceedings that come with that? Could not
these matters be better dealt with in the small claims court or with
some form of arbitration&#151;somewhere where there is a civil
remedy? I am asking a question rather than making a
suggestion.</div>
					<a name="07032064000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
the Minister and the Committee have heard our concerns about the
schedule not being nearly as user-friendly or straightforward as it
could be. Some parts of the schedule are welcome. Given that, it would
be inappropriate to press for a Division. My hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, Central and I will therefore seek to work with our colleagues
and to persuade the Minister before Report that there are better ways
in which to set out the new plan presented in the schedule. We reserve
our position. I wish to put on the record that we are not fully content
with the measure, but we hope that it can be improved at a later stage.
I would also be grateful for answers to the specific questions asked by
both me and the hon. Member for
Stafford.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000496"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I have one question for the Minister. Will she
tell the Committee whether the enforcement and collection of a fine
incurred for a criminal offence is a civil or criminal matter? I would
like her to clarify that point, because there has been some confusion,
and I felt that a debate about the schedule as a whole was the
appropriate time to ask that question. Other than that, as we have
discussed the schedule at great length through the various groups of
amendments, I have no further questions.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000497"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> Watch my lips: it is criminal. Certainly, I agree
that, if possible, mediation or alternative dispute resolution should
be involved in issues concerning the excessive use of bailiffs&#146;
powers and fees to short-circuit the current route, which is none the
less pretty plain. It was a slip of the tongue that led me to say
&#147;remedies&#148;&#151;I read my note too quickly and did not
think, but I am a lawyer and I know the difference between a remedy and
a criminal offence. The remedies in paragraph 66 allow an individual to
come back to the court that granted an authority and to make a claim
that the fees charged were too high.</div>
					<a name="07032064000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There will,
however, be some changes. Up-front fees will be paid to bailiffs so
that they can no longer rely on the cut, as it were, that they take
from recovered money. That ought to take the bite out of the kind of
complaints of which both I and my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford
are aware. The fees that bailiffs charge will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>fixed and made public, so they should be known. However, one would have
to go back to the court that gave an authority to try to get some
resolution. It is important that we try to include mediation and
alternative dispute resolution in that, which I accept completely. The
Government are committed to the whole notion of mediation and
alternative dispute resolution because they help to avoid the stress of
court proceedings and enable simple recovery.</div>
					<a name="07032064000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall answer some of the
questions asked by members of the Committee. It is correct that clause
58 contains the only new offence. Disputed amounts will be assessed by
the court, as I mentioned. Offences under paragraph 68 are offences
against the enforcement agent and no others, and the remedies are as I
stated. I hope that I have covered everything asked of me, and I
commend the schedule to the Committee.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000502"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Bercow,
for protection from the hubbub emanating from that direction. It is
never easy to develop an argument in the context of a substantial
hubbub.</div>
					<a name="07032064000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall try to
be brief, because I do not want to go in great detail through all the
arguments for regulation&#151;they were discussed at some length in
the other place and on Second Reading&#151;but I should mention that
a number of people have underlined the need for outside regulation,
including the Enforcement Law Reform Group and the indomitable
Mr. Philip Evans in representations. I hope that I did not
see someone shaking their head at the name of Philip Evans. He has been
most helpful in briefing Committee
members.</div>
					<a name="07032064000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The National
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, or Citizens Advice as it is now
called, has lobbied MPs up and down the country to express its concern
about the Bill&#146;s provisions and its belief that in the context
of giving bailiffs extra power, a system of outside regulation should
be introduced. The Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, about which we have heard, has
been helpful and assiduous in ensuring that we have been properly
briefed on those aspects of the Bill affecting vulnerable people. The
Enforcement Services Association and the Association of Civil
Enforcement Agencies also take the view that there should be outside
regulation.</div>
					<a name="07032064000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
original enforcement Green Paper argued strongly for independent
outside regulation. That was endorsed by Professor J. Beatson,
professor of public law at Cambridge university. He produced a report
for the Lord Chancellor in 2000, on which I believe the Green Paper was
partly based, in which he made it clear that he felt strongly that
independent regulation of bailiffs was necessary. The arguments are
strong if one considers the extra powers that bailiffs will be given.
When the Minister joined the debate on the last group of amendments,
she said that the extra powers are quite minimal and will concentrate
around one key area, but I submit that they are considerable.</div>
					<a name="07032064000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in a society in which
more and more debt is building up. The amount of debt in private
households in this country is now quite frightening. We hear day in and
day out in our constituencies of families that get themselves into
debt, go to loan sharks, try to pay off the debt using additional
credit cards and get into a spiral of increasing debt. We all know of
terrible examples of families that started off with quite a modest debt
that became impossible.</div>
					<a name="07032064000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Later in the
Bill, we shall come to the proposed new arrangements to help people who
end up in serious 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>debt. However, the problem is that in society when there is debt,
creditors have the right to enforce and collect it. We could be talking
about private individuals; debts could be owed to them. Debts may also
be owed to corporate entities, companies or Departments. As debt builds
up, so collections increase and the activities of the
bailiffs&#151;both Crown and private&#151;also increase in a
commensurate fashion.</div>
					<a name="07032064000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the next few years, more and
more work will be done by bailiffs. We have talked at length about how
only a small minority of bailiffs abuse the system and represent
themselves, wrongly, as having powers that they do not have. Only a
small minority will behave in an aggressive and intimidating fashion.
Nevertheless, we all know that such things happen, and they happen
because of human nature.</div>
					<a name="07032064000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we certainly agree
with the Minister that it is a good idea to codify the rights and
powers of bailiffs in one place in the Bill, there is an overwhelming
case for outside, independent regulation by a body that could lay down
exactly what could and should not be done and was able to issue
licences. Furthermore, as well as issuing licences, that body would
have the power to take them away and discipline the bailiffs in
question completely independently.</div>
					<a name="07032064000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister suggested that
that role can be fulfilled by the Security Industry Authority. We
understand that the SIA is not keen to take on that role; that has been
reported to me by a number of the different organisations that I
mentioned earlier. If the Minister says categorically that the SIA is
happy to take on that role, I will be slightly more
reassured.</div>
					<a name="07032064000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
important point is that the SIA will be regulating only private
bailiffs, not Government bailiffs, the Crown agents. We propose an
independent outside regulator to regulate all bailiffs. The arguments
in favour of that approach are overwhelming. If we are going to give
bailiffs more power, if their activities increase&#151;as will
inevitably happen in a society where debt is building up&#151;and if
we are to protect creditors, as we have to do in any market economy, I
am afraid that there will be more examples of vulnerable people being
oppressed and maltreated and more people will come to our surgeries
complaining. That is why we need proper outside regulation.</div>
					<a name="07032064000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask the Minister
about one more important point. The Bill introduces a new certification
procedure for bailiffs. I understand that Ministers have made it clear
that the proposals will cover all private bailiffs. However, I gather
that the proposals will not do that. The Enforcement Law Reform Group
said:</div>
					<a name="07032064000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
could, in fact, exempt any bailiff the Lord Chancellor chooses but I
expect it will be used to exempt county court bailiffs (who are civil
servants) and the private bailiffs authorised to enforce High Court
orders.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister clarify that
point?</div>
					<a name="07032064000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">As legislators,
it is vital that we should act in good faith and do all we can to help
those in society who deserve extra protection. I would not like to go
away from this Committee and the deliberations on this Bill without
being able to sleep more quietly at night, knowing that, rather than
having an SIA that will regulate only private bailiffs, we will have a
proper system of overarching, overall regulation of the entire bailiff
industry.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): It is a delight to serve
under your chairmanship once more, Mr. Bercow, and I
apologise for the hubbub, which was entirely the fault of my hon.
Friend the Member for Bristol,
North-West.</div>
					<a name="07032064000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek
clarification as to whether the consultation on the regulation of
enforcement agents is running in parallel with the Bill. As the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk said, the notion of the regulation being
undertaken by the SIA seems to be the main idea that comes from that
consultation, and I have considerable sympathy with what he said about
proper, transparent and accountable regulation by an independent body.
Can the Minister clarify whether there has been an overwhelming
response to the effect that there should be a different form of
independent body to deal with the vagaries of the bailiff system, and
if so, whether that can be incorporated in legislation? I refer not to
the primary legislation, which I hope will already have been enacted,
but secondary legislation, to make the changes that give us an
independent body to which bailiffs will be
accountable.</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000504"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I commend the attempts that have been made to link
the implementation of this part of the legislation to a registration
system. My new clause is far shorter than that of the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk, so it should commend itself doubly to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07032064000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I have a
slightly philosophical dilemma, because I come from a tradition that
wants as little regulation as possible. I would normally, therefore,
resist the idea that we should give more powers to
regulators&#151;the state is already too oppressive rather than not
oppressive enough. However, we are talking here about people who are
empowered to interfere with people&#146;s homes and property, and
therefore with their civil liberties. It seems to me that, just as we
have tight legislation concerning what the police can do in such
circumstances, so we need a regulatory system that will ensure that
others with such powers are controlled. That is how I square the
political and philosophical circle.</div>
					<a name="07032064000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, this is an area in
which, as we have discussed, the public need to know that, where
possible, the people who have the power have a uniform. The Minister
was positive about that on Second Reading. Secondly, I am sympathetic
to the idea that there should be a limited number of categories.
Constables should not fall under the regulator, because they have
powers elsewhere and it would be inappropriate to suggest that they
should be subject to further regulation. Further, because this is an
enforcement mechanism, it is probably right to work on the basis that
anybody who works for the courts does not need to be separately
regulated. If the people working for the courts are not working
properly, we are in trouble. If this service is to be
contracted-out&#151;as, increasingly, it is&#151;it must be up to
the Courts Service, and above it the Department for Constitutional
Affairs, to ensure that those working on behalf of the courts system
have a good reputation.</div>
					<a name="07032064000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it seems reasonable
that others should be regulated. In that case, it is easier to think in
terms of people who work for Revenue and Customs as being in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>the same system as others who are neither police constables nor working
for the Courts Service. In any event, members of the public need to
know that those in authority can be identified not just by a piece of
paper but by their
uniforms.</div>
					<a name="07032064000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, on
who should do the regulating, we already have a Security Industry
Authority. My simple political principle suggests that it is better to
use an agency that exists, as long as it is more or less appropriate or
can be made so, than to create another organisation and therefore more
bureaucracy, more cost and more management. Therefore, I think that the
authority that we set up in 2001 is the right one. It has been going
for only a few years. It may need to be modified. It may need to be
rebranded slightly. It may need other changes. But let us use an agency
that we have.</div>
					<a name="07032064000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
obviously am sympathetic to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk. I am glad that we will link the system, but I
hope that the Minister can give us the assurance that there will not be
this interim period. At the moment we are in the slightly muddled
position that the Bill proposes one regime and then later down the
track there will be another regulated regime. We do not need the
interim stage. We could go from where we are to a regulated system. If
there is no interim period, it will make the regulated system come more
quickly because the pressure will be there to deliver it more quickly.
Finally, could the Minister reconsider having no new interim
arrangement and moving straight to regulation? What is the earliest
date that Ministers believe that a new regulated system can apply to
bailiffs, enforcement agents and the like?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000505"></a>
								Vera
Baird:
						</b> We intend to regulate this industry. The industry
itself wants to be regulated and the stakeholders who have made
representations to us, and almost all of those who have made
representations to fellow members of the Committee, want regulation.
And regulation there will be. There will be regulation as soon as it
can possibly be put in place. It will regulate those who are not court
or state employees. There are precious few complaints about them.
Citizens Advice makes it very clear that it is private bailiffs about
whom it complains and not court or state employees, who are, of course,
subject to civil service codes, discipline and complaints procedures
already. We think that that is sufficient.</div>
					<a name="07032064000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk is wrong to suggest that there will be an increase
in bailiff activity. I hope that there is good power in part 5 that
will help a lot of people to deal more adequately with their
indebtedness than in the past. That will obviate the need for this type
of action as much as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07032064000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government issued a joint consultancy partial regulatory impact
assessment exploring the cost and impact of regulation and setting out
the preferred option: that is the Security Industry Authority, which is
an agency of the Home Office. I should reiterate that implementing the
preferred option&#151;in other words, regulation by the
SIA&#151;can be achieved through secondary legislation. What is
required, as there is a structure in the Private Security Industry Act
2001, is to use secondary legislation to bring the bailiffs
into that structure. There will be an affirmative order, which the Home
Office intends to lay before the summer recess.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>
					<a name="07032064000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						After the
making of the affirmative order it will be for the Home Office and the
SIA to take regulation forward toward implementation after consulting
all the stakeholders. It is not appropriate to set, as the hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk does, a time limit because it is more important
to get it right for all parties. He can rely on us. We intend to move
as quickly as we possibly can. We are committed to regulation. The
interim solution, as it has been described by the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey, is important therefore in the meantime. There
are provisions in the Bill that it is imperative to introduce very
quickly. There must be a beefed up certification process to hold the
fort for us until we can bring in the SIA.</div>

							<a name="07032064000506"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Could the hon. and learned Lady help us with my
question about the timetable? What are the earliest and the latest
dates that the Government would expect the regulation under the SIA to
be
achieved?</div>
					
					<a name="07032064000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032064000507"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I do not think that I can be as specific as that.
The hon. Gentleman would not derive much assistance from the latest
date and we are not clear about the earliest date. Let me make it very
clear to the Committee that the political will is to do it as soon as
at all possible. We want regulation, and regulation we intend to bring
in.</div>
					<a name="07032064000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
have referred to the interim solution and said how important it is.
Contrary to what the hon. Gentleman said, there is a significant
difference between his amendment No. 160 and the amendment that the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has moved. Amendment No. 160 would
not allow any of the provisions of chapter 1 of part 3 to come into
force until the regulatory scheme was in place. That is wholly
undesirable, because chapter 1 introduces many valuable protections for
debtors, including fixed times and dates when enforcement agents can
call, limits to the methods of entry that they can use, exemption of
goods from seizure, a single fee structure and new remedies when
enforcement agents break the law. If amendment No. 160 were accepted,
many of the things that we discussed this morning that we currently do
not do and which urgently need to be brought into force would not come
into force.</div>
					<a name="07032064000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give
further reassurance, I shall repeat what I have already said. The only
increased power is the one that I have committed the Government to not
introducing until the full regulatory scheme is in force. The rest of
the Bill is all supportive of the fair use of bailiff procedures and is
intended to get rid of the anomalies and irregularities that have been
much quoted to me today and which I accept
occur.</div>
					<a name="07032064000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk suggested that the SIA was not keen to take the
task on. That is incorrect; furthermore, I have written to him to say
so. He suggested the same on Second Reading, so I wrote to him
afterwards to say,</div>
					<a name="07032064000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;you
suggested that the SIA was not keen to take on the work of licensing
enforcement agents. That is not the case. It has long been the
intention that the SIA would take on this work and the organisation is
now in a position to do
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must therefore
hasten to get the SIA to do exactly that.</div>

Bellingham:
						</b> I am very grateful to the Minister for
explaining things so clearly. We on the Conservative Benches feel
strongly about the issue and so hope to return to it on Report. We are
concerned that the SIA will regulate only private bailiffs. We feel
that our solution is better and would have more impact on protecting
those who need protection. However, we are certainly grateful to the
Minister for ensuring that those provisions in the Bill that create new
powers will not be commenced until the SIA procedures come into place.
That is a significant concession to those of us who have been arguing
the case strongly for some time, and it is always good to go away with
something. When the Minister reflects on this debate, I hope that she
will appreciate that members of the Committee and those interested in
the subject have worked hard together to try to improve the Bill.
However, on the basis of what she has said, I beg to ask leave to

Crown employees. I do not believe it to be necessary, and if it is
acceptable to the Committee, I shall give more detailed reasons in the
later debate.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>
					<a name="07032064000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 111 mirrors an
amendment moved on Report in the other place. The Bill gives the
collective title of &#147;enforcement agent&#148; to all who take
control of goods and sell them under a power in accordance with
schedule 12. The term will apply to county court bailiffs, High Court
enforcement officers, tax collectors, private bailiffs and anyone else
who is certificated under the enhanced and extended regime of clause 59
when taking control of
goods.</div>
					<a name="07032064000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
entirely sure of the point of the amendment, unless it is a concern
that people who now call themselves bailiffs will not be able to do so
in future. Many who work in the industry like to use the job title of
bailiff; they have got used to it. Let me clarify the matter: they can
still call themselves bailiffs if that is their job title. The
provision is not about changing titles. County court bailiffs will
still be county court bailiffs, High Court enforcement officers will
still have the same title, tax collectors will remain as such and so
on, but collectively they will all be called enforcement agents when
taking control of goods in accordance with schedule
12.</div>
					<a name="07032064000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would also create a new offence if a person knowingly or recklessly
describes himself as a bailiff in connection with enforcement by taking
control of goods or engaging in other debt collection activities
without being authorised to do so. As we are not creating a specific
and separate category of enforcement agent called a bailiff, it follows
that we do not need a separate offence to deal with those who describe
themselves as bailiffs. I hope that the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk will be satisfied that there is no need for those
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07032064000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendment No. 127, the hon. Gentleman proposes to make failure to
comply with regulations about certification a criminal offence. We do
not think that that is necessary. Application is made to a county
court, and the contents of the application form will be sworn on oath
before a judge. Examination of applicants on the details required by
the judge is carried out under oath, so contravention of the process
would amount to a contempt of court. That is an appropriate sanction
for dealing with such a contravention.</div>
					<a name="07032064000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 106 appears to
stipulate the provisions that must be contained in regulations. The
provisions in subsection (3) are an indicative list and set the minimum
provisions, and I would prefer to maintain that flexibility.</div>
					<a name="07032064000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The extra requirements in
amendment No. 107 are not necessary. We have committed to putting many
of them in regulations and much of their detail is in paragraph 194 of
the policy statement, to which I have referred extensively. The
provision of information to debtors is already contained specifically
in paragraphs 7 and 28 of schedule 12, to which extensive reference has
been made. The provision of identification by an enforcement agent to a
debtor is covered in paragraph 26 of the same schedule.</div>
					<a name="07032064000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prescribing insurance
requirements for individual agents may not be practical if bailiff
companies employ many agents. Agents will have to provide a bond anyway
as part of the certification process, and it will be used when
appropriate to pay compensation to debtors who successfully complain
about the actions of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>an enforcement agent. Paragraph 194 of the detailed policy statement
deals with that
issue.</div>
					<a name="07032064000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
109 is intended to regulate by order all agents who would be subject to
certification under regulations under clause 59 and, on the final point
made by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, proposes
that such an order-making power should be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure. I share the view of the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee in the other place that the negative
resolution procedure is appropriate for the purpose. I hope that hon.
Members will feel able not to press the
amendments.</div>

							<a name="07032064000517"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> The amendments would improve the Bill and they
make sense. Amendment No. 122 is purely a paving amendment. It would
remove the words &#147;one of these&#148; from clause 58(3), which
states:</div>
					<a name="07032064000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
individual is exempt if he acts in the course of his duty as one of
these&#151;</div>
					<a name="07032064000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) a
constable;</div>
					<a name="07032064000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) an
officer of Revenue and
Customs;</div>
					<a name="07032064000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) a person
appointed under section 2(1) of the Courts Act
2003&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 123
would remove paragraph (b), amendment No. 124 would remove paragraph
(c) and amendment No. 125 would remove subsection (4), which
states:</div>
					<a name="07032064000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
individual is exempt if he acts in the course of his duty as an officer
of a government
department.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032064000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 126 would remove subsection (5), which
states:</div>
					<a name="07032064000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of an enforcement power conferred by a warrant, an
individual is exempt if in relation to the warrant he is a civilian
enforcement officer&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
feel that there are too many exemptions. There are exemptions for
officers of Revenue and Customs, but do they not have enough power
already? There are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>exemptions for Government officers, and again we believe that that
extends the powers too far.</div>
					<a name="07032064000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to push the Minister on
one particular point. The essence of the clause is to introduce a new
certification procedure for bailiffs, and I return to a point that I
made a moment ago. Twice now, Ministers have told hon. Members that the
proposals will cover all private bailiffs, but I am not sure whether
that is 100 per cent. correct. Clause 58(3)(c), which we would
delete, exempts</div>
					<a name="07032064000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person
appointed under section 2(1) of the Courts Act
2003&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032064000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">That provision
could, in fact, exempt any bailiff whom the Lord Chancellor chooses. I
expect that it will be used to exempt county court bailiffs, who are
civil servants, and private bailiffs authorised under the relevant
paragraphs of schedule 12 to enforce High Court orders. I know that
that is a technical, tricky point, but perhaps the Minister could put
our minds at rest. In light of the fact that we are probing, will she
give me some comfort that the clause does not require the improvement
that I am
suggesting?</div>

								Vera
Baird:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 122 to 126 would mean that no
enforcement agents except police constables would be exempted from the
proposed enhanced and extended certification process. We believe that
there is no need for Crown employees to be certificated under this new
procedure, because they are already subject to suitable recruitment,
training and disciplinary procedures in their position as civil
servants. At present, the Department for Constitutional Affairs does
not have control over the training, conduct and discipline of private
enforcement agents, but it does have a very large amount of control
over its own enforcement staff.</div>
					<a name="07032064000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						County court
bailiffs, civilian enforcement officers and the magistrates court are
subject to civil service recruitment. The civil service code governs
their behaviour. They are subject to strict controls over their
conduct, subject to discipline under the civil service discipline
procedures and complaints against them can be made to the appropriate
court manager. They are also subject to continued training and
development provided by the Department, and they are now, of course,
subject to compulsory criminal record checks. We can therefore insist
that certain standards will be adhered to within our own Department,
but we have no such power in respect of private sector and local
authority enforcement agents; hence the need for compulsory
certification for those sectors of the industry.</div>
					<a name="07032064000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is widely acknowledged that
the private sector bailiffs are the source of most complaints about the
activities of enforcement agents. Figures from Citizens Advice indicate
that 93 or 94 per cent.&#151;it was certainly more than 90 per
cent.&#151;of the complaints that it receives about the behaviour of
bailiffs are about those employed in the private sector. Compulsory
certification is therefore aimed at the sector that is in most need of
regulation.</div>
					<a name="07032064000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
Crown-employed enforcement agents will be exempt from the new process,
I want to reiterate what my noble Friend Baroness Ashton said in the
other place on Third Reading. The Government are committed to ensuring
a common set of standards and a common appearance across the
enforcement industry. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>
					</div>
					<a name="07032064000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
is a footnote: the cost to the public purse of certificating all Crown
employees and the application process, bearing in mind the
&#163;10,000 bond that every certificated bailiff must put forward,
would be &#163;22 million. Given that few complaints are
made about those involved and that they are already closely tied to the
civil service code, and although I accept that cost will not be
determinative in any issues concerning the security of ordinary people,
that is none the less another important
point.</div>
					<a name="07032064000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
committed to ensuring common standards across the enforcement agencies,
and I hope that those reassurances will empower the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk to seek leave to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
