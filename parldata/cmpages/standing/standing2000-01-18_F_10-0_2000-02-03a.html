<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): On a point of order, Sir David. Will the Minister update us on the tabling of amendments on the rebate on stakeholder pension schemes?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I cannot do that now, but hope to provide some information this afternoon.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 75, line 39, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'6. The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for the application, in connection with child support maintenance payable following a variation, of paragraph 7(2) to (7) of Schedule 1 (subject to any prescribed modifications).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unlike many of the Government amendments, amendment No. 44 is not technical. It relates to applications for a variation from the normal rules by which child support maintenance will be calculated, and inserts a new paragraph into part II of schedule 4B of the Child Support Act 1991. The amendment forges an essential link between two key elements of the reformed scheme: variations and shared care.
<P>
Part I of schedule 1 of the 1991 Act, as substituted under clause 1, specifies the normal rules by which the weekly amount of child support maintenance will be calculated. Paragraph 7 of part I details the manner in which the liability may be adjusted when the care of the child is shared. New schedule 4A contains detailed provisions supplementing the rules governing applications for variations in new section 28A under clause 5. New schedule 4B specifies the cases and circumstances in which a variation may be allowed, and the regulatory controls governing the operation of the variations scheme.
<P>
As the Bill stands, the shared care rules may be applied only to cases in which the non-resident parent is liable to pay the basic reduced rate. They may not be applied when, as a result of a successful variation application, the non-resident parent is treated as having more--or less--income than would otherwise have been the case. The amendment corrects that omission by introducing a further regulation-making power in Schedule 4B which will allow the shared care rules to be applied, with prescribed modifications, to cases in which a variation of the normal rules by which the maintenance calculation is made has been agreed.
<P>
Without the amendment, two key elements of the new scheme would be prevented from working in tandem, as it would not be possible to apply the shared care provision to cases which are the subject of a variation. I am happy that I had notes to put that on the record clearly and openly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): That is a sensible move. Not to take such action would be an injustice, so we have no objection to the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 2, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Variations: revision and supersession</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 8, line 40, after '(1)' insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'An application for a variation may also be made when a maintenance calculation is in force.
<P>
(2)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 10 and 11.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The purpose of this group of amendments is as follows. Unlike the departures scheme, applicants will be able to apply for a variation at any time before, as well as after, a final maintenance calculation has been made. In general the revised legislation introduced by clause 5 deals specifically with applications made in these circumstances. Amendment No. 9 makes it clear that variation applications may also be made after a final decision on the maintenance calculation has been made and renumbers the existing subsection (1) of 28G. Amendment No. 10 adjusts the text of the existing subsection to reflect the effect of amendment No. 9. The purpose of amendment No. 11 is to correct an anomaly in the Bill as drafted. I am quite happy to explain the anomaly, but without amendment No. 11 the Secretary of State would be able to resurrect only those variations that form part of the current maintenance calculation that he now seeks to change. That was not intended.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 10, in page 8, line 45, leave out from beginning to end of line 46 and insert 'such applications'.
<P>
No. 11, in page 9, line 5, leave out 'the decision superseded' and insert 'an earlier decision'.--[Mr. Rooker.]
<P>
Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Revision of decisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 9, line 21, after 'may' insert '(if appropriate)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government Amendments Nos. 13 and 14.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> These amendments are purely for clarification. Clause 8 inserts new provisions in section 16 of the 1991 Act enabling a decision to be put in place about a default rate of maintenance liability that can be revised later if the relevant information becomes available so that a full maintenance calculation can be made. Amendment No. 12 makes a minor change to the new subsection. It just makes it clear that when the Secretary of State revises a default maintenance decision, it may be replaced by either a full maintenance or a default maintenance decision. Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 just put it beyond doubt that when the Secretary of State revises those calculations, the decision is taken under section 11 and the rights of appeal will apply.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 13, in page 9, line 23, after 'decision' insert 'as revised'.
<P>
No. 14, in page 9, line 24, after '11' insert 'instead of section 12(1)'.--[[Mr. Rooker.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government Amendment No. 16.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Amendment No. 15 removes a superfluous reference in subsection (1)(d) as it is to be substituted and amendment No. 16 removes from the new subsection an erroneous reference to subsection (1)(c).
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 16, in page 9, line 33, leave out ', (c)'.--[Mr. Rooker.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 9, line 45, after 'question' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'and each subsequent one beginning on the day after the last day of the previous one'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 19, 24, 31, 34, 45, 47, 49, 50, 52, 36.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The amendments are necessary purely to improve the Bill's drafting. As I explained at our first sitting, our original intention was to arrange for Second Reading to take place before Christmas, which meant an extremely tight timetable for drafting the Bill. That early introduction meant that we have had to table a number of amendments.
<P>
None of this group of amendments changes the substance of the Bill in any way; they merely improve its drafting. It would not be a fruitful use of the Committee's time to go into detail but, as ever, I am happy to explain any of the amendments to hon. Members if necessary.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appeals to appeal tribunals</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 10, line 10, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>', not to revise a decision under section 16,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall do my best to keep up with the pace. The amendment simply removes from clause 10 a superfluous reference to an appeal right that already exists in child support regulations. For the record, I refer to regulation 31(2) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 10, line 43, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>', save that the appeal tribunal shall consist of three members one of which must be a legally qualified member and the tribunal shall, if practicable, include at least one member who is of the same sex as the appellant.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should like briefly to outline the purpose of the amendment. It would add to the end of clause 10(4)(b) a provision whereby, if practicable and possible, child support tribunals would include someone of the same sex as the appellant.
<P>
Until June 1999, child support tribunals consisted of three members, of whom at least one had to be the same sex as the appellant, if that was practicable--we have retained that caveat because we believe that it is still necessary. However, the Social Security Act 1998 changed the situation. The only stipulation relating to tribunals now is that they must include one legally qualified member.  The amendment would provide that a child support appeal tribunal must consist of three members, one of whom must be legally qualified--as now--and at least one must, if practicable, be of the same sex as the appellant. The reason for this goes back to some of our previous debates, particularly in respect of the very sensitive issues with which the appeal tribunals will be dealing, not least that of good cause for not co-operating with the agency, which was discussed in Committee on Tuesday.
<P>
We understand that the Government are currently carrying out extensive research and evaluation into the perceptions of customers of the Child Support Agency. We want to know whether that includes their experiences of the appeal process, particularly how appellants felt if the tribunal did not include a person of the same sex. It would be useful to have objective evidence on that. Even if the Government are unwilling to accept the amendment, we hope that they will be willing to include within their evaluation process a means by which such evidence could be gathered, so that a rational and sensible assessment can be made of whether the change could be made in the future.
<P>
We appreciate that the words in the amendment may not exactly give effect to what we are seeking, but the principle is a sound and important one and would ensure that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I think that this is a sensible amendment, and although the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) spoke only briefly, he put forward sensible arguments with which it is difficult to find fault. Why should the practice of having at least one panel member who is the same sex as the appellant be dropped? That is elementary, natural and the night thing to do when dealing with sensitive matters. Is it normal practice to try to achieve a gender balance? I am not simply trying to be politically correct, although nowadays one has to insist on a statutory man, whereas in the old days it was a statutory woman. Why should any panel, discussing any subject--but particularly child maintenance issues--consist of three members of the same sex?
<P>
I presume that although the Under-Secretary may agree with us, she will not want to include the proposal in the Bill. That is fair enough: Ministers usually want to adduce such arguments because, quite rightly, they do not want to have their hands tied and impose administrative costs on the bureaucracy they are charged with running. I understand that, but if that is the Under-Secretary's response, will she at least assure the Committee that she will do her level best to ensure that when guidance is issued, good practice will include the gender balance of tribunals?
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam did not give the view of his party that three-member tribunals should include one who is legally qualified. I hesitate to mention the need for lawyers, because I might be accused of self-interest or of being part of a trade union and all the other garbage that one hears in Committee, but it is a fact that they receive a lengthy training and have relevant expertise. However simple the Government want to make the formula--as we have debated endlessly over the past three weeks--the matters to be considered would be complex.
<P>
It would do no harm to try to ensure that, if possible, there was a legally qualified member of the tribunal. I presume that the Under-Secretary will adduce the same arguments, and that may be the right thing to do--we do not want to tie her hands. Alternatively, she might say that there is no need for lawyers to sit on the panel at all. That is an interesting argument and we should like further and better particulars from her--to be rather legalistic--to find out exactly how she believes the panels will work. Will they operate in a quasi judicial framework, or will they be so informal that it may not be necessary to have anybody who is legally qualified? If they are very informal, it might give rise to the accusation that they are simply creatures of the bureaucracy and not genuinely independent.
<P>
The advantage of having a professional person on the panel is that it will raise its status. It will give an impression of decorum and order to the person appearing before the panel, because it will not be a panel consisting entirely of people such as he or she has been dealing with up till now. Those who work for the Child Support Agency are, no doubt, doing their best and working hard, but people who go to the panels think of it as their day in court and want their arguments to be heard seriously. The presence of a lawyer will give the panel a certain amount of dignity and credence. I hope that the Minister will feel able to respond positively to this entirely sensible amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall not delay the Committee. The amendment interests me because I suspect that, to a certain extent, it is supernumerary to requirements. Pace my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), it is axiomatic to have a lawyer as chairman of any such tribunals and--dare I say--quite right too. I speak as someone who is not a lawyer. There is a slight downside in that the fact that the chairman is a lawyer tends to impose a certain formality, which some people find difficult. Hence, those who can afford it tend to have a friend as an accompanying solicitor--even a QC is not unknown--whereas those who do not have the money need access to other kinds of advice.
<P>
I do not for a moment argue against having a lawyer as chairman of the tribunal. What fascinates me is that the Liberal Democrats are actually endorsing the existing system rather than trying to revert to the court system, which would have been the effect of the amendment that was withdrawn. That would cost a lot of money and would undoubtedly come out of the penny, or pennies, on income tax that they are talking about. I resist strongly the idea that we should go back into the legal system. That is what we have all fought and will continue to fight so hard to avoid, and it is sad that the Liberal Democrat party seems bent on giving yet more money to the legal profession. I shall be interested in the Minister's response.
<P>
There is common sense in someone of the appropriate sex being on the panel, that is, that the tribunal is mixed. I suspect that it may be axiomatic and that there is an even balance among those people who have volunteered to serve on the tribunal, so the Government regard it as unnecessary to mention the fact. However, it would be reassuring to people who would feel nervous in those circumstances to know that, among the three people making a decision, will be somebody who understands their point of view--perhaps through long experience of cases as opposed to personal expenence--and has some knowledge of the problems and difficulties of couples fighting over child support.
<P>
It may have been decided that, because of the Equal Opportunities Act, old though it is, or the new Human Rights Act 1998, it is unnecessary to include in legislation a requirement that there should be a mixed tribunal--again, the spectre of judicial review rears its head. If someone were feeling litigious he could point out that there was no equality of representation among the tribunal members. That may also be true, and I am sure all of us have experienced this in our surgeries. The long delays are due to the pressure on the tribunal service. Many constituents have asked me why it takes so long to get an appointment for an employment tribunal or a child support case or a DSS tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): It is because they are trying to get the gender balance right.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> As my hon. Friend says, it may be because they are trying to get the gender balance right. I do not think that is correct, although it would be interesting to know what the balance is between the sexes among those who serve. As my mother used to serve on tribunals, I am well aware that many women serve on them exceedingly well. I have great respect for the tribunal service, so I would not take the jaundiced view of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne).
<P>
However, it could be that, for administrative convenience to try to speed up these tribunals, the Government have decided to drop the specification that there should be a mix of the sexes on the panels. It is an interesting point, and I am grateful to the Liberal Democrat party for raising it. I look forward to the Under-Secretary giving us an explanation of why it has been dropped. I have thought of a variety of explanations or excuses that may well be correct. I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary could tell us what is the correct reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I do not welcome this amendment, and I do not share the view of my hon. Friends. I thought, a year ago, that the law had made a significant advance by abandoning this requirement, so I would not be pleased if it were restored now. It strikes me as part of the dismal heresy of the modern age to impose this political correctness that there has to be gender balance. My hon. Friends have said, "Aah! But this is a question of getting a man on to the tribunal so that it won't be dominated by women." However, one type of political correctness is as bad as the other. I am genuinely gender blind in these matters. I do not believe that it is right, proper or expedient to divide humanity into two antithetical groups whose interests cannot be represented by the other.
<P>
It is entirely appropriate to have the tribunal made up of individuals who are intelligent and capable of reviewing the information brought before them. It has nothing to do with what sex they are. It really is a most monstrous requirement that any tribunal, particularly the one that is the subject of this amendment, has to be made up of a certain quota of sexes. What about this new sex--the one we are now introducing into the armed forces? What about a quota of them? For heaven's sake, do away with this nonsense and have done with the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> That was an interesting vignette. I genuinely welcome the hon. Member for Gainsborough's conversion to feminism. He is turning out to be a rather interesting presence on the Back Benches, although naturally he disagrees with his hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West who probably has nightmares about the monstrous regiment of women coming over the hill and destroying peace and tranquillity as he came to know it wherever it was he taught--I suspect it was a single sex school.
<P>
I shall quickly deal with clause 10 to set amendment No. 76 in its context. It sets out clearly the child support decisions that are appealable. Furthermore it provides for the framework of appeals and tribunal procedure which is specified in detail within the regulations. In a reformed child support scheme, we want the agency, whenever possible, to settle disputes without the need for direct tribunal consideration. Parents will have access--in line with changes with the changes to decision making and appeals--to an efficient and effective disputes service. However, tribunals represent an important guarantee of parents' rights, allowing child support liability to be considered by an independent body with legal expertise when disputes cannot be settled in the agency.
<P>
As now, appeals will be allowed on decisions relating to child support liability. There will also continue to be a right of appeal against a decision to impose a benefit penalty  on parents with care who have claimed income support and opted out of child support without good cause. There will also be rights to appeal against financial penalties and fees.
<P>
10.30 am
<P>
Our proposals build on changes to the appeals system for child support which were introduced from June 1999. During the passage of the Social Security Act 1998, there were lengthy and detailed debates about tribunal composition. Amendment No. 76 would provide for appeals tribunals to comprise three members, one of whom should be legally qualified and one of whom should be the same sex as the appellant. That would take us back to the position that existed before the 1998 Act was passed.
<P>
 It is less than a year since the administrative changes were made to the appeals system in June 1999, so it is rather odd to say that only one of five different tribunals run by the Department of Social Security should be taken back to the previous position. That does not make sense. Hon. Members may recall that the 1998 Act allowed for the creation of two-member and one-member appeal tribunals. Clearly, a one-member appeal tribunal cannot have a gender balance--to imagine that is beyond my ingenuity.
I remind Committee members of why the changes were made. When we came into government, the average length of time for an appeal to be heard was seven months, but many people waited for well over a year for their appeal to be heard. We examined carefully why backlogs were developing and the system was clogging up. We found that one reason was the rigid requirement that all tribunals should have three members. Gathering together in one place three busy people who have other jobs often takes time. The requirement for three people to sit for a tribunal to be properly constituted was one of the main reasons for delays, hence the move to allow one and two-member tribunals.
<P>
The president of the appeals tribunal, whose position is an independent judicial appointment, has followed closely the results of the introduction of the new, more flexible appeals. Appeal delays have been reduced to an average of 16 weeks. Appeals are being heard much more quickly and expeditiously, so one of the main alms of the new system is being achieved as we speak. Much of the backlog has been dealt with.
<P>
When the 1998 Act was in Committee, the Opposition expressed concern that changes to composition would affect the outcome, that the new arrangements were a way of getting appeals through quickly as that they could be dismissed. Let me tell them that the success rate of the CSA CSA three-person tribunal hearings prior to the 1998 Act was 57.5 per cent. and that the one-person tribunal hearings that have replaced them have a success rate of 57.8 per cent. Therefore outcomes have not changed. There is no obvious trend of more of these appeals being dismissed by one-member tribunals than by three-member tribunals. As we have one-member tribunals we clearly cannot ensure a gender balance, but we can--I give the Committee a pledge--try to ensure that the pool of people from which the judge can appoint tribunals to hear these cases contains equal numbers of men and women.
<P>
We are trying to recruit more women to serve in the tribunal service; they currently stand at 35 per cent. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) was right that there are a lot of women, but it is still not 50 per cent. Our clear aspiration is to have 50 per cent., but 35 per cent. is the same as the current proportion in the legal profession so we have achieved a sort of balance. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that the president of the appeals tribunal takes the issue seriously. He has agreed to ensure that adequate equal opportunities training on some of these sensitive issues is given to everyone who serves on the child support appeal tribunal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful for the clarifications and assurances that the Minister is giving. Could she answer two points? Could she give us some idea of the targets that have been set for achieving equality in the pool of people from which tribunals are drawn? How long will we have to wait until we get to 50 per cent? Secondly, could she say a little more about the evaluation of the views of appellants at tribunals?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I was going to come on to that once I had dealt with these more technical issues. At present, 35 per cent. are women. The president of the appeal tribunals who appoints people to these posts is constantly searching for other qualified women to do this job. We will continue to push to get those numbers up. It is partly a question of those who apply as well those who are appointed. Word has gone out and we have done quite well so far.  We are searching for an equal ratio of male and female lawyers to hear CSA appeals because we want to ensure that appellants have an equal chance of getting the one or the other so that they cannot complain that they have been done down. We will certainly not get into a situation where the vast majority of CSA appeals are conducted by men or, indeed, by women. We want to achieve a balance in the new system. Our evaluation includes people's experience of the appeal process, so we would pick up any huge dissatisfaction or perceived bias in that area. We shall watch that closely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Presumably it is quite easy to work out. One knows how many appeals fail or succeed and whether a man or a woman was sitting on a tribunal, so one could easily determine whether there is a trend towards women judges favouring women, or vice versa.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Yes, these things are fairly easy to pick out and track. I can assure hon. Members that we will be doing that. We are aware of the sensitivities around the issue but we are also aware that it would not be satisfactory to get back to the situation we inherited when we came into power where there was an average delay of seven months, and often much longer, in getting an appeal through.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sorry to pick the Minsiter up on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. One of the things that I have heard many allegations about relates not to child support but to income support, but it is the same problem. I do want to go into specifics, but there is sometimes an advantage in going to one tribunal in one location because it is known that there may be a more generous or a less generous approach. If any bias in decisions on child support emerges, will it be picked up and acted on? It is not the picking up that is the problem, but whether it will be acted on.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I can assure the hon. Lady that, with the creation of the appeals service, which comes into formal being in April and is currently in shadow form, such trends would and could be picked up and dealt with very quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I should like further assurance about the balancing of the pool of people from which the tribunals are drawn. The Under-Secretary went a little further in her response to my intervention, but she did not give us the timetable for targets to be set. I appreciate that efforts are being made by the president and others, but have the Government actually set a benchmark against which the performance will be measured?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Appointments to the tribunal system are a judicial matter in which Ministers may not directly interfere. It is an independent system. We have set the guidelines. The president has agreed with them, and sees the need to put them into effect. It is as though I were to ask the hon. Gentleman when the Liberal Democrat party will have an equal representation of women in its parliamentary party. He may have guidelines on such matters and may be able to give me a set date when that will be achieved. We have set the target that we need to achieve. That has been agreed, and we are doing our best to achieve it. When 35 per cent. of the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party are women, the hon. Gentleman can give me lessons on how we can achieve our target.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I assure the hon. Lady that that will be after the next general election, when it will be zero.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman has an interesting view of the future, and of the past. I do not agree with any of his views.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is the present we must consider.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I have been attempting to sit down for about five minutes, Sir David. I hope that I have reassured the Committee about how seriously we view such issues, but some practical difficulties would be created by going back to the old system so soon after we had changed to the new one, which is already giving results in the form of steep declines in delays in the tribunal system--something about which we should all be glad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am intrigued. The proposition that the Minister is putting to the Committee is that, if I were to give assurances about the gender mix in the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party, she would be able to give us the concession that I was seeking. That is not how Government policy is made, but it was a good debating point. However, that, together with some of the Minister's other responses on this area of concern to us, has not persuaded me that the Government are dealing with the issue seriously and satisfactorily. I wish to press the amendment to a vote.

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 227, in page 11, line 43, at end insert--

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(4A) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (3) that he has reasonably refused a scientific test to prove that the alleged parent is a parent of the child'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment should be seen in conjunction with various matters relating to clauses 61 and 62, but I tabled it to clause 12 because that was easier to amend and provided a good opportunity to discuss DNA testing.
<P>
Hon. Members will recall that, on Second Reading on 11 January at column 157, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) raised this issue in relation to one of his constituents with the Secretary of State. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Can the right hon. Gentleman guarantee that from now on, in every case where an individual is willing to have a DNA test to prove parentage--or more particularly to prove non--parentage--he will be able to do so?"
<P>
The Secretary of State replied:
<P>
"I do not see why anyone who is willing to undergo a DNA test should have any difficulty in doing so, as that would put beyond doubt whether or not he was the father of a particular child."--[Official Report, 11 January 2000; Vol. 342, c. 157.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are all aware of the great advances in medical science which have made DNA testing almost routine. It is not invasive in any way--it does not even require that blood be given to determine whether someone is the parent of a particular child.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, who is an energetic and assiduous Member--I think that he was a finalist in the Opposition politician of the year contest--has raised this issue several times, not just on Second Reading but in various Question Times. I know, because he briefed me on the details of the case, that his constituent was willing to take a test but was denied the opportunity. That seems absurd. I have only once come across such a situation in relation to a constituent. I shall relate the story briefly to the Committee, heavily disguising the person involved.
<P>
About three or four years ago, a gentleman came to my surgery. He was a senior member of one of our great national institutions who was, I suppose, entering middle age. He had formed a liaison with a young lady who also worked for this great national institution, as a result of which a pregnancy occurred. She told him of the situation and, unusually, said that unless he signed the birth certificate, she would tell his wife. To sign a public document in the hope that something would remain quiet seemed to me rather peculiar logic and made me wonder about the quality of the people running our great national institutions.
<P>
As it transpired, he was not the child's father, but he only learned that some six or seven years down the line when playing tennis with another member of the great national institution. I should emphasise that this great national institution is not Parliament.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> None of us thought that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I thought I saw some quick movement of the pen.
<P>
It turned out that that gentleman had also had an affair with the mother at the same time and was the father of the child. After my constituent had signed the document his wife had found out, his marriage collapsed, he missed promotion at work and, eventually, lost his job. He attempted to have a DNA test to put his mind at rest, but had great difficulty in obtaining one. There are still questions regarding the signing of the certificate that we will deal with later.
<P>
If the Secretary of State says that that he does not see why anybody who is willing to undergo a DNA test should have any difficulty in doing so, a number of questions are raised. This is a probing amendment and the Government will have to drive me to a frenzy to press for a vote. We look to the Government for a sensible reply. If that is the case, is it an absolute right? Does the father have to show some evidence before a DNA test is possible? Will DNA testing be routine? It is not a difficult thing to do, but some cost is involved. If there is cost, who pays? Will it be the father? Does he have to make a contribution? If he does, will it be means-tested? If he has to make a contribution and it is proved that he is not the father, will the State pay? All these matters need to be ironed out now. They do not need to be enshrined in legislation but we need to know how the Government intend to proceed with this testing. Will it be there as a right? Who will pay? Is there a presumption that has to be shown? None of that is unreasonable. We would not wish to see a situation where people are DNA-tested as a natural process of being involved with the CSA. That would be unnecessary. That does not need to be enshrined in primary legislation but it is reasonable to ask the Minister now whether such matters will be covered by legislation, or perhaps, by practice notes. There is a legitimate concern here in which law and practice need to catch up with advances in medical science.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute. One question that again arises from a surgery case--but nowhere near as high profile as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)--is the cost. There are circumstances in which the CSA pays for a DNA test. However, where putative fathers deny paternity and are prepared to provide a DNA test as proof, the CSA is not usually prepared to pay for it. Perhaps the Minister could address that issue as well as my hon. Friend's queries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> What is the cost? If the test was positive--if paternity was proved--would it not be appropriate for the father to meet the cost, and if it was not, for the CSA meet it?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The one thing that I do know about DNA testing is that the more it is used, the lower the price. ICI did all the research work and when it was first able to be used in the open market the cost ran to four figures. It is probably now down to three, and I expect that, if the technology improves, there will be further reductions. As time goes on it will probably be cheaper for the CSA to do it to clarify matters. However, I understand that there have been occasions where such information has been offered to the CSA and it has not been taken into account when a conclusion has been reached about who should pay for the upkeep of the children.
<P>
We have often talked in Committee about the need to look not at what happens now, but at what will happen in 10 or 15 years' time. If we think forward to the development of DNA and its increasing use and availability, we need reassurances from the Minister that DNA tests will be used properly by the CSA and that the cost, when it is material to the outcome of a case, should be met by it. As we have discussed on previous occasions, fathers may not be wealthy and they should not be forced to meet the cost of tests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am ignorant of many things, but particularly about DNA testing. I do not move in that sort of world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Is it painful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I do not know.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Swabs on the tongue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> There is not much difference between what the amendment proposes and what is already in the Bill. The Bill says--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (3) to prove that he had a reasonable excuse for failing to comply."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment says--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (3) that he has reasonably refused a scientific test".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill puts a more onerous burden on those required to have a test, but "to prove" is a term of art. It is often used in the legal establishment to prove beyond any reasonable doubt or beyond the balance of probabilities that a person had a reasonable excuse for failing to comply.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us about past circumstances where people have had a reasonable excuse for failing to comply? I cannot instantly imagine what those might have been, but my hon. Friends have already intimated possible examples. Why is it necessary to put on the face of the Bill that somebody has to prove it? The wording of the amendment that--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"...he has reasonably refused a scientific test"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is a sensible way of proceeding? I cannot see any objection to that.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> First, I shall put before the Committee some figures and discuss, in the experience of the Agency, where the difficulties lie and then explain the changes that are made in clause 12. These need to be taken account of in the light of clauses 61 and 62 where we are also making changes to the evidence because advances in medical science and technology since the current legislation became law in 1969 have made it easier and less intrusive to establish parentage.
<P>
Currently, about 22,000 non-resident parents a year dispute paternity. Of those, 95 per cent. are the father. About 2,000 of those cases a year go to court for a declaration of parentage under the existing legislation to which I have referred. In only 100 of those cases is the non-resident parent found not to be the father. Those who genuinely and rightly dispute parentage constitute a small percentage of such cases.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other pattern that the CSA has noticed is that some claims are made halfway through the process. Often after a maintenance calculation has been made, the non-resident parent declares that he is not the father. Normally, in those circumstances, his name is on the birth certificate, he was living with or married to the parent with care when the child was born and other factors show that one would not have to be Sherlock Holmes to draw a reasonable conclusion. The CSA has found that disputes about parentage have been used to delay the process. Clearly, I am sure that all members of the Committee would want to put that issue to rest as quickly as possible. Anyone can have a DNA test, so long as all the relevant parties consent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Under-Secretary define the relevant parties involved in such consents?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The relevant party will be the person who is having the test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Just one person.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Yes. The hon. Gentleman asked what would be reasonable grounds for refusing a DNA test. The only one that I can think of is that people might have a religious objection if blood has to be taken for the test.
<P>
I am now told that both the parent and child will be relevant parties. That will become clear when we reach clauses 61 and 62, and it is partly to do with Scottish law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is an important point. Presumably, both parents will have to give their consent for a child, but surely both parents will not have to give their consent for the father to take a test. Surely, the father can take a test without the mother's consent, or, in Scottish law, that of the child.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am not a scientist, but I am told that the results are more accurate if the DNA of both parents is tested, so that the proper parentage of the child can be traced. If only one parent is tested, the results are less reliable. Clearly, under current law, people cannot be tested against their will. Therefore, it is necessary to take DNA samples from both alleged parents to establish parentage accurately.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> That was my understanding of the current situation, but as the Under-Secretary has said, DNA tests can be used as an excuse to cause delays. I know of a constituency case in which the husband decided that he might not be the parent because of evidence that emerged halfway through the process, and that case was genuine. However, as DNA testing develops, if the Bill insists that all those consents must be given, nothing will have moved forward.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Let me get the scientific stuff out of the way so that we all know what we are talking about, including me. In order to have an accurate DNA test both the alleged parents and the child have to be tested. If all three are tested there is a 99.9 per cent. chance of accuracy, which is pretty good odds. If only one parent and the child are tested, those odds go down to 70 per cent. Therefore, in order to have an accurate DNA test with which people cannot quibble all three relevant parties need to be tested. Any less accurate test would be open to doubt.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I hope that this is not too scientific. If one parent has a DNA test which indicates that there is a 70 per cent. chance that he is or is not the father of the child, surely it is incumbent on the CSA to insist, before a plan is drawn up for the child, that the parent who has refused takes the test as well.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I am not sure that the CSA has the power to insist that anyone takes a medical test. Medical tests have to be consented to by those who are tested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> There are good reasons for that, and for the present law. If someone is required to give blood or urine, it is invasive. However, DNA testing is not invasive. A swab from the tongue or even from one's hand is sufficient. If he were here, President Clinton could testify how non-invasive a DNA test is. Surely such concerns about the need for consent for a medical examination do not apply to taking a simple swab.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We can insist that parents with care take a test, but if they still refuse there is the reduced benefit direction sanction. That is all that the CSA has the power to do. Clause 12 introduces new presumptions as to parentage in order to proxy some of this and make assumptions in certain circumstances that will allow the CSA to presume that somebody is a parent. That is a way of proxying the likelihood.
<P>
I have read out the percentage of people who use this as a method of delaying. In an ideal world nobody would refuse to take the test because that puts the matter beyond doubt. However, the CSA currently has non-resident parents who have had the DNA test and been proved to be the fathers, but they still refuse to accept paternity and to pay. That is one of the issues often used as a delaying tactic.
<P>
The hon. Member for New Forest, West said that the CSA should pay for the test initially and if the result was that the non-resident parent was proved to be the father he should pay. That is already the case.
<P>
There is not much between us on the amendment. I suspected that it was a probing amendment when I first saw it. It seeks to provide that the criminal offence of failing to supply information under clause 12 will not apply to an alleged parent who has reasonably refused to take a DNA test intended to establish parentage. We have established that, in the vast majority of cases, there is not a great deal that is reasonable about denying parentage.
<P>
Clause 12 makes it an offence for anyone to fail to provide information or give false information to the CSA, with a fine of up to £1,000 on conviction. Those new criminal sanctions will ensure that more non-resident parents meet their obligations to their children and show that the Government are committed to the radical reform of child support.
<P>
In the current scheme, disputing paternity is a way of delaying the payment of child maintenance. That is why, through clause 14, we intend to allow the CSA to presume that a man is the father of the child when he has refused to take a scientific test aimed at establishing parentage. Thus, a refusal to take such a test will not normally stop the child support process. We also intend that presumption to apply where the child is living in England and Wales and the alleged father was married to the child's mother at any time between the date of conception and the child's birth--following an existing presumption in Scottish law--or where the alleged father 301 302 is named on the child's birth certificate. In the vast majority of cases--there are always exceptions, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar amusingly illustrated--any man who is presumed to be the father of a child has the right to apply to the courts for that presumption to be rebutted if he can prove his case.
<P>
This is a permissive presumption. If the Secretary of State thinks that there is a reasonable reason, such as religious grounds, for an alleged parent to refuse to take a DNA test, he would not assume that that alleged parent was the child's father. In other words, we do not assume that a refusal to take a DNA test is in all circumstances proof or a proxy of proof of parentage. In such circumstances, we would instead go to court for a declaration of parentage and the Secretary of State would not pursue information until the court had established parentage. Thus, in those situations action under clause 12 would not be appropriate.
<P>
Clause 12 is designed to make it a criminal offence to fail to provide the CSA with the information required to calculate or collect child support or to give it misleading information. It is not intended to settle disputes about parentage. Clause 14 deals with that. As I said, clauses 61 and 62 also modernise related provisions in existing law.
<P>
If a non-resident parent refuses to take a DNA test without good reason, he will be presumed to be the parent, and the Secretary of State will take action to ensure that the necessary information is provided. If it is not, criminal action may be taken.
<P>
These provisions toughen up the existing situation following the CSA's experience in dealing with denials of parentage over the past few years. We think that they are fair and reasonable, so I ask the Committee to oppose the amendment and support the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that comprehensive explanation of clause 12. By and large, we support the Government's approach. We also support what the hon. Lady said, but I am still not clear--largely because of the fullness of her reply to interventions--about the implications of the Secretary of State's statement to my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I do not see why anyone who is willing to undergo a DNA test should have any difficulty in doing so".--[Official Report, 11 January 2000; Vol. 342, c. 157.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My confusion arises from the varying degrees of consent. Is the hon. Lady saying that if someone says that he wants a DNA test and can show some grounds, he will not be refused? Perhaps I could tempt her to her feet again just to expand on that issue.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point a little better now than I did at the beginning of our debate.
<P>
Any individual can have a DNA test and no one can stop him. The problem is that both the child and the other parent have to be tested as well in order for the matter to be put beyond doubt. The Bill does not allow the CSA to override the requirement to obtain consent to those tests from those who have to be tested. It would be wrong for it to do that; if it did, we would have to legislate for other medical treatments, probably with major implications. Clause 14 therefore makes assumptions and presumptions as a result of particular behaviour. If a non-resident parent wanted to take a DNA test, he could. The point is that the results of that would be only 70 per cent. accurate. It is necessary to have DNA from the child and the mother as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This may be a naive question, but what would happen in the event of a dispute where a man denies a mother's claim that he is a child's father and is prepared to back up his denial with a DNA test, but the mother refuses to co-operate?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> She will get a reduced benefit decision and have benefit taken from her if she persists in refusing unreasonably for the test to be taken. The CSA, however, cannot force her to have a DNA test nor can it force her to consent to the child having one. It must respond in an appropriate fashion if there is a refusal. It would be undesirable, given the implications in other areas, for the CSA to be given the power to force somebody to have a test against their will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Surely if the man denying paternity is prepared to have the test, that in itself is good evidence that he is not the father. If DNA testing establishes a 70 per cent. reliability that he is not the father and the woman still refuses to have the test, why should she get any benefit at all? The Under-Secretary says she is receiving reduced benefit but is that really fair?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The reduced benefit deduction would be on her income support and that is the only lever that the CSA has because the CSA is not the arbiter of everything in society. It can deal only with this particular area. Clause 14 will enable the CSA to make presumptions that are fairly obvious in such circumstances and to proceed with the case before it making those presumptions. We cannot offer Opposition Members the clarity that they want by announcing that we will give the CSA powers to force people to have tests. We cannot do that. This is not the place to do that even if we thought it desirable to do so.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I hope that the hon. Lady does not think we are persecuting her, but these questions arise. Can she confirm that the only sanction the CSA has against mothers not prepared to take a DNA test is to reduce benefit to those who are on benefits? I know we are talking about a small number of people, but if the mother is not on benefits, are there any sanctions there?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> At the back of all of this lies the court, which we shall come to when we discuss clauses 61 and 62. People can go to court to establish parentage, and in certain circumstances the court can order measures to establish parentage beyond doubt. That procedure is always available. We must not get too fixated on the power of the CSA and presume that it should do the job that the courts are there to do with respect to parentage. If a parent with care unreasonably refuses to have a DNA test, the non-resident parent will not be treated as the father of that child. She will have a reduced benefit direction and he will not be treated as the father of that child. In those circumstances that is a sensible approach. It is the only thing we can ask the CSA to do independently of the current system for establishing parentage that is within the power of the court.
<P>
Clause 14 does some of that. The CSA has to make presumptions in some circumstances and we are laying out some of the circumstances in these clauses as to how the CSA will be able to proceed. Clearly, if a man wants a DNA test and the mother unreasonably refuses a DNA test, he will not be treated as the father of the child. However, I remind Opposition Members that, in the vast majority of these cases, parentage has been disputed halfway through the process, when a maintenance calculation has already been made, as a way of delaying things. That is where the non-resident parent is on the birth certificate and was living with the woman around the time of conception and the birth of the child.
<P>
Let us not get this too out of perspective. Without taking on powers that would be inappropriate for the CSA, over and above the courts, the settlement in clause 12 whereby people can be fined for misleading or withholding information from the CSA, in clause 14 where certain presumptions are made about parentage in certain circumstances, and the modernisation of the law in clauses 61 and 62, are about as good a settlement as it is possible to get.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Lady has gone a long way towards satisfying us. On the test on DNA she has certainly got above 77 per cent. and is rapidly approaching 99 per cent. She is right when she says that such tests are used as a delaying tactic. We have clearly come across a few hard cases.
<P>
What still concerns me slightly is whether the clarity that the Under-Secretary has provided is finding its way into the CSA, so that people who deal with cases clearly understand this procedure. It would seem sensible for me to table a written question to ask the Under-Secretary to explain for the record precisely what the procedure is. Having said that, I am satisfied with the Minister's response, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Inspectors
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 221, in page 12, line 8, after 'inspector', insert 'shall receive full training and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 222, in page 12, line 13, after 'entry', insert 'in the presence of the occupier'.
<P>
No. 223, in page 12, line 15, leave out 'as he considers' and insert 'that is deemed reasonably'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The amendments deal with the powers of inspectors, and I hope that the Minister will be able to do the same as she did in the last debate. They relate to three distinct circumstances. Amendment No. 221 would require the inspectors to have training. Hon. Members will recall the White Paper "A New Contract for Welfare: Children's Rights and Parents' Responsibilities", page 21 of which refers to problems with training when inspectors are appointed for one case only. Surely training of inspectors must be compulsory if they are to study the accounts of a non-resident parent's employer.
<P>
The inspectors will also need to be aware of the need for the employer's or former employer's privacy. We looked at that issue in great depth when we were dealing with the tax credit legislation to try to ensure that people's privacy and employers' privacy were protected. We have been keen to ensure that people who carry out such work receive the appropriate training so that they can understand the information that they receive--that is obvious, because it would be ridiculous to appoint somebody who did not have the remotest idea of what he was looking for. They should be given training on how to approach their task, and be made aware of the enormous importance to be attached to privacy, and not just the privacy of a non-resident parent. In this country, we are very cagey about how people's tax affairs and personal affairs are dealt with. That is a good trait. We want to ensure that inspectors receive such training.
<P>
We are also aware of what training would be helpful. We have to recognise that sometimes the inspectors are going into difficult situations. They may have to go into a small firm, with a work-force of one or two, or into a family firm to which the non-resident parent may belong.  People often take sides in relation to separation and divorce and tempers can fray. Matters may become unpleasant. We all know the importance of avoiding confrontation.
<P>
Training in relation to such matters would be desirable.
