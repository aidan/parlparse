                     </span>
                  </strong> I thank the Minister and his officials,
who, as the Committee will see, will enable the original Bill to be
translated from my amateur attempt at drafting into a measure that
covers all appropriate bases, thus enabling it to become fit for
purpose, to use a well-known
phrase.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also want to draw the Committee’s attention to the right hon.
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East, who was the Minister who steered
through the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which I am
aiming to amend. In fact, consideration was given in Committee to
adding serious physical harm, along the lines of my intention. I hope
that the right hon. Gentleman will agree with my interpretation of that
discussion in Committee, in which he accepted the desirability of
including serious physical harm. However, as section 5 was rather
revolutionary, a “suck it and see” approach was desired.
I hope the Committee will excuse my using Australasian slang, which is
often crude but generally descriptively accurate. It would be fair to
say that section 5 has worked well—it has been sucked
and we have seen —and there is a considerable call for it to be
extended, as is proposed
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
current section 5 applies to the death of a child or vulnerable adult.
It is best demonstrated by the Baby Peter case that so shocked the
nation. Essentially, when the mother was accused, she said, “It
was not me; it was him,” and her partner said, “It was
not me; it was her.” Section 5 allowed for the prosecution of
both and, as we all know, they were found guilty of causing or allowing
the death of Baby Peter and sentenced to the maximum of 14 years. A key
to the success of the prosecution case was that the pathologist was
able, finally, to point to a cause of
death.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
brings me to one reason for my desire for the extension to cover
serious physical harm. I understand that sometimes in such
cases—this is not too infrequent—an actual cause of death
cannot be specified, and section 5 cannot therefore be utilised.
Additionally, if Baby Peter had been seriously physically harmed but
had survived, even in a vegetative state, section 5 would not
have applied. My attention was drawn to that problem by
Detective Chief Inspector Dave Marshall of the Metropolitan police.
Those who work in child care and child protection accept him as one of
the experts in the area throughout the United Kingdom. He has recently
retired and now teaches police officers about the detection and
prosecution of such
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
recently attended a UK police course lecture by Dave Marshall. He cited
several cases, but the one that stuck in my mind was the near death of
a three-month-old child. If I recall correctly—we saw
photographs and the case was horrendous—the wee baby had both
legs broken, one broken arm and 15 breaks in the ribs. As he pointed
out, the child could not be picked up to be comforted, because the
moment that was done, the breaks in the ribs caused absolutely
excruciating pain. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 7<a class="bkMark" name="Column7">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Each of the two adults associated with that wee mite’s situation
blamed the other, but section 5 could not be applied as the baby
survived—just.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
case is not that unusual. I understand at second hand from the
Wiltshire chief constable that, in the past two months, his force has
had two cases relating to young vulnerable adults, in which the parents
could not be convicted. They would be in future, assuming that the Bill
is enacted. Over three years, from 2005 to 2008, the Met police
undertook research into cases of intra-familial grievous bodily harm to
children and looked at 179 cases of such allegations in London
alone. In 69 cases, there was no prosecution. In the opinion of
the police researchers, of the 69 cases, 39 would have been considered
under section 5 if the amendments that have been proposed today had
been made to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the Committee will probably know, many of the organisations involved in
child protection have been pressing for such changes for some time. I
have received support from the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, and I draw the Committee’s attention to a
document that it published in 2003 entitled, “Which of you did
it?”, which centred on the problems of achieving criminal
convictions when a child dies or is seriously injured by parents or
carers. Now—some eight years later—we are actually
getting round to resolving such
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
I am tempted to expand my remarks at great length, I am aware that
members of the Committee, especially the Minister and the shadow
Minister, desire our business to be concluded positively and promptly.
The Minister will speak about several Government amendments and new
clauses. My experts and I have discussed such proposals with him and
his officials, and we agree with them. I therefore ask the Committee to
vote against clause stand part, and to support the Government’s
new clauses and amendments to rewrite the Bill effectively so that it
will be fit for
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000035">&#160;</a>

Andy Slaughter</strong> (Hammersmith) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000119">&#160;</a>
                  </span> It is a pleasure to be
here under your chairmanship, Mr Gray. I heard you say that, when you
were the special adviser to the hon. Member for Mole Valley, he did not
take much notice of your opinion. At that time, he was local government
Minister and I was leader of a Labour local authority, so you can
imagine what notice he took of my opinions when I presented
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman and I will be of one mind today because
the Opposition support the Bill, and I shall outline the reasons why. I
am grateful to him for ensuring the Bill’s speedy and efficient
passage through the House, and clearly no disrespect is meant to him by
the Government’s tabling tidying-up amendments to the measure
and consequential amendments to other legislation. The Bill was
accepted in the Chamber on 18 March without objection on
Second Reading, showing that it had all-party support, and that remains
the case
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
issue has been identified by the judiciary as having been a problem for
decades as, indeed, it has by civil society. As the hon. Member for
Mole Valley said, it is a matter to which a solution was proposed
almost 10 years ago by the NSPCC report, followed by the Law 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Commission and legislation introduced by the Labour Government. I am
pleased to see my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale
East in Committee. He was the Minister responsible for putting the
substantive Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 through the
Commons, and I hope that I will not embarrass him by quoting what was
said at the time. It shows that this sitting is part of a wholly
logical sequence of amending the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Everyone
knows that the issue was a difficult legal problem, but one that needs
to be resolved because of cases such as Baby Peter, which have shocked
the nation over a long time. It is right to say that considerable
controversy surrounded that part of the Act, but that controversy
certainly did not apply to serious harm. It centred a little on the
possible criminalisation of victims of domestic violence. At the time,
Women’s Aid and other groups made representations. Often, in
households where children are being harmed, the mother of the child
would also be subject to violence. There was concern that, despite the
fact that she was intimidated and cowed, she was at risk of
prosecution. I think that the issue was resolved in favour of its being
a matter for the judge or jury to take into consideration, and it was
decided that it should not prevent the case from going to
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
area of controversy was procedure. There was a defeat in the House of
Lords, and it was described as monstrous on that occasion to amend
procedure in such a way. As a member of the criminal Bar at that time,
I might have weighed in on the side of the people who objected to
procedural changes, but that is history. Although the consequential
amendments deal with that, it is not a matter that is particularly
before us today. We should concentrate on the single purpose of the
Bill, which is to add the concept of serious harm. It is right to say
that that has been contemplated since the original NSPCC proposals. It
was discussed
extensively.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Without
wishing to quote him in his presence unduly, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East—the then Minister in the
Commons—and Baroness Scotland considered the matter carefully.
There were amendments to include serious harm. On balance, it was
decided not to include them because it was quite a significant change
in the law for the reasons that I have given. It was a difficult matter
on which to legislate, and therefore one needed to proceed with
caution. It was also felt that, where victims had not suffered death
but serious injury, they might be available to give evidence, or that
one of the accused—one of the possible
perpetrators—having seen the level of injury, would be more
prepared to come clean and to give evidence. Those points may have been
valid at the time, but the key reservation was that this was a
legislative leap, and therefore it was right to see whether the law
worked. We have seen that it does work, and the Government were simply
proceeding with caution at that stage. I will not speak for him, but I
suspect that that is now the view of my right hon. Friend: time has
passed and we have seen that happen. He concluded his rejection of the
amendment at that stage by saying that the<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“examples are
compelling, which is why I do not rule out extending the offence at
some time in the future. It is important, first, to put in place the
new offence. Let us get that right first and see how the provision
operates. If appropriate, we may return to the problem at a later
date.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 27 October 2004; Vol.
425, c. 1473.]<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000091">&#160;</a>

               <p>That later date is now.
The case has been well made that serious harm—grievous bodily
harm—is in many cases as serious an issue in terms of the
injustices done and in the effect particularly on a young child, who
may be brain damaged or incapacitated for life. It is right that the
provisions in the original Act are extended to cover such cases, and
therefore I lend my support to the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000043">&#160;</a>

I will also be brief. I want to pay tribute to him in this context. I

assiduous in paying attention to any measure to protect vulnerable

was slightly concerned when I arrived in Committee this morning to find
that both the hon. Member for Mole Valley and my hon. Friend the Member
for Hammersmith had quotes from what I said seven years ago.
Fortunately, they are quotes that I am happy to stand by, and I will
support the hon. Gentleman’s measure. He and others will
remember the case that most concentrated our minds back in those
days—that of Lane and Lane. It involved a 22-month-old baby who
had a fractured skull and died. Clearly, one of two people was
responsible. They would not point the finger at one another. They were
convicted but they won on appeal, because the law could not sustain
their conviction.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000047">&#160;</a>

Law Commission did some tremendous work. We grappled with all that,
because it was a new departure. Thank goodness we had the courage to
see it through. It was sensible to do it in a staged way, and it
worked. The conviction of those responsible for killing Baby Peter is
evidence of that. The case is now made to extend that measure to
include serious harm. I wish the hon. Member for Mole Valley well, and
I will continue to support the Bill until it is enacted, I hope with
active support from the

been in post for some time, the Minister will no doubt hear Members of
all parties complaining about new criminal justice measures and
legislation coming out of the Ministry of Justice. I urge him to hold
fast, because that was a criminal justice Bill, one of the many that
the previous Government were derided for introducing. This was part of
it. The year before, we introduced another new offence of grooming
children for sexual exploitation. That same year we changed the rule on
double jeopardy, so that people who are guilty face the punishment they
deserve. I say to the Minister: when the case is made, follow it
through, regardless of the complaints from people around

Minister—whether or not he benefited from your special advice,
Mr Gray. By that stage, my hon. Friend was already a distinguished
former leader of a local authority, and has been recognised for that.
The right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East made clear that my
hon. Friend has now added a substantial string to his bow with his
proud record of championing the cause of vulnerable children.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is a
pleasure to bring the Government’s adjustments to the criminal
principle that he has brought to the House in the Bill, to assist it on
to the statute book. My hon. Friend’s Bill would provide
increased protection for children and vulnerable adults who were at
risk of serious harm from members of their own household, and the
Government are pleased to support it. We heard of Bills introduced by
the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East. I also have a
couple of different quotes, which would put me in danger of slight
repetition.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The advance
that we are considering this morning was contemplated seven years ago.
However, there were perfectly sensible questions about whether it would
work, as it was breaking new ground, and the important procedural
issues referred to by the hon. Member for Hammersmith were also new and
potentially legally controversial. I will address those matters
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale
East, who, like us, Mr Gray, was first elected to this place in 1997.
He was my neighbour—in an office sense—in those days, and
I know that he is an extremely civilised and decent man. He was a
Minister in the previous Administration, and I am proud to follow in
his footsteps with the responsibilities that he held in earlier
times.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
said that, I want to reflect on the right hon. Gentleman’s
advice about legislating when the case is made. I agree up to a point.
Between 1997 and 2010, there were a horrifying number of criminal
justice Acts. One of the issues that we are addressing is the extremely
complicated statute book. The Government have not lightly reached the
decision to support the Bill presented by my hon. Friend the Member for
Mole Valley. In the first instance, we want to consider the blizzard of
legislation on the statute book and see whether there is a way of using
the existing law to achieve the policy objective that hon. Members
propose, if it is supported by the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 11<a class="bkMark" name="Column11">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Administration. We have carefully examined the available powers and we
believe that the case for the Bill is made. I am clear, however, that
our principle is not to legislate in haste, but to take that position
as the last option if we cannot achieve the policy objective through
the legislation that is already available.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Mole Valley explained, the intention of his Bill
is to amend section 5 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act
2004 to include cases of causing or allowing serious harm to a child or
vulnerable adult, and to apply the evidential and procedural provisions
under section 6 of the 2004 Act to the extended offence. As we have
heard, extending the law in that way was anticipated in 2004, and
people have continued to press for that extension since then. Indeed,
the NSPCC and others argued at that time for the section 5 offence to
extend to serious harm in the first place. The offence and associated
evidential and procedural provisions were considered novel at the time
and the then Minister argued for a cautious approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some six
years on, however, we know that the existing legislation on the offence
has worked well in practice. It has been used successfully in a number
of cases, not least in the tragic one of baby Peter Connelly. We agree
that the time is right to consider extending the law, so we support, in
principle, the Bill’s aim. It addresses difficult issues in a
serious area—cases in which, although it is clear that the
injuries suffered by a child or vulnerable adult must have been
sustained at the hands of one of a limited number of members of a
household, there is insufficient evidence to point to the person
responsible.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In such
cases, when serious injury short of death has occurred, it might not be
possible to mount a successful prosecution. The victim might be too
young to give evidence, or might not be able to do so as a result of
injury or through fear. Offenders in such cases should not be able to
escape justice simply because the victim has escaped death. However,
this is an already complex area of law and we must ensure that the
extended offence is proportionate to the harm, and does not criminalise
behaviour more broadly than is necessary. In addition, we must ensure
that the application to the extended offence of the evidential and
procedural provisions under section 6 of the 2004 Act is workable and
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
do not believe that clause 1 achieves fully what my hon. Friend
intends. I am grateful to him for engaging constructively with my
officials and me in drafting the Government amendments to which I shall
now speak, which better reflect the aims of the Bill. If hon. Members
agree that the clause should not stand part of the Bill, it would be
replaced in the first instance by Government new clause 1, which would
extend the offence under section 5 of the 2004 Act to causing or
allowing serious physical
harm.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
the new clause, the maximum penalty for the extended section 5 offence
would be 10 years’ imprisonment. Before I explain why we have
concluded that the extended offence should be restricted to serious
physical harm, let me remind hon. Members of key elements of the
section 5 offence as it
stands.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Section
5 provides that members of a household who have frequent contact with a
child or vulnerable adult will be guilty of an offence if they cause
the death of that child or vulnerable adult or if each of three
conditions 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 12<a class="bkMark" name="Column12">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is met: first, that they were aware or ought to have been aware that the
victim was at significant risk of serious physical harm from a member
of the household; secondly, that they failed to take such steps as they
could reasonably have been expected to take to protect the victim from
that risk; and thirdly, that the victim subsequently died from the
unlawful act of a member of the household in circumstances that the
defendant foresaw or ought to have
foreseen.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
considering the parameters of an extended section 5 offence,
we have had regard to the definition of “serious” harm
already contained in the 2004 Act. Section 5(6) of that Act provides
that “serious” harm means harm that amounts to grievous
bodily harm for the purposes of the Offences Against the Person Act
1861. That definition would apply to the extended offence as it does to
the existing one. However, grievous bodily harm for the purposes of the
1861 Act includes psychiatric
injury.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
the section 5 offence places no particular duty on any person, to avoid
committing the extended offence, those in a household could be liable
if they had failed to take reasonable steps to protect the victim from
psychiatric harm. The risk of that kind of harm is much more difficult
to identify than the risk of physical harm, and there is a potential
risk that a broad offence that covered psychiatric harm could deter
people from caring for vulnerable adults, because they feared being
prosecuted for failing to foresee a psychiatric injury. We have no wish
to cause such fear to family members and carers, who can be under great
pressure in difficult
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
addition, the offence is most likely to be of relevance where the
victim is unable to give evidence, such as in the case of very young
children or mentally incapacitated adults. It would be extremely
difficult to show any psychiatric harm in such cases. Restricting the
offence in that way is also consistent with the existing position in
relation to the need to show a pre-existing risk of “serious
physical harm” in subsection 5(1)(c) of the 2004 Act, and is
consistent with the Government’s commitment not to criminalise
behaviour more broadly than is necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I turn now to
the maximum penalty for the extended offence. The Bill makes no
provision for penalty, which reflects my hon. Friend’s intention
that the maximum penalty for the extended offence should be the same as
for the existing offence—that is, 14 years’ imprisonment.
However, we need to ensure that the maximum penalty for causing or
allowing serious physical harm is proportionate when considered against
the maximum penalties for causing or allowing death, which is
14 years’ imprisonment, and against those for other
offences of grievous bodily harm. For example, the maximum penalty for
an offence under section 20 of the 1861 Act—inflicting grievous
bodily harm without intent—is 5 years’
imprisonment.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s view is that a maximum of 10
years’ imprisonment for an offence of causing or allowing
serious physical harm would strike the right balance. Accordingly, new
clause 1(5) would amend section 5(7) of the 2004 Act, so that the
maximum penalty of 14 years would apply only to the offence
of causing or allowing a person’s death. New clause 1(6) would
insert a new subsection (8), providing a maximum penalty of 10 years
for the offence of causing or allowing serious physical harm. Finally,
as is usual when creating new 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 13<a class="bkMark" name="Column13">&#160;</a>
                  </div>offences, new clause 1 includes a transitional
provision to ensure that the operation of the extended offence would
not have retrospective
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 2 would apply similar procedural and evidential provisions at
section 6 of the 2004 Act to the extended section 5 offence. The effect
would be to insert a new section 6A into the 2004 Act, covering
evidence and procedure in cases of serious physical harm. To put the
changes into context, it may be helpful if I first explain how sections
5 and 6 of the 2004 Act operate to prevent those responsible for the
death of a child or vulnerable adult from escaping
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000068">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">To
secure a conviction for the section 5 offence, the prosecution need not
prove which of “causing” or “allowing” the
death the defendant was responsible. The defendant will therefore be
convicted of the same offence whether he was personally responsible for
the unlawful act that killed the victim or whether he was a member of
the same household that failed to take steps to protect the victim when
he knew, or ought to have known, about the risk of harm that existed in
that household. That means that it is much harder for defendants to
evade justice by virtue of simply remaining silent or blaming each
other, as was illustrated in the case referred to by the right hon.
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale
East.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
section 5 offence is a serious stand-alone offence that carries a high
maximum penalty, but the aim of the Bill is to identify the person who
caused the victim’s death, so that that person can be convicted
of murder or manslaughter if appropriate. By itself, however, the
section 5 offence may not always open the way to such a conviction. The
less culpable party could still not be willing to explain what had
happened, or they might only give their version of events after the
close of the prosecution case. By that time, the judge would already
have withdrawn the murder or manslaughter charge from the jury on the
basis of there being no case to answer in the absence of any evidence
identifying which of the defendants was responsible for the
death.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In an effort
to identify the actual perpetrator, therefore, section 6 of the 2004
Act modifies certain evidential and procedural provisions in relation
to alternative charges in trials involving the section 5 offence. The
modified procedures apply where a defendant is charged with the section
5 offence and with murder or manslaughter in the same proceedings and
in relation to the same
death.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are two main changes to normal trial procedure. First, during the
trial, a submission of no case to answer on the murder or manslaughter
charge is delayed until all the evidence is heard—both from the
prosecution and the defence—rather than taking place at the
close of the prosecution case. The judge therefore makes the decision
after the defendants have given their evidence, if they have chosen to
do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
change concerns the drawing of adverse inferences from silence in
court. Where a defendant refuses to give evidence in court, any adverse
inference that may be drawn in relation to the section 5 charge may
also be drawn in relation to the murder or manslaughter charge, even if
there would otherwise be no case to answer on that count. Although a
jury cannot convict solely on the basis of an adverse inference, such
an 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 14<a class="bkMark" name="Column14">&#160;</a>
                  </div>inference may strengthen the prosecution case when the delayed
submission of no case to answer is made and
afterwards.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
section 6 procedures are intended to encourage defendants to give
evidence and to ensure that the more serious charge—murder or
manslaughter under the law as it currently stands—remains
available if evidence emerges as to who was responsible for the death
during the trial. Against that background, the Government agree with my
hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley that the evidential and
procedural provisions in section 6 of the 2004 Act should apply to the
extended section 5 offence. Given the extraordinary nature of these
provisions, however, they should apply only to the more serious
offences that are likely to be tried with the extended section 5
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Accordingly,
new clause 2 would provide that, in the context of causing or allowing
serious physical harm, the procedural provisions should be limited to
cases where the defendant is charged with the extended
section 5 offence and either with an offence under section
18 or section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 or with
attempted murder under section 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. As
with the existing offence, the modified procedures would apply where a
defendant is charged with the extended section 5 offence and one of the
other offences in the same proceedings and where the two offences arise
from the same serious physical harm caused to the
victim.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Grievous
bodily harm could result from other offences such as sexual assault or
child cruelty. In almost any other case in which grievous bodily harm
results from another offence, however, an offence under sections 18 or
20 of the 1861 Act could, nevertheless, be charged, so we think it
right to limit the modified procedures to those offences and to
attempted
murder.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
Members will know, the procedural measures in the 2004 Act were
discussed at length during the passage of the existing legislation. The
hon. Member for Hammersmith has alluded to what his position might have
been as a member of the criminal Bar at the time. The provisions,
however, have worked well in practice and have, to the best of our
knowledge, operated in the way intended. The extended offence and
procedures are intended, like the existing ones, to be a package of
measures that is both fair and
proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11062256000077">&#160;</a>
