<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hope that members of the Committee are sitting comfortably, because I propose to read quite a long note, which will cast new light on our amendments.
<P>
This is an important set of amendments, dealing with matters that I know are of great interest to the Committee, as they were to Lord Burns's Committee. The amendments relate to the Bill's key provisions on market abuse. I apologise for the fact that I shall speak for rather longer than usual, but I hope that my remarks will be of great interest to members of the Committee.
<P>
The starting point for the new regime is the importance of major financial markets, which sit at the heart of every modern economy and provide a mechanism for intermediation between savers and borrowers and between risk-takers and those who seek to hedge risk. They help to ensure the efficient allocation of resources, by channelling funds to where they are best employed. They also provide information on the fair market price of a range of assets. The prices that are set in the London commodities exchanges, for example, are used the world over in setting the terms of contracts between the producers and users of commodities. If the efficiency and liquidity of major United Kingdom markets are reduced, the effect is not confined to only a small group of market participants but is felt more widely. Ultimately, market inefficiencies impact on economic growth and the UK's overall prosperity.
<P>
UK financial markets serve more than the domestic economy. London is one of the world's three financial capitals. The City's expertise and innovation bring huge job and revenue benefits to the UK. That is a major factor in the UK's success story.
<P>
We are perceived to have fair and clean markets. We need to ensure that we keep it that way and, where possible, improve that reputation. That is vital in a world of rapidly changing global markets which compete for business.
<P>
We protect the financial markets in two ways. First, there are the criminal regimes for market manipulation and insider dealing. Those are both serious criminal offences, which carry a maximum sentence of seven years in jail and an unlimited fine. Secondly, there is the regulatory regime under which various regulatory bodies can take action against regulated persons for market abuse. However, there is a gap in the protections. The criminal law covers all market participants, but only a narrow range of serious criminal offences. The regulatory regime is capable of dealing with a wider range of damaging behaviours, but applies only to the regulated community.
<P>
Many commentators on the Bill have often exaggerated the differences between the new regime and what is possible under the current system. There are two key changes from the current position. First, the new regime extends the regulator's reach to cover all those who abuse the markets—both those who are regulated by the Financial Services Authority and those who are not. For example, where an unregulated person squeezes or attempts to squeeze a commodity market, that can have serious effects on other market participants and on the wider economy. However, that behaviour cannot be properly addressed at present. Secondly, we are trying to introduce greater transparency in this area for the regulated community.
<P>
It has often been overlooked by those commenting on part VII that under the existing system the regulator can take action for breach of rules or for breach of high level regulatory principles where abuse has occurred. It is worth recalling that the Joint Committee which examined the market abuse regime accepted in principle the need for a market abuse regime that complements the existing criminal offences.
<P>
We have set out the mischief on the face of the Bill rather than leaving the scope of the regime to FSA rules. The primary legislation sets an understandable outer boundary to the regime. That will be developed by case law providing greater certainty at the margins over time. We recognise that from the outset the new regime needs as much certainty as is reasonably possible. Financial markets move quickly and we do not want to inhibit innovation.
<P>
In order to provide greater certainty, clause 96 requires the FSA to produce a code of market conduct. It is intended that the code will set out the types of behaviour that are acceptable and unacceptable in a way which the Bill cannot do adequately in a changing world. The FSA consulted on a version of the code in June 1998 just before the draft Bill was published. It is now looking carefully at the many comments it received during that consultation with the help of a practitioner group and a group of exchange representatives.
<P>
The FSA intends to produce a revised version of the code and will consult on it next spring. That will, of course, take into account changes made in the Bill. As a result of the consultation responses on the Bill and the Joint Committee's recommendations we have made a number of improvements to the regime. I shall run through those briefly before moving on to today's amendments.
<P>
Following the consultation on the draft Bill it was suggested that the new market abuse penalty regime would be classified as a criminal regime under the European convention on human rights. The Joint Committee heard evidence on that from a number of witnesses and extended its investigations into the Bill to look at that question. In the light of consultation responses and the evidence of witnesses to the Joint Committee, we reviewed the question of the likely convention classification of the market abuse regime. We decided as a precautionary measure to introduce the convention criminal protections for market abuse penalties. Our arguments were fully stated in the written and oral evidence that we gave to the Joint Committee.
<P>
We recognised that there was a possibility that it would be classified as criminal for convention purposes and to avoid any risk of a finding that the Bill does not fully comply with the convention requirements, we decided to introduce the relevant protections. The first protection is against the use of compelled statements in proceedings to impose a market abuse penalty on the person who gave those statements. That is provided for in clause 144. The second protection provided under article 6 of the convention is the provision of subsidised legal assistance where a person has insufficient means and where the interests of justice so require.
<P>
We said in our memorandum to the Joint Committee of 14 May that we would look into how to make legal assistance available in cases involving the imposition of penalties for market abuse. We will table amendments in due course but I should like to take this opportunity to set out briefly what we propose.
<P>
We intend to provide for a stand alone legal assistance scheme. It will be entirely separate from the existing schemes for legal aid and will be administered by the court service alongside its role in running the tribunal. The scheme will be available to provide assistance to individuals who choose to refer a case involving a penalty for market abuse to the tribunal.
<P>
As the Government made clear, legal assistance is not generally available for tribunal proceedings as they are intended to be speedier and less formal than court proceedings. We do not intend to extend its availability under the Bill to cases other than those for the imposition of a market abuse penalty. It will be subject to both a means test and an interests of justice test in accordance with article 6 of the ECHR. Eligibility according to those tests will be determined by the tribunal. However, I should make it clear that the nature of market abuse cases is such that we would expect the interests of justice test to be met in the majority of cases.
<P>
The eligibility criteria will be set out in regulations to be drawn up by the Lord Chancellor's Department. The scheme will be funded from a levy that the FSA will raise from authorised persons. The money raised will be passed directly to the court service which will, as I said, be responsible for administering the scheme. The FSA will be the other party in all cases to have a role in that.
<P>
The levy will be raised by the FSA as part of its arrangements for raising fees from, and distributing penalty income to, authorised persons. The FSA will consult on the distribution of those costs, just as it will consult on the distribution of the penalty income.
<P>
Another change that we have made in response to consultation concerns is to provide that compliance with the express provisions of the FSA's code of market conduct is a complete defence against the charge of market abuse. If someone does something that is expressly permitted by the code, the FSA will not be able to take action. If the FSA thinks that the behaviour should be deterred, then it will have to change the code.
<P>
We also announced to the Joint Committee that we would be exploring two additional changes to the market abuse provisions. The first was to provide explicit protections for those who take reasonable steps to ensure that they do not commit market abuse. The second was to clarify that the regime will apply only to market participants.
<P>
The amendments to clause 95, which we are bringing forward today, would give effect to those two commitments and make several helpful clarificatory changes to the provisions. Let me explain what we have done and why.
<P>
First, let me deal with the changes related to the market participants issue. Concern was expressed during consultation and by witnesses to the Joint Committee, that the regime could catch people who were engaged in behaviour that had nothing to do with the market. An example is that the regime could catch striking copper miners since their actions could be said, although with severe straining of the language, to have had a distortionary effect on the market in copper futures, which would be a market protected by the regime.
<P>
Our regime was never intended to catch that sort of behaviour. The intention is to catch behaviour that does not live up to the standards expected by those who regularly use the market—hence damaging confidence in the markets. Looked at another way, only behaviour that does not live up to expected standards can damage confidence.
<P>
The Bill currently provides for that in clause 95(1)(c) by making a condition of abuse such behaviour as would be likely to damage the confidence of informed participants that the market is a true and fair one, or would be likely to damage confidence if it became commonplace. However, in the light of the concerns that were expressed we looked at how we could make it clearer that the regime did not apply as widely as some had feared.
<P>
We therefore adopted a different approach—to make it clear that it will be market abuse only when someone acts in a way that regular users of the market would consider to be a failure to observe the standard of behaviour reasonably expected of a person in his position in relation to the market. That would be the effect of amendment No. 346.
<P>
What regular users will expect will differ from case to case and market to market. For example, the market is likely to have higher expectations of a knowledgeable investor or an issuer than an ordinary member of the public. As part of that change, we have replaced the ``informed participants'' of the current provision with a hypothetical regular user of the market. The regular market user is defined by amendment No. 356 to be a reasonable person who regularly deals on the market. He has to be, effectively, the cousin of the courts' reasonable man. He represents the distillation of the standards expected by those who regularly use the market. Unlike the current ``informed participant'', he represents a single view. If people engage in behaviour that fails to meet the standards expected by the regular market user, that user's confidence in the market would be affected and he would be less likely to deal in it.
<P>
If they are to work properly, markets rely on people to observe proper standards. Where people do not do so, the markets can be damaged. For that to happen it is not a necessary condition that the person causing the damage intended to do so. Market integrity may also be affected by people acting without due care and attention. That is why I ask my hon. Friends to oppose amendment No. 139, tabled by Opposition Members.
<P>
The amendment would provide that, in the case of misleading impressions and distortions, abuse would occur only when someone intended to carry out the abuse. In many cases, people obviously intend to carry out their abuse. Where they do, penalties will be imposed under this regime. However, in relation to those who deliberately abused the markets, penalties could be higher as a result of amendment No. 360 to clause 99, to which we will return in due course. Rather like driving without due care and attention, people can cause a great deal of damage without intending to do so.
<P>
For example, the markets rely on those responsible for providing information to do so having taken due care to ensure that the information is accurate. If a company were to release information which misled investors, about, say, its current profits or planned activities, it should be possible to take action against it if the circumstances warrant it, for example if they were negligent. Similarly, if a trader does not take care to follow market rules or conventions, on disclosure, for example, and, as a result, the market is misled, it should be possible to take action.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not saying that, in such cases, market abuse would have necessarily occurred; I am saying that they should not be outside the scope of the regime. The Opposition's amendment would put them outside its scope.
<P>
People will be guided on what is abuse by their own understanding of market conventions and practices, and by the FSA's code of conduct. To continue the driving without due care and attention metaphor, the code will act like the Highway Code in giving guidance on the type of behaviour that is acceptable, and on what is unacceptable. Therefore, I hope that Opposition Members will not press their amendment.
<P>
It is worth recalling that, in paragraph 266 of its first report, the Joint Committee acknowledges the force of our argument against requiring proof of intent. The Joint Committee did, however, say that the regime should be modified so as to include some form of safe harbour for honest and careful persons. We provide that safe harbour in amendment No. 347. The amendment, as well as making changes to the conditions of abuse to take account of the changes introduced by amendment No. 346, also introduces two new safe harbours.
<P>
It proposes that in determining whether behaviour is abusive, regard must be had to the extent to which the person concerned took care to avoid engaging in abuse, or believed that the behaviour would not amount to abuse.
<P>
Whether someone took sufficient care, or had reasonable belief that his behaviour would not amount to abuse, will depend on the facts. That is true of similar provisions in the Bill. It is not possible, nor would it be sensible, to specify exactly what steps were sufficient. In one case it may be sufficient to rely on guidance from an exchange, but in another, it may be that formal legal advice is required from experts.
<P>
A specific safe harbour is also provided against a charge of market abuse through amendment No. 354 which provides that those who act in conformity with FSA rules cannot commit market abuse. This is intended to cover in particular things done in conformity with price stabilisation rules and Chinese wall rules. However, it is drafted widely to cover behaviour that conforms with FSA rules, on the basis that if people act in accordance with the rules, it would be wrong to proceed against them for market abuse.
<P>
The purpose of the Government's amendments is not to make significant changes to the underlying regime; like the changes that I have already explained, they are aimed importantly, at clarifying the Bill's intent.
<P>
Our amendment No. 347, as well as making changes necessary to take account of the move from the phrase ``informed participants'' to the term ``regular market user'', makes some additional changes to the conditions for the mischief. These will introduce greater certainty. In the condition dealing with information abuse, we have moved from the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relevant in deciding whether or not to enter into transactions'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is arguably too wide, to the narrower
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relevant when deciding the terms on which transactions . . . should be effected''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This change narrows the clause's effect, providing that abuse will occur only where the information goes to the terms on which the transaction might be effected, rather than the potentially much wider question of whether the transaction should be effected.
<P>
In the second condition relating to false impressions, following responses to consultations we have moved from the mischief being to give a ``mistaken impression'' to the more familiar ``false or misleading impression''. Again, greater certainty is the aim.
<P>
I hope that, in the light of these changes, the Opposition will not press amendment No. 372. The amendment would make it a condition of information abuse that the person engaging in the behaviour knew, or ought to have known, that the information was confidential.
<P>
The point at issue—that the information has to be information not properly accessible to other market participant—is already dealt with. The information has to be information which is not generally available. Clause 95(7) makes it clear that information is to be regarded as generally available if it can be obtained by research or analysis. In addition, abuse occurs only if the reasonable regular user thinks that someone—the person engaging in the behaviour—has failed to live up to expected standards.
<P>
The problem with using a term such as ``confidential information'' is that it would place some people under a duty to treat information as confidential and others not. I fear that that would create more uncertainty than it would resolve. If I were to overhear a conversation between two directors about an upcoming company announcement, it would not be clear whether that information was confidential in my hands. However, if I were to deal on the basis of that information, I would be engaging in behaviour that we want the regime to cover. The code will, of course, be able to say something about when information is not generally available to the rest of the market and to give any necessary additional clarity.
<P>
Amendment No. 350 simply makes it clear that the two types of behaviour for which subsection (6) provides, which are to be regarded as occurring in relation to qualifying investments, are not the only types of behaviour that fall into that camp. For example, the production of a false press release that gives people a misleading impression of the price of a company's shares would be behaviour in relation to qualifying investments. Whether it would be abuse would depend on the facts of the case.
<P>
Amendment No. 351 is intended to ensure that clause 95(5)(b) covers what we intend it to cover. It makes clear that behaviour in relation to a commodity whose price or value is expressed by reference to the price or value of the qualifying investment also comes within the regime. Spread-betting is an example of such behaviour. A person could have inside information revealing that an issuer of shares is about to collapse. That person could take advantage of such information by making a spread bet on the movement of the price of the share in question. The bookmaker would quote a price that reflects his own book rather than the share price by reference to which the bet is made and which may not depend on the price of the underlying share, although it will be expressed by reference to it. The amendment makes it clear that spread bets and similar investments will be within the scope of the regime.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 349, 352, 353, 355 and 356 make changes that follow from the move to a regular market user as the person who represents the view of the standards expected by the market. Amendments Nos. 140, 141 and 389 to 391 are therefore unnecessary. I hope that Opposition Members will seek to withdraw them in the light of the changes.
<P>
The Committee will have noticed that the Government amendments remove clause 95(1)(c) from the Bill, and I think that hon. Members have a copy of the clause as it will appear when revised. Subsection (1)(c) is no longer needed as behaviour that is not in accordance with expected standards would damage confidence in the markets if it became commonplace. The provision would not, therefore, add anything to the clause. The changes to the clause should allay concerns put to the Government by the industry about the level of certainty provided by the new regime. We have received indications from industry representative bodies and their advisers that our general approach is welcome.
<P>
By unpacking the concepts in the clause, we can make it clear that the only behaviour that will be caught is that which fails to live up to the expected standards of the market. Behaviour that does not live up to those standards and which involves abuse of the market will most emphatically be caught.
<P>
The new regime is a big step forward in protection of the major UK markets. It will be good for professional users of the markets, for investors generally and for the economy as a whole. I commend the Government amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): As the Committee will know, the clause, about which a deal was made in the Burns Committee, is one of the most important in the Bill. The financial services industry has made substantial representations about it. As the Opposition see it, there are, objectively, two crucial tests for the clause. The first test is essential fairness towards people working in the industry. The second is competition, or maintaining and supporting the UK's international competitiveness. It is important, but it is not yet seen as an objective. The clause covers matters in which, if the UK rules are not clear and there are no safe harbours, substantial volumes of business will move elsewhere.
<P>
The Government have gone a good way towards addressing the essential issues raised by the industry and by the Opposition. The Minister referred to industry representative bodies. I wonder whether the concerns of the British Bankers Association, the London Investment Banking Association and a firm of leading lawyers been fully assuaged by the redraft? There are stories of midnight oil having been burnt.
<P>
We are happy that there should be arrangements by which people may defend themselves satisfactorily against potential criminal penalties. We are not happy that those arrangements should be funded by a levy on the industry; it would be fairer if they were treated as other forms of legal aid.
<P>
I understood the Minister as having said that the redrafted clause was meant to apply only to market participants. One of our main concerns has been for Miss Innocent or Mr. Innocent—it would be unreasonable to expect such people to understand such complex matters, and wrong for the innocent to be found guilty of a serious crime when there was no intent.
<P>
As the Minister said, one of our key objectives has been the limiting of the offence to the misuse of confidential information. Issue could be taken with how to specify what is confidential and for whom. However, unless it is made clear that the phrase ``research and analysis'' used in subsection (7) does not cover the discovery of confidential information, that subsection will be vague The term ``confidential'' remains an important qualification and should be included.
<P>
The specification of intent to mislead or to distort the market remains crucial; under the original draft, an offence could have been committed without intent. The redrafted clause goes far to pick up on intent by a circuitous route. The position of the non-market participant with regards to intent is significant.
<P>
The power of the Financial Services Authority to impose market abuse penalties other than on participants should be limited to situations in which abusive behaviour was intended. I am not clear about what the Government intend by the redrafted clause. Under the original draft, anybody who had taken or refrained from taking action, and so had induced another to engage in market abuse, would have been liable. The Treasury has been cautious of the problem of defining intent, but the stock exchange council has grappled with the issue by having a defined checklist of what constitutes intent.
<P>
As the Minister commented, amendments Nos. 140, 389, 390, 141 and 391 become redundant following the redraft. I thank the Government for presenting the amended clause; the redrafting makes it much easier to understand. However, we wish to continue to press amendments Nos. 139 and 372.
<P>
Clause 95(1)(a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``qualifying investments traded on a market''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to which the rest of the section applies. As the Minister may be aware, there is controversy in the markets about what the phrase means. One camp within the industry thinks that it means that it limits the scope of the offence by applying only to those investment markets that are prescribed, and is taken to mean investments actually being traded as opposed to capable of being traded. Clearly, there could be off-market transactions that are not actually traded on such markets, but which are capable of being traded and we assume that it is the Government's intention to tackle the latter and not just the former. However, as it stands, the phrase lacks clarity.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a relief that in respect of Government amendments Nos. 346 and 356 we have to worry only about standards of behaviour and not market confidence. The more that one reads through Government amendment No. 347 the more it appears that there is a substantial back-door limitation to the application of intent. The clause invests in the new concept of the reasonable regular user of the market and we assume that it does not require such standards of Miss Innocent. As a result of the amendment, clause 95(1)(c) will state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``expected of a person in his or their position in relation to the market''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is capable of wide interpretation. We seek clarification that if, for example, it is the office cleaner or a clergyman's widow living down in Somerset, it means that one would not expect them to understand the new concept of reasonable, proper, behaviour by a regular user of the market.
<P>
The problem is that the standards of behaviour referred to are not defined; there is scope for uncertainty and a lawyer, a market-maker and a fund manager will approach the matter from different angles. The Minister said that case law should solve that problem over time but that it may be a little painful in the meantime.
<P>
To what extent is the proposal intended to apply to Miss or Mr. Innocent? From what the Minister said earlier it seems not at all, but we request clarification of that point.
<P>
We shall continue to press amendment No. 139, which provides the requirement of intent. Government amendment No. 360 seems to accept the principle of intention, at least in regard to defining penalties. Our points about the requirement of intent are, first, if a regulated firm is guilty of market abuse by accident, conviction is still unfair even though the fine may be small because of the lack of intent or recklessness. As a result, the firm would sustain bad publicity. The newspapers are bound to report guilt of market abuse rather than reporting that the fine was not large because there was no intention to commit market abuse. Therefore, a business could be severely damaged willy-nilly when there was no intent.
<P>
Many regulated firms are also part of non-United Kingdom groups and would need to notify their non-UK regulators about any regulatory offence. Perhaps the Treasury or the Financial Services Authority could deal with that specific issue. Regulators would not like to be told that a firm had committed the offence of market abuse if the firm had done its best to make it clear that the offence was neither deliberate nor reckless, a concept that the authorities may not understand.
<P>
Most importantly, the discovery of some cases of inadvertent market abuse means that the FSA on its own initiative will be able to require the firm to compensate all investors who lost out as a result, which is set out in clauses 333 and 334. The policy behind the market abuse provisions is to protect the investor. That is why the Treasury has not wanted to allow the defence of no intention. We will relax our efforts on this matter only if the Government tell the Committee that they will amend the clauses to make it clear that where there is no intention of recklessness, there will be no restitution order.
<P>
The alleged offender will also have to spend a considerable amount on expensive counsel to persuade the FSA that it should not find it guilty. Large trading companies will be just as likely as regulated firms to fight the FSA on an alleged offence. The Government could deal with some of those issues by other means, but the issue of intent has a knock-on effect that we want the Government and the Treasury to consider.
<P>
Government Amendment No. 347 sets the helpful test of misusing information. Criteria in clause 95(1)(b) and new subsection (2) have to be satisfied. The confusing reference to participants who are unaware of the behaviour has been dropped. The reference to information that is not generally available reflects previous amendments that were discussed in the summer. The restriction that information has to be confidential is necessary because the offence is not limited to insiders. I am sure the Government will recollect that several years ago we discussed what would happen if a man travelling in a train spots a major factory burning down and sells stock in the relevant company.
<P>
We are pleased that in new 95(3) the Government are honouring the commitment to follow the Burns Committee and to provide an exemption for people who have taken care to avoid the offence. However, it is helpful only to market professionals who know what they need to defend themselves against, although it is good that the Government have provided an exemption for persons who believe that their behaviour would not constitute market abuse. Government amendments Nos. 347 and 346 provide an objective test that is based on the position of the putative market abuser. That will help people who have no connection with the market and do not realise the possible effect of their behaviour. New 95(3)(b) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``believed that the behaviour in question would not amount to market abuse.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be better to say ``did not believe that the behaviour in question would amount to market abuse'' because that would afford slightly more protection to the innocent.
<P>
The clause currently requires the non-professional to think about market abuse, which he or she might not be capable of doing. In addition, as the Minister said, when the hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) was Economic Secretary to the Treasury, she promised the Burns Committee that the Government would introduce an exemption for people who were not market participants—the African copper mine issue. We should like to know where that exemption is. The Minister referred to honouring that promise, but we are not sure where that is addressed.
<P>
Amendment No. 372 suggests that an offence of misusing information should not be restricted to insiders or their tippees. It would qualify the information on which such behaviour is based—as in clause 95(2)(a)—as that which the offender knows or should know is confidential. The new draft of clause 95(7) begs the question where the borderline lies between research and analysis that does not constitute abusive behaviour and research and analysis that might be construed as abusive behaviour. We have attempted to deal with that by introducing the concept of confidentiality.
<P>
We accept that Government amendments Nos. 349 to 353 and 355 contain what are essentially drafting powers, but they also serve, self-evidently and deliberately, to widen the territory of what behaviour could give rise to abuse by including physical markets and attempts to rig those markets that could lead to changes in indices or even have an effect on the share prices of major stocks, so they include derivatives and options.
<P>
Amendment No. 352 puts the wording the other way round, but as stated, it still begs the question what constitutes research. Amendment No. 355 relates to the definition of informed persons. We believe that amendment No. 354 is important. The FSA and the courts are no longer directed to ignore the fact that likely behaviour did not occur. That reflects our previous amendment No. 391, which we have withdrawn. The Government's replacement is also important. As we understand it, it means that if FSA rules make certain requirements—for example, price stabilisation rules—compliance with those rules will not constitute market abuse. What is the position with regard to the rules of recognised investment exchanges approved by the FSA? I cannot remember if reference was made to this in the amendments or whether it was something that the Minister said, but I believe that she suggested that they would not be treated in the same way as the FSA's rules. We believe that that could cause considerable confusion and that it is the FSA's job to ensure, along with the various stock exchanges that it is willing to approve, that the rules of those stock markets on market abuse are satisfactory.
<P>
We cannot have a situation in which there are conflicting rules for market participants, which mean that there is no point in recognising the stock exchange. Therefore, the principle contained in Government amendment No. 354 should be extended to investment exchanges that are approved by the FSA, and any problems that the FSA may have should be sorted out.
<P>
That brings me to the end of this tortuous first group of amendments. We welcome and accept the Government amendments, which render ours unnecessary and inappropriate, but our key amendments Nos. 139 and 372 remain desirable and necessary to avoid injustice and bring greater clarity to the Bill.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should clarify matters so that we know where we are going this morning. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) suggested that he would like to vote on amendment No. 139, and he also mentioned amendment No. 372.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We will come to Government amendment No. 347, with which we shall have to deal formally, before we deal with amendment No. 372. If the Committee accepts Government amendment No. 347, amendment No. 372 will in effect be negated, because it seeks to amend a part of the Bill that the Government amendment would have removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. We were aware of that, but we would nevertheless like our amendment to be accommodated, because the redrafted Bill would remain the same, in that Government amendment No. 347 states that, under the conditions of clause 95(2),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the behaviour is based on information''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is such information, in both old and new forms, that we want to describe as confidential.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We could do that only through a manuscript amendment, which I would not accept at this stage because the Government amendment was tabled some time ago. Therefore, the only recourse open to the hon. Gentleman is to return to the subject on Report. Committee members should also note that, when the relevant Government amendments are put, I intend to take them en bloc. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to be caught unawares, and he should think about that if he wants a particular Government amendment to be put singly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Will we be allowed to comment on amendment No. 372 in relation to the Government amendment that will render it no longer applicable?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is permitted to discuss the amendment, but not to vote on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I should like to congratulate the Minister on the amendments, which extensively rewrite the market abuse provision. I had the honour to serve on the Joint Committee on Financial Services and Markets. Its report raised serious questions about whether the original provision was sufficiently clear and certain to be acceptable to the courts in the event of litigation, which will doubtless arise.
<P>
I am particularly pleased to see that clause 95(1)(c) will include the new test of the ``regular user'' of the market, whom my hon. Friend the Minister described as the cousin of the reasonable man. From the point of view of judges, who will feel comfortable with the new provision, it would perhaps be better to describe him as the grandson of the passenger on the Clapham omnibus. The provision is also welcome because the Government were not keen to add intent to the test of market abuse; nor have they ever liked my idea of requiring the regulator to make complaints of market abuse through the civil courts.
<P>
I am pleased that the Government have more than accepted the Burns Committee's recommendations on safe harbours. The new proposal to make compliance with the code a complete defence is the best that the Burns Committee could have expected. I also congratulate the Government on the additional protections for people who took care to avoid engaging in market abuse or believed that the behaviour in question would not amount to market abuse. That is a marvellous addition to the protection of the innocent.
<P>
I was surprised that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said that the Opposition would judge the provisions by two tests: fairness to market participants and the effect on competitiveness. What about the third test: the protection and promotion of the good name of the City of London? Our priority should be to stamp out the criminal and sub-criminal behaviour that affects the City's reputation for open and clean markets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My point was that it is implicit in the clause that that is its prior objective, which one must then consider against the two downside risks. Everyone agrees about the prima facie objective of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that explanation, but it is not good enough. The protection of the City's good name is not implicit—it is our top priority. That good name has taken some knocks in the recent past, and the current regulators have expressed frustration at their inability to get among the people who are misbehaving and root them out of the market. The new civil procedure of market abuse fills the gap in the regulators' armoury between the ability to punish breaches of the rules by administrative fines and the whole panoply of the criminal law, which has not been effective in a sufficient number of cases. I welcome the provision of extra powers to stamp out abuse and ensure that the reputation of the City of London is maintained and enhanced, because that is our top priority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Perhaps I might make a few comments before we have the opportunity to discuss some more specific points about the amendments during the clause stand part debate.
<P>
I welcome the rewriting of clause 95, which represents a drastic departure from the hole-ridden clause that we discussed in the Joint Committee and goes a long way towards addressing many of the concerns that we raised at that time. The Government have responded to many of the amendments that we tabled before the summer recess, and I would be missing a trick if I did not say that I am pleased about that. I particularly welcome the putting into black and white of the provisions relating to the use or non-use of compelled statements, and the firm measures on safe harbours, the availability of legal aid—although I question some of the practicalities of how that is to be operated—and the use of absolute defence for those who comply with the provisions of the code.
<P>
I look forward to the arrival of the code next spring. The Minister described it as being rather like the Highway Code, which summons up visions of Howard Davies appearing in green tights with his underpants outside as the force of law and order in financial markets. We have heard other oft-used metaphors returning, some of which are unchanged—such as the beleaguered African copper miners who are all going to be banged up for going on strike—and some of which have undergone variations. The Minister's predecessor, the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce, used the analogy of drunk driving, which the Minister has converted into driving without due care and attention. However, that is covering old ground.
<P>
I should like to back up the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs on Government amendment No. 346. The Government should give additional examples of what might be perceived to be sub-standard behaviour. More details are required because many different perceptions are involved. A lawmaker's perception of what is sub-standard behaviour is different from that of a practitioner in the market. If we have a system that is based on the perceptions of practitioners rather than one that is rules-based and subject to law, it could, in due course, be challenged.
<P>
I want to concentrate on amendment No. 372, which relates to confidentiality. If the Committee supports Government amendment No. 347, which will do away with that part of the clause to which amendment No. 372 relates, our amendment would still fit in rather neatly with the revision of the clause that is proposed in amendment No. 347. The Government could return to the matter on Report—perhaps having taken our amendment into account—if they are so minded. If not, we may revisit the matter ourselves.
<P>
The Minister said that the confidentiality requirement in our amendment was not necessary because amendment No. 347 refers to information from, for example, research or analysis. However, the Government's proposal covers a multitude of sins that could easily be abused. Consider, for example, someone who works in research and who, as a result of a heavily watered lunch, became privy to information from the finance director of a quoted company. He or she might make that information available to other members of a broking house in a memo entitled, ``News from the research department''. I am not sure of the extent to which that person, who used what would normally be construed to be confidential information, would be culpable.
<P>
I want to describe a scenario that may or may not be relevant but is based on a true story. Several years ago, the client of a firm of stockbrokers in the City struck up a friendship with the manager of a branch of Dixons. Perhaps they went out for drinks together. The client noticed that Amstrad, which in those days was an almost-failed computer company, was starting to produce cheap televisions and videos. I am sure that many of us remember Mr. Sugar's innovations during the 1980s.
<P>
As a result of conversations about that company with the manager, the client thought that Amstrad appeared to be a good investment. He had been privy to comments by the manager, who may have said, for example, ``We have shifted many Amstrad televisions this week,'' or, ``We have had to order 100 new sets in addition to our quota from regional head office.'' On the back of that information, the client geared up heavily—he continued to buy Amstrad shares and he bought options on them.
<P>
The bottom line of the story is that on an original outlay of £30,000, the client made a profit of more than £2.5 million—he became a very wealthy man. I should add, in his defence, that he gave half the money to charity. Was that information confidential or not? That is my point, which touches on the question of insider dealing. Anyone could have benefited, including a market participant or someone who had never invested in the market, let alone participated in it at a semi-professional or professional level. Any of those people could strike up a friendship with a manager of a branch of Dixons—not a director or privileged person in the company—and then form a view on the basis of information provided in a social context.
<P>
I think that that is a justified example—I am not sure whether such an investor would fall foul of the new criterion in the clause, as, strictly speaking, such information is not confidential. The information is not generally available to those using the market, but, as the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if available . . . would be likely to be regarded by them as relevant in deciding whether or not to enter into transactions involving investments of the kind in question''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am no lawyer, but I think that that Amstrad investor could fall foul of clause 95(2)(a) if confidentiality were not added as a factor. The information on which he was acting was patently not confidential, but restricted.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Would the hon. Gentleman's example not be covered by subsection (7)? Such information would be readily available to anyone who did the necessary research.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That is why I started by considering what constitutes research or analysis, and what is or is not readily available. A keen legal mind could argue the case one way or the other. Does the Minister think that that client could fall foul of the clause? He was known to the market authorities, as he became a big buyer of the stock in question, and inquiries were made, especially when the Amstrad share price zoomed up because good sales figures were announced. It was not considered as an abuse of the market, insider trading or other criminal activity. Would the clause make him culpable merely because he made the effort to obtain information from someone who was in a position to give a more considered view, without giving privileged, confidential figures? That is an example of a shortfall in the legislation. If the amendment were accepted, such information could not be construed as confidential, and loopholes would be tied up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I accept that the hon. Gentleman is raising a reasonable question. The Minister must address that quandary at the end of this debate. At the other end of the spectrum, however, the confidentiality test is far too narrow. For example, a person who deliberately breaches confidentiality—not to make the secret profit himself, but to tell someone else who can make it—would be let off the hook by the hon. Gentleman's amendment, as would a person who accidentally came by such information and made the profit. Both those people should be caught by the legislation, but the hon. Gentleman's amendment would prevent that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. His legal mind has come to the fore many time in our proceedings, but I am not sure that I agree with the logic of his argument in this instance. Amendment No. 372 proposes to insert, after ``information'', the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which he knows, or ought to know, is confidential''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that that deals with the hon. Gentleman's concern. If the manager of the Dixons branch had made it clear to the Amstrad investor that the information was confidential—that he had access to privileged information such as head office figures as part of his job—and if the Amstrad investor had used that information or passed it on to a chum who used it, a breach would have been committed by the original Amstrad investor and possibly by his chum.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that there are still shortfalls and that confidentiality helps to plug some gaps. We no longer have the clause to which the amendment applies, but will the Minister say whether I am right? Will there be scope on Report to revisit the question of whether confidentiality criteria would close some loopholes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is a most important debate on a key group of Government amendments. I am glad that they have been tabled, because they go quite a long way towards meeting at least some of the concerns that we had and which representatives of the market expressed forcefully to us and to Ministers.
<P>
The Bill must tackle market abuse. It is a difficult but essential subject. There is no dispute about the need to define market abuse and to punish it where it is intentional. I suspect that the clause will, in time, replace the insider trading provisions in other Acts, which have proved difficult to operate in practice, It is, therefore, doubly important that we get the provisions right.
<P>
What so alarmed us all when clause 56 of the draft Bill was first published was that the Government tackled the issue without due regard to basic requirements of fairness or giving explicit definitions of market abuse. That, combined with the lack of references to intent in the original draft, added up to a very scarifying clause.
<P>
I want to quote from the evidence that was given to the Joint Committee, of which I and my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) were members. In particular, I shall cite the evidence given by Lord Hobhouse, who is a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. He might, therefore, be faced with interpreting some of the Bill's provisions in due course. My intention is not to highlight the holes in the original clause or to show how inadequate it was. That is common ground, and the clause was, of course, a consultation draft. Rather, my intention is to show the seriousness of the issue and to identify some of the points to which the Government had to respond. I shall also draw attention to issues on which the Government have moved and to those on which they have not moved sufficiently.
<P>
Lord Hobhouse referred to an early meeting about what was then part VI of the Bill. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I am afraid the view that was formed by quite a number of us on that occasion was that it was not yet in a fit state to form part of a Bill to be introduced to the House.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to refer explicitly to clause 56. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``My concerns relate to Clause 56 and they really remain because there have been no changes proposed to Clause 56 and furthermore certain of the suggestions for the improvement of Clause 56 have been specifically rejected by the Minister.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said, Ministers eventually moved on the issue, and we are all grateful for that.
<P>
I should like to move on to Lord Hobhouse's particular concerns. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The first is that section 56 in conjunction with clause 58 is a power to fine, and it is a power to impose a punishment. Therefore, whatever may be the technicalities, it is essentially criminal''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister told us that the Government now concede that a power to levy large fines may take us out of civil and into criminal law and that certain changes have been made with that in mind. Lord Hobhouse continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Clause 56 subsection (1) does not make any conduct illegal and it specifically refrains from doing that. Therefore, as it is drafted at present it purports to authorise punishment for what is lawful conduct. That is something that is just wrong in principle. The situation is made more serious by the provision of subclause (9) which says that behaviour can be inaction as well as action. That means that somebody who is under no duty to act in a particular way, no legal duty, can nevertheless be punished for failing to act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That part of the clause remains. It is still an offence not to take action as well as to take action. He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Clause 56(1) drafts what we might describe as the ``offence'' in terms which lack certainty and clarity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Hobhouse then refers to the code of conduct which the Government are using as a way of getting over the lack of clarity. In other words, the code fleshes out what market abuse is to be and is supposed to provide clarity. We shall come to the code in a later debate but it is relevant to the amendments. Lord Hobhouse said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The code in my view, and I can amplify this if you wish, does not meet this objection, and indeed the function of a code in this context should be to provide a safe haven rather than to meet deficiencies in the drafting of the Bill itself.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have made that point in previous debates. Reliance on codes, rule books, regulations and secondary legislation is no substitute for setting down in primary legislation exactly what is to be criminalised or to be made the subject of disciplinary proceedings.
<P>
Lord Hobhouse returned to that later in the evidence-giving session, when he said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If you are creating a criminal offence or something that is tantamount to a criminal offence, then it ought to be defined in statute although certain Is may be dotted and Ts may be crossed in regulations for example . . . there must be a freestanding and adequate definition in the primary legislation itself.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our question this morning is whether the amendments and the redrafted clause give that certainty about what is being outlawed. Lord Hobhouse summed up by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``All those things when one adds them together add up to a scheme for punishing people who may be abroad, who may not be taking any active part in any market in this country, who have not done anything illegal, whose conduct is innocent, who are under no duty to act where they are accused of failing to act, and nevertheless punishing them for such conduct.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was a pretty devastating piece of evidence from a Law Lord. The Government have responded positively to many of these objections, but it still seems that the redrafted clause relies a good deal on subjective judgment. I revert to layman mode here as I am not a lawyer and have received very little legal training. Clause 95(1)(c) applies to behaviour that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``likely to be regarded by a regular user of that market''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as failing to observe standards of behaviour
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonably expected of a person . . . in relation to the market.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, a hypothetical person has to judge whether another person who may be abusing the market is behaving in a way that falls below what might reasonably be expected. That involves a good deal of subjectivity.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many people operating in markets are brash, make enemies and demonstrate intolerable behaviour in some respects. In that light, someone could fall foul of the provision not for acting illegally or abusing the market, but for falling outside the normal standards of behaviour, which often have more to do with good and polite conduct than gaining an unfair advantage. As I said, the provision entails considerable subjectivity.
<P>
The Minister might say that that is inevitable. However, we should examine the redrafted clause in the light of what was said by Lord Hobhouse and by Lord Lester, QC, who also gave evidence along similar lines. He pointed out that unless certainty was built into the legislation, it could fall foul of the European convention on human rights, which requires that people are punished only for actions that they know to be wrong or are clearly shown to be wrong in writing, preferably in an Act of Parliament.
<P>
Lord Lester also made the interesting point that the European convention on human rights is not some weird foreign convention. Article 6—the relevant provision—was drafted by British civil servants and incorporates certain
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``ancient British principles of natural justice and fairness''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the clause as initially drafted not only threatened to breach the new convention, which is to be incorporated into British law, but defied more ancient principles of British law.
<P>
My doubts about subjectivity remain, but my main concern is about ``intent''. Under Government amendment No. 347 it is necessary to have regard to ``the extent to which'' people
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``took care to avoid engaging in market abuse''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``believed that the behaviour in question would not amount to market abuse''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an improvement, but it is not watertight. It requires only that ``regard must be had'' to intent. Regard must be had by whom? Presumably, the FSA, but we need more than just guidance to the FSA, and who is to judge whether it has proper regard to those matters?
<P>
The amendment hardly places a requirement on the FSA; it is more a question of guiding it in the right direction. The language throughout the amendment seems to move towards the requirement that there should be intent to commit market abuse, and the unnumbered subsection in the redrafted clause helps, but still fails to lay down an absolute top-to-bottom requirement that someone must be intending to abuse a market in order to be disciplined. Will the Minister comment further on that?
<P>
If a firm abuses a market by accident and the FSA hauls it up and accuses it, but then lets it off with a small fine because the act was chiefly accidental and because it had regard to the question of intent, a great deal of damage could be done to the firm's reputation. Also, I think that a company that is a United Kingdom subsidiary of an American bank, for example, would have to tell the American regulator—the Securities and Exchange Commission—that the UK subsidiary had been guilty of market abuse, even though the fine imposed on it was small because there was not clear intent. That could be extremely damaging to the bank.
<P>
There is also the matter of compensation. If a firm was found guilty of market abuse but the intent was small, the FSA could nevertheless require it to compensate all investors and this could be enormously expensive. We shall return to the issue of compensation and restitution later in the Bill, but it should be made clear that where there was a lack of intent, restitution or compensation should not apply. It must remain obvious that guilt under the clause would damage a firm. We thought it important to put it beyond doubt that intent should be required. Our amendment No. 139 would do that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs asked whether non-participants in the market would be explicitly excluded. The language of the redrafted clause tends to catch only people who are engaged in the market or in some way aware of market rules. In an evidence session to the Joint Committee, the Minister gave the example of some warehousemen in an African copper business who might, through their actions, affect the price of copper on the London exchange. They would be unaware of this, but to some extent would be market participants—if we stretch that term quite far. Under no conceivable circumstance would they seriously be caught by the clause but, to exclude more marginal cases and to put the matter beyond doubt, it would be helpful to have an additional provision that defined more precisely who would be caught. Without it, the net would not only be widened unfairly but would be unenforceable, because it would not be possible to enforce rules against the categories of people I gave as an example. While I genuinely welcome much of the thinking behind the Government's amendments, I have doubts about their subjectivity and intent. They are written from the viewpoint that, to be caught, a person has to do certain things, and must know that he is doing them.
<P>
My final comment is a question to the Minister about clause 95(1)(c), which relates to intent and requires the behaviour in question to be likely to be regarded by regular users of the market as a failure to observe usual standards of behaviour. A person could unknowingly fall below certain standards but still be regarded as failing to observe them. I am not sure that that part of the Government's amendment includes provision for an element of intent. In some cases, a person's behaviour would be deliberately designed to breach customary standards of behaviour in the market but, in others, the person in question may not know what is usually required of him, and other regular users could judge retrospectively that he had failed to observe standards of behaviour. That could be true even if the behaviour was unintentional. Amendment No. 139 would put beyond doubt the intent requirement, which should be unambiguous.

<P>

<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The Burns Committee, to which the right hon. Member for Wells referred, was aware of two reasons why the clause as originally drafted contained a danger. One can be explained by reference to Lord Hobhouse, Lord Lester and others, who were concerned about the need to comply with the European convention on human rights, which requires the provisions to be clear and to avoid the use of compelled evidence. The revised draft has cleared up that complaint; it is much clearer. Later during our consideration of the Bill, we shall discuss a clause that deals with the avoidance of using compelled evidence. The regime therefore conforms with the procedure for criminal cases under the European convention on human rights. The Government are to be congratulated on both of those points and on the way in which they have dealt with them.
<P>
The Burns Committee considered another important point, which I thought at the time was the subject of consensus among all parties. I refer to the issue of intent, which goes to the heart of the Bill. One of the problems with which the Bill attempts to deal is the number of cases that have arisen in the past in which someone got away who was blatantly—and clearly to anyone with common sense—guilty of market abuse.
<P>
Such cases were almost impossible to prove in court, which is the essential argument against including provisions on intent in the Bill. Intent is almost impossible to prove and would be a major loophole in the legislation. The market abuse clause before us would be virtually inoperable were such provision to be introduced; the intent of guilty parties would not be capable of being proved, and their cases would often fall. Hon. Members have an interest in not only securing justice for those subject to the provisions, but also in ensuring that cases that blatantly transgress the provisions result in prosecution. The lack of appropriate legislation would cause a tremendous lapse of public confidence.
<P>
I do not, therefore, believe that intent should included in the Bill in the manner proposed in amendment No. 139, and I hope that the Government will not yield to it.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Let me start at the beginning, with the remarks of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. The hon. Gentleman mentioned legal aid funded by the industry. I believe that the Government's position, as set out in our amendments, is consistent with our general approach throughout the Bill: namely, that the costs of regulation are to be met by the industry. The industry will, after all, also benefit from the rebates of the fine income. It is therefore only reasonable to expect it to meet the costs of legal assistance on the other side of that system. That approach is entirely consistent.
<P>
Hon. Members have mentioned the concerns of the British Bankers Association, the London Investment Banking Association and others. The Joint Committee has consulted closely with industry advisers. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned the midnight oil; I could not possibly comment. We have discussed the proposed changes in considerable detail, and they have been broadly welcomed by various industry advisers.
<P>
I shall quote Charles Allen-Jones, a senior partner of Linklaters and Alliance, which has been working on the industry's behalf in respect of a number of the changes being made. Charles Allen-Jones stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``HM Government's proposed amendments to the market abuse regime are the result of a detailed and constructive dialogue with the leading industry associations representing wholesale businesses. HM Treasury's proposed amendments to the Bill are broadly to be welcomed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``HM Treasury's response to the industry's concerns is a step forward in defining more clearly those abusive activities which market participants should not engage in.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen-Jones continued:</B>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Industry associations will continue to offer assistance to HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority in relation to part VII of the Bill and the Code of Market Conduct to try to ensure that the market abuse regime is workable from the industry's perspective while remaining an effective regulatory tool.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We share those ambitions, and it is right that I place that on the record. The London Investment Banking Association has said that the change is a substantial improvement, and that is to be welcomed. I am grateful for Opposition Members' support for these changes and for my hon. Friends' enthusiasm for the revised clause 95.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
In terms of market participants, I confirm that the proposal will apply only to those who have a position in relation to the market. The end of revised clause 95(1)(c) refers to that. I am sorry that the subsection between (2) and (3) on the printed sheet is not numbered. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred to it as subsection (3) but there is already a subsection labelled (3). It gets a bit confusing, but we will cope with it.
<P>
We considered whether it would be possible to define who the market participants were, but having discussed the issue with the FSA, with a practitioner group and with a group of exchange representatives set up by the FSA to review the code, it became clear that that would not be a fruitful approach. There are too many types of abusive behaviour that we want to deter that do not involve participation in the market in the narrow sense of buying, selling or holding investments to make a restriction of scope based on definitions either meaningful or practical. For example, let us suppose that someone who is not buying, selling or holding shares mocks up a press release which gives a false and misleading impression. We would not want the regime to be able to cover such an example in principle, even if the person was not buying, selling or holding effective investments at the time.
<P>
The new regime is concerned with the effects of behaviour, not with the intent behind it. It is concerned with market efficiency rather than moral culpability. Clearly, we want to be able to catch those who intend to abuse markets, but in addition confidence in the markets can be affected by actions regardless of the underlying intentions and we want people to act with due care and attention when interacting with financial markets.
<P>
The regime has never caught innocent behaviour as some have claimed. The hon. Gentleman spent some time referring to a Miss or Mr. Innocent but it is not our intention ever to catch that innocent behaviour. We have unpacked the concepts previously wrapped up in the old clause 95(1)(c) to make it clear that only behaviour that a reasonable regular market user thinks is a failure to observe proper standards will be abuse.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked about the phrases able to be traded or capable of being traded, and I can tell him that the off-market transactions will be within the scope of the regime. Off-market behaviour investments traded on the prescribed market can damage those markets and we may wish to consider the hon. Member's point. The intention is to catch investments in which there is a market on a specified exchange. The intention is to pick up the hon. Gentleman's point about the phrase capable of being traded.
<P>
The copper miners and warehousemen are looming large in our thinking. I make it clear that the copper miners do not have a position in relation to the market and the reasonable regular user would not regard their industrial action as a failure to observe the standard of behaviour expected of them, so they are outside the provision and that is our clear intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</b> I want to continue with the point about the oft-quoted copper miners. Let us suppose that the copper miners' union in South Africa bought shares in a copper company on the London market—Zambia Copper, for example—and then the workers went on strike, so a link could be imagined between strike action and the price of copper rising from which the union benefited from a rise in the share price. Would that union be guilty of market abuse?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson: </b>That remains to be decided. We have not discussed how to get out of such a problem because it is not clear what the connections might be in such circumstances. That would have to be decided as a subsequent issue. Clearly, the genuinely unconnected activities of a group of miners who have no significant intent, as we were discussing, would be outside the envisaged regime. I am trying to make that point clear. The hon. Gentleman can dream up more examples, but we cannot decide a position on them through our discussions. We can all dream up further, more complicated examples; the purpose is to make clear what would happen in a specific circumstance.</B><P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs expressed interest in compliance with exchange rules. The difficulty is that certain behaviour may occur across exchanges. Although that behaviour might comply with exchange rules, it could nevertheless be abusive. There have been examples of manipulation of investments on derivative exchanges through transactions on another market on which the subject matter of the derivative was trading. I do not want to go into detail, but it is clear that such abuses can occur and that there is no end to the ingenuity of those who might want to abuse the market.
<P>
The Joint Committee, which heard both sides of the argument, concluded that our approach was the sensible one; it did not consider that a case had been made for the enactment of such a safe harbour. Exchange rules influence the question of whether an abuse has occurred; there is a germane question as to whether a reasonable market user feels that a person's behaviour represents a failure to live up to the expected standards.
<P>
The words ``research and analysis'' are clear enough. Something that can be obtained through proper research or analysis—through the use of analysts or models, for example—will not be considered to constitute information not generally available. Any uncertainty can be addressed by the FSA's code of conduct.
<P>
On the question of deliberate or reckless actions, the revised clause makes clear that matters such as belief and diligence are relevant to the question of whether there has been market abuse. However, the Government feel strongly that there should be a capacity to impose sanctions on negligent behaviour—the analogy is with driving without due care or attention—and for sanctions to be imposed even if the behaviour is not dangerous. The Joint Committee acknowledged the arguments against requiring intent.
<P>
The point of clauses 333 and 334 is that, even if there is no intent, abuse can result in a loss for investors. It is right that restitution can be provided in such cases. The purpose of the clauses is to ensure that investors are no worse off than they would have been had the abuse not occurred.
<P>
I cannot comment on the fantasies of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham; I must move on to substantive points, although I note his fantasies about the highway code. If, by making inquiries while conducting research, a person obtained information—on Amstrad's trading record, to use the hon. Gentleman's lengthy example—that information could be said to have been generally available. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) said, a restriction to confidential information would not be the right approach. The key issue is whether the use of information falls below the accepted standards—that is the central test. What may be perceived as constituting sub-standard behaviour will vary between markets, depending on the rules, practices and conventions of those markets. References to a reasonable regular user of a specific market represent a distillation of the standards of proper behaviour expected by that market. The FSA's code of conduct, which underpins the regime and which will be subject to consultation with the markets, will be able to deal with any areas of uncertainty.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The highway code analogy might have been fantasy, but my other examples were far from being fantasy—they were based on fact. I cannot understand how my Amstrad investor would know whether investing in Amstrad shares after speaking to the Dixons manager constituted sub-standard behaviour. He would be even more in the dark, especially as his action was not castigated by the stock exchange and the authorities at the time.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hesitate to trade examples of sub-standard behaviour, endless though they are, because that could take a long time. However, a good example of sub-standard behaviour is a squeeze on the commodity market, whereby someone abuses a dominant position to cause prices to rise to artificial levels. Although that is prohibited under commodity market laws, they extend only to members of the market.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) referred to Lord Hobhouse's evidence to the Joint Committee. With regard to clause 56 of the draft Bill we are dealing with illegal conduct and the need to authorise punishment by extending the regulator's reach to cover all market participants, regardless of the categorisation in the European convention on human rights. As we are not creating a new domestic criminal offence, there is no need to stipulate that a particular course of conduct is illegal. The position is similar to a breach of FSA rules. The Bill will penalise a person who behaves in a particular way, but we are reconsidering the redrafting.
<P>
To protect the markets, the regime needs to consider the circumstances in which market participants fail to act in accordance with market practice or their obligations. For example, a company's failure to inform the markets of a major new development as required by the market or listing laws could constitute market abuse. Similarly, someone who squeezes the market may not take any action, but, merely by continuing to hold a particular position, could be involved in an abuse. The right hon. Member for Wells said that the offence should be on the face of the Bill, but the mischief of market abuse is clearly set out. The European Court of Human Rights has recognised that many laws are widely drawn, especially where an area is subject to change. Nevertheless, we are concerned that there should be a reasonable amount of certainty, which is reflected in the changes. Market abuse legislation is supplemented by a code of market conduct which will provide examples of what behaviour is and is not acceptable. Where behaviour complies with the express provisions of the code, it will be a complete defence.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the regime will be subjective. Once again, I refer the Committee to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford who pointed out that the reasonable man is familiar to the law and the courts. He represents an objective and dispassionate view. I have no doubt that the courts and tribunals will find the concept as workable in this matter as it is in other aspects of the law.
<P>
In his evidence to the Joint Committee, Sir Sydney Kentridge, the Treasury's legal adviser, explained that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the European Court of Human Rights has said on many occasions that some sorts of even true criminal offences can only be stated in general terms. The more you define it, it has sometimes been said, the more loopholes there are.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say that although he was not a draftsman, he believed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the tribunal and the court would make sense of that definition.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is even more so the case in relation to the definition in the revised clause.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked about good and polite standards. For abuse to occur, it must meet all conditions in clause 95(1) which include the regular user test, but it must also be covered by clause 95(2) which provides that behaviour needs to be based on information that is not generally available or likely to mislead or distort the market. Good and polite conduct does not fall within those conditions.
<P>
As for what he said about taking care, the changes mean that someone who has taken care to avoid market abuse will be protected. The starting point is that the behaviour will be considered to be abusive only if it does not live up to the standards that an objective, reasonable and regular market user would expect. Even without the words that we have included, we consider that the question of whether a person has taken care not to abuse the market would have a significant influence on the view that a reasonable regular market user would take about whether the behaviour fell short of the proper standard.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In our discussions, it has been suggested that it would be desirable, although not essential, if that were made clear, which is what we have done. I hope that answers the hon. Gentleman's points. I encourage my hon. Friends to resist the temptations put forward by the hon. Gentleman and to support the Government amendments.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 348.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The amendment requires the Treasury to consult all relevant interests before it prescribes the market to which the clause applies. That is a reasonable requirement. Ministers collectively have indicated elsewhere that they are happy to consult on these matters, but the amendment puts it beyond doubt. That is especially important as the Government's amendment relates to electronic trading and to which overseas markets that can be accessed from the United Kingdom should be covered by the clause. The subject of electronic trading is interesting. It is not an appropriate subject for general debate now, but it is an issue to which we wish to return. We do not believe that the Government fully understand e-commerce and the related questions of jurisdiction and enforcement, but they are huge and growing issues. Under clause 95, it seems that, in principle, the Government want to include markets that can be accessed from the UK. Perhaps the Minister will say a little more about that. If that is to be the case, it is particularly important for the Government to consult on the matter. We have seen, in Bills relating to distance selling and e-commerce, that there is a conflict between the Government's intentions and relevant developments in the European Union and the United States. Questions of territoriality and jurisdiction are prominent. If the Government are to avoid making mistakes, consultation is the least that is required. If the Economic Secretary to the Treasury cannot currently give us details of her intentions, an undertaking to consult when the time comes would be welcome.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the Opposition for tabling their amendments. As the right hon. Member for Wells said, amendment No. 310 would place an obligation on the Treasury to consult relevant interests before prescribing the markets that will be covered by the new regime. We have been round this loop several times. We discussed the matter at length before the recess, and I hope that we shall not spend too long today repeating that debate.
<P>
Of course we intend to consult, wherever appropriate, on the exercise of the Treasury's powers. We have also consulted on the draft scope order, on the question of mortgage regulation, on the recognition requirements for investment exchanges in clearing houses and on our approach to financial promotions. In July this year, we issued a consultation document about the markets that should be covered by the new market abuse regime, which is precisely what the amendment would require us to do.
<P>
On the consultation document, the markets that we propose to cover are the six currently recognised UK investment exchanges. They enjoy an international reputation as being well-regulated markets, and we need to maintain that reputation. In deciding which markets to designate, we said in the consultation document that we believe that there are three key factors to take into account: the expectations of market participants about the market's integrity, the reliance that market participants place on the market—the more that people place reliance on the market's facilities, the more likely the market is to be damaged by abusive behaviour—and the market's wider economic importance.
<P>
Consultation finished at the end of September, and we are currently reviewing the comments that we received. Officials will discuss the issues with several interested parties. I say that to keep Committee members informed and to demonstrate that the Treasury consults on draft regulations, where appropriate, and takes account of such consultations. This morning's debate is a good example of the way in which we take close account of comments on the Bill. The history of the Bill and our proposed more general changes are also testament to that.
<P>
Before I turn to amendment No. 142 and to Government amendment No. 348, I should explain how clause 95(5) will work. I hope that I can show that concerns that have been expressed about subsection (5) are unfounded. Clause 95(3) will allow the Treasury to designate any market anywhere as a market that should be covered by the regime, although we are currently planning, as I mentioned, to prescribe only the six currently recognised UK investment exchanges. Clause 95(5) will cut back on the scope of those provisions. As the Bill is currently drafted, the only behaviour that will come under the scope of the regime, regardless of which markets are prescribed, is that which occurs in the UK or which has an effect on a market that is situated in the UK. If we designated an overseas market, clause 95(5)(a) would allow us to take action when someone in the UK abused that market. That is a potentially useful power in this age of global markets and of increasing regulatory co-operation. We could not, in that situation, take action against someone overseas who abused an overseas market.
<P>
Clause 95(5)(b) involves the other side of the coin. It will allow the FSA to take action if someone overseas abuses a market that the Treasury has designated, but only when that market is situated in the UK. If someone in Monaco, for example, used privileged information to buy shares that were traded on the London stock exchange, he would fall within the scope of the regime.
<P>
There may be practical difficulties with taking action when a person is located overseas, but that is not a reason to exempt such behaviour. That is in line with the approach that was taken in section 47 of the Financial Services Act 1986, which relates to the criminal offence of market manipulation. It is worth noting that our proposed changes to clause 95 make it clear that if someone overseas acts in accordance with local rules, there is unlikely to be abuse. Such behaviour is likely to be in accordance with what the regular market user would expect from someone in their position in relation to the market.
<P>
Amendment No. 142 would allow the Treasury to specify through regulations the markets against which which the FSA could potentially take action in terms of behaviour overseas. I cannot see the purpose of the amendment, given the effect of Government amendment No. 348, which potentially extends the regulator's reach to behaviour overseas that affects a market that is capable of being accessed electronically from the UK. I say ``potentially'' because, although we do not currently intend to prescribe any such markets through an order under clause 95(3), it is prudent to allow for that possibility. We simply do not know how markets will develop in future, especially in relation to the growth of the internet. If a situation arose in which a major UK market—in the sense of a market that had a major impact on the UK economy—was not located in the UK, but was accessible electronically from the UK, we might want to prescribe it. It could be treated as a UK market in practice even if, in legal terms, its headquarters were elsewhere. That might be logical if most of the market's business was done from the UK between UK persons, although the market itself was located somewhere else, perhaps for tax reasons.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If I understand the Minister correctly, subsections (4) and (5) potentially provide for two different regimes for abusive behaviour. Under one of those, if the abusive behaviour occurs in the UK it does not matter where the qualifying investments are traded; under the other, if the investments are traded on a UK market both overseas and domestic abusive behaviour are covered. It appears that, at least initially, market abuse will apply only to anybody in the UK or overseas who may be committing market abuse on one of the six designated UK markets—but, for the sake of parity, the UK is reserving the power to be involved in markets anywhere in the world if the abusive behaviour has emanated from the UK.
<P>
Amendment No. 142 is necessary because subsection (5)(b) should relate only to those markets which the Treasury—or, ultimately, the FSA—has designated. Otherwise, matters will be left somewhat wide open and indeterminate. Also in relation to subsection (5)(b), will the Minister explain whether the Government intend it to mean in the United Kingdom, from the United Kingdom or both? I believe that she said ``from the United Kingdom'' during her earlier comments, but the Bill uses the words ``in the United Kingdom''. While both meanings could be equally applicable, the Government apparently intend that it should be the former.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The only behaviour that is caught is behaviour that affects the markets that we prescribe under clause 95(3). Therefore, behaviour in the UK in relation to overseas markets would be caught only if we prescribed those overseas markets.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I should like to raise a couple of points relating to the Minister's comments on the redrafting of the clause. I shall not turf over the ground of our continuing concerns, but I want to ask the Minister some further questions about the levy. The subject was raised by the Burns Committee, but at that stage the Minister did not commit herself. Many of us feared that, to judge by her comments, the levy will apply to all authorised persons. She also said that the offsetting of penalties in respect of market abuse will work in the same way as regulatory fines elsewhere in the FSA structure. That raises the question, which we have already debated, of whether FSA income and fines from penalties will be used to offset fees paid by authorised bodies that subscribe to the FSA. If there is to be a stand-alone system, as I believe the Minister described it, how will fines be set against the levy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman point out where reference is made to fees or levies in the redrafted version of clause 95?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am raising the point now because the Minister raised it during her introductory comments. I would have thought it germane for the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard), who did not challenge the Minister's attempt to clarify the redrafting of the clause, to raise the matter under clause stand part.
<P>
If the fine income from market abuse exceeds the cost of legal aid for those who are entitled to it under the two criteria set out by the Minister, will the levy be dropped, so that, conceivably, in one year there will be no levy or a reduced levy? That is my understanding of the way in which the regulatory part of the FSA will work with regard to offsetting fines and penalties against subscription fees. We appreciate that the finer details have yet to be worked out, but will the Minister confirm whether, in principle, fine income might result in the reduction or elimination in a given year of the general levy for legal aid costs? Will that levy be uniform for all members? On what calculation will it be based?
<P>
As I said, I shall not retread the old ground of other points for which we continue to seek clarification, but I ask the Minister, without going into detail on the mechanics of the system, to give a specific explanation of how it will work.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have already discussed fees during the debate on schedule 1, and we shall discuss penalties when we consider clause 98. Although the Minister mentioned the subject and it is worthy of debate, I ask hon. Members to keep the discussion as tight as possible and not to anticipate what the Committee shall discuss later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> Fear not, Mr. Atkinson, I have no intention of touching on fees, charges or rebates.
<P>
First, it would be remiss not to thank the Minister for providing us with the redraft of the clause, which has saved time and focused the debate on the relevant issues. Secondly, I should like to remind the Committee of a previous speech that I made on the extent of financial crime and the authorities' fear of it. I do not want to repeat all the statistics, but, clearly, financial markets around the world are worried—the trends towards globalisation and developments in information and communications technology make the risks of financial crime greater not less. Public awareness of such issues has grown rapidly, most recently in relation to Russian money laundering in banks in New York and a branch of a New York bank in London. People are therefore acutely aware of the dangers of financial crime.
<P>
I want to draw the Committee's attention to the views of a couple of authorities on the importance of civil remedies, alongside the traditional criminal remedies, for insider trading cases. Michael Ashe and Lynne Counsell's ``Insider Trading'', published by Tolley, quotes from testimony given to a Senate committee in 1990 by Richard Breedon, who was then chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He, in turn, quoted a previous report with approval:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `the civil fine has assumed a place of paramount importance in the compliance arsenal of most federal regulatory agencies. It is today almost inconceivable that Congress would authorise a major administrative regulatory programme without empowering the enforcing agency to impose civil monetary penalties as a sanction.' ''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That shows how the idea of having civil remedies alongside criminal ones has taken hold in other countries, as it should in our country. I also want to quote from Maurice Punch's ``Dirty Business: Exploring corporate misconduct'', which was published in 1996. The paragraph concerned is from a chapter called ``Ten Cases of Corporate Deviance'', in which the author describes the cases of Drexel and Ivan Boesky in America, and comments:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It should not be underestimated, however, how difficult such a series of investigations and prosecutions are for control agencies. Agencies are faced with complex conspiracies that are not easy to unravel . . . and that require considerable investment of people, resources, and time. The suspects are protected by top lawyers, by using every delaying tactic in the book, and by the intricacies of their offshore secret holdings and dummy corporations. In essence, prosecution is facilitated by the willingness of suspects to talk, by plea-bargaining, and by a combination of civil and criminal cases.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The complementary nature of having criminal and civil routes in the armoury is important to the effectiveness of the overall regulation.
<P>
Some hon. Members will be worried that the civil route will completely overtake the criminal one. The right hon. Member for Wells said that, in future, one or more of the criminal offences might be subsumed by the civil procedure. I hope that the Committee will be reassured by what the Treasury and the FSA have said previously about the intended practice for the future. The Treasury gave a note to the Joint Committee on issues of double jeopardy, which made the point that criminal cases would always be considered ahead of civil ones. The FSA's response to the consultation on the new market abuse regime emphasised that it will always consider first whether the criminal route can be taken. I hope that that assures hon. Members that we are considering the introduction of complementary powers, and not a takeover by the civil route because it is easier than the criminal one.
<P>
The intention behind the market abuse complementary powers is to establish a regulator that we can respect, which will give us markets that we can trust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I make a brief point, to which we shall probably return when we discuss clause 127? Although the FSA has the instrument of the code to communicate with the industry, it seems to me that the United States practice of no-action letters is relevant in providing market clarity. In relation to this territory, do the Government envisage addressing the issue of the FSA's being able to, and obliged to, provide no-action letters?

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Confusion remains among Opposition Members—and perhaps among Labour Members—as to what constitutes a market participant. In her summing up, the Minister said that the Government were not concerned with people who published information on, for instance, the internet, who in any case were not shareholders or investors in a company. If, as has happened many times, an internet user—perhaps a disgruntled employee—publishes a phantom announcement on a company, which affects that company's share price, is there no facility for the FSA to impose a penalty on that internet user if he or she is not an investor in the company and therefore does not financially benefit directly from that action or if that internet user turns out to be an investor in that company or a disinvestor in that company? For example, if such a person sold short shares in the company, and then made a phantom announcement on the internet, suggesting that the company was about to face, for example, a massive compensation suit he could benefit financially from buying back the shares at a lower price if the share price reacted.
<P>
I am not sure whether the maker of a phantom announcement on the internet is defined as a market participant, first, if he or she is a shareholder in that company or would benefit financially from that announcement, or secondly, if he or she does it for no financial gain but purely for fun or out of a sense of grievance. Can the Minister confirm whether that person would be affected as a market participant in either of those two cases?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford for his remarks. Let me also place on record the fact that Opposition Members found it useful to have the revised clause before them this morning.
<P>
As my hon. Friend said, the new regime fills a gap beneath the criminal regime covering market abuse. The gap is the fact that the regulators cannot take action against unregulated market participants who damage the market. We decided not to extend the boundaries of the criminal regime to deal with that. In our view, that would not have been proportionate. However, the criminal offences will remain, and when criminal offences have been committed and the public interest and evidential tests for criminal proceedings are satisfied, they will be taken.
<P>
On no-action letters, the FSA can do what the Securities and Exchange Commission does. The no-action letters that the SEC gives do not preclude the SEC taking action even when someone complies with the terms of the letter. As the SEC said, no-action letters are not given for fraud. The FSA has the power under the Bill to give firms guidance on particular issues. That carries weight although in the case of the SEC, compliance with it would not be a complete defence either.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with the points made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. I may have put in an extra negative at some point. Let me make it clear that we are concerned about the situations he described and that they would be caught by the provision.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Could the Minister clarify that? I gave two different scenarios. Is she saying that they would be caught if they were a shareholder and would benefit financially or if they were not a shareholder and would not benefit financially? Would they be caught in both cases or only one?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> They would be caught in both cases.
<P>
I turn now to the more general point about fines and legal assistance. I am bearing in mind your point, Mr. Atkinson, about straying beyond the clause and into clause 98 and others. We will table amendments to the Bill on fees, fines and legal assistance. There will be a chance to look at the details more closely then. The income for the penalties will be remitted to authorised persons in accordance with the mechanics to be set up under paragraphs 16 and 17 of schedule 1 which we dealt with some time ago. We will have to look at all of that in the context of our amendments dealing with legal assistance.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 95, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 357, in page 44, line 42, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for the purpose of helping to determine'<P>

<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`containing such provisions as the Authority considers will give appropriate guidance to those determining.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 358.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The clause places a duty on the authority to prepare and publish a code that will allow it to set out in more detail than primary legislation the kind of behaviour that can constitute market abuse. In the United States where a regulatory regime has operated alongside the criminal law for some time, the approach has been to have general legislation which has been interpreted over the years by different cases.
<P>
Rather than wait for case law to build up, we have provided a code to give greater certainty at the outset, although we would expect it to develop over time. It is an important element of the new regime, setting out with more transparency and certainty than before the kinds of behaviour that will constitute market abuse.
<P>
Originally the code was given evidential weight in the Bill: that is, a breach of the code tended to prove that there had been a breach of the primary legislation. A number of those who responded to consultation on the draft Bill were concerned that it would be possible for someone to comply with something permitted by the code but nevertheless be proceeded against for market abuse. We have discussed that this morning.
<P>
Although the FSA would clearly not take action against someone who had, in good faith, complied with the code, we decided to enhance certainty in this area and announced to the Joint Committee that we would make compliance with something expressly permitted by the code a complete defence to the charge of market abuse. That is provided for in clause 87.
<P>
Where someone breaches the code it will not, however, be conclusive that he has committed market abuse. The FSA will have to prove that his behaviour comes within the definition as set out in the Bill. In that case the code will carry evidential weight. The FSA has already done a lot of work on the code. It published an initial draft code for consultation in June—consultation paper 10. That draft was deliberately produced before the Bill was published to give people a clearer idea of the kind of behaviour that would be covered by the Bill's regime. It is not therefore totally in line with the provisions in the Bill.
<P>
The FSA received a large number of comments on the draft code which is not surprising, given that, to an extent, we were breaking new ground. Although the financial services regulators can take action against authorised persons who abuse the markets, there has been no attempt to set down the kinds of behaviour that constitute market abuse. Attempting to shine a light on such a subject inevitably focuses minds, and the FSA is succeeding in narrowing the current grey area.
<P>
Following consultation, the FSA set up a practitioner group, which has met regularly to consider possible changes to the code. A group composed of representatives of all the exchanges and clearing houses is also discussing the code. Work has been proceeding since the beginning of this year, and the groups are making good progress. If the Committee agrees to amend the primary legislation in line with our commitments to the Joint Committee, the way will be clear for the FSA to publish a revised version of the code and embark on a further round of consultation, which it plans to do next spring.
<P>
In the amendments, we say a little more about the nature of the code. They make it clear that its overall job is to give guidance to help to determine whether behaviour constitutes market abuse. The specific matters mentioned in subsection (2)—the descriptions of behaviour that does or does not amount to abuse and the factors to be taken into account—are examples of the guidance that the code might give.
<P>
We are introducing the change to make it crystal clear that it will not be enough if the code contains nothing but descriptions and factors: it must also provide guidance on primary legislation. That is in line with the intention of the FSA, which is concerned to provide as much clarity and certainty as it reasonably can. It is worth putting the matter beyond doubt. The industry has expressed concerns, which we are laying to rest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Both the amendments are clearly sensible and helpful. Mere descriptions of behaviour that does or does not constitute market abuse cover little territory. We hope that the guidance notes to which the clauses give rise will be considerably more helpful to the industry.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 358, in page 45, line 1, after `may', insert `among other things'.—[Miss Melanie Johnson.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 392, in page 45, line 8, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) If the Authority becomes aware that there is uncertainty as to whether particular behaviour may or may not amount to market abuse it shall use its best endeavours to make its opinion public by altering the Code accordingly as soon as practicable.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 393, in page 45, line 14, leave out from `of' to end of line 15 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the public'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 394, in page 45, line 18, leave out `interested persons' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the public'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 396, in Clause 99, page 46, leave out lines 13 and 14 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the public'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment deals with a situation in which the authority becomes aware of uncertainty as to whether particular behaviour amounts to market abuse. It states that the FSA
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall use its best endeavours to make its opinion public by altering the Code''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as soon as possible.
<P>
There will be disagreements in the markets about whether particular behaviour represents market abuse. Clause 96 requires the FSA to produce the code to determine such issues, and we have seen the draft. If the FSA becomes aware of differences of opinion—they would have to be pretty significant for it to do so—it should resolve them and spell out its view as quickly as possible. We would expect the FSA to do that anyway, but it is important that it is told do so in the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 393, 394 and 396 deal with slightly different, but related issues. Although the amendments to clause 95 narrowed to some extent the range of those who will be covered by provisions on market abuse, we could still be talking about a wide range of people. The Minister's response a moment ago to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, made it clear that the provisions will not be limited to market participants. The code should be promulgated publicly. Our problem with the present test is that everyone could be subject to the fining power, yet it could be argued that it had not been brought to their attention.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As I said, the clause places a duty on the authority to prepare and publish a code. The FSA will keep the code under review and, after consultation, will be able to change it. That is wise in the world of rapidly developing financial markets. Whether the code's provisions create undue uncertainty will also be kept under review, though we must accept that full certainty is impossible. No code or rule book can ever be fully comprehensive.
<P>
It is unnecessary to place an obligation to take steps to amend the code where there is uncertainty, as under amendment No. 392. One of the FSA's objectives is to maintain confidence in the financial system, so it will need to check that the code plays a part in that. In discharging its general functions under the Bill—including giving advice and guidance—the FSA must have regard to the principles in clause 2(3). It is worth reminding hon. Gentlemen of some of those principles.
<P>
The FSA is required, under clause 2(3) (c) to have regard to the principle that burdens or restrictions should be ``proportionate to the benefits'' and, under paragraph (d), to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the desirability of facilitating innovation in connection with regulated activities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (e) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the international character of financial services and the desirability of maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom'';<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and paragraph (f) stresses the importance of competition.
<P>
The FSA is therefore under strong obligations to reduce or remove uncertainty. It will also be able to issue guidance under its general powers to do so where it considers it appropriate. Leaving aside the rest of the accountability arrangements, which we have debated many times, the practitioner panel—which must include authorised persons in exchange and clearing house representatives—will be able to make representations on how the FSA discharges its functions under clause 2(3).
<P>
Additionally, the FSA proposes to set up formal mechanisms for ensuring that the code stays up to date and does not inhibit innovation. As stated in consultation paper 10, the FSA expects to use practioner input to carry out periodic reviews of the code in its operation and it intends to consult on the precise arrangements when it next consults on the code.
<P>
The FSA will obviously be well plugged into the market through its day-to-day regulation and people will not be slow to point out any uncertainties in the code. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs to withdraw amendment No. 392, which is unnecessary. Making a requirement in the provisions here would call into doubt what the FSA has to do in other areas where it needs equally to keep its rules and policies up to date in the light of developments and representations.
<P>
In considering changes to the code, the FSA will be under similar obligations to consult as it would with respect to approved persons under part V. As the Committee knows, we will introduce further amendments in due course to bring into line the various provisions on consultation throughout the Bill. That will oblige the FSA to ensure that it consults in a manner best calculated to draw the public's attention to its proposals. I therefore welcome amendments Nos. 393 and 394 in principle.
<P>
The changes that we make will be general and will affect the policy statement and codes in parts V, IX and XIII. I hope that, with my assurance that we will give effect to them later—albeit with a slightly different approach—the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will withdraw the amendments. I also hope that he will withdraw amendment No. 396, which deals with consultation arrangements for the policy statement produced under clause 99. The issue is the same, but the change that we want to make will be part of the process of aligning various requirements to consult. I hope that, in the light of my assurance to give effect to it later, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the basis of the Minister's undertaking, we are happy to withdraw. We are glad to hear that that the code will be republished, if necessary. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
