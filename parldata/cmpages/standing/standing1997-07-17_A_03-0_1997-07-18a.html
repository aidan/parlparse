<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before our proceedings begin on amendment No. 19 to clause 6, may I, for the benefit of members of the Committee, advise them of another piece of procedure. I assume that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has asked permission for gentlemen to remove their jackets in Committee, a request that I would willingly grant as the weather is warm. Oddly enough, jackets cannot be removed without the permission of the Chairman--which is sexist because it does not apply to ladies. We now come to clause 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): If there has been any discourtesy on my part, I wish to clarify how grateful I am to you, Mr. McWilliam, for what I think is now a ruling in favour of men. Indeed, may I say on behalf of a household that is 80 per cent. female--and that is excluding my mother--that the sexism of the long-standing tradition of men having to ask permission to remove their jackets in Committee should be investigated by the Chairman's Panel.
<P>
On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
The Opposition are worried about the present situation. Because of the arrangements made by the Business Sub-Committee, we were unable to complete consideration of clause 3 last night. Uncharacteristically, I was burning to make a long speech on the 10 pages of schedule 2. That brings me to clause 4, which I am sure that members of the Labour party would have wanted to debate, not least because it is an important clause connected with profit-related pay and the definition of clause 5. I am sorry that we did not debate those provisions. I wish to put that on the record, in the hope that we can now proceed expeditiously with today's business.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I send my good wishes to the mother, cousins and aunts of the hon. Member for Daventry. They are much in our thoughts, but should it not be drawn to the attention of new Members of Parliament, whom you have been most gracious in assisting--as well as those of us who still regard ourselves as new hon. Members--that, had the Opposition not spent so much time bringing us up to date with their family circumstances, we might have made better progress?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I presumed that the hon. Member for Daventry was about to move the amendment, but clearly he was not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) wishes to move the amendment, which is tabled in our joint names.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you. I presume that the hon. Gentleman's granny will not be mentioned during the debate.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Fuel and power for domestic or charity use</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 5, line 23, leave out `1st' and insert `17th'.
<P>
I am not so sure about your latter point, Mr. McWilliam. My hon. Friend's granny is our consultant on several matters connected with pensioner incomes, a matter that I am about to investigate.
<P>
The amendment would change the date of the value added tax reduction affecting fuel and power in domestic households. As is happening so often under this Government, there is less in the apparent benefit than meets the eye. When we start to examine why they chose the date of 1st September to put the cut into effect, various questions arise. Why did the Government not cut VAT on domestic fuel and power from Budget day? After all, they increased hydrocarbon duties, including the duty on heating oil, from that date. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry's mother, who is a pensioner, heats her home with heating oil on which she is already paying extra duty. That went up on Budget day, and she is disappointed that the reduction in VAT on domestic fuel and power does not take effect until later in the year.
<P>
The first question--why did the Government hit everyone with the tax increases on Budget day but postpone the apparent benefit until September--gives rise to a second question. Why did the Government choose the date of 1 September? I wish to ask the Financial Secretary about the effect that that date has on the consequential uprating of pensions and benefits. Members of the Committee will know that the uprating of pensions and benefits in April is based on the performance of the retail prices index to the year ending 15 September.
<P>
The September dates are important. By selecting the date of 1 September, the Government have ensured that the RPI to the year ending 15 September rises by slightly less than it otherwise would, resulting in a lower uprating of pensions and benefits on 1 April. There is a clawback: the apparent reduction in VAT is eroded by the lower uprating of pensions and benefits by the choice of date.
<P>
What does the lower uprating mean in cash terms? It has been difficult to obtain that information from the Treasury. We were told in a written answer that the reduction in VAT on fuel and power would mean an average fuel bill saving for single pensioners of 30p a week and for couples of 40p a week. What will be the effect on that cash benefit of the lower uprating that I have just described? The answer was not forthcoming, but it is important that we should know the true cash benefit to those various categories of household.
<P>
It puzzles me greatly and makes me rather suspicious to know that the information is available to the Government. We know that from other written answers received from another Department. I say that in the context of the Treasury's almost Trappist silence. I have tabled a good many written questions in recent weeks, spurred on by the professed willingness of the Government to adhere to codes of openness, but instead of the Treasury giving us more information, it is giving us less.
<P>
I said that the information is available, and I meant exactly that. My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) asked a similar question about the effect on pensioner and other households of increasing VAT on fuel to 8 per cent., which we did during the previous Parliament. He deliberately asked not only about the direct cash effect of the VAT increase but also about the possible uprating of benefits and pensions as a consequence of that slight increase in the RPI. In other words, my hon. Friend had spotted that, although there was a cash disbenefit to households, it was compensated for at least in part by the increased benefits awarded at the time and the additional uprating due to the higher RPI figures.
<P>
The rather remarkable answer--all members of the Committee ought to listen at least to this--was that single retirement pensioners were no worse off as a result of the imposition of VAT at 8 per cent. because of the benefits that were awarded to them and because of the additional uprating. Moreover, couple retirement pensioners were made 5p a week better off following the increase in VAT from zero to 8 per cent. We have heard, in Committee and elsewhere, several hon. Members asserting that the imposition of VAT on fuel bills made pensioners worse off. That is not true, and we have the Government's word for that.
<P>
All that information came from the Department of Social Security in a written answer supplied on 24 June by the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley). The methodology and the information, therefore, are available to the Government, but when I tabled a similar question about the effects on uprating of a reduction in VAT, I received no such information.
<P>
Perhaps one part of the Government does not know what another part knows, but I suspect that the Treasury has a new rule of not supplying information that is embarrassing. I regret that. It is hypocritical, as it flies in the face of all the assurances on openness, which are repeated and made a virtue of in the infamous ``The Pocket Budget''.
<P>
Incidentally, that booklet cost &#163;50,000 to print and distribute. We pointed out in earlier debates how misleading it was on the advance corporation tax credit changes on pension funds, which were not mentioned--the proposals are all rolled up in some guff about the need to invest more. The booklet is misleading and expensive, but it takes pride in the apparent new culture of openness. That is directly contradicted--particularly starkly in this case--by the Treasury's refusal to give information about the clawback of the apparent VAT benefits, even though that information is available elsewhere in the Government.
<P>
The Financial Secretary should make amends for that and give us the information by the end of this debate. I ask her a direct and simple question; we know the effects on single and couple retirement households from 1 September, but what will the clawback be as a result of the lower uprating in benefits next April?
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo)</b>: I am delighted that the right hon. Member for Wells, in moving the amendment, now accepts that VAT on fuel should be cut to 5 per cent.; he is merely quibbling about the date. That is a bit cheeky, given that his Government increased the rate from zero to 8 per cent., having promised that they would not, and would have taken it to 17.5 per cent. if they had not been stopped by the combined parliamentary skills of the then Opposition. If the rate had been 17.5 per cent., as the previous Government intended, there would have been no opportunity to reduce it to 5 per cent. I am delighted that the Conservative party is now going to accept our proposals; even at this late stage, its U-turn is very welcome.
<P>
Under the clause, VAT on fuels will be cut on 1 September, in line with our election promise, to 5 per cent. That date was chosen because it was the earliest one that could be negotiated so as to ensure that the cut was implemented before the winter.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's argument was a little confused. One minute he complained that we were introducing the change on 1 September and asked why we did not delay it until 17 September, because of the RPI calculation; in the next breath, he complained that we had not implemented it on Budget day, which would have had the same effect in relation to the RPI as will our proposed implementation date. I encourage the right hon. Gentleman to decide which line of attack he wants to pursue on the measure, with which he now apparently agrees.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The reason that the change has been delayed until 1 September is that we needed to negotiate with the power companies and to give them time to make adjustments to their billing and accounting procedures in order for them fairly to implement the cut in the rate to 5 per cent. I am glad to be able to tell the Committee that the excellent negotiations undertaken by the officers of Customs and Excise have secured that agreement.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): Is the hon. Lady saying formally that when the Government were considering the date on which the reduction of VAT on domestic fuel would come into effect and decided on the date of 1 September, the consideration that that would involve a saving to public funds and an additional loss to pensioners--because the rerating will take place on 17 September, when the reduction in the cost of domestic fuel will be a factor in calculating that rerating--played no part in their deliberations?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was just about to come to the question of the RPI. The manner in which the hon. Gentleman poses his question makes it sound as if we deliberately picked a date to get under the calculation of the RPI--we did not. However, I would not want to mislead the hon. Gentleman by saying that the RPI consideration did not enter our discussions. He would not expect me to say otherwise, because every decision needs to be taken on the basis of a balanced view.
<P>
The question was posed in a most ungenerous way by the right hon. Member for Wells, who suggested that somehow a deliberate clawback was involved. I must assure him that that is not the case. The compensation package that was put in place by the previous Government when the 8 per cent. rate was introduced remains in place, despite the fact that VAT on fuel is now to be reduced to 5 per cent. Pensioners will still receive the compensation for the 8 per cent. rate, but they will only pay 5 per cent.
<P>
The benefit to pensioners, to those on low incomes--in fact, to all of us--is a constant benefit, not a one-off, whereas the RPI calculation is performed annually.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked for the figures, which I am now able to give him. The calculation with which I have been supplied is that the RPI will be reduced by 0&#183;12 per cent. That is equivalent to 10p per week; and the benefit is &#163;18 a year, so pensioners and low-income families will receive a net gain. They will keep the differnece in compensation between the 5 per cent. and the 8 per cent. rate. The difference between the VAT rate and the RPI update will be more substantial because the VAT rate will be cut to 5 per cent.
<P>
To delay the change until 17 September would deny people the benefit during the intervening period, and would cause considerable problems for the energy companies' billing procedures, because they are now ready to make the apportionment on Monday 1 September. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment and endorse the Government's decision to reduce VAT on fuel to 5 per cent. on 1 September.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for at last giving a figure. I think she said that the clawback will be 10p a week, but it was not clear whether that will be for all households, pensioner households, single-pensioner households, pensioner couples or whatever. Given that she has the figures, she should give them to us and explain exactly what the impact will be on each category of household.
<P>
I ask the hon. Lady to consider that moving the date from 1 Septebmer to 17 September, as we wish, would deny pensioners the benefit of the cut in VAT for two weeks. So, at 30p a week, we would be making single-pensioner households 60p worse off. However, by avoiding the clawback, they would quickly get that 60p back on the higher pensions and benefits that would accrue from next April. So by accepting the amendment, the Committee would ensure that all pensioners--indeed, all households--benefit for an additional year from higher pensions than those that would be paid if the Committee agreed to the date in the Bill.
<P>
Labour Members say much about being on the side of vulnerable households, but this is an opportunity for the Government to do something for those households. Let the talking and posturing stop; let Labour Members do something for their constituents and accept an amendment which, by changing the date, would ensure that all pensioners received an additional year of higher benefits because of changing fuel prices.
<P>
We shall watch carefully to see which hon. Members vote and how they vote. New Labour Back Benchers can do something for the people who sent them here, other than sending them warm words and assurances which, in practice, mean no lower fuel bills for millions of their constituents.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not wish to delay the Committee, but the right hon. Gentleman is pursuing a spurious point. I gave the figure for the average pensioner. The right hon. Gentleman then asked for other, detailed figures. I assure him that, for instance, the figure for a standard pensioner is &#163;3.90 per annum; the gain will be &#163;18 per annum. The figure for a married pensioner couple is &#163;6.23 per annum. However, as the right hon. Gentleman wants to debate this point, I must tell him that he is on a loser because the measure will provide extra money to households. By retaining the compensation and by cutting the rate of VAT on 5 September, people will gain every year as a result of the change.
<P>
If the right hon. Gentleman is still not satisfied with my answer, I shall study what he has said and, if any further information can be made available, I shall write to every member of the Committee to provide them with it. But I have given the information that we have, and that answers the queries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before the Financial Secretary concludes, I thought that she said--it might have been a slip of the tongue, or I might have misheard or misunderstood her--that the date of the change was 5 September. In the Bill, it is 1 September. Is that what she intended to say?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I apologise if I said 5 September. If I did so, it was a slip of the tongue. The date of the change is Monday 1 September.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> To confirm the point, the hon. Lady has said that there will be a clawback of more than &#163;6 a year as a result of the lower uprating of benefits and pensions. Because of her choice of date--1 September--that clawback will take effect on 1 April next year. If the amendment were accepted, that would not be the case. Therefore, Labour Members will shortly be voting on a decision to deny those pensioner couple households that additional benefit for the next financial year. Let us be clear that that is what they will be doing, and they will be judged accordingly.

Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rate of duty on spirits</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Government are not cutting spirits duty, as we believe they should, and the rate of duty will rise on 1 January 1998. There are two issues involved: the date and whether there should be a cut. We understand that the Government are undertaking a review of alcohol taxation, so it is not clear why an increase in line with inflation has been signalled for 1 January, which rather prejudges the outcome of that inquiry. If it is intended to be a genuine inquiry into the impact of duty increases on the industry and matters such as alcohol consumption, cross-border shopping and smuggling, surely it is unwise to signal in advance that alcohol duties will be increased in line with inflation from 1 January, when we are expecting another Budget shortly after that date.
<P>
Spirits are in a slightly different category from many alcoholic drinks in that they are taxed highly in respect of the alcohol they contain. There is a differentially high burden of duty on that form of alcoholic drink. In recognition of that, over the past two years, the previous Government cut the duty on spirits by 4 per cent. a year in real terms, which adds up to a pretty hefty cut of 13 per cent. in real terms. Not only did the previous Government think that taxation on spirits was getting out of line, they recognised that there is a particular effect of such duty on an important British exporting industry.
<P>
It is well known north of the border that the Scotch whisky industry is one of the great British success stories--it is sold throughout the world. However, the industry continually runs into the problem of foreign countries discriminating against Scotch whisky and, to a lesser extent, other spirits in favour of domestically produced drinks. That problem is frequently taken up by Ministers on visits abroad, but often without success.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Governments and tax authorities tell us that we in this country also discriminate against foreign spirits and ask how can they be expected to level their playing field to help Scotch whisky when we have an equally uneven playing field. In recognition of that, my right hon. and learned Friend, the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), as the then Chancellor, started to cut spirit duties in real terms. He could not do it all at once and he could not do anything too dramatic in a single year, but by bringing duties down two years in a row and showing his sympathy for the case, he sent a clear signal to British industry based at home and foreign Governments and tax authorities that we were meeting the point that they were making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Will the right hon. Gentleman tell us whether consumers receive any of the benefits of those tax cuts? I do not think that they do.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not know where the hon. Gentleman does his shopping; perhaps he does it at the Co-op, which I am sure held on to the additional profit accruing to them. I am pleased to say, however, that in the place where I shop there was a sign in the window last Christmas and over the new year saying that the full duty cut had been passed on to consumers--so I would suggest that the hon. Gentleman shops around.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper </B>(Pontefract and Castleford): Has the right hon. Gentleman considered the sales impact of those cuts, because I understand that sales have not significantly increased, despite the 4 per cent. cut on spirit duties in the previous Budget?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Lady is absolutely right that a secular decline in the sales of certain spirits--I believe whisky is included--has set in. It is unfortunate that in this country whisky--I am speaking like a whisky salesman although I assure the Committee that I never have been one--has become associated with older drinkers whereas in country such as Spain it is a young person's drink. It is therefore true that the whisky industry is experiencing a steady reduction in domestic consumption of certain, but not all, spirits. Nevertheless, the Government should respond to that by lightening the burden if it is perceived as unfair, so that the decline does not become precipitate and consequential on an unfair duty burden. Another reason for our having cut spirit duties was to help overseas sales which, as I said, are buoyant in some countries.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): Would not the right hon. Gentleman accept that his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) suggests that he believes that the demand for spirits is inelastic because he has accepted that there was not a big increase in sales when the duty was reduced? The effect of his proposal to reduce duty would therefore result simply in a fall in revenue to the Treasury; that being the case, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would enlighten us about how that shortfall should be made up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the hon. Lady really thought that that demand was inelastic, she would not want to increase duties on other drinks such as alcopops, on the ground that that would also have no effect on consumption. I would be slightly cautious about giving too much weight to the proposition that the consumption of alcohol has nothing to do with price, because it clearly does. The decision of many of my constituents about whether to buy a bottle of whisky at Christmas is certainly very much affected by the price that they will pay. Bits of my constituency are probably worse off than certain bits of the hon. Lady's, so not all my constituents can afford to buy spirits at Christmas. There is, therefore, a sensitivity to price, which I have witnessed at first hand in the consumption patterns in my constituency.
<P>
The fact that a drink may be in decline does not alter the fact that it is price sensitive. The decline could have been a great deal steeper had the Government not listened to some of the arguments that the industry made to lighten the load. The fact of the decline does not prove the hon. Lady's point.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I rise to speak not as a Minister but as someone who has considerable whisky interests in her constituency.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman should be aware that the whisky industry has gone to considerable lengths recently to change its marketing profile; indeed, it now sells whisky-based products with mixers. It is even possible to buy a brew that mixes whisky and Irn-Bru, which is our other national drink. That does not particularly appeal to me, but it is extremely popular with young people.
<P>
Will the right hon. Gentleman also acknowledge that his point about price is not strictly true? Certain whisky products can be described as giffen goods--that is, goods for which demand increases in relation to price. In this case, that means products at the more expensive end of the malt market. The right hon. Gentleman should not be as sweeping as he has been about elasticity of demand.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that the Financial Secretary will not follow the Economic Secretary too far down that road. It is bad enough being here on a Friday morning, but listening to the description of a drink that mixes whisky and Irn-Bru is totally distasteful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The whole thing is made worse, Mr. McWilliam, by your strict injunction yesterday that we cannot sample these drinks in Committee. You are, however, certainly right about Irn-Bru. I go to Scotland frequently and I am fond of the place, but I meet this amazing drink called Irn-Bru in the shops. I am surprised that it is now being advertised south of the border. I agree with the hon. Lady that mixing Irn-Bru with whisky is a terrible thing to do to whisky.
<P>
Of course, I do not dispute the Economic Secretary's observation that certain high-value products have a snob appeal and, eccentrically, certain sorts of people buy them if they are more expensive. Not many of those people live in my constituency, however, and not many of those whiskies are sold there. I therefore maintain--and it is generally accepted--that most whisky sales are sensitive to price. If one adds to that the effect of price on overseas sales, which is extremely important to the industry and the country, the case for a further modest real reduction in the spirit duty that affects the industry is overwhelming. I am disappointed that the Government have not accepted the industry's entreaties and not carried forward the trend that was set by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The right hon. Member for Wells raises three major points. First, he asked why there was an increase. Secondly, he asked whether the increase would undermine the review. Thirdly, he made some specific points about exports and particularly those of spirits.
<P>
As a former Paymaster General, the right hon. Gentleman has substantial knowledge in this matter and knows the problems that the Department faces. He said in 1996:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are ... not witnessing a wholesale collapse in the home market for most categories of alcoholic drinks.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 30 January 1996; c. 23.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was right then and he is right now--we are not witnessing that.
<P>
In answer to the right hon. Gentleman's first question as to why there is an increase, I can tell him that there was an increase in inflation and it was necessary to defend the revenue coming into the Department. I have had many meetings over the years with representatives from the industry--not only from whisky companies, but from those producing beer, wine and cider--about their attitude to duty rates, smuggling, excise fraud and growth in criminal activity, which are undermining their trade in the United Kingdom and, as the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, in other markets.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman cannot berate us for taking that step to defend the revenue when in 1994 his Government did exactly the same. They increased duty rates on all alcohol, including spirits, in the mini-Budget that they had to introduce when they lost the vote on VAT on fuel, which they are now so keen to support. The lot of government is defending the revenue.
<P>
Returning to the discussions that I had with representatives of the industry while in opposition, while I understood but did not necessarily agree with their points, I always said to them--I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would agree--that tackling these difficult issues and the problem of duty rates requires a partnership between the companies and us as the revenue collectors.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I am interested in the discussion about the markets and how they develop products. Is my hon. Friend aware that the spirits market has produced a sachet-sized product that young people can take into football grounds and schools? The consequential effect on young people's health in turn puts pressure on the revenue.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I let the hon. Lady get away with that because she is a new Member, but, strictly speaking, we are dealing with the duty on alcoholic liquor.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was not aware of the existence of such products. In this short discussion I have been educated about the many ways in which what I consider to be a nice drink, by itself, can be ruined by the addition of other things. I will not dwell on that point, Mr. McWilliam, because I know that it distresses you to contemplate it.
<P>
I can tell the right hon. Member for Wells that I have written to the industry laying out the terms of reference of the review and inviting representatives to meet me and have discussions with customs officials. The terms of reference include the revenue on alcohol. That consideration has been extended to tobacco, but perhaps we should leave that for a discussion on another clause, Mr. McWilliam. The review will also cover smuggling, cross-border shopping and issues of health and law and order. We are seeking to achieve a partnership with the industry to deal with those issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I suspect that we may hear more about cross-border shopping this morning, but while we are discussing spirits, is the hon. Lady aware that in 1994 the average number of bottles of spirits in a car returning from a member country with lower excise duties was 2.14, and last year it was 6.725? It is estimated that that is costing UK retailers &#163;393 million. Yet does she not accept that that the fact that she is to increase duty still further will make the position worse, even before she has begun the review?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> There are a number of ways to tackle the issue of illegal cross-border shopping. Legal shopping, because of the indicative limits, is much more difficult. I have been to Dover, as has the right hon. Member for Wells, to see what goes on there.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jim Cunningham </B>(Coventry, South): Does my hon. Friend recall that when the right hon. Member for Wells was Paymaster General, a Committee of the House of Commons took evidence--the right hon. Gentleman attended--on the question of cross-border smuggling against a background of cuts in the number of Customs and Excise officers? Does she agree that it ill behoves the Opposition to point the finger at Labour Members? At least we are trying to do something; for a start, we are increasing the number of Customs and Excise officers, whereas the previous Government cut it.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> My hon. Friend is correct about the impact of the funadmental expenditure review on the number of officers now available to the Department.
<P>
To answer directly the points made by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), we want to identify the direct and indirect effects, including those on health, law and order, competition law, commercial fraud--which is a huge and growing area--smuggling and cross-border shopping. The Government can tackle those issues only in partnership with the industry.
<P>
The industry did not pass on to UK customers the cut in duties. Some distributors may have reduced prices--I understand that champagne in the Co-op is the cheapest to be found in any supermarket--but that is a commercial decision. Companies did not pass on the duty rate reduction because, they explained, they had experienced financial difficulties. The duty rate reduction, which they reabsorbed into their profits, was to make up for that. The industry well understands the need to defend the revenue and why the Government have put in place only an inflation-rate increase on spirits and other alcohols while the review continues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does my hon. Friend agree that the industry and consumption are sensitive not at the top end of the market--malts, for example--but at the bottom end, particularly with respect to children? My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) made a point about sachets of liquor being taken into schools. Young children are more sensitive to price than adults who are working. Therefore, the measure will benefit our attack on under-age drinking.
<P>
Do you agree with me that an explanation for the number of bottles coming into the country is to be found in the new rules on the single market? That is not to do with price elasticity. Do you also agree that, because there is no excise on exports, they will not be undermined? We are looking to boost exports, not encourage over-indulgence in whisky, either in this place or beyond.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can neither agree nor disagree. As Chairman of the Committee, as all hon. Members know, I have no view on the matter.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> My hon. Friend made a point about there being no excise duties on exports. The argument has been that that sends the wrong message because of what happens in the home market. If the price has not gone down despite a duty reduction, what message are the producers sending?
<P>
I am sure that you would not expect me to speak about alcopops, Mr. McWilliam, but as for the marketing of alcohol to under-age drinkers and their consumption of it--
<P>
<B>Mr Geraint Davies:</B> I was not referring to alcopops but apparently there is a new generation of liquers and spirits--specifically spirits--that are marketed in sachets, as opposed to alcopops, which tend to have a cider and beer content.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The industry is currently discussing alcopops with the ministerial group at the Home Office. However, our review picks up the health concerns that stem from the consumption of alcohol, and its growing consumption, by very young under-age drinkers. I think that figures show that about one quarter of 11 to 15-year-olds have been drunk in the past month, or something equally outrageous.
<P>
Some health considerations are included in the review. Other Government Departments need to be involved in the review, as well as the industry. I have written to the relevant Ministers explaining the scope of the review and asking them for their comments.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> From my hon. Friend's comments, this seems to be exactly the right time to conduct such a review. I have been campaigning about under-age drinking in the round. This is not an alcopops issue; it is about preventing very young people from drinking spirits. It does huge damage to their health and costs the nation a great deal in terms of their health, well-being, health care and the crimes that they commit while under the influence of drink. Therefore, this is not the right time for the Government to give drinking the green light by failing to raise extra revenue through taxation.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend's very good point. The Government are attempting to tackle the broad range of issues--including duty--on the consumption and use of alcohol. In addition to the obvious questions about revenue and the viability of the industry, there is the issue of law and order. Growing and substantial networks of criminal activity are trading in illegal cigarettes and drink. These networks are established and have a very wide influence on our communities, not just because it is a way of sidestepping and getting alcohol to under-age drinkers, but because of the intimidation and pressures that are brought to bear, and the money that becomes available for other criminal activity. I am sure that from our constituency experience we have all heard of the pressures that such illegal activity puts on publicans and those who run corner shops selling alcohol. The review covers those points as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): Has the hon. Lady considered that one reason behind the growing problem of alcohol smuggling and other illegal activity is that the duties are now so high, and that encourages criminal gangs?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the problem is far more complex than that, a fact that the industry recognises. But it is true that duty plays a part. We have to balance the concerns of government--health, law and order and income--and work out a sensible strategy. That is what we seek to achieve by the review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Clause 7(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This section shall come into force on 1st January 1998.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was interested in what the hon. Lady said about the review. A philosophical approach against freedom seems to be emerging from her comments and those of her hon. Friends; as always, Labour Members have a puritanical, anti-freedom attitude. In view of the fact that the increase in duty will come into effect on 1 January, when will the review be completed?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That is very unfair of the hon. Gentleman. We are not being puritanical; we are taking a sensible and balanced approach to a series of complex issues, of which duty is one.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned 1 January, which would be the normal point of change after a November Budget. There seemed no reason to move that date--it is when the industry would have expected any increase--and it was therefore left in place.
<P>
The review is to be completed by 31 December. I am happy to circulate its terms of reference to all members of the Committee. If they want to submit evidence, either individually or collectively, they are welcome to do so.
<P>
I have explained the Government's approach to the issue, and I have every confidence that the industry will take a positive and productive approach to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall not give way, because I have finished my speech.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rate of Duty on Beer</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before I speak to the clause, perhaps I might make a suggestion, Mr. McWilliam, which I hope you will treat in the spirit in which it is put. You have corrected hon. Members, including myself, on several occasions when we have used the word ``you''. Perhaps you would like to consider a draft amendment--you could even slip it to an Opposition Back Bencher--for consideration on Report, which would impose an excise duty on the use of the word ``you''. More practically, we could have a swear box and reinvest the proceeds at the end of the Committee into some slightly more substantial refreshment than we are indulging in this morning. I do not mean that too seriously, but I understand the difficulty that hon. Members, including myself, occasionally encounter with the rule.
<H4><center>[Mr. Ivor Caplain in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
We have rehearsed many of the arguments in relation to spirits and the Committee will not want tedious repetition in what are often very illuminating debates. I shall therefore confine myself now to issues connected with beer.
<P>
Again, I should declare a small interest, in that I am a member of the parliamentary beer club. I should also like to mention that the uncle of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells--it may have temporarily slipped his mind--when he served as Chancellor in 1959, cut the duty on beer to protect the British industry and went on to win the election. Indeed, the Financial Secretary referred to that with admiration--and perhaps some approbation--in last year's Finance Bill Committee.
<P>
I want to make three points, the first of which concerns the comparison in the record. The last two years of Conservative Budgets saw a freeze in most alcohol duties apart from those on spirits, which we discussed earlier. Beer and wine bear the bulk of duty in terms of overall revenue. The effect of that freeze was that beer fell to its lowest share of the total income from duty for the past 30 years. The proportion is now 30 per cent. of the price of a pint, which compares with about 38 per cent. in 1983.
<P>
I feel that it is unwise to put excise duties too high, both because of the economic effects and also because people should not be penalised, although I think it is reasonable to influence the market and to take some revenue from what are essentially products for indulgence. I am glad that we made that freeze. We would have sought to maintain it by means of an amendment, but we have chosen to argue for it today in this clause stand part debate.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to discuss the economic impacts of the clause. I am a student of the notes on clauses and the Red Book, and it seems to me that the overall effect on the retail prices index is a remarkably modest 0.06 per cent. The notes also make it clear that, when indexation is taken into account, that is by definition a zero increase. My only possible quibble is that the Budget and Red Book figures show an inflation rate of somewhat less than 3 per cent., while the actual excise increases proposed for beer and wine are 3 per cent.
<H4><center>[Mr McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
I am anxious, as are all hon. Members, about the effects of the Budget on the retail prices index, given that inflation is already beginning to rise in a worrying way. The last Budget presented by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe broadly speaking put up the retail prices index by 0.4 per cent. As the Office for National Statistics recently commented, this Budget will raise the retail prices index 0.8 per cent. The alcohol package is not a large component of that rise, but I hope that the Financial Secretary will take it into account, especially in regard to the consumption of the beers and tobacco at the lower end of the price spectrum, as opposed to spirits, which are at the top of the market, or petrol, which is not used directly by all consumers.
<P>
Interestingly, the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association suggests that the Treasury's model shows that a 20 per cent. cut in beer duty-- equivalent to 6p a pint--would reduce inflation and bring in extra revenue. I would appreciate the Financial Secretary's comments on that analysis.
<P>
I sense that the Committee is rightly concerned about some of the general social issues. First, I should like to deal with the misuse--or abuse--of alcohol, especially by young people. Despite the cynicism of some people, I would like to flag up the good work that is done by organisations such as the Portman group in dealing with alcohol abuse. I am pleased that the Financial Secretary's friends have worked with the Portman group to make new proposals to tighten up the ready dissemination of alcopops. There might also be a need to consider sachets under such proposals.
<P>
I think, however, that the Committee would be unwise to depart from the general principle that, unless there is a strong public purpose, we should not tax units of alcohol more highly just because there is anxiety about the means of their delivery. We should consider the advertising and marketing of such products and, if necessary, impose regulations with the consent of the industry, but we should not have different tax rates for products with the same alcoholic content.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> For clarification, is the hon. Gentleman advocating an alcohol-based tax applicable to all alcoholic drinks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> No. I must make that exception. As the Financial Secretary is well aware, the tax per unit on spirits, for example, is much higher than that on beer. Later, I shall ask a question abut the relationship between beer and cider. It is not that I disagree with the principle; I am saying that because we have a problem with sachets or alcopops we should not automatically change the basis for computing the duty on those products. I am glad the Committee is agreed on that. I do not want to mislead the Minister. Nevertheless, it is right that the Committee should continue to bear it in mind. As the Minister said, it is relevant to the present review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> The hon. Member makes a strong case for non-discrimination. Is he aware that surveys of young girls between the ages of 14 and 15 show that their preferred drinks are alcopops and that Manchester hospital has reported a quadrupling of alcohol-related diseases among the young? Growing evidence shows significant social problems occurring among particular sections of young people. Does not that make a strong case for looking again at the taxation of such drinks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am no ideologue on the matter. If there is a strong social case, we should consider it. I am merely inviting the Committee to pause before jumping to conclusions. I do not say this is a partisan spirit, as it is right that we should express anxiety and take appropriate action.
<P>
The first line of defence against these social ills--ills that I have seen--is the means of delivery. Opposition Members agree that one of the benefits of the excise system is that it is possible to influence behaviour through price.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's assurance that she will be open with the Committee over the review that she has announced. My hon Friends and I would like to see the terms of reference, and may wish to take up her offer and contribute. The offer is helpful, as letters from professional bodies reveal some anxiety about the Government's change of emphasis from their position when in opposition, when they called for an independent commission.
<P>
We are becoming aware of the Government's propensity to review. Indeed, some hon. Members--the ruder ones no doubt--call them the Palladium Government. I feared that the Palladium was going to play behind closed doors, but now that the Minister has said that they will take advice from the occasional outside actor I am a little reassured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Does the hon. Member accept that it is right and proper for a new Government to review matters of this nature?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am entirely happy that the Government review matters. I merely say to the Government that, as almost 50 formal reviews--however defined--are under way, they will have to stand up and be counted, and make decisions about the reviews. We need to be measured in our response, and take our time to get it right.
<P>
Cross-border shopping is worrying the Revenue; it is worrying for social reasons, to which I shall return; and it is clearly worrying the British alcoholic drinks industry. My last ministerial job was at MAFF. Interestingly, MAFF, rather than the Scottish Office, is the Government Department with responsibility for Scotch whisky and alcoholic drinks--although I had not such responsibility when I was there. We did have something to do with it--
<P>
<B>Mr. David Hanson </B>(Delyn): That explains the beef crisis.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Heckling is not in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We shall return to matters of consensus when we can, Mr. McWilliam. The now Financial Secretary expressed concern when considering the Finance Bill on 30 January last year. She was anxious about health issues--I know and respect her former involvement in such issues--but she over-emphasised taxation's benefit to health. She quoted an analysis that suggested that one in six of the bottles of beer sold in this country were imported, and she asked the then Treasury Minister if that statistic was accurate. That estimate was higher than the Customs and Excise estimate on beer, which is that 4 to 5 per cent. of the bottles of beer sold in Britain are imported, of which about 2.5 per cent. is bootleg beer.
<P>
It is natural for people who go to the Loire or Beaujolais on holiday to bring back bottles or cases of wine, but the beer market is much more directed and we all know how it works. Despite the bulk and comparative cheapness by volume of beer, people still bring it back from the continent. The drinks trade estimates that about 1&#183;1 million pints come into the country a day, or 8 million a week, which has a significant impact on the British brewing industry and on excise revenue, and is a worry in terms of crime.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, South, who was a member of the Standing Committee to which I referred and is a member of this Committee, although he cannot be present today, remarked that there was a major automotive company in his west midlands constituency that manufactured shock absorbers for the auto market. He gave assurances that this company was extremely pleased with the increase in cross-border trade because it had noticed a dramatic increase in sales of replacement shock absorbers, especially for Ford Transit vans.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I do not wish to undermine the advantage to the British automotive industry, but will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that a large amount of the beer being imported from the continent is foreign brewed? That constitutes a detrimental double-whammy on the British brewing industry, which is missing out on revenue and production.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If I were being chauvinistic, I would add that it is not doing the health of the British drinker any good either. However, I do like foreign beer myself, so I will not pursue the point on a nationalistic basis.
<P>
It is clear that there is a very large trade in foreign beer, and the Minister has said that it will be looked at as part of the general review being undertaken by the Treasury. It is hardly surprising that people are taking advantage of the disparity between the price of beer in Britain and the price of beer on the continent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the work of the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the subject? In a publication last October, the institute said that equalising excise duties between the UK and the continent would not remove the incentives for cross-border shopping.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not think that equalisation is up for consideration at the moment. Every time European authorities are approached on the subject of equalisation, they respond that duties are a matter for domestic policy. The disparity between beer prices in Britain and on the continent is very large. Before taking into account this increase, the duty on a pint of beer in France is 4p per pint, while in Britain it is 30p.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is unreasonable to suggest that all responsibility for the disparity in price rests with the excise and the duty that we are proposing to raise? Although, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, the duty on a pint of beer has been proportionally reduced, the retail price of that beer, as sold in a pub, has increased. Therefore, the brewers and the owners of the pub companies should bear some responsibility for the disparity in prices.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I find that an interesting line of argument. The hon. Lady is correct: a change in the excise is not automatically, pro rata, reflected in a change in the retail price. That is a commercial decision to be made by the undertaking concerned. There is a complex of interesting things going on in the pub industry, including its conversion from a broadly beverage-based industry to a managed leisure industry, with a change of image, pubs that have been smartened up, or renamed--which I find deplorable--and other changes.
<P>
In my view--I suspect it ought to be the view of new Labour now--commercial matters should be sorted out commercially, in the marketplace. It is possible to operate a pub--a freehouse or otherwise--on the basis of competition of quality or price, giving the best possible value for money to customers. Other customers may want a different package, and may be prepared to pay a higher unit price for the beer involved.
<P>
By definition, we are considering off-sales when we discuss cross-border shopping. Those sales constitute an increasing proportion of the market. British supermarkets are highly competitive, between themselves, on price: my local off-licence or supermarket always has a special offer of one kind or another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Cunningham:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman will agree with my argument that the group that is most threatened by cross-border sales, or smuggling, is the outdoor licensee. Many of those licensees are small business men. I do not know about the hon. Gentleman's experience, but I have had many letters about the problem.
<P>
Moreover, I am not clear what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the Government should do that the previous Government, of which he was a member, was not able to do, bearing in mind that I have had much correspondence with the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, who froze prices but was not prepared to take other action. I have letters on file on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes, there is a problem for the licensee; that I accept. However, the point that I was making to the hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) was that a significant proportion of the trade is off-sales anyway. For the British consumer there is a choice between on-sales and off-sales.
<P>
We welcome additional resources to deal with matters of illegality; my only concern is that any additional resources allocated to Customs and Excise for this purpose do not create difficulties within the Minister's overall departmental budgeting in resourcing other activities such as drug control and internal administration, as opposed to import administration.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). Cross-border trading involves the United Kingdom in a double-whammy--the revenue lost and the business forgone at the manufacturing end and at the retail end. Does my hon. Friend agree that, however many extra customs officers you employ to try to prevent cross-border trade, such action is merely palliative? If the European Union is to mean anything, we should have free and fair competition across the European Union. In the medium to long term, that will involve harmonising duty rates on alcohol and tobacco.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</b> rose--<p>
<p><b>The Chairman:</B> Order. Just in case the hon. Gentleman believes that I am going soft, I shall make it clear that I shall not be putting any customs officers in anywhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am interested in my hon. Friend's comments. The issue is whether the degree of harmonisation or approximation will take place through market forces or through some administered changes. I am not yet in a position to know exactly how it will work. The Financial Secretary may wish to come back to it.
<P>
My essential point is that there are two suppliers--domestic and overseas, some of whom import from Britain in order to re-export--and that there is competition at different rates of taxation. Any change in the domestic UK rate of excise makes it not only absolutely more expensive to buy British beer but relatively more expensive, thereby increasing the premium on those who have to calculate whether to go to Dover, either for personal use or as a bootleg operation--
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Stringer </B>(Manchester, Blackley): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the reduction in the number of Customs and Excise officials brought about by the previous Conservative Government exacerbated the problem of illegal entry of alcohol--especially beer--into this country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My view is that any growing disparity in the rates is far more likely to increase the trade than anything that we do about enforcement, however well intentioned or well focused, but that should not be viewed as a signal that we are not interested in enforcement. We must use the appropriate level of resources. I know that when my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells had responsibility for these matters, he kept them under review. It is a function of expanding trade that further extension is envisaged.
<P>
We have grave reservations about widening the disparity between British domestic and overseas tax treatment of beer. We understand that it will factor into the review which will go wider, and we welcome that. We are pleased that the hon. Lady is prepared to involve Committee Members and other interested persons with it. These are serious matters and the Government are taking a slightly wrong turn by proceeding now instead of waiting for the review and perhaps acting more radically in the light of it. We look forward to hearing the hon. Lady's comments and to a continuing debate on this important issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In pointing out problems with the clause, I want to refer briefly to an important philosophical point that arises from it. One of the most damaging aspects of the Bill--arising mainly from the rushed and over-hasty way in which it was drafted--is the extent to which it gives rise to far-reaching and damaging, unintended and unforeseen consequences. We have already seen devastating results--the windfall tax, its damaging consequences for investment and its effect on double tax agreements. The decision to abolish tax credits on dividends also impacts on investment decisions. Pension funds are another problem, and billions of pounds have been forced to move out of equities and authorised unit trusts into investment such as property. Yet one of the expressed aims of the Budget was to dampen down the housing market.
<P>
The clause will have damaging unintended consequences. It raises the duty on beer in line with inflation. To quote the Inland Revenue explanatory note,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``this increase will prevent further erosion of the revenue in real terms.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The previous Conservative Government's policy was to freeze the duty, so at real terms, its level actually fell. Over the past two years, that represents a cut of 5 per cent. in real terms. The reason for that policy was a simple one. The lower levels of duty on beer in France, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Daventry said, and according to a brief sent to all Committee members by the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, amounted to a duty differential of a factor of seven. It is not surprising that the incentive to smuggle into Britain from France and the continent is large.
<P>
Even more challenging is the incentive to import beer from France legitimately. According to Customs and Excise, the market share for bootlegged beer is 2.5 per cent. but, more importantly, duty-paid imports to this country take 4.5 per cent. of the market. There is a huge incentive for people in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, my south-coast constituency, to go by the channel tunnel or ferry to France to stock up with cheap beer. The volume one can legally bring back for personal consumption is huge, thanks to the freeing up that resulted from the single market. Many constituents of mine regularly take day trips, or pleasant mini-holidays, to bring back beer and wine for the months before their next trips.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East mentioned that the average number of bottles of wine brought into the country is 18. We have no figure for beer, but that is a colossal amount of alcohol.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Where has the hon. Gentleman been for the past 18 years? Has he only just noticed that problems are building up as a result of the previous Government's policies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that intervention because I can say that this is not a problem. The single market has existed for several years and it is good that people can buy products freely. However, because of the free market and duty problems, there is a huge incentive to bring goods into Britain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm where those duty problems arose? Who imposed the duty over the past 18 years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Duty on wine, spirits and beer is an historical fact and we have had it for many years. The single market is a relatively recent phenomenon, brought about by Conservative Governments, which has added to the wealth of consumers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is my hon. Friend's point that, whatever happened in the past, the problem is now evident and growing because of the juxtaposition of two perfectly understandable policies? The first is that the UK has had a high historic excise rate, the other that the welcome operation of the single market has exposed a much lower rate of excise on comparable products in continental countries. Is not the point as simple as that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Of course, even before the single market, people were allowed to bring in a quantity of alcohol. Indeed, even before the single market, there was alcohol smuggling from continental Europe because duties were lower. However, the development of the single market by previous Conservative Governments has made it possible to bring in much more. That problem was recognised and was being dealt with by the previous Conservative Government, and that is why duty on beer was frozen for two years, resulting in duty falling in real terms by 5 per cent. We were beginning to deal with the problem, but the Labour Government are not continuing that policy.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Labour might be responsible for so much more drink being necessary since 1 May to celebrate the new Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb</b> rose--<p>
<p><b>The Chairman:</B> May I caution the hon. Gentleman not to go down that route?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was merely going to say that in my constituency people are consuming more alcohol to drown their sorrows about the high taxes that they face under Labour.
<P>
The previous Conservative Government had got a grip on the problem by freezing duty on beer for two years, leading to a fall in real terms of 5 per cent. on the duty. It is a pity that the Government have not continued that sensible policy. Such policies must be developed over a period, and it may take five, 10 or 15 years to equate the duties while the differentials wither on the vine. Withering on the vine is a general taxation policy that has been adopted and is often supported by the Inland Revenue as a safe and fair way of dealing with disparity. It was used to reduce mortgage interest relief, which was frozen at &#163;30,000 for many years. It is a very good way of reducing distortions in the market, and that is what we were doing with beer. It is a pity that the Labour Government have not continued that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stringer:</B> Is it not the case that when we discussed mortgage interest relief at source on the Floor of the House Conservative Members objected and opposed it?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I agree that the reduction in MIRAS should be opposed. We are deviating from the clause, but perhaps you will indulge me for a moment, Mr. McWilliam, to allow me to say that there is a difference between allowing the &#163;30,000 provision to wither away with inflation and taking the dramatic decision of reducing the relief to 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Has my hon. Friend noticed that if the Committee proceeds with sufficient expedition before the fall of the knife, it may be possible to return to these matters on a later clause this morning?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend and I hope that we shall discuss clause 16.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): On the point of withering on the vine, did not the Conservative Government reduce the MIRAS rate twice: from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent.--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That arises in a later clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> When people in my constituency want to hold a party it seems that they find it worth while to make a trip to France to buy beer. Barry Sutton, chairman of the Wine and Spirit Association, said that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``duty rises next year would do nothing to stop cross-channel drink imports, adding to the burden being borne by Britain's drink industry.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All that, coupled with the growth of illegal importation into Britain, is having a devastating effect on the United Kingdom brewing and pub industries. More and more pubs are closing because they cannot compete with the influx. The Labour Government's decision to end the policy of freezing duty--in the medium term, that policy would have led to the duties coming into line--will speed up that process of closure. That in turn will have an effect on the level of corporation tax that the Exchequer receives from the brewing companies. It will fall as a result of a reduction in brewing sales. It will have an effect on the income tax and national insurance receipts from managers and employees of pubs who find themselves without a pub to manage or in which to work.
<P>
As with so much else in the Finance Bill, the Government are desperately extracting cash from wherever they can, regardless of the consequences. They are grabbing like a petulant child wanting immediate satisfaction and ignoring the effect on the underlying strength of the economy. They will damage their revenue-raising ability not only in the medium and long term, but even in the following year. That is the contention of the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association in its briefing to the Committee, and that is precisely what the Government have done with the windfall tax. They are grabbing now with no care for the damage that will be done to the utilities' investment plans, which will create jobs for people who pay tax and national insurance.

<P>

<B>The Chairman: </b>Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman is a new Member, but procedure in the Committee is different from that in the Chamber. I notice that he was reading, and although it is acceptable to use notes, it is not acceptable to read them.<p>
<p><b>Mr. Gibb:</B> If I may return to my notes for a quick read--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman must not persist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clause 8 is a great disappointment to the brewing industry. It will save a minimal amount of money. It can be seen from the Red Book that it will raise almost nothing, yet it will have a devastating effect on the brewing industry, corporation tax receipts and income tax receipts. It is a short-sighted measure to raise and extract the very last penny of taxation from wherever the Government can for their absurd spending plans. They are causing enormous damage to what has been a successful industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I should like to deal with the general issue of the review and move on to comment specifically on cross-border shopping. I hope that I surprise and please the Financial Secretary and her colleagues by agreeing that the review was welcomed by the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association. However, at the same time as welcoming the review--which it believes is necessary to address the problems that we discussed at some length this morning--it was surprised and disappointed to hear the Chancellor's announcement of a duty increase from 1st January 1998.
<P>
The association makes the valid point that the problem is not so much the rate of duty in this country but the differential between it and the duties of our immediate neighbours. I assume that a central feature of the review will be the effect of that differential on the industry and on shopping habits in this country.
<P>
I was delighted to hear the Financial Secretary's reassurance that the terms of reference of the review will be made completely open. The association is legitimately worried that the terms of reference will be too narrow and will not embrace all the problems raised by my hon. Friends. I would welcome a further assurance on that in the hon. Lady's response.
<P>
Cross-border shopping is extremely important to my constituency, where both sides of the debate are relevant. Ashford is close to the channel ports and only 10 miles from the shuttle terminal. It also has a terminal on the channel tunnel link which is more user-friendly than the terminal at Waterloo and which is the most convenient way for my constituents to get to France. A disproportionate amount of cross-border shopping inevitably takes place. Anecdotally it is said that almost no one in east Kent who has to cater for a large party--a wedding or a birthday, for example--shops in this country. It is routine for people at all income levels to buy a large amount of drink--mostly beer--from across the channel because of the savings involved.
<P>
Such action is legitimate; it is not smuggling but straightforward shopping--one of the great benefits of the single market for the consumer. We applaud that. But essential to our debate on the clause is the realisation that while half the country and a large number of my constituents enjoy that benefit, local brewers are extremely disadvantaged.
<P>
I should declare a minor interest. I thought it appropriate to wear the Shepherd Neame tie. The company produces one of the finest beers in the country--made in Kent, brewed in Faversham and drunk all over the county. Shepherd Neame is run by patriotic men of Kent who are concerned that their beer should continue to be drunk by men and women of Kent and further afield.
<P>
[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to be heard. Will the Committee please listen in silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The brewery is worried, but it is also an entrepreneurial company--
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> How much beer does the hon. Gentleman's favourite brewery export to Calais, to be purchased there and brought back here? Why does the brewery do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was half way through my sentence and so, if the Financial Secretary could be patient for a second, I shall explain: the brewery does that to help it stay in business and make money. Its job is to ensure that it continues to provide wealth and jobs. It knows that the people of Kent are attracted to Calais to buy beer, and that is why it sells its beer in supermarkets where those people go to buy their drinks. That is an entirely sensible and business-like response.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Is that a consequence of the single market or is that illegal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is not illegal. It is partly a consequence of the single market but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry explained earlier, there are two other factors: the increasing ease of travel between south-east England and France and, central to our debate--perhaps the hon. Lady would care to listen to the answer to her question--the difference in duties between our country and France. I find it odd that the issue is regarded as controversial by those on the Government Benches. It is blindingly obvious that, if duties are much higher in this country than in France and it is easy to travel there, people will travel there to buy those products. That has a particular effect on brewers that operate, like Shepherd Neame, in Kent and elsewhere in the south-east of England.
<P>
We are considering whether it is appropriate for the Government to increase the duty from 1 January while their all-embracing review is still on-going. It is a peculiar date to choose. The hon. Lady said that the reason it was chosen is that 1 January was the standard date for such increases when there was a November Budget. Fine--but we do not have a November Budget. We had one in July and will have another next March. To select 1 January as the date seems to me the worst possible choice, not least because the effect of that cross-border trade will be particularly marked in the run-up to Christmas when, inevitably, drink is bought in large quantities. With the knowledge of a post-Christmas increase in duties, there will be every encouragement for people to do all their Christmas drink shopping--particularly their beer shopping--over the border. That would cause further unnecessary damage to the interests of British brewers such as Shepherd Neame.
<P>
It would be sensible if the Government's review were to continue for as long as it takes to find answers to some difficults questions. We have discussed industrial and social issues associated with alcohol sales. I agree that the review will have to tackle difficult questions and decide the balance of disadvantages and advantages in setting duties. Increasing duties half way through that review, however, seems to me an arbitary and unnecessary measure. I suggest that the Government continue at least until the next Budget the freeze that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe kept in his last Budget. By then the review will have been completed, it will have been debated by interests inside and outside the House, and we can reach a sensible decision based on all the evidence about the future direction of duty on beer. The Government should not take a half-cocked decision to increase duties half way through the review simply because that always happened when we had a November Budget. I urge the Financial Secretary to consider.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I agree absolutely with the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) when he said that we need to make a sensible decision based on all the evidence. Unfortunately, the previous Government did not do that. I am greatly encouraged to hear the concerns of Conservative Members of the Committee, now that they are on the Opposition Benches, about the problems faced by the industry. A two-year freeze on duty did not assist. The problems are more complex that that, as the hon. Gentleman now acknowledges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb</b> rose--<p>
<p><b>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
I absolutely disagree with what the hon. Gentleman says about the likely impact of the inflation rise on duty rates announced by the Government. It is entirely reasonable for the Government to act to defend the Revenue, as they have done. The Government have done a great deal more in 10 weeks to start addressing the issues that the Committee has discussed this morning than the Conservative Government did in 18 years. With regard to anything else that Opposition Members have to say on the matter, it would be wasting the Committee's time to repeat what I have already said about the review.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) wanted to intervene, so I shall give way to him before I conclude my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If the hon. Lady believes that freezing duty for two years was insufficient to deal with the problem, why does she believe that raising rates will help?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have made it clear that the reason is to defend the revenue. That is exactly what the previous Government did in 1994 when they lost the argument on the Floor of the House about VAT on fuel, having declared themselves against an increase in duty rates on the ground that it would damage trade. Then, only a few weeks later, they put 26p on a bottle of spirits and increased duty on wine, beer and cider. So it ill behoves Opposition Members to attack the Government for taking the same course of action that they took when in government. The difference is that we are conducting a review as quickly as is feasible to address the issues and develop a sensible, balanced approach to a complex problem, of which duty is part.
<P>

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I should like to comment on wine generally and on the English wine industry in particular. During our debates on previous clauses, we heard much about the specialist concerns of the whisky industry, the Irn Bru industry and others. I am perturbed that, yet again, the English wine industry is not mentioned in the Bill and will again be prejudiced.
<P>
I declare an interest as a contributor to the authoritative work on the English wine industry by Hugh Barty-King, someone who has lectured on English wine and who has been involved in archeological excavations to prove the origins of English wine in Roman times. Indeed, some recent evidence has come to light to suggest that English wine was available in the Iron age, which would make that industry even older.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Hon. Members:</B> Iron Brew!
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would not want the Committee to be misled; Irn Bru is not an English product.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I had picked up that point, Mr. McWilliam. Neither has it anything to do with pre-Roman times.
<P>
My point is that the English wine industry is an old, important industry in England and Wales. It does not go as far as Scotland for obvious reasons, although the Committee may be interested to know that the most northerly English vineyard stretches as far as Derbyshire.
<P>
The English wine industry will suffer an enormous differential in tax treatment compared with its European counterparts. Yet again, the English wine industry will suffer the same duty increases of 3 per cent., which will take the duty on a bottle of English wine to well over &#163;1. Wine producers in France, Italy and Spain pay the equivalent of just a few pence in duty on their home-grown products to their Exchequers. That puts the English wine industry at an enormous disadvantage.
<P>
This important industry has expanded greatly in recent years. Its revival was pioneered in the 1950s by Guy Salisbury-Jones at the Hambledon vineyard in Hampshire. It is no longer an industry that is the prerogative of retired colonels with a garage at the bottom of their garden in which they brew their stuff; it is now a professional industry. Many English wines have won awards in blind tastings that included their continental counterparts. Many thousands of acres are now under cultivation in this country, and there are large vineyards--some of them cover several hundred acres--in, for example, the Thames valley. The industry is not by any means an amateur activity.
<P>
The English wine industry already suffers prejudice under the terms of the 1964 treaty of Rome. That treaty did not recognise the United Kingdom as a wine-producing area, and limitations on wine production in the United Kingdom are exceedingly stringent. There is no equivalent of Qualitatswein or appellation d'origine controlee--any measures that apply to English wine are imposed voluntarily by the English Vineyards Association. Given the quality of wine that this country produces, that is a great shame.
<P>
The implications of that arrangement are that, under the treaty of Rome, wine production in the United Kingdom is limited to about 3.2 million bottles a year. Back in the 1960s, that was a fairly insignificant limit because not much wine was produced--other than by amateur but keen retired colonels at the bottom of their garden. However, over the past few years the English wine industry has produced in excess of that figure. The treaty of Rome states that anything over that limit has to be turned into industrial alcohol. That fate might be worthy of the lethal combination of Irn Bru and whisky but it is not one to which we should subject a quality product like English wine. I venture to recommend Committee members to sample a good Muller Thurgau variety of grape, which goes into much English wine, a Reichensteiner, or my own favourite, a seyval blanc. They should also taste Breaky Bottom, which the catering facilities of the Palace of Westminster occasionally provide. It is produced near my constituency in Sussex, and it is marketed with the slogan: ``Probably the best bottom in the world''. It is indeed a masterpiece of English viticultural productivity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Is that wine equally good when it is mixed with Irn Bru?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall return to that matter in my concluding remarks. My hon. Friend may be interested to hear that the Lamberhurst vineyards, which were set up by the McAlpine family some years ago, are close to his constituency. It is one of the biggest vineyards in this country, and it pioneered the production of English champenoise with enormous success.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am very happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman. I am not aware of any vineyards in his constituency, but he may be a sampler of wines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am a sampler of Welsh-made wines, and a friend of mine has a small vineyard.
<P>
I want to emphasise the point that the hon. Gentleman has already made--that there is a quota on production. He discussed the size of the industry, but there is already over-capacity. Most of the wine that is consumed in Britain is imported, and the associated excise obviously falls on foreign-produced wine. The balance of the argument must be that we should proceed with a marginal tax on imports because there is a clear constraint, which we may want to remove in future, on domestic production.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> English wine is treated no more favourably than imported wines. It is usually cheaper to produce wine abroad, because we do not have the advantages of a hotter climate.
<P>
I regret that I was not in a position to table an amendment specific to English wine. I ask the Government to consider seriously the special case of the English wine industry. It is an increasingly large employer. As well as producing wine, it is valuable to the tourist industry. Many vineyards offer tours, tastings and so on. Therefore, the wine industry employs many people, especially in south and south-west England.
<P>
We have debated the effect of alcohol on impressionable youth, and we have discussed booze cruises. English wine is not freely available on the continent, therefore it does not fall foul of our strictures on the latter. English wine does not lend itself to forming a lethal cocktail with Irn Bru. It is not available in sachets that are easy to coneal and smuggle into schools or football matches. It does not have the same attraction as alcopops to impressionable teenages. It is not associated with lager louts, who cause many of the law and order problems about which we have heard so much recently. It is not necessarily greatly enjoyed by the bons viveurs who frequent Islington wine bars and the sippers of creme de menthe frappe from that part of town.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's train of thought. I do not share his knowledge of and expertise in English wines. There are certain products that I decided to leave off for my middle age. Does the hon. Gentleman consider Buckfast to be an attractive English wine? It causes great difficulties in my constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am not familiar with that product, but I would be happy to deal with the point on another occasion.
<P>
There is a good case for special treatment of the English wine industry, but the Bill does not cover it. Such special treatment would not contribute to the trouble caused through alcohol consumption by disruptive and impressionable people. The English wine industry has been restricted by the factors that I mentioned. It is a prime case for a little special treatment, which would be in the best interests of a growing industry, and of those with more discerning wine palates who choose to support a home-grown industry. I hope that the Government will consider that in future.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We have had a fascinating discussion on English wines, which represent only a tiny proportion of alcohol consumption in this country. Notwithstanding the obvious quality of English wine, I am surprised that we needed such a discussion, given the number of clauses we have to debate this morning. I shall not repeat what I have said about previous clauses because I do not wish to detain the Committee from subjects that the hon. Gentleman will want to discuss before 1 pm. In the light of the hon. Gentleman's representations on behalf of English wine, I am sure that many members of the Committee will rush off to sample it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of Hydrocarbon Oil Duties etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 7, line 10, leave out `&#163;0.4510' and insert `&#163;0.4467'.
<P>
I have a suggestion, Mr. McWilliam. For the convenience of the Committee, I can discuss amendments Nos. 25 and 31 separately--or together, if that is your wish.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. The matters are unrelated. They must be taken separately.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Then we shall debate the rate, and the timing.
<P>
Amendment No. 25 seeks to return the duty increase on certain hydrocarbon oils to 5 per cent., the rate announced and written into the Red Book by the previous Government. It was deliberately done that way for road fuel duties. The previous Government felt it important to send a clear message, to motorists as well as to motor manufacturers, that there would be a significant and steady increase in the rate of fuel duty. That was to enable manufacturers, who have a long planning timescale, to adjust their anticipated mile-per-gallon aims and the design of their engines to meet certain fuel targets. It was a business-friendly move designed to look ahead and to get people to anticipate; it also sent a clear environmental message. But that plan will be upset if, in one year, a Government come along and break the trend, increasing fuel duties by an extra 1 per cent. without explanation. It was done, obviously, for revenue requirements. However, it would have been wiser of the Government to have made it clear at the time either that they intended to continue fuel duty increases of this magnitude--or greater--or that they would continue the trend set by the previous Government. Their action has caused considerable confusion.
<P>
When we debated the Bill's timetable motion, the Government made great play of the necessity of giving taxpayers certainty. It was felt that taking the Bill more slowly, or postponing it, would cause confusion and send contradictory signals to those who would pay some of these taxes. But they have done exactly that by breaking the convention on fuel duties. They have failed to send a clear message to people who work in the automative industries and have caused muddle in environmental quarters. People question whether it is a signal that, in future, all duties will continue to be increased by this magnitude, or whether it will be only for duties on transport. They wonder about the future effect on domestic heating oils and the Government's plans for red diesel and other rebated fuels used by farmers and others. We would like a clearer signal of the Government's future intentions from the Financial Secretary. Perhaps she will also tell us why she went for an extra 1 per cent., and quantify its effect on revenues, especially as the increase has been brought forward by five months?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I shall be brief. The previous Government's commitment was to a 5 per cent. increase in duty. Now we appear to have an additional 1 per cent., and on top of that it is to be imposed five months early. In their Budget, the Government have effectively increased duties by around 8.5 per cent. annually. That impinges very heavily on my poorer rural constituents because, unlike their urban counterparts, if they are to survive they have no choice but to use a motor car. In many places they have no rurual bus services or railway stations.
<P>
As I said in the Budget debate, the measure impinges particularly on poorer people, because relatively more affluent people will continue to use their motor cars. An increase in petrol duties will have no effect in reducing the amount of motor traffic. Indeed, it is a blunt fiscal instrument that will not achieve that objective on its own.
<P>
The Government should be considering the rate of increase in the use of motor cars, but other measures need to be taken. In particular, they should consider measures to deal with emissions from poorly serviced vehicles.
<P>
As I have said, the provision impinges on rural areas and other measures could be taken. For example, there is an excellent community bus scheme in my constituency. It is run on a community-wide basis, and it is staffed and driven by members of the community. In future Budgets, the Treasury should consider giving specific duty rebates to such schemes in order to encourage more of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does not the Budget even add to the costs incurred by such community bus schemes? The duty will add to the cost of running the bus in the same way that it will add to the cost of the national health service by increasing the price of fuel supplied to fleets of ambulances. Indeed, the duty will add to the cost of public transport in general. More duties will be paid by those running buses, ambulances and the community bus scheme in my hon. Friend's constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Of course, my hon. Friend is correct. Increasing duties across the board will have a perverse effect on some worthwhile community schemes. I have other points to make, but I shall do that on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): I restrained myself from speaking on the other clauses because I thought that that would provide an opportunity for Labour Members to speak.
<P>
I look forward to speaking to the amendment for a number of reasons. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), I represent a rural constituency. Many people in Witney, like many others throughout the country, depend on the motor car. The amendment has been tabled because of the savage way in which the Government have pursued motorists with callous disregard of the reasons why they use cars.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): I, too, represent a rural constituency. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the reasons why people in rural constituencies rely so much on cars is the deregulation of bus services? That has meant that people cannot use buses to go even to the centre of town. For example, one can not get from Buxton, which is outside my constituency, to Hanley and back in one day if one is in the tax office in the centre of Hanley for more than 15 minutes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Lady's short speech. I do not propose to deal with it in its entirety, except to say that perhaps those on the Government Front Bench will tell us whether it was a declaration of the Government's intention to renationalise transport services.
<P>
As I said, I represent a rural constituency and I am extremely concerned for those who live in the countryside. I have taken the pleasure of rereading ``new Labour because Britain''--apparently--``deserves better'', which I keep by my bedside. I can find no mention whatever in that document of Labour's intention to introduce such a ruthless increase in these duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stringer:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the difference between regulation and ownership? The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Ms Atkins) concerned regulation, not ownership, but the hon. Gentleman answered with respect to ownership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Blackley for that intervention. Yes, I am aware of the difference, thank you very much.
<P>
There are 82 small villages in my constituency, spread out over 250 square miles. The people who live in them truly rely on the motor car. They live a life in which the car is not a luxury but a necessity. They need it to get to work. The single mother needs it to take her child to school. The farm employee needs a car. Small businesses need cars. Cars are needed by well-off people and by poor people. Yet the tax will hit all those people--the many, not the few, to invoke the Labour party's rhetoric. It is a cruel tax.
<P>
Why is the tax to be introduced? This is the second hike in the relevant duties since ours of seven months ago. It puts great pressure on rural people. Probably about 7 million such people are affected.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): I wonder where the hon. Gentleman was for the past few years, while his party was in government, and while it was, to use his phrase, hiking up the duty on fuel. Did the hon. Gentleman ever consider the impact of that fact on his rural community and similar communities? Perhaps we could have some intellectual honesty on the subject. Will the hon. Gentleman answer that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am always delighted to engage in intellectual debate with the hon. Lady. The Conservative Government's measures were taken in an annual Budget. In the present instance the Labour party, having come into Government, could not wait to present an emergency Budget.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> If the hon. Lady will wait--I can respond to only one intervention at a time, although she may not wish to hear the reply to her hon. Friend's intervention.
<P>
In the great document which the Prime Minister alleges includes every promised Labour tax increase there is no reference to the imposition, after a seven month interval, of the tax increases that we are discussing. The measure is an example of a broken promise--of the misleading of the people of this country.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> On the subject of broken promises and levels of increase in fuel duties, I remind the hon. Gentleman that, in his March Budget in 1993, Norman Lamont announced a 10 per cent. increase in road fuel duties. In his November Budget, only eight months later, he announced a further increase of between 8 and 10 per cent. in road fuel duties. Just one year later, in 1994, he announced a further increase of between 6&#183;5 and 10 per cent. in road fuel duties. None of those increases was signalled in the 1992 manifesto. Would the hon. Gentleman care to reflect on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is always a pleasure to be given the opportunity to reflect on such matters. Perhaps you will rule otherwise, Mr. McWilliam, but given the opportunity I shall be delighted.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wants to talk about fuel duties he may do so. That is what the Committee is discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I bet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Indeed, I am grateful for one simple reason. The Labour party made much, during the general election campaign, of the alleged 22 Conservative tax rises. It dealt at length with its claims that none of the tax rises had been included in the Conservative manifesto. Labour party members bored the country rigid with repetition of Mandelson speak directives taken from their pagers or from their morning instructions on the fax machine. We have learnt to hold them to account as well. When the next election comes, although we will recognise fully that we introduced, reluctantly, 22 tax rises during five years, we will remind the Labour party that, within 10 weeks of coming to office, in one afternoon there have been 17 tax rises and 17 broken promises. Those will not go away. We are debating the clause because this tax rise is a good example of the Labour party's hypocrisy.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I have two brief points. First, the hon. Gentleman's calculation concerning tax rises is incorrect. He should go back to Central Office and ask it to recalculate that figure, because many of the provisions were in our 1997 manifesto. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman has not answered the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford about the 1992 manifesto. It will not have escaped my hon. Friend's notice that the hon. Gentleman was director of communications for the Tory party at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding members of the Committee of my previous employment. If he would like to ask me further questions, I shall be more than happy to give him a guided Cook's tour of the jobs that I have taken in my life. None the less, this is not a matter on which to delay the Commitee and I want to return to the amendment.
<P>
I know that Labour Members are not happy with proper scrutiny of the Bill, but we are. Our concern is to address the questions of why the increase is in the Bill and of why we wish to reduce it.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman:</B> May I take the hon. Gentleman back to the original question from my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford about hiking the fuel levy over a period of years, because he did not answer it fully? I refer the hon. Gentleman to a comment by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I firmly believe that motorists should bear the full costs of driving--not only wear and tear and congestion on the roads, but the wider environmental costs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I presume that that comment had the backing of at least some members of the Conservative party, if not all. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will reflect that the Government have increased the excise duty by the amount that they have this year for the same reason--that we have a wider environmental responsibility.

<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> When we raised duties, we did so after full consultation with a wide group of environmental bodies. The immediate response on 2 July to this Budget by environmental bodies was, and I quote from Friends of the Earth:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are very disappointed and there is little in this Budget that will combat the greatest environmental threat facing the Earth. There is''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and this will be interesting for Labour Members--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a real gap between Tony Blair's words at the Earth Summit and what his Chancellor has said today''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, the director of Friends of the Earth said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This Budget will do little to combat climate change.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the difference between what we did and what this Government have done.
<P>
What the Government have done has nothing to do with helping the environment. That pseudo-scientific justification is nonsense. It is yet another smash-and-grab raid, this time on the 27 million motorists, especially those who live in rural areas. The tax will not fall fairly, because petrol pump prices will probably continue to go even higher in the countryside, whereas in the towns they will remain suppressed because of competition. Therefore, people in the countryside will be hit doubly by this tax, which will also work its way through into consumer prices: 15 per cent. of consumer prices in supermarkets reflect transport costs. The reality is that consumers up and down this country will pay extra for their shopping. It will hit them hard. The implications are enormous.
<P>
The National Farmers Union has registered many worries about the impact of this tax on vehicle running and haulage. It is very concerned about average farmers' costs which will probably go up by &#163;90 a year on fuel alone--
<P>
