<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 242, in page 13, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) to require that the implementation of any such decision as is referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection is deferred until a decision has been made whether or not to exercise the power conferred by subsection(3).'.—[Mr. Waterson.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 287, in page 13, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Unless the matter is certified by the authority's monitoring officer to be urgent, no decision by an executive, a member of an executive or a committee of an executive, under its executive arrangements, shall be implemented within less than five working days after the decision is published.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 27, in page 14, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where a member of a relevant overview and scrutiny committee finds that a decision by or on behalf of the executive ought to be subject to immediate review he may, with the agreement of two members of the relevant overview and scrutiny committee, cause the decision to be delayed until that overview and scrutiny committee has considered the matter'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): Without wanting to pursue the analogy too far, I was suggesting that if the scrutiny committees are to be introduced, some lessons should be learned from the scrutiny system here at Westminster. I refer especially to the pre-legislative scrutiny system. If the Government want to force local authorities down a road that is very similar to the parliamentary system, it is common sense—especially as there will be no pilot schemes—to try to learn from the good and bad parts of the system in this place.
<P>
The amendments would not apply to all decisions or even to most decisions—especially in relation to pre-scrutiny processes—except in the most appallingly badly run authorities. In any event, time and resources would limit the ability of scrutiny bodies to exercise their power in all but the most sparing manner. The amendment seems to us a useful extra weapon to put in the scrutineers' armoury. Scrutiny of the sort proposed in the Bill is new. If the Government are intent on pursuing it, the more strength we can give to the arm of the scrutineers, the better. That is not to say that we retreat in any way from the position that I set out this morning, when I expressed the belief that scrutiny occurs perfectly regularly and happily in many authorities under the existing system. It would be a gross slander of a lot of hard-working councils and councillors to suggest otherwise. No Committee member should labour under any illusion that the new, modernised, holistic, beats-as-it-sweeps-as-it-cleans system that we are being asked to agree to will necessarily provide all the answers.
<P>
Unbeknown to me, a councillor from North Wiltshire was present to hear our deliberations this morning; he buttonholed me at the break. Councillor Dick Tonge, a Conservative councillor on North Wiltshire district council, has a very different story. Apparently, the Liberal Democrats, who currently have the casting vote—[Interruption.] The Minister is intervening from a sedentary position again; I am sure that, if she has something helpful to say, she will rise to her feet, but it sounds as though she does not. The Liberal Democrats, in North Wiltshire—surprise surprise—have a project involving some spanking new office accommodation. Not unreasonably, the project was put into the hands of a scrutiny working group, of which Councillor Tonge, as an opposition member, was made the chairman. So far, so good.
<P>
However, a lot of important questions were asked. People asked why the development was necessary, given modern and changing working practices. I imagine that all sorts of questions were asked about the details of the project and its cost. Those concerns were detailed in a report signed off by Councillor Tonge to the scrutiny committee on North Wiltshire district council; the report was highly critical of the project. Again, the Committee may think ``So far, so good''; however, the Liberal Democrat majority on the scrutiny committee were whipped to vote to defer the report, which, it is fair to say, is contrary to the spirit of the legislation. It was decided to defer consideration of the report until after the decision had been made. The Lib-Lab majority on the council has now decided to go ahead with the project without a review of the report. There is to be belated discussion of the report, but only now that the decision has been taken.
<P>
Experience tells me that I am likely to be slapped down, but I hope that the Minister might, just this once, share my concern about that example of how scrutiny is not working—at least in North Wiltshire. It would be intriguing to hear what the lone Liberal Democrat present in Committee, the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders), has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): Not being a member of that district council, I am at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, I was reassured by the Minister's earlier remarks that the problems with the executive and scrutiny committees currently being experimented with are all related to the fact that the legislative framework is not in place. If we have heard the whole story, I would put the problems down to the system, not to the political colour of the council. Similar things have happened on many Conservative-controlled councils, especially where the press and the public have been excluded from decision making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> There we have it. I often say to friends that I will be a Liberal Democrat in my next life because, to them, a situation is always somebody else's fault. No matter how devious, self-serving, incompetent, inept or undemocratic the Liberal Democrats on a local authority—I am being restrained in what I say—they always blame the situation on the Government. It does not really matter who the Government are, because it will never be them.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): Another interpretation is that the hon. Member for Torbay is asking for more regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> No, I am not.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is, in effect, asking that because he is arguing that the legislation is not competent and that we need more secondary legislation. Local government is suffering from powers. One of the London chief executives has complained about the large volume of complicated double-reading double volumes of secondary legislation and regulation being laid upon councils. I suspect from the Minister's past performance that we will get another layer of measures, such as those that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) will discuss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, because it gives me a chance to raise the second consultative drafts of the proposed guidance. It sounds to me as though there ought to be a new volume simply to cover Liberal Democrat councillors out there in the real world.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Why bring them into the real world?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> True, that might be a contradiction in terms.
<P>
I have made my main points and given an especially graphic illustration of the way in which scrutiny can be perverted by being run by the wrong people. It seems not to matter a jot whether the legislation is in place. Unfortunately, as the Government are so set against having proper pilots for their whizzo new ideas, the best we can do is study operations in places where people are having a go, no matter how incompetently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Amendment No. 287 is similar to the Conservative amendments. It would give a short period to enable members of overview and scrutiny bodies to call in decisions under the powers set out in clause 20.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> As Opposition Members have made clear, all the amendments are designed to delay the implementation of decisions taken by the executive. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne noted, that is so that overview and scrutiny committees can consider whether to require reconsideration. The hon. Gentleman said that, notwithstanding his amendments, he was starting from the premise that adequate scrutiny could take place under existing arrangements. Our view is that scrutiny takes place now, but only within political groups, not in public; it is not recorded and only councillors can participate. The reason for changing the structure is, in part, to bring the scrutiny function out into the public domain. Scrutiny will be undertaken in public, and the meetings will be recorded, which will enable people with an interest have their say.
<P>
As for the need to provide mechanisms to enable overview and scrutiny committees to consider decisions, there is no difference between the Government and the Opposition. It is important that members of overview and scrutiny committees should be able to discuss actions undertaken by the executive, and clause 20 gives them the power to call in executive decisions. The difference between us is that the Government do not want to be prescriptive. It should be for local councils to formulate the mechanisms, perhaps with the detail proposed in the amendments, and to incorporate them into the arrangements under which committees will be able to call in decisions.
<P>
We do not anticipate problems. However, despite their much-professed faith that councillors will be able to operate the current system effectively and openly, the Opposition apparently do not trust them to put in place arrangements that would secure effective scrutiny, ensure appropriate time scales, and so on.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Let me state that my faith does not extend to members of the Liberal Democrat party. To illustrate to the Committee how the system would work, I allude to the North Wiltshire debacle. Assuming that clause 20 is enacted unamended, would such series of actions be within or outwith the Bill's provisions?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Every council will have set out its arrangements on how decisions should be recorded and made public. We are generally making clear that there should be a delay between a decision being taken and its being implemented, to allow the overview and scrutiny committee time to call in the decision. We do not want to impose unnecessary constraints. It is for councils to work out the best way of operating.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne spoke about North Wiltshire; I presume that he was referring to the allegation that the Liberal Democrat party had whipped scrutiny committee numbers. We have made it clear that we do not think that whipping is consistent with the spirit of the Bill; that is why the Labour party has removed the whip from the scrutiny process. I would not support a party that continued to apply the whip. I invite the hon. Gentleman to intervene to let us know whether the Conservative party will remove the whip to enable their members to take part in effective and meaningful scrutiny. He is not rising to the challenge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I always think that one should give up when the crowd is shouting for more. There are two issues, if I can separate them out. As to the first, I agree with the Minister. I do not think that the whipping of scrutiny committee members is consistent with the Bill. I have given the article from Councillor Chalke to the Official Report, so I cannot say whether they have whipping in Wiltshire, but I suspect that they do not. When officials have the opportunity to go down to Wiltshire, it will be interesting to discover whether they do and to see how that Conservative lead experiment works.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I note that the hon. Gentleman still did not clarify the position that the Conservative party is going to take. I understand that the Conservative party has specifically rejected any commitment to the type of transparency and accountability pledged by the national executive committee of the Labour party, although I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, nor to the type of rules by which local Labour councillors will be bound.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Let me have a stab at explaining. The Minister appears to be under the misapprehension that we operate a centralised system covering all Conservative councillors in the country, which is not the case. It is the case with Labour party members, who are controlled out of Millbank tower.
<P>
Let me ask the Minister about the example that came up the other day, of Brighton and Hove. If whipping is not happening, why was it that, when councillors of her own party voted against the system of the new cabinet structure, two members of the executive were sacked because they did not obey the whip? Has the whip been withdrawn, or is it still operating contrary to new instructions from Millbank tower?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I will not let the Conservative Members get off so easily. The hon. Gentleman is confusing two issues. We are debating scrutiny and whether or not, when they are executing a scrutiny function on scrutiny committees, members of political parties should be whipped. In the vote to which he referred, it is my understanding that no Labour councillor voted against the resolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> For.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Whatever. In any case, that was a matter of policy, not scrutiny. The hon. Gentleman should get his facts right. We are discussing scrutiny, yet he stood up and gave an example that had nothing whatsoever to do with scrutiny. It would be helpful if the Opposition would indicate that Conservative councillors will not apply the whip in any vote on scrutiny committees, according to the spirit of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Minister cannot get away with switching the spotlight from her Government's and her party's policies. Despite her boasting about the views of the national executive of the Labour party—whose writ does not really run much further north than Islington—what does the hon. Lady have to say about the quote I read out this morning from the Labour Campaign for Open Local Government, which talked about the vexed and disturbing issue of secret whipping going on behind closed doors, presumably within Labour groups? Despite the diktat issued by her colleagues nationally, is she confident that that is no longer going on?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We dealt with that allegation. The local government officer of the Labour party responded to the letter from the Labour Campaign for Open Local Government and asked the person who made the allegation to provide evidence to support it. The request was repeated on a number of occasions, but no evidence of secret whipping has been provided for the part to investigate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It is secret.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The Campaign for Open Local Government is making its claims for their own purposes, but it has no evidence to support the allegation.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Lady should enter the real world. If I were a resident of Hammersmith and Fulham, I would ask her about Petrovic. It wipes out her statement completely.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> That is not the case. Despite the fact that the amendments are relatively straightforward and deal with an important issue, it seems that Opposition Members have nothing better to do this afternoon than be mischievous and make hay while the sun shines.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 287, we cannot agree that pressing decisions should be delayed while the monitoring officer's confirmation that the matter is urgent is sought. To require a monitoring officer individually to decide whether a matter was urgent would be wrong; it would place the officer in the position of accounting for what is and should be an executive decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Whipping or no whipping, there is an inherent deficiency in the system. Only a few members of a large single-party group will be able to sit on the executive, which other councillors might aspire to join. Are not those other councillors unlikely to question the leading members of their group too hard during scrutiny, in case they ruin their chances of preferment? One does not need a whip to get councillors to act in that way. Washing dirty linen in public and undermining the image of the executive is automatically suppressed within any political grouping. The issue is far more important than the question of whipping.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> It is interesting to find that underlying the desperate search by both Opposition parties to find problems in the structure is a deep distrust of local councillors and an apparent inability to see the potential for local councillors to act with integrity through scrutiny. In my experience, having led a Labour group and a council, one wants to be in the executive with thinking, able people. There is enormous potential for people, through scrutiny, to act with integrity and to apply their abilities constructively. We do not want scrutiny to be a political football. Rather, we want people, through scrutiny, to exercise judgment, to be analytic and to demonstrate the skills that they would need to use to take effective decisions were they to enter the executive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Let me ask the question differently. Does the Under-Secretary believe that, had there been a scrutiny committee on Westminster city council, the cemeteries would not have been sold?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The point is hypothetical. I can say to the hon. Gentleman, albeit hypothetically, that there would have been a much better chance of the issues surrounding Westminster city council and the way in which it was operating being brought to the surface earlier had a scrutiny function been well established and working well. The hon. Gentleman has made an important point.
<P>
Some hon. Members have expressed concerns about the ability of non-executive members to feed into the decision making process and to make their views known before decisions are taken and implemented. That concern is reasonable. We have always made it clear that overview and scrutiny committees should be able to make recommendations about what the executive plans to do in future, as well as about the decisions that it has made. Recognising and sharing hon. Members' concern, and wanting to ensure that the issue is taken seriously and is well understood by councils, we changed in the second edition of the draft guidance the provisions requiring mandatory standing orders to be developed. That will enable scrutiny committees to know what decisions are forthcoming and to scrutinise issues before decisions are made.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I was going to make precisely that point. It is obviously essential for there to be a process of notification of the imminence of decisions. That might prove to be an inconvenience for the executive, if matters emerge that do not lend themselves to that process. What provision will be made to distinguish between matters requiring an immediate response and those that are suitable for notification?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Chapter 10 of the draft guidance clearly sets out the situation. If the right hon. Gentleman wants me to, I will go into detail, although it will probably be a major issue in the debate on clause 21. Instead, I will outline the provision.
<P>
The mandatory standing order will require the executive to produce well in advance—we suggest three or four months ahead—a rolling list of the key issues on which it will be making decisions. We have defined key issues and key decisions in the guidance. There will also be a requirement to update the rolling list of issues every one or two weeks. The overview and scrutiny committee will thereby have a clear view of the rolling programme of issues on which the executive is working and on which key decisions have to be made. The committee will be allowed a considerable period in which to call in decisions. I remind the Committee that we are providing for any member of the overview and scrutiny committee to put any item on the agenda of meetings at any time. The provisions will enable the committee to have every opportunity to scrutinise at considerable length forthcoming decisions, as well as decisions that have already been taken.
<P>
Clearly, on rare occasions, there will be a need to take urgent decisions that have not been on the list of up-coming key issues and for which the normal three days' notice cannot be given. In those cases, the executive will need to obtain agreement that the decision is urgent from the chair of the relevant overview and scrutiny committee or, in the absence of that person, the agreement of the chair of the council or his deputy. We have involved the chair of the scrutiny committee in the assessment of whether a matter for which prior notification has not been given constitutes an urgent decision. We have made provision for those eventualities. I am sure that the matter will be discussed in more detail when we come to clause 21.
<P>
Speaking seriously, the issues raised in Opposition amendments—[Interruption.] The jokes come from the Opposition Benches. If Opposition Members want to keep the subject one of jest, I am sure that Government Members can accommodate them. I was trying to tell Opposition Members that they had raised serious issues in their amendments, but that those issues ought to be left for local determination by local councils. The guidance will require councils to take decisions, but we did not want to prescribe in the Bill a precise mechanism that every council has to follow to ensure that effective overview and scrutiny is undertaken. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Eastbourne to withdraw amendment No. 242.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It is difficult not to rise to the Under-Secretary's bait, because the issues are indeed serious, and I am glad that she recognises that some of them were raised seriously. I am still not wholly convinced that anything that she has said will affect the position in North Wiltshire—[Interruption.] I am not surprised, however. Most people have a threshold; we are here only because we must be. I have heard nothing to make me feel that the people of North Wiltshire can sleep more soundly in their beds as a result of the legislation or of what the Minister says. However, as the sun has come out and the rain has stopped, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 13, line 45, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A sub-committee of an overview and scrutiny committee may not discharge any functions other than those conferred on it under subsection (5)(b).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 145 and 146.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> These again are minor technical and drafting amendments. However, when we said that this morning, there was a substantial debate. I was getting worried, when it was raining, that Opposition Members would think that they had no incentive to finish early. I suspect that those who were friends of the previous Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), might have their eyes on the cricket rather than on anything else this afternoon. Now that the sun has come out, they may well be able to go there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Disraeli said that the English, not being a spiritual people—therefore, obviously, not all Methodists—had invented cricket to give them a concept of eternity. I entirely agree with Disraeli.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not going down that route.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. I might have to be honest about my views on cricket.
<P>
Amendment No. 144 is a technical amendment to ensure that any sub-committees that are set up can carry out only functions delegated to them by the overview and scrutiny committees.
<P>
Amendment No. 145 relates to the way in which the membership of overview and scrutiny committees is determined and ensures that, as with others of the authority's committees, the authority will determine their size. For any sub-committee, the relevant overview and scrutiny committee will make the decisions. I called it a technical amendment, but it will also help the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), who was worried that the executive would set up such committees.
<P>
Amendment No. 146 is a minor drafting amendment that provides that any sub-„committee or overview and scrutiny committees will have the same right as the main committees to request that executive members and officers appear before them. They will also have the same powers to invite other people to attend their meetings. That reinforces the Governments's view, as expressed in the Bill, that the overview and scrutiny committees should have those powers, as should any sub committees that they seek to set up.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We have now reached the last group of amendments to clause 20. I shall begin with amendments Nos. 20 and 244, which come at the same problem from slightly different angles.
<P>
We have in the past expressed concern about the position of officers in the executive-scrutiny split. As I have said in previous debates, I am particularly concerned about smaller authorities, where it will be more difficult to ensure that officers are not servicing both executive and scrutiny functions. I know that there have been discussions, and I suspect that discussions are continuing, on the second draft guidance. Therefore, I shall take this part in a little less detail than I might otherwise have done, as I am waiting to hear what the officers' representatives say about the ongoing discussions. I think that one Minister said today, or perhaps on Tuesday, that further discussions were taking place.
<P>
It seems axiomatic that, if there is to be this Berlin wall between executive and scrutiny functions, we must ensure sufficient officer back-up to assist an overview of scrutiny committees in discharging their functions. Because of the potential conflict of interest, we must also ensure some division between the different officers. Despite the massive weight of legislation, it would be easy for an authority—North Wiltshire comes to mind, but there may be better examples—to subvert the process by having insufficient officer back-up to assist members of the overview and scrutiny committees. In authorities where people are stuck on scrutiny committees because they are new to the council, are being punished for some reason, or can be relied on not to ask too many probing questions, it is all the more important that they should have sufficient back-up.
<P>
Amendment No. 84 is a probing amendment, although the Minister will probably tell me that it is a matter for guidance and standing orders. It deals with the ability of a senior officer to issue a summons for a meeting, and matters that can be included in the agenda.
<P>
Amendment No. 243 deals with members of a scrutiny or overview committee acting independently of party political interest. We have discussed whipping on scrutiny committees at—some might say inordinate—length, and the amendment tries to bring those issues out into the open. It would not be productive to go over that ground again, save to repeat one crucial point. In the world inhabited by new Labour—I gather that we are not supposed to use that phrase any more—it is said that waiting lists are going down, crime is reducing and police numbers are increasing, but in the real world, the opposite is happening. Whatever the Bill or the national executive of the Labour party may say, people are still whipping members of scrutiny committees on Labour-run councils, and the Under-Secretary has yet to reassure my colleagues and me to the contrary.
<P>
I know that the Under-Secretary is a relatively new Minister, but it is the height of naivety to say, ``We asked the Labour campaign for open local government for evidence of that secret practice, but we have received none''. Only the most inept whips leave footprints, fingerprints or traces of blood. By its nature, whipping can be a subtle process—

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we are not going to debate whipping again. We are discussing scrutiny, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to keep to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I was trying to, Mr. O'Brien. I was making the point that amendment No. 243 addresses the issue of committee members declaring in advance of a meeting whether they have been subject to political pressure.
<P>
New clause 5 is concerned with issuing a summons and putting items on the agenda. I think that it was Clement Attlee who said, ``He who controls the agenda controls the meeting'', and that principle should be firmly enshrined in the Bill.
<P>
New clause 6, which reprises the whipping issue, would ensure that, prior to the meeting of an overview or scrutiny committee, the head of paid service would be informed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>whether or not any matter . . . has been the subject of prior discussion at any meeting of the relevant group.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Government mean what they say about political pressure on members of such committees, it is sensible and logical that such a provision be included in the Bill. That is the purpose of new clause 6, and I commend the new clauses and the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Amendment No. 20 would allocate officers to assist the overview and scrutiny committees. They would work exclusively to assist the committees and not be able to report to the executive. However, they would still be under the direction of their paid managers, who would be servicing the executive.
<P>
For the same reasons that I mentioned in the context of not needing whipping, pressures might be put on people not to rock the boat. A junior officer from the same department as those serving the executive might feel pressurised while investigating a matter that could show his or her boss in a poor light, or that could damage his or her credibility in the eyes of their paid service manager.
<P>
There is some merit in considering support for a scrutiny committee. However, it would be dangerous if that support came from within the same administration that services the executive, even if the officers themselves were not allowed to service the executive. If there is to be support, it should come from an independent body. However, if that stage were reached, one might see that as an excuse for employing more people in local government to service the committees set up by the Bill.
<P>
On those grounds I would oppose the measure, because it is unnecessary. We would be going down a dangerous road if we considered the servicing needs of scrutiny committee members. We need those members to feel that they can act independently, without any comeback. Any advice given to them should be free and independent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We should not detain ourselves too long over what constitutes whipping and what does not. There are formal and informal ways of doing it, but it would be naïve to suppose that by renouncing whipping, one would put an end to the little chats in the tea room, or over a pint down the road. This is a slightly fatuous discussion in that regard, because this is a question of culture.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne for tabling the amendments, because they tease out how the Government perceive the relationship between the officials and the committees [Interruption.] I hate to interrupt the Minister's conversation; although she is not God, she is at least His emissary on Earth. However, as a mere disciple, I would quite like her attention.
<P>
My preference would be that the officials who serve the executive also serve the scrutiny committee even-handedly and as an equal part of their job. It is a question of culture that documents that go to the executive go to the scrutiny committee simultaneously. The danger is that the officials could be put into a difficult position because the system is geared to servicing and facilitating decisions. If, therefore, the scrutiny committee became subject to a secondary action, or if a selection of material were made available, the committee would need to find an alternative means of working on an equal footing with the executive.
<P>
How will the Minister interpret the guidance to ensure that officials realise that they have a difficult task to perform in dealing even-handedly with two bodies? They cannot give primacy to the executive, because the scrutiny committee will soon find itself in a subordinate position at the tail end of the procedure. If there is a risk of that, there is a case—as the hon. Member for Torbay said—for reinforcing the scrutiny committee. However, I doubt whether that would be effective. Drawing again on the analogy of Select Committees, our own staff are present on those Committees, but are not privy to the information that the Executive has. Moving in that direction would introduce a kind of apartheid between the two bodies. The Government believe that a certain degree of apartheid between scrutiny and the executive is necessary, but how, in practice, will the secretariat simultaneously service two bodies that are constitutionally designed to be in opposition to each other, as a scrutiny and an executive committee have to be?
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> One of the great joys of being Under-Secretary of State for Wales is that I am able to serve on several concurrent Standing Committees. These proceedings are far more amusing than those of the Committee next door, which is considering the Learning and Skills Bill. I hope that my colleagues on that Committee will not take that as a slight. I have listened with interest to today's debates, which have been lively and interesting—at least so far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Under-Secretary has not been here for as long as we have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> No doubt the best is yet to come. The Committee sitting next door is due to finish its deliberations next week, so I shall be here more often after that time.
<P>
As hon. Members have said, the amendments are designed to tease out the Government's position on a range of issues. Amendment No. 2 tabled by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, would require local authorities to institute a formal separation of officer support between the executive and overview and scrutiny. It is important to recognise that overview and scrutiny committees should be properly resourced and effectively supported, because that is essential for a rigorous overview and scrutiny process. However, that will take place in a wide variety of circumstances, so local authorities will have to decide for themselves how to divide officer support between the different roles.
<P>
During the Bill's preparation period, I spent a great deal of time visiting local authorities in Wales, where there are many small authorities. To have to separate support between overview, scrutiny and executive in the way that the amendment proposes would be a heavy burden for many small authorities. I do want to be prescriptive. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne recognises that local councils should be able to choose how they offer support to the overview and scrutiny committees.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am delighted that the Under-Secretary is not being prescriptive. However, could he be suggestive—in the nicest possible way—and explain how local authorities in Wales and elsewhere are approaching the problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I would not wish to be suggestive in any way, shape or form—especially not to the hon. Member for Mole Valley.
<P>
In circumstances where officers support both the executive and the overview and scrutiny procedures, there will be the potential for conflict. Overview and scrutiny committees will question executive decisions and consider officers' advice. It is appropriate for councils to draw up their own procedures for resolving conflicts of interest. More importantly, members of overview and scrutiny committees will have to develop the skills that make for good scrutiny, which many Members of Parliament also have to develop. I repeat we do not want to be prescriptive, and we will bear in mind the pressures that small authorities may face.
<P>
I looked at amendment No. 84 with some interest and a little incredulity. The hon. Member for Eastbourne will tell me if I am mistaken, but it would apparently allow the monitoring officer and chief finance officer to issue summonses to meetings of an overview or scrutiny committee, and to put on the agenda any item that falls within the responsibility of such a committee. That surprises me, because I thought that that was the job of councillors, who are politicians. The amendment would extend considerably the role of officers and risk putting them in awkward situations with council colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It has been admitted that these are teasing or probing amendments, but in a council dominated by one party—for example, the Labour party—the executive and scrutiny functions might become entirely stitched up, and a senior responsible officer become so disturbed by something not being scrutinised that he wants to put it on an agenda and insist that it is discussed. That would be unusual, but not unreasonable, so why should it not be allowed for?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I presume that he envisages purely Labour authorities. Any member of any committee can place an item on an agenda. Unless the Conservatives lose even more local authority seats than they have lost in the past 18 years and we have purely Labour authorities throughout the country, I cannot envisage the problem arising. If members of a council are worried about something, they can place an item on the agenda for a scrutiny committee. It is not for officers to do that.
<P>
Overview and scrutiny committees have an important function and the members who serve on them will develop their skills to hold the executive to account. It is important that those committees have adequate support. They may discuss fruitful lines of inquiry with officers, but, ultimately, it is for councillors and the committees to decide what they want to do. It is not for officers to decide what the committees should be doing. Officers are not members of the overview and scrutiny committees, and they cannot question members of the executive or put them under pressure as councillors can do at a scrutiny committee meeting.
<P>
The amendment would allow an officer to put an item on the agenda of the scrutiny committee when no committee members wanted to ask the executive member about it. The hon. Member for Eastbourne does not seem happy with that, but it is important to remember that councillors, not officers, are the scrutineers. The purpose of officers is to serve the authority corporately, including the scrutiny committee; it is not to undertake the role that we fulfil here. There are no senior officials of the Government or senior advisers to the Opposition defending positions here. Hon. Members on both sides fulfil that function, and I support that principle.
<P>
The amendment would undermine the role of the overview and scrutiny committees. It seems to imply that councillors are not up to the job and that officers should tell councillors what to do. That would undermine the principle of local democracy. All members, executive and non-executive, can look to officers for advice. The council remains a corporate body and the monitoring and chief finance officers will give advice on a range of issues. The hon. Gentleman should reflect on those matters. It is for members to decide what is discussed by their committee and it is evident that they are capable of doing so.
<P>
New clause 5 does not recognise that. It would require the head of paid service to issue a summons for a meeting of the overview or scrutiny committee within 14 days of receiving a request from a member of that committee. I respect the points made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, but the Bill allows for any member of the committee to place a relevant item on the agenda. If we allow any member to require a meeting of the committee by referring to the head of paid service, the sort of disgruntled councillor that we all know could persist in requesting that type of meeting. We could have a situation in which the members of a council—officers, scrutiny members and executive members—were not using their time efficiently. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will not proceed with the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Under-Secretary, with his usual charm, dismisses disgruntled council members with a sweep of his hand. We are talking about two different groups of people. There are the councillors who are always disgruntled about something; I am sure that we have all served with them at some point. Such councillors are just generally disgruntled—or certainly not ``gruntled'' at any rate.
<P>
Baroness Thatcher used to say about Europe that the mere fact of her being in a minority did not mean that she was wrong. What happens if a councillor is unhappy about the way in which his council is being conducted and wants certain matters raised? That is the sort of issue that we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Such a councillor has the right to put a matter on the agenda, but, under new clause 5, the head of paid service would be required to issue a summons for a meeting within 14 days of receiving the request, and the new clause sets no limit on the number of times that that can be done. A council, its scrutiny committee, its officers and its executive could all grind to a halt, because of a councillor who was not ``gruntled''—or seriously disgruntled. The councillor is entitled to have his say, within reasonable bounds, but new clause 5 would give him the capacity to disrupt the work of the authority as a whole. The hon. Gentleman could reflect on that.
<P>
Amendment No. 243 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>each member of an overview and scrutiny committee of a local authority shall act independently of any political party interest<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that any member who has attended or has knowledge
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of any prior meeting of members of the authority . . . at which any matter on the agenda shall have been discussed shall declare such attendance or knowledge to the meeting.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Similarly, new clause 6 would require leaders of political groups to inform the head of paid service in writing of whether any matter on the agenda of an overview and scrutiny committee has previously been discussed by the relevant political group.
<P>
I was genuinely surprised that amendment No. 243 was tabled. It is clearly unworkable. How does the hon. Member for Eastbourne think that anyone could determine whether someone is acting in a particular way because they think that it is right, or because they think that it is in the interests of their political party? Sometimes, people will say something on an issue because they agree with their party. In my area, many councillors have been elected because they were Labour candidates, not because they were Mr. X or Mrs. Y. They act in the party interest all the time, and the party interest coincides with their own political beliefs. The amendment would discount that party interest, which is not workable in any way, shape or form.
<P>
In the new clause, what is meant by ``discussion''? Hon. Members mentioned discussions in tea bars or in corridors prior to meetings. Under the new clause, such discussions would have to be declared. Once upon a time, my wife and I both served on a council, and every Tuesday morning, we opened our council mail for the meeting that Thursday. The terms of the new clause would oblige people in that situation to say, ``I am sorry. We discussed this over our cornflakes on Tuesday.'' That is what the amendment would mean—it is unworkable. If my next-door neighbour is a councillor and he has a chat over the garden fence with my wife, who is also a councillor, about leisure services or the bins or planning applications, will they have to say at the next meeting, ``I am sorry. While mowing the lawn on Tuesday, I spoke to my neighbour about our position on X or Y in Tuesday's meeting''? That is what the new clause would require. I am sure that that is not the hon. Gentleman's intention, but he should consider that possibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I wonder how the hon. Gentleman was fortunate enough to acquire a wife who has such a low expectation of his conversational skills.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I shall allow my wife to answer the hon. Gentleman in due course—perhaps when she, too, has been elected a Member of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman's explanation with some astonishment. Our probing amendment has certainly worked: he has explained how patronage works.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I do not think that the relationship between two elected council members—be it next-door neighbours, friends, colleagues, husband and wife, or sister and brother—should preclude them from having a prior discussion on an issue. Under the new clause, they would have to declare such a discussion, however innocuous. The hon. Member for Eastbourne wants the Government to accept the new clause, but he must recognise its real effect, and I hope that he will withdraw it.
<P>
Whipping, which has been discussed in detail, is a matter for political parties nationally and locally. The Labour party has said that, in respect of Labour groups, there will be no whipping. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions gave the hon. Member for Eastbourne the opportunity to elucidate the Conservative party's views on whipping, and I am giving him a further opportunity, but he declines. I shall be interested to see how other political parties deal with the issue.
<P>
Amendment No. 244 would require the head of paid service to ensure that overview and scrutiny committees have adequate personnel and resources to enable councils to discharge their functions independently of the executive. Section 4 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 requires every authority to designate an officer as head of paid service and provide him with such staff, accommodation and resources as are, in his opinion—I emphasise the words ``in his opinion''—sufficient to allow the performance of his duties under the section. In the light of that requirement—and as it is his duty to prepare and submit a report to the authority setting out his proposals on how he will discharge those functions—the amendment is unnecessary because the power already exists. Overview and scrutiny is a function of the authority, and is thus encompassed in the requirement in the 1989 Act for the head of paid service to provide adequate levels of staff.
<P>
I have listened to what members of the Committee have said. In the light of the fair explanation that I have tried to give, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that his amendments are in some part unnecessary and would run counter to the spirit of an effective scrutiny committee. I ask him to withdraw the amendment, and not to press the other amendments that stand in his name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his explanation and defence of the clause, but I am afraid that, on this occasion, he has not been persuasive. Almost the only matter on which he has persuaded me is that it is not a good idea to be in his home at Tuesday breakfast time. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that even I am no longer at home on Tuesday mornings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I cannot imagine who told me about Tuesday morning breakfasts in the Under-Secretary's home, but I shall move rapidly on.
<P>
The Under-Secretary says that he does not want to be prescriptive, but he must be having an off day, because this is the only clause in which the Government are not being prescriptive to a ludicrous extent. Several members of the Committee have referred to the amendments as teasing amendments, and they have certainly succeeded in teasing out from Ministers exactly what they have in mind. They are presenting themselves as Snow White simply because they have issued an edict ending whipping, but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) said, whipping takes many different forms. In arguing that new clause 6 is unworkable, the Under-Secretary demonstrates the practical problems associated with saying, ``We are not going to have whipping in the Labour party''.
<P>
In respect of ending whipping on scrutiny committees in some authorities, the amendments have successfully teased out from the Under-Secretary how realistic the Government consider their own expectations, let alone anyone else's. I fear that we shall continue to see local authorities dominated by one party that uses scrutiny as an adjunct to the executive, and that party is the Government's.
<P>
As ever, the Under-Secretary has been charming, but he has not been persuasive. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 20, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
