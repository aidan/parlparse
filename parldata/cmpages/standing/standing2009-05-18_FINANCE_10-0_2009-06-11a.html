the schedule be the Twenty-seventh schedule to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061154000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061154000223"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I welcome you back to the
chair for this afternoon&#146;s sitting, Mr. Hood.
</div><a name="09061154000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was talking about the Poles referred to by my hon. Friend the Member
for Hammersmith and Fulham in the debate last year on the residence and
domicile rules. I was pointing out to the Minister that there was
apparently a degree of confusion about what the limit would be in what
is introduced by paragraph 3 of the schedule. The explanatory notes
state:</div><a name="09061154000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Paragraph
3 amends section 809D(1)...which provides that an individual
unremitted foreign income and gains of less than &#163;2,000 in a tax
year does not need to file a self-assessment tax
return&#148;</div><a name="09061154000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
3 (3)(1A) of the schedule states that</div>
<a name="09061154000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the individual
is not domiciled in the United Kingdom in that year and conditions A to
F in section 828B are
met.&#148;</div><a name="09061154000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
clause 52, condition B in proposed new section 828B refers to the
matter of &#163;10,000. There is a mismatch somewhere between the
explanatory notes and the Bill as to what the cut-off level would be,
so I should be grateful for some clarification. I shall have a little
more to say about the &#163;10,000 when we come to the next
clause.</div>
<a name="09061154000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue that is resolved, in part, in the schedule, is that of the
trailing spouse. That was debated last year. The Government helpfully
made a positive move by introducing a de minimis limit of UK source
income of &#163;100&#151;the hon. Member for Taunton has tabled an
amendment to clause 52 about that. My only concern about the issue is
that the limit may be insufficiently generous, because it would give
rise to taxable income of &#163;20. Do we want a trailing spouse to
go through that process simply for &#163;20-worth of tax? Is there
not a higher, more pragmatic, limit? When we debated the issue last
year the Minister&#146;s predecessor, the right hon. Member for
Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) was very much against increasing
limits. Is the Treasury much more interested in increasing limits this
year? The change from &#163;2,000 to &#163;10,000 is one increase.
Perhaps the Government should think more carefully about imposing too
high a burden in respect of a relatively small amount.</div>
<a name="09061154000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue that had a great deal of debate last year, both in the run-up to
the Committee stage of the Finance Bill and the Bill itself, was
remittances of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div>personal property. This year the exemption has been extended so that it
applies regardless of the source of income used to purchase a property.
That is a welcome move by the Government, which takes account of some
of the criticism made last year about the unworkability&#151;if that
is a word in the dictionary&#151;of the reforms and has taken things
further. However, one of the comments that has been made is that the
exemption could have gone a little bit further than the Government have
conceded so far.</div>
<a name="09061154000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The exemption
does not apply when the assets cease to be personal property. That is
entirely reasonable when the personal property has been sold, and I can
understand that. There is concern that the exemption should be extended
to include circumstances when the property has been lost or stolen.
That would be a welcome relaxation of the
rules.</div><a name="09061154000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are grateful that the Government have made some progress in responding
to the concerns we raised last year, but I wonder if the Minister could
clarify the three issues that I have raised: the interaction between
the &#163;2,000 and the &#163;10,000 limits; whether there could be
a more generous amount for the so-called trailing spouse provision; and
whether the exemption for personal property could be extended to
include property that is either lost or
stolen.</div><a name="09061154000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061154000224"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I shall echo a couple of the points
made by my hon. Friend. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the
comments made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants on this matter.
Although it has welcomed much of what is being proposed, it points out
that the consultative committee established for last year&#146;s
Finance Bill needs to continue, to ensure that the changes come
through. I would like to know what commitment the Minister will give
about that.</div>
<a name="09061154000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
whether this is appropriate for clause 51 or for clause 52, but there
is a point that needs clarification&#151;it probably relates to both
clauses: the interaction of this legislation with settlements
legislation. It would be nice to know whether that issue has been
addressed and whether there should be some
clarification.</div><a name="09061154000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000225"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I too welcome you back, Mr. Hood, after
our lunch break.</div>
<a name="09061154000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad
that the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) was able to
welcome the changes in the schedule. Perhaps it was a slightly grudging
welcome. Nevertheless, it was a welcome and I am glad about
that.</div>
<a name="09061154000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our aim in
introducing major changes to the remittance basis last year was to
maintain our international competitiveness and to increase the fairness
of the tax system. Of course, the UK needs to continue to be attractive
to people overseas who have the skills we need for our own economy, but
it is also absolutely right that those who have chosen to live and work
in the UK should make a fair contribution through the tax system to
support public services. That is the balance that the new arrangements
were designed to
deliver.</div><a name="09061154000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Government are certainly prepared to listen to legitimate concerns
that taxpayers from abroad and their advisers have raised with us, so
my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>who was dealing with the Finance Bill a year ago, gave a commitment that
officials from the Treasury and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs would meet interested parties to review the rules, to ensure
that they operated as intended and imposed no unnecessary
administrative obligations on potential
users.</div><a name="09061154000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the autumn, officials from the Treasury and HMRC have talked with a
wide range of representatives of external bodies, as the hon. Member
for Henley has mentioned&#151;I have met a number of them as well.
They have identified issues that they felt should be addressed so that
the new regime can be implemented as smoothly and effectively as
possible. We have also taken the opportunity to make one or two other
small
adjustments.</div><a name="09061154000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first change introduced by the schedule relates to gift aid tax relief
as it applies to individuals who use the remittance basis. It was
always the intention that the annual charge introduced by the
remittance rules should be treated as a payment of tax for the purposes
of gift aid and available to frank payments to charities. Due to a
drafting error, the legislation does not deliver that result, so the
amendments made by paragraphs 2 and 5 of the schedule ensure that the
rules for gift aid operate as intended.</div>
<a name="09061154000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
majority of cases, if somebody wishes to be taxed under the remittance
basis they are required to make a formal claim to do so through the
self-assessment system. An exception is when someone&#146;s
unremitted foreign income and gains are less than &#163;2,000 in any
tax year, when it is assumed that they will have chosen the remittance
basis without any claim being made&#151; the hon. Member for
Fareham asked a question about the &#163;2,000 and I will come to
that in a moment. A case has been made that the legislation is not
sufficiently clear on that point, so paragraph 3 of the schedule seeks
to put beyond doubt the fact that a claim will not be required in those
circumstances. Its effect will be that people in that position will be
taxed on the remittance basis, but they will preserve their right to
file a tax return and to be taxed under the arising basis if they wish
to do
so.</div><a name="09061154000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figure of &#163;2,000 is a general de minimis limit for those who use
the remittance basis. The new &#163;10,000 limit, which is introduced
in the next clause, is a new tax exemption that applies to individuals
from overseas, such as migrant workers who have a job in the UK and
also have overseas employment income in the same year. The exemption
would simply remove the obligation on people in that position to file a
self-assessment return. It is a more generous arrangement for that
group of people, and it applies whether or not the individual chooses
to use the remittance basis; it does not affect whether they are
eligible to pay tax on the remittance
basis.</div><a name="09061154000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000226"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Minister clarify that point? I am a little
puzzled by how the provision will work? If there is a &#163;10,000
exemption for employment income but a &#163;2,000 exemption for other
income, how will the circumstances in which each one works be made
clear to people who may be covered by the remittance
basis?</div><a name="09061154000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000227"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> As I said, the &#163;2,000 is a general, de
minimis limit for anyone. The &#163;10,000 figure, which will be
introduced in the next clause, applies specifically to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>migrant workers, who frequently will have had some employment in the
same year in another country, and will have gained an income. They will
have a choice about which arrangement to apply to their
circumstances.</div><a name="09061154000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
4 of the schedule removes the obligation to file a self-assessment
return when an individual has total UK income or gains of no more than
&#163;100, which has been taxed in the UK, provided they make no
remittances to the UK in that tax year. At one point, I thought that
the hon. Member for Fareham was referring to trading spouses, but the
appropriate term is &#147;trailing spouses&#148;. HMRC was told
that trailing spouses typically have a bank account in the UK that
earns only a small amount of income, and &#163;100 covers such cases.
The measure has been widely welcomed as a positive
move.</div><a name="09061154000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
9 relates to the rules applying to assets brought into the UK. As the
rules stand, someone who has chosen to use the remittance basis will be
subject to UK tax if they use their foreign income and gains to
purchase property and assets that they bring into the UK. There are
some exceptions to that general rule&#151;for example, when the
assets in question are imported temporarily, or are worth less than
&#163;1,000.</div><a name="09061154000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
broad terms, those exemptions are not available when the items are
purchased using overseas employment income, so the exemptions may be
difficult to operate in practice and might give rise to inadvertent
non-compliance. Following representations, the Government decided that
the rules on exempt assets should be extended with effect from the
start of the 2008-09 tax
year.</div><a name="09061154000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked why the exemptions were not being
extended to assets that are lost or destroyed. I suggest that
introducing such an exemption could open up significant opportunities
for abuse. We must remain vigilant, and although we have been able to
take on board a number of the suggestions made to us, that one could
give rise to
difficulties.</div><a name="09061154000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
12 and 13 clarify the interaction between the new remittance regime and
the tax rules that apply to overseas trusts. The remittance regime
includes transitional provisions that prevent certain income arising
before 6 April 2008 from being taxed as a remittance if it is brought
to the UK on or after that date. The point has been made that those
provisions do not work as intended, so we are amending them to ensure
that  they
do.</div><a name="09061154000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked whether the problem he described with
settlements legislation has been solved&#151;I am sorry, it was the
hon. Member for Henley who asked that. I think that paragraphs 13 and
14 of the schedule cover that point, and people we have talked to have
not only welcomed the change, but told us they think it solves the
problem.</div><a name="09061154000181"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09061154000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
follow some provisions that remove ambiguity in the remittance basis
regime and ensure that they are not targeted by those seeking to
sidestep the rules. The hon. Member for Henley, while welcoming the
progress we have made as a result of the discussions, asked whether we
were going to keep the consultative committee going. I can reassure him
that we have agreed to do that. I agree that it has been a useful
forum, and one whose value will continue for a period yet.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div><a name="09061154000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking the
changes introduced by the schedule together makes the remittance basis
more straightforward to operate in practice. I again express my thanks
for the constructive approach the interested parties and outside
organisations have taken in their consultations with officials from the
Treasury and HMRC, as it has allowed us to make these worthwhile
improvements to the remittance
basis.</div><a name="09061154000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

&#145;&#163;500&#146;.</div><a name="09061154000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
will recall, Mr. Hood, that we had an extremely lengthy
debate on all these matters a year ago, and that I had the opportunity
to raise every issue I could conceivably think of&#151;and many that
I had not previously thought about&#151;with regard to the topic. I
do not intend to go over all that ground again, especially as it has
been touched on in our discussions on schedule 27, but I have tabled
this specific amendment. Yet again, I cannot claim its original
authorship, because representations were made to me by the Chartered
Institute of Taxation&#146;s Low Incomes Tax Reform Group on that

for example, or people doing jobs that pay only the minimum wage or a
small amount above it would nevertheless be classified as non-doms. The
amendment concerns the tax they would be eligible to pay on interest on
money in their bank accounts. Because of sterling&#146;s decline
against the euro, people who live elsewhere in Europe, or who are paid
in euros, might be able to accumulate even more money than normal.
Anyone working hard and applying themselves, even if earning a
relatively small amount of money, could build up a reasonable balance
without it being regarded as large by any normal person&#146;s
standards, and they would be eligible to pay interest on that balance.
The point was well made by the hon. Member for Fareham that that might
be seen as unreasonable, although that is a subjective view.</div>
<a name="09061154000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that the hon. Gentleman made was about practicalities: for
someone eligible to pay &#163;20 of tax on a balance of &#163;100,
in terms of additional interest, it seems to be quite an administrative
burden to recoup a rather small amount of money. The amendment
therefore proposes that the clause should specify &#163;500 for
interest payments, rather than &#163;100, which would give people
just a little more of a cushion, with regard both to practicality and
to giving people an opportunity to save a small but reasonable amount
of money. That would be more workable and
reasonable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div><a name="09061154000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061154000229"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
wish to speak briefly to oppose the amendment. To raise &#163;100 a
year in a standard, current or gold service account seems trivial but,
in the low interest-rate economy in which we now live, it would need an
ongoing balance of around &#163;20,000. It is in part a function of
the low interest-rate economy&#151;which will be with us for at least
the tenure of this Finance Act&#151;that that seems a sensible de
minimis level. I understand the rightful concern that we do not want
anything too pettifogging, with too many different rules. In this
context, the difference between a minimum of &#163;100 and one of
&#163;500 might seem trivial, but it would require a six-figure sum
in a current account to raise &#163;500 a year, as interest rates
tend to be below 0.5 per cent., even for the most generous basic savers
accounts.</div>
<a name="09061154000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Taunton is absolutely right that we should encourage those
non-domiciles who are not well off. In my own central London
constituency, there are significant numbers of people&#151;perhaps
spouses, ex-spouses or relatives of wealthy investment
bankers&#151;who are non-domiciled but are not as well off as the
general image suggests. It is fair that they should have a reasonable
day-to-day balance of a few months&#146; living expenses under their
belts&#151;perhaps as much &#163;10,000 or &#163;15,000 a
year&#151;well within the constraints that the Government and
Treasury have in mind. If there were significant increases in interest
rates in the foregoing 12 months I hope that the Treasury would return
to this and raise that minimum threshold. At this juncture, &#163;100
is a relatively sensible one to have in
place.</div><a name="09061154000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000230"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am with the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster on this one in the debate we have just heard. The hon.
Member for Taunton is absolutely right that a lot of foreign workers on
low incomes come to the UK and might well fall within the remittance
regime&#151;people working in agriculture or construction&#151;and
it was never our intention to bring low-paid workers into
self-assessment in that way, still less so when there is no tax
involved. The clause introduces an income tax exemption on overseas
income, which effectively removes the obligation to file a
self-assessment return from anyone who has foreign employment income of
less than &#163;10,000 in any tax year, as we were discussing a
moment
ago.</div><a name="09061154000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
might also have small amounts of income from bank accounts or other
investments overseas in addition to their foreign employment income.
That would again trigger an obligation to file a self-assessment return
and, again, that was not the intention. The change here is that people
with overseas bank interest of less than &#163;100 in any tax year
will still be able to take advantage of the tax exemption. I should
clarify the fact that the clause requires that the foreign income must
be subject to a foreign tax. That does not mean that the person must
actually have paid tax on the income in a country other than the UK. It
could well be that the income in question is liable to a tax rate of 0
per cent. or could be covered by overseas personal allowances, in which
case no tax would be payable on it but it would still count as subject
to a foreign tax in this clause.</div>
<a name="09061154000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster is right: an
investment income of &#163;100 in the current environment does equate
to a significant capital saving. That is set at the right level in the
current 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>environment to ensure that the people who are the target of this measure
will not be brought into self-assessment. An investment income of
&#163;500 would mean a significant capital sum. The clause deals with
individuals on low incomes who come to work in the UK in the sort of
situations that we have discussed. I am not aware of any evidence of a
need to increase the threshold, and I am confident that nobody will be
prevented from taking advantage of the tax exemption and the
administrative relaxations that it delivers. I accept that we
should  keep the matter under review, as circumstances
might  change and the threshold might need to be raised, but
the &#163;100 level is right for
now.</div><a name="09061154000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000231"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am happy to have had the opportunity to make my
point and to have heard the entirely valid arguments made by the two
other contributors during our brief discussion. On that basis, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061154000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="09061154000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000232"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The principle of the clause&#151;the introduction
of a &#163;10,000 exemption&#151;was discussed at length last year.
There were various proposals at that time, one of which was tabled by
the hon. Member for Taunton to change the exemption from &#163;2,000
to the value of the personal allowance. The then Financial Secretary
said that that would be far too expensive and that we should not do it,
but the Government have clearly had a change of heart. Concerns were
also raised a year ago about the administrative burden that such a low
level would place on Her Majesty&#146;s Revenues and Customs, but
again we were assured that that was not a problem. However, here we are
a year later, and there has been a sea change in the Treasury&#146;s
approach, with the introduction of a &#163;10,000 exemption for
earned income. To make sure that the Minister will not claim that I
grudgingly welcome the measure, I will say that I wholeheartedly
welcome it. It is a very sensible measure and one that the Government,
had they listened to the representations of people such as the Low
Incomes Tax Reform Group last year, would have included in the previous
Finance
Bill.</div><a name="09061154000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister made a comment earlier about interest income being subject to
tax. Will that also apply to employment income? The LITRG raised the
issue in its representation this year, which takes us back to
828B(2)(b) which states
that</div><a name="09061154000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all
of that amount is subject to a foreign
tax.&#148;</div><a name="09061154000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s earlier reassurance in response to the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Taunton that personal allowances and
zero-rate bands will be taken into account is helpful, and applies to
employment income as well as interest income. I would be grateful if
the Minister could place that on
record.</div><a name="09061154000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the issue raised by the LITRG something that the Government will
determine on a territory-by-territory basis where income for a
territory is subject to tax, or will there be a blanket exemption? If
it is to be determined on a territorial basis, it would be helpful to
have a list of jurisdictions where the Government believe that up to
&#163;10,000 of income has been subject to tax. That list of
countries will need to be made known to migrant workers who are here on
a temporary basis, as they need to be told what is and is not
appropriate. A blanket exemption,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>however, would be administratively easier for migrant workers, as it
would avoid having to communicate to them a list of exempt
companies.</div><a name="09061154000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would therefore like the Minister to clarify two points. First, will he
clarify what is involved in being subject to foreign tax, and will he
confirm that his explanation on the &#163;100 investment income also
applies to employment income? Secondly, is it a blanket exemption, or
will it be applied on a territory-by-territory basis? Perhaps he could
just round that off by saying why he now thinks that &#163;10,000 is
appropriate, whereas last year it was seen as being a necessary cost to
the
taxpayer.</div><a name="09061154000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000233"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I wish to speak briefly to the clause. I am
reliably informed&#151;I admit that I did not conduct this research
in the Derby Gate Library myself&#151;that in the drafting last year,
schedule 7 ran to 55 pages, or 22,989 words, and there were 160 pages
of explanatory notes and more than 100 Government amendments wrestling
with this difficult area to try to get a grip on it and make it
workable in practice. Even then, the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales described the Government&#146;s efforts
as</div>
<a name="09061154000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;incomprehensible,
unworkable and likely to be undermined by poor
compliance.&#148;</div><a name="09061154000182"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09061154000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, I am extremely grateful that the Government have listened
to representations made by members of this Committee and others who do
their best to ensure that the Government&#146;s policies work in
practice. I am extremely flattered that the general direction that the
Liberal Democrats have been taking in respect of tax thresholds is
being adopted incrementally by the Government, and that the
intellectual argument is being won. It is important that, wherever
possible, people on low incomes are given the most incentive to work
and contribute to our economy. I am sympathetic to what the Government
have finally managed to achieve and interested to know whether the
Minister will take this consultative, wide-ranging approach in future
and take on board any of the other suggestions made by Opposition
parties.</div><a name="09061154000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000234"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> My right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree, who was then the Financial Secretary, agreed that there
should be a discussion with the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group and
others, and that discussion has proved to be fruitful. Of course, we
always listen to suggestions made by hon. Members in this Committee and
elsewhere. I shall take the remarks that have been made as a warm
welcome for the changes in the
clause.</div><a name="09061154000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a useful reminder that the remittance basis of taxation does not
affect only wealthy people, as we have discussed. The LITRG and TaxAid
pointed out that, as a result of the changes made last year to the
remittance basis rules, many people on low incomes could be required to
file a self-assessment return. The clause removes that obligation from
any individual whose foreign income solely comprises overseas
employment income of less than &#163;10,000 and overseas bank
interest of less than &#163;100 in any tax year, all of which is
subject to tax in the country where the income was
earned.</div><a name="09061154000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
respond to the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Fareham,
yes, the observations that I made in the context of investment income
apply equally to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>employment income. The exemption is a blanket exemption rather than a
territory-by-territory
exemption.</div><a name="09061154000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
gladly express gratitude to all those who have made representations on
the subject, and I hope that the Committee will be content to add the
clause to the
Bill.</div><a name="09061154000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div>
<a name="09061154000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061154000235"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is a
great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, I
believe for the first time in this Bill Committee. I assume that the
Exchequer Secretary will be dealing with this schedule. May I formally
welcome her back to the Treasury? I know that this is not the first
time she has been a Treasury Minister. Perhaps she is following the
example of the Financial Secretary as a serial Treasury Minister. I do
not know whether she will reach his total number of spells in the
Treasury&#151;I suspect she will not do so in the immediate
future.</div><a name="09061154000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
28 deals with provisions regarding taxable benefits that arise from
cars being made available to employees by reason of their employment. I
have a couple of queries that I would like to raise with the Exchequer
Secretary. The first matter is the abolition of the current
&#163;80,000 list price cap, which will lead to higher tax charges
for individuals using more expensive cars. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales asked whether that proposal will have
an impact on the UK car industry, because the UK car industry produces
a number of cars that would exceed the &#163;80,000 list price cap. I
would be grateful if the Exchequer Secretary said whether any
assessment has been made of that
impact.</div><a name="09061154000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second issue is directly relevant to provisions regarding the taxable
benefits that arise from cars being made available to employees by
reason of their employment. I will mention briefly a slightly
specialist point, and, to be fair to the Exchequer Secretary, it is a
matter that she may find easier to respond to in writing. In April,
through correspondence, I raised with her predecessor the issue of car
dealership employees who are taxed on their use of demonstrator cars.
The problem relates to those employees working for car dealerships who
use demonstrator cars for their own private use. It has long been
accepted that it would be inappropriate to tax that benefit in kind in
exactly the same way as company cars are usually taxed. It is likely
that the employee will use more than one car or that they have no
choice over which car to drive. The car that the employee drives is
likely to be disproportionately expensive compared with their
salary.</div>
<a name="09061154000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a
consequence, a system has developed whereby HMRC has looked at a range
of models and averaged a value to calculate a figure for the relevant
benefit in kind. A new system was introduced in April that still 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>works on the basis of averaging the value, but it is done on narrower
bands. I have received representations from car dealerships and
manufacturers because the consequence of that is likely to be that more
car dealership employees pay tax. In addition, the measure is likely to
increase the administrative burden on car dealerships. As I said, I
have raised that point previously in correspondence, but given that
schedule 28 deals specifically with taxable benefits and cars, I have
taken the opportunity to raise it
again.</div><a name="09061154000079"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000236"></a>John
Howell:</b> I wish to make a couple of points. My hon. Friend
has asked about the impact of the provision and research on the car
industry, but will the Minister comment on the difference in tax yield
between the proposal under discussion and increasing the amount from
&#163;80,000 to, say,
&#163;100,000?</div><a name="09061154000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000237"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> It is
a pleasure to serve once again under your chairmanship, Mr.
Hood. As it is, or it is also a pleasure&#151;even if I cannot
speak&#151;</div><a name="09061154000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061154000238"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000239"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Overwhelmed, indeed, by the opportunity and
privilege of debating with the hon. Gentleman again
today.</div><a name="09061154000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
points that have been made are valid. The schedule does three things:
shifts down the CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emission threshold for the main company
car tax band by 5g CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>per km; abolishes the cap on company
car list prices for the purposes of CCT; and&#151;I think this is
uncontroversial&#151;simplifies the legislative means by which the
appropriate percentage for electric cars in CCT is set.</div>
<a name="09061154000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, we have, of
course, considered the impact on the industry. The impact, if there is
any at all, is negligible, for the simple reason that only around 1,700
company cars retail at more than &#163;80,000. The price range may be
extremely wide. I think the figure of &#163;300,000 was mentioned.
People who purchase that type of car should easily be able to cope with
what we propose. There is no policy reason for a cap. On the point made
by the hon. Member for Henley, it therefore follows that it would not
make any difference if the cap were raised to
&#163;100,000.</div><a name="09061154000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000240"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s explanation,
but given what she has just said, why are the proposals being
introduced at different
times?</div><a name="09061154000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000241"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We like to give certainty to the industry, and are
simply setting out what we propose to do in the appropriate years
ahead. Some of those proposals have been pre-announced, fulfilling
different
commitments.</div><a name="09061154000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Abolishing
the &#163;80,000 cap will, after three years, yield about &#163;5
million, while raising the cap to &#163;100,000 would probably not
yield anything quantifiable. I hope that that goes further towards
answering the question asked by the hon. Member for
Henley.</div><a name="09061154000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised an issue that, as I was
aware, he raised with my predecessor in correspondence: car dealerships
that might give employees 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>a different car to drive every couple of days, or every week. As he
says, while in some firms an employee might be given those different
cars because they are what they would like to drive, in many other
firms employees do not have a choice. He is right that in the past,
just to make it simpler for the employer and the garage, we allowed
average list prices. What we wish to address is the fact that those
prices were negotiated with HMRC on a piecemeal basis, garage by
garage, often with an individual garage in a chain of garages. That
sometimes led to an arbitrariness that perhaps was not conducive to
good policy making, and we are simply formalising the process by means
of a national system.</div>
<a name="09061154000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might help
the hon. Gentleman to know that the effect of the change is cost
neutral to us, and so while there might be differences for
individuals&#151;and they are right to raise those
differences&#151;this is not a revenue-raising measure and there will
be both winners and losers. I am sure he agrees that it is better to
have a proper system, rather than to deal with the issue on an
arbitrary, ad hoc
basis.</div><a name="09061154000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000242"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for responding this
afternoon on that point. I note her comment that the measure is cost
neutral for HMRC, but what assessment has been made of the additional
administrative burden for car dealerships? What consultation was there
with car dealerships and the car manufacturing industry as a whole, and
what was the
response?</div><a name="09061154000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000243"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I think that I am able to reassure the hon.
Gentleman on those points. We have consulted extensively with industry
bodies&#151;for example, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Retail Motor Industry Federation&#151;on the change.
The feeling that we are getting back is that the change will lead to
reduced administrative burdens, because of the certainty that it
provides. Individual employers do not have to use an averaging process
if they do not want to; they can continue with the mainstream system if
they prefer that. However, the purpose of the measure is to reduce
compliance costs and have a far simpler
method.</div><a name="09061154000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000244"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> In the correspondence that I have seen, both RMIF
and SMMT have expressed concerns about the proposal. That
correspondence dates back a couple of months or so, and those
bodies&#146; position might have changed, but what I have seen
suggests concerns about the proposals rather than a general welcoming
of
them.</div><a name="09061154000183"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000245"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The advice I have been given is that the measure
should lead to reduced administrative burdens, and that that is
understood. We intend there to be a simplification measure. We are
making the change because people have complained that the previous
system of individual car averaging arrangements with individual
employers and garages was unfair, and led to inconsistencies across the
country. Perhaps that is the nub of the problem. If there were
inconsistencies there would obviously be winners and losers as a
result.</div>
<a name="09061154000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I simply want
to reassure the Committee that this is not an attempt to ratchet in
more funds to the Exchequer; it is simply better policy making. If in
ironing out there are inconsistencies and some individual employers
feel 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>hard done by, I can understand that. But this is a better way forward.
As I said, they have the option of not going down the averaging route
if they prefer. I hope, having explained that, that the schedule will
be accepted by the

amendment seeks to amend one of the elements of the clause. The clause
provides that for disabled drivers of automatic cars who hold a
disabled person&#146;s badge, the list or notional price of an
equivalent manual car will be used instead of the list or notional
price of the automatic car that they actually drive when computing the
car benefit charge if it produces a lower taxable benefit. This removes
the disadvantage that some disabled company car drivers might face when
they must drive an automatic car because of their
disability.</div><a name="09061154000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) defines an &#147;equivalent manual car&#148; as a car
that</div>
<a name="09061154000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is first
registered at or about the same time as the automatic
car&#148;.</div><a name="09061154000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
phrase &#147;at or about the same time&#148; seems a bit vague. The
amendment would replace it with the phrase &#147;in the same
registration period&#148;. It is simply an attempt to provide
additional clarity. There may be good reasons for the current wording,
but the amendment was suggested by CIOT and is much more
precise.</div><a name="09061154000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000252"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I urge the Committee to resist the amendment. As
the hon. Gentleman suspected, there is an extremely good reason for the
current wording, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>which states that the relevant car price should be that for an
equivalent manual car that is registered at or about the same time as
the automatic car. This definition has been used in legislation for
seven years and HMRC has received no representations that it is
difficult to use in practice. However, if the Opposition amendment were
accepted, things would immediately become far more complicated. If a
reference period of six months were used, it would not be at all clear
what the relevant price of a manual car would be for comparison
purposes. Car list prices can change within registration periods, often
quite dramatically, so the suggested wording would not always lead to a
single figure. Indeed, it might encourage all sorts of negotiation
about what the correct figure should be. We think that that would lead
to unnecessary
complication.</div><a name="09061154000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000253"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Without wishing to paraphrase the  thoughts
of my hon. Friend the Member for South- West Hertfordshire on
the matter, surely the registration period is an entirely certain
period of time&#151;six months. What does she understand the phrase
&#147;at or about the same time&#148; to encompass, either from her
own experience, or from any non-representations that she has had over
the past seven years from interested
parties?</div><a name="09061154000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000254"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> It is exactly what it says on the tin. The fact
that nobody has complained about it in the past seven years means that
people understand what &#147;at or about the same time&#148; is. It
is a price that is available at or around the same time. I suppose the
word &#147;around&#148; is used because at that precise moment
there may not exactly, at that infinitesimal moment in time, be a
precise comparison and so it is a reasonable time period to use. If the
amendment were accepted, it could lead to some disabled drivers paying
more in income tax, and that is certainly not our intention. We want to
give disabled company car drivers certainty about how they will be
supported through the tax system.</div>
<a name="09061154000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000255"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If it is open to abuse, disabled drivers would find
the best comparison price to reduce their tax liability; they would not
put in a price that would actually increase their tax
liability.</div><a name="09061154000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000256"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Well, that is not at all clear from the wording
that his party is proposing. There could be all sorts of different
prices out there in a six-month period. There could be a price one day
that is very different from a price 10 or 15 days later. There is the
additional complication of burden of proof, either on one side or
another, whereas the current system is easy to understand and easy to
administer, so I do not see the point in changing
it.</div>
<a name="09061154000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000257"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Does the Minister think it is possible that a
registration within the same registration period would not be at or
around the same time? It seems to me that our amendment actually
narrows the requirement, rather than widens it. I am not sure that her
case is quite as strong as she makes out.</div>
<a name="09061154000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000258"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am sorry if I am not making the strength of my
case clear, but perhaps I will try again. The list prices of cars can
change quite dramatically during a registration period, which is
currently six months. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>It is not clear, therefore, what the relevant, appropriate price of an
equivalent manual car would be. However, if the legislation says
&#147;at or around the same time&#148;, then clearly, as the last
seven years&#146; experience has shown, it is the price available at
or around the same time that is taken, as opposed to any price over a
six month-period, which could vary quite
widely.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000260"></a>Kitty

happy to take him up on
it.</div><a name="09061154000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000261"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Let me make it clear. I have no doubt of the
strength of the way the Minister is putting her case, I just think that
that strength is unwarranted. Could she be clear? Does &#147;at or
around the same time&#148; mean essentially the nearest time to the
date of registration of the automatic car? If that is the
case&#151;the wording is not as clear as it might be&#151;then she
does have a stronger
case.</div><a name="09061154000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000262"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> That is the case, which is why my argument is
stronger than that which the hon. Gentleman is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000263"></a>Mr.

certain amount of persistence, she may well have articulated her case,

<a name="09061154000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000264"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Mr. Hood, you anticipated that I have
one or two remarks to make on the clause.</div>
<a name="09061154000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already touched on the essential purpose of the clause. However, I just
want to make one other point. The application of the clause is based
upon an employee holding a disabled person&#146;s badge. The LITRG,
at the prompting of the charity Mobilise, has questioned whether the
blue badge scheme is sufficiently wide to include everyone who needs to
use an automatic vehicle. For example, it has stated
that</div><a name="09061154000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;single
amputees do not necessarily qualify for a blue badge, but do need to
drive an
automatic&#148;.</div><a name="09061154000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently
it goes on to say:</div>
<a name="09061154000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be interesting to know why a definition linked to the disabled
badge
scheme&#148;</div><a name="09061154000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">has
been used in the clause.</div>
<a name="09061154000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LITRG
also noted another issue that is worth highlighting. The issue of
disabled badge holders arose earlier, of course, in our considerations,
in the debate that the Exchequer Secretary had with my hon. Friend the
Member for Fareham about the definition used in paragraph 22 of
schedule 11. I shall quote from that debate, in which the Exchequer
Secretary responded to a question from my hon. Friend about why that
particular provision could not be simplified to include disabled badge
holders:</div><a name="09061154000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
hon. Gentleman then asked specifically why in paragraph 22
we do not simply use the qualification criterion of a person holding a
disabled badge. The answer quite simply is that the power to award a
badge is devolved to local authorities and we wanted to ensure that we
had a comprehensible and tighter set of criteria, so that the system
and the resources are properly targeted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>on those people who need our
support.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Finance
Public Bill Committee, </i>9 June 2009; c.
234.]</div><a name="09061154000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
be grateful to the Exchequer Secretary if she could explain why the
disabled badge qualification was inappropriate for paragraph 22 of
schedule 11 but is appropriate for clause
54.</div>
<a name="09061154000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
clause to work effectively, it will be necessary to publicise the new
provisions contained within it. I should say first that we welcome the
intention behind the clause; the clause is seeking to do something that
is very worthwhile and just. However, as I say, if the clause is to
work effectively it will be necessary to publicise the new provisions,
so that employers and employees know what information to provide to
HMRC to obtain the correct 2009 tax coding restriction. I would be
grateful if the Exchequer Secretary could say what steps were being
taken to publicise the provisions in the
clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000265"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I want to make a brief contribution on a tangential
issue that arises here. My hon. Friend has rightly said that it is up
to local authorities to determine whether or not an individual
qualifies for a blue badge. As someone who represents a central London
constituency and two central London local authorities within that
constituency, I would be very reluctant to see any move away from local
authorities having that power. I appreciate that it may not be in any
way in the Treasury&#146;s thinking at the moment, but I strongly
oppose any suggestion that the mechanics of the blue badge disabled
driver system should be determined at a national level.</div>
<a name="09061154000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Westminster
city council is working closely on this issue with a number of
neighbouring and non-Conservative local authorities, such as that in
the London borough of Camden; in fact, Camden is of course now under
Liberal and Conservative control. Westminster city council feels very
strongly that it should continue to have autonomy in awarding such
badges and that a national badge scheme would not be in the interests
of disabled people. Although disabled people would like to have the
opportunity of coming to central London, if they all did it would
absolutely clog up the parking system in the area. I appreciate that
that is a tangential point and does not necessarily represent the
thrust of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire, but I wanted to put something on the record about it. It
is an issue of considerable importance and a number of central London
local authorities are acutely concerned that, although elements of the
scheme have national resonance&#151;obviously, in relation to tax
benefits&#151;those should not apply to the operation of the scheme
itself.</div><a name="09061154000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000266"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> It might help if I start by explaining exactly
what the clause does, because the context for this policy change might
answer some of the wider questions as well. The clause supports the
Government&#146;s commitment to provide help for the disabled by
changing the way in which the company car benefit charges are
calculated for disabled drivers who need to drive an automatic car
because of their
disability.</div><a name="09061154000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Company
car drivers holding a blue disabled person&#146;s badge are already
able to use the carbon dioxide emissions figure of an equivalent manual
car when calculating their company car benefit, in place of the figure
for an  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>automatic car, which is usually a higher-emitting vehicle. The logic is
that, because automatic cars emit slightly higher amounts of CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>per km than the equivalent manual car, it is unfair that people
who have to have an automatic car because of a disability that they
cannot control should be penalised through the taxation system. We are
making the system slightly more generous for people in that category by
saying that such drivers would also be able to use the list price of an
equivalent manual car to work out the benefit charge instead of the
list price of the automatic car that they currently drive. That is
usually to their advantage, because of the price differential between
two equivalent
models.</div><a name="09061154000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause would simply align the methods used to determine the list price
and the CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions figures. It is a logical tidying-up
exercise, but it also benefits disabled company car drivers, so it
should be supported. I welcome the support from the official Opposition
spokesperson. Both methods of calculating benefit will now be based on
an equivalent manual car, if that is more beneficial for the disabled
driver. If it is not, that does not have to be
so.</div><a name="09061154000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
for the record, and subject to certain conditions, the cost of
accessories provided for disabled drivers is also excluded from the
calculation of the company car benefit
charge.</div><a name="09061154000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire was perhaps making two
arguments that pointed in different directions. He asked, first, about
disabled drivers who do not hold a blue badge and whether they should
also be included. The blue badge provides a clearly defined test of
disability, it has worked in this area of policy in the past and there
is no proposal to change it. However, it is worth stating clearly that,
in exceptional cases, affected individuals in particular circumstances
will be able to contact HMRC to seek guidance about whether there is
any flexibility or any prior agreement that can be
reached.</div><a name="09061154000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
argued that the scheme should, perhaps, be more generous, the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire questioned whether it could be made
tighter by using the definition that we debated earlier in the week in
relation to capital allowances, which also applies in respect of
vehicle excise duty and is tighter than the one that applies in this
area of
policy.</div><a name="09061154000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000267"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Perhaps I can take the Minister back a moment to
her suggestion that somebody who is not eligible for the blue badge may
be able to seek guidance from HMRC and may benefit from the scheme.
That is welcome, but I should be grateful if she reconciled that with
the wording contained in clause 54(5), which contains new section 124A
of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. It
states:</div><a name="09061154000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
section applies...at any time in the year when the automatic car
is available to the employee (&#147;E&#148;), E holds a disabled
person&#146;s
badge&#148;.</div><a name="09061154000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
flexibility does not appear to be contained in the legislation. I
should be grateful if she clarified that
point.</div><a name="09061154000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000268"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I cannot possibly begin to describe the
circumstances, because those will depend on the individual&#146;s
situation. If people feel that, in their individual circumstances, it
could apply to them, HMRC is saying 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>that individuals who are affected should contact it first before
applying and it will be happy to have that conversation. If I can
provide further detail, I will.</div>
<a name="09061154000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
discussing why the gateway for disabled company car drivers is
different from that in other policy areas, such as capital allowances
and vehicle excise duty. The policy aim has a different origin. For
example, in vehicle excise duty, the disability exemption is a total
exemption from paying that duty to help those who are practically
unable to walk to be driven or to drive themselves, whereas in company
car tax, blue badge holders are allowed to substitute only the
CO<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub"> </span>emissions, and now the list price, of an
equivalent manual car when calculating the company car benefit, to give
them parity with able-bodied drivers under law.</div>
<a name="09061154000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main
point is that we are taking an existing policy that works well and
simply making it slightly more generous, because we think that there is
a logical policy reason to do so. We are not seeking to open a debate
about the definition of disability across the taxation system. The
policies have different rationales, which is where the differences
arise.</div>
<a name="09061154000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
point made by hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster about
the burden on councils. I hope that he will be reassured that we are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000269"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause deals with the exemption of benefits
consisting of health-screening or medical check-ups. It may help if I
set out a little background to the measure.</div>
<a name="09061154000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two statutory
instruments introduced in August 2007 dealt with the taxation and
reporting of health screenings and medical check-ups provided by
employers to employees. Previously, employers and HMRC had persisted in
treating the provision of periodic health screenings and medical
check-ups for employees as exempt from tax and reporting requirements.
There was no specific provision requiring such benefits to be provided
universally in order to be tax and NIC exempt. However, HMRC took the
view in 2007 that the practice was based on an understanding or
assumption, rather than on strict legality. New regulations provided a
significantly narrower exemption for periodic health screenings and
medical check-ups.</div>
<a name="09061154000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
introduced in August 2007 required any provision of health screenings
by an employer to an employee to be made available to all employees and
any medical cheek-up to be either made available to all employees or
made available to those identified by a health screening as needing
such a check-up. Those regulations came into effect on 14 August 2007,
but had a retrospective effect covering the 2007-08 tax year. Strong
representations were made about that retrospection. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>HMRC agreed not to collect any tax for 2007-08 and, in February 2008,
that was extended to 2008-09, so we had a period of
confusion.</div>
<a name="09061154000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 55 is
a revision of the revised proposals of August 2007. After receiving
further representations, HMRC announced on 10 December 2008 that it
would include legislation in the Finance
Bill</div><a name="09061154000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
exempt from tax the provision of yearly health screening and medical
check
ups&#148;</div><a name="09061154000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">without
the proviso that they have to be generally available on similar terms
to all employees. That is essentially what is covered by the
clause.</div><a name="09061154000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is welcome up to a point. It is fair to say that the changes
announced in August 2007 were somewhat botched and that there has been
a lengthy period of confusion, but concerns remain that clause 55 is
still somewhat restrictive. There is a restriction to one health
screening or check-up per tax year, but an individual may well require
more than one screening or check-up, or a check for more than one
potential condition, per year. It is often impractical to ensure that
an annual medical that occurs around the start or the end of the tax
year is not repeated within that same year, as people can end up having
two medicals in one year just by a few days. I should be grateful to
know why the Government have not reverted to the position before August
2007. Why is there a restriction of one check up per year? I suspect
that the answer may well be cost, but what is the cost? I am sceptical
that it is very
significant.</div><a name="09061154000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will reduce the amount of red tape for employers and employees,
so we welcome it as far as it goes; it is clearly an improvement on the
uncertainty of the past two years or so. However, I would be grateful
to know why the Government have not sought to return to the arrangement
that seemed to be working perfectly adequately prior to August
2007.</div><a name="09061154000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000270"></a>John
Howell:</b> My family would be intensely surprised to hear me
speak to this clause and encourage people to have more than one medical
per year. New Speakers are reluctantly dragged to the Chair; I am more
than reluctantly dragged to a medical. In the years in which I was a
partner at Ernst &amp; Young, an annual medical was required for
insurance purposes, but my interpretation of annual was always somewhat
loose. I understand that the medical profession have a term for
that&#151;white coat syndrome&#151;which, in my case, I attributed
to the obvious mental scarring that occurred when I shared student
accommodation with too many
medics.</div><a name="09061154000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the course of my experience with a regime that required annual
medicals, it was impossible to schedule them on a strictly annual
basis. It is not a question of a couple of days; it is often
impossible, with a large work force and the way in which a medical
schedule is taken up and booked far in advance by a doctor, to fit a
medical in within even a couple of weeks or a month of the annual date.
There were many occasions when a second medical occurred within the
same tax year. Also, although I never had to endure it, colleagues of
mine had to return during the year, either for further check-ups as a
result of their original medical, or for medicals for additional
reasons. For the reasons advocated by my hon. Friend, the rules need to
be further relaxed, although I assume that I will not have to be
subjected to more medicals than I need.</div>

Brian Jenkins</b> (Tamworth) (Lab): I will not take much time,
because I know that Members want to pursue the Bill as rapidly as
possible, but I want some clarification from the Minister, because I
would be worried if I thought that we were taking a step
back.</div>
<a name="09061154000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
employees in this country who work in hazardous conditions, which might
require the employer to work with them and their trade union to ensure
that they have one medical check a year. I seek assurance from the
Minister that there is no way we are going to stop or financially
impede the opportunity to take that check, depending upon the type of
work the employee undertakes. I would of course like all employees in
any company to be treated equally, and if an employer wants to
undertake an annual medical check, all their employees should be
treated the same, but for individuals working in hazardous conditions,
we should ensure that we will put nothing in the way of checks
occurring more frequently than once a
year.</div><a name="09061154000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061154000272"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): In Devonport, we have
a dockyard. There are frequent reports of nuclear leaks, which are
exceptional, but were a leak to happen, each employee would clearly
need a full and thorough health check, which might be in addition to
one they have already had, so I share my hon. Friend&#146;s
concerns.</div>
<a name="09061154000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000273"></a>Mr.
Jenkins:</b> I understand totally that the employees in such
areas carry dosimeters all the time, and when those meters change
colour the employee must have a medical check, irrespective of when
they last had one, but there are many areas in industry across the
country where those conditions can arise, and I would not like the
ability to have annual checks to be put back. I would like the Minister
to make that totally
clear.</div><a name="09061154000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000274"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I will start by reassuring my hon. Friends the
Members for Tamworth and for Plymouth, Devonport that the provisions we
are debating are completely without prejudice to the relevant health
and safety legislation, which of course require workers to undergo the
necessary medical testing and treatment, in so far as their personal
health is affected by conditions at work. That is the crucial
difference, so I hope that that reassures
them.</div><a name="09061154000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Responding
to the points made on more frequent medical checks, it has never been
our intention that medical treatment should be exempted from tax when
provided by a company. That is no different to any other type of
private medical treatment. An individual may go for a check-up in which
a problem is identified that is then treated via the company, but we
have no desire to treat that check-up as a benefit in kind. We
therefore provide a generous taxation position; I do not know whether
the Opposition would want to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div><a name="09061154000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the
regulations were introduced in 2007, the guidance, as has been
mentioned, referred to periodic medical check-ups. That was based on
the understanding that, when an employer provides employees with
medical check-ups, they are commonly at longer intervals than once a
year&#151;perhaps reflecting the fact that the hon. Member for Henley
is not alone in his aversion to check-ups. It is certainly our
understanding that routine check-ups, rather than treatment, tend in
practice to take place less frequently than once a year, which is
absolutely fine as far as the regulations are concerned.</div>
<a name="09061154000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations were introduced in 2007 because we needed to ensure there
was a clear legislative basis for what was otherwise simply an
understanding on the part of HMRC. We are changing them now precisely
because of the representations we have received and simply because we
want to get the provisions right. There were some anomalies that, to be
honest, HMRC had not identified. The example that makes the point most
clearly is that the 2007 regulations stated that precisely the same
check-ups needed to be made available to all classes of people, and
since some of the check-ups are for gender-related cancer, it
immediately became apparent that it was absurd to require that the
whole work force should be tested for testicular or breast cancer,
regardless of gender. It soon became clear that something needed to be
sorted out, so the clause aims simply to regularise that
position.</div><a name="09061154000162"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000275"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Given that swine flu is back in the news today, one
potential issue is that employers might want to instigate checks and
make them available to their employees in an attempt to respond to it,
particularly in the autumn when there are likely to be concerns about
swine flu again. In clause 55, it appears that an additional check in
the course of the year would be taxable. I understand why it is not
addressed in the legislation, but would the Treasury be willing to
reconsider if concerns about swine flu increased and such checks became
widely
available?</div><a name="09061154000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061154000276"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We are not planning to look at this again. A
company wishing to undertake swine flu checks on its entire staff would
do so for both humane and business continuity reasons. It is ultimately
a commercial decision for the company. There are intense efforts across
Government to ensure, through the national health service, an
appropriate response to any future swine flu pandemic, and that will
proceed as normal, regardless of where people
work.</div><a name="09061154000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
