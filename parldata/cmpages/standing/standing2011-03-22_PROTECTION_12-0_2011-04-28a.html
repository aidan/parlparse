                           </span> Before lunch, I was responding to
the hon. Member for Northampton North, who is now approaching his
place—just on time, unlike many of the trains that I am about to
mention. He made a comparison with Scotland, which does not have
clamping powers. I was talking about the Cator estate, part of which is
in my constituency. It is close to a railway station, and the people
there fear that they will suffer from commuter parking. The hon.
Gentleman said that they do not seem to have that problem in Scotland,
but that is a poor
comparison.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
took the opportunity of the break to look up some figures that were at
the back of my mind from when I was on the Transport Committee, about
the problems caused by commuting around London. Nearly 70%—a
staggering figure—of the train journeys undertaken each year in
this country are related to people travelling to and from London. For
people living around railway stations in the outer parts of London,
commuter parking is a huge problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If Government
Members were to go to any of the stations on the south-east
network—certainly those around my constituency—they would
find that local authorities have been forced to introduce restricted
parking zones around stations because of commuters using free street
parking and clogging up the roads. That was not only inconvenient for
local residents, but was damaging to local businesses as parking spaces
around town centres and local amenity stores were not available, and
shops were being lost. It was therefore vital for local economies and
local amenities that the issues were dealt with. In response to the
point about Scotland seeming not to have such problems, it should be a
question of what is suitable in each circumstance. We all want to deal
with rogue
clampers.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have an extreme example of a chap I referred to on Second Reading, whom
I would describe as a rogue clamper. He is a cage fighter who sits in
his white van at the bottom of a little lane and when anyone dares to
park on the little parking space at the end of that bit of private
land, he comes up like a trapdoor spider, traps the car in, and then
clamps it and demands immediate payment. I recently heard from one of
my constituents that he leapt on and clamped a car while a disabled
person, who had dared to park there for a few seconds, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 430<a class="bkMark" name="Column430">&#160;</a>
                           </div>was stuck inside. We certainly want to regulate to stop that sort of
rogue clamper, but at the same time we should consider the situation
that people who live on the Cator estate might be placed
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
estate has nearly 4,000 residents and is close to Blackheath village
and the small town centre there, and to Blackheath railway station. The
residents have experienced problems with people using the estate as a
car park. They want to be able to allow people who need to go there to
park on the estate and to allow people to pass through it if they need
to. However, bearing in mind that an independent, not-for-profit
amenity company runs the estate, they do not want to see their local
roads used as a free car park for commuters intending to travel on
trains via Blackheath station.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I refer to my
earlier point. Given that many of the other stations experiencing
similar problems have parking schemes that will not be affected by the
Bill, will that make the estate a target for car parking, given that it
might be easier for people to obtain free parking there if they can
arrive early enough in the morning to find a
space?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000020">&#160;</a>

that the fact that under this Bill the local authority will be able to

                           </strong> I do, but I wonder about the practicalities of
doing that for this estate. That is the problem—just what
bureaucracy and cost are involved? At the moment, as the Minister
described it, we have barriers at the entrances to the estate, but the
roads are quite wide. It is part of the local road network out of peak
times. So the idea that barriers can be put down on this estate to
enforce the parking scheme is out of the question. The idea that the
local authority will be able to pop down every time the Reverend Scott
or someone points out that there is a car parked on the estate seems to
me to be
impractical.<a class="bkMark" name="11042893000002">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There are barriers at certain exits on the estate,
which are the attractive ones for rat-running. At one of them a
part-time keeper is paid to operate the barrier, so that people
approaching the estate from that direction can gain access. Obviously,
there are people who will need to enter the estate and have a
legitimate reason to be there. That is how it operates; the company is
financed by contributions from residents on the estate. It is an
awkward situation. That demonstrates what is being legislated for here.
For good reasons—to deal with rogue clamping
operators—we are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and there
is an undesired consequence for the Cator estate. The position that the
Government have taken on this particular clause assumes that the
clampers are always the aggressors, but we all know that drivers can
also be intimidating and aggressive. The idea that communities such as
the Cator estate would be able to operate a system that allowed them to
enforce payment of tickets seems strange. They said in evidence that
they accept the need to deal with rogue clampers, but they do not want
to become the victims of rogue drivers who want to abuse the
availability of parking spaces. That clogs up local roads and has a
damaging effect on the community and local

restrictions are enforced by barriers. Unfortunately, some people like
the barriers and some do not. Minicab firms do not like the barriers;
they get free parking for their cabs, but if the barrier is down they
use a club hammer to smash off the padlock. In the real world, placing
restrictions on land by using a barrier does not always work.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000029">&#160;</a>

barrier? There will be no one to release them, because no one is in
charge of the land. Will the car be effectively impounded if there is
no one to release it because a neighbour has put the barrier down? I
can say that it happens, because it happened to me once when I was
canvassing. What responsibility does the landowner have to ensure that
someone is readily available to free a car parked on their land? What
if no number is available? Where will people go to have their cars
released if we allow a proliferation of barriers on private land? Will
cars be effectively

take responsibility for someone else’s vehicle simply because
they own a piece of land, and can move the vehicle and put it on the
public highway seems extraordinary. In the Transport Committee, we had
a long debate about the new technology being put in vehicles—it
is being advertised on TV now—which takes over when the vehicle
gets too close to another vehicle. Who will be responsible for

away and leaves a vehicle on a piece of land for a long time and it
needs to be moved, and a cost is involved in moving it, who will pay

I go on walkabouts with tenants and leaseholders—mainly of

identified is abandoned vehicles. We have more or less eradicated them
now, although I appreciate that that is largely due to the increase in
scrap metal values. Another issue is people parking illegitimately on
somebody else’s land. The council’s response was to hire
a contractor who put up clamping signs across all the bits of land,
saying “If you park here, you will be clamped.” The
problem was solved at very little cost for different pieces of land.
There was no capital investment in barrier after barrier, which frankly
some of the tenants or residents would smash up anyway, because they
cannot be bothered to get out of their car, undo the lock and lift the
barrier. It was a very practical solution; it is cost-effective in many
locations for a local authority to have a private contractor, who is
required to have a high standard of operation, to carry out the
enforcement. The problem disappeared almost completely.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000035">&#160;</a>

local authority to invest huge sums of money in barriers on each piece

lady left her car in a nightclub car park for less than 24 hours. It
was clamped and she found herself paying £320 for it to be

a contrary example, motorists tend to take advantage of Bellfield road
shopping centre. Instead of parking and using the nearby shops, they
walk into town. There was a recent spate of shop owners using clamping

of shop customers, but that created chaos and the fines were

for people to use parking for a purpose other than that for which it is
provided. The hon. Member for Eltham mentioned commuters parking on a
private estate to go to work, which is clearly wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000048">&#160;</a>

of the key concepts to consider is the old phrase “taking a
liberty”. We are here to protect freedom and prevent the taking
of liberties. On the one hand, we have property owners who take the
liberty of drivers to move their vehicles; on the other, we have
drivers who take the liberty of property owners by inconveniencing
their use of their land. Opportunistic parking is, of course, wrong,
and over-eager clamping and grotesque fines, which are followed up by
intimidation, have caused anguish, anger and dismay in my constituency

decently, appropriately, proportionately, and with consideration for

situation of using a freedom Bill to ban the exercise of property
rights. I must support the Government’s action, but it is a

                        <p class="tabbed">This morning,
the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North raised a query about why
we did not enact the previous Government’s provisions on
wheel-clamping. They introduced a raft of further regulation, which
extended the licensing of individual clampers by the Security Industry
Authority. More regulation, however, is exactly what the Government are
trying to stop and curtail while protecting the rights of landowners
and motorists. More important, the real menace and evil—the
intimidation, threats and bullying—would not necessarily have
been affected by such regulation, because it related to matters after
the event. If someone’s vehicle were clamped in a dark car park,
on a dark night, who would be there to help? There might be no way for
them to get home, which would leave them in an impossible and untenable
situation, from which they could not get out in any circumstances. The
menace that we are tackling is the immobilisation of the
vehicle.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000054">&#160;</a>

point to what happened under the Private Security Industry Act 2001 to
clampers operating without a licence. There were 1,700 vehicle
immobiliser licences, but only four prosecutions between 2001 and 2009.
Licensing individuals who were on the spot clamping does not seem to
have been an effective piece of legislation in dealing with the menace
of clamping, bullying and intimidation. The Act gave them all sorts of
regulations to deal with, such as letting the authority know which
company they worked for, their name and those sorts of things.
Increasing bureaucracy and regulation would not deal with the

                           </strong> Yes, regulation can be useful, but in this
case, the first burst of regulation did not help, so a second, third or
fourth burst along those lines would not help to deal with the menace

hon. Lady asked when the ban will be introduced. We will seek to bring
the ban into force as quickly as possible after Royal Assent. With new
criminal offences, the normal practice is to give at least two

commencement.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked whether rogue clampers would not turn into rogue
ticketers. Everyone recognises that there are some issues around
ticketing, but they are the issues that arise in every private car park
throughout the land where there is no private wheel-clamping. Most
private pieces of land are regulated by ticketing. That comes under
consumer protection law. Not everyone uses clamping. When Patrick Troy
from the British Parking Association was giving evidence, he told us
that of the 150 clampers registered with the BPA, only 12 are solely
clampers. The rest do ticketing as well. Those people can normally make
a good living out of
ticketing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000062">&#160;</a>

issue was raised about people returning to their car and being menaced
by five burly people. One can never say never, but the five burly
people would wait an awfully long time for someone to return to their
car. If it had a ticket attached, they would not know when the person
might return and there would be no means of immobilising the
car.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000063">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked about bailiffs. Their activities will not be affected by the ban
when they are carried out with lawful authority. Anything that bailiffs
or anyone else can lawfully do now, they will be able to continue to
do. If they do not have lawful authority now, the Bill will not make
their actions lawful. Lawful authority for bailiffs includes existing
statutory powers, such as the power of certificated bailiffs to
immobilise and remove vehicles for unpaid council or national taxes and
specific powers for bailiffs to enforce debts, including immobilising
or towing away vehicles in relation to debts enforceable under
magistrates court warrants of distress. Bailiffs also have common law
powers to seize and sell goods to recover a sum of money, in the
exercise of which vehicles may be immobilised and towed away.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked for a list of lawful authorities. The following is not an
exhaustive list, but it includes the most typical examples. The police
have an ability under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and
secondary legislation to immobilise and/or remove vehicles on the
public highway, or in other circumstances. Local authorities also have
a power under the 1984 Act, in addition to the Traffic Management Act
2004. Both local authorities and the police have the power to remove
abandoned vehicles from public and private land. Certificated bailiffs
have powers, as I have just said. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency has the power to immobilise or remove vehicles that have no road
tax. The Department for Transport’s Vehicle and Operator
Services Agency may use clamping and towing to prevent the use of
unroadworthy vehicles. The Ministry of Defence may use clamping and
towing on defence lands. Police and local authorities also have a power
in respect of unauthorised Travellers and Traveller encampments
under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Those
are examples of lawful authority to clamp or tow
away.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about costs. Regarding police costs—were they to
be involved—the Association of Chief Police Officers referred to
the amount of time that would be saved if the police did not have to
attend incidents when people were being intimidated by rogue clampers,
investigate them and take them to court. I think there were 700 cases,
but I will have to check that and return to the hon. Lady. ACPO
believes that an immense amount of time would be saved by the banning
of rogue clampers; people will be able to get into their cars, drive
away and pay the ticket in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000066">&#160;</a>

East suggested that people would not know who to turn to if an offence

the cost of police powers to remove vehicles when we discuss them
later. The police are able to charge for clamping or towing, so they
are able to recover their costs. Clamping and towing are normally
contracted out, so it is not actual police time that we are talking
about. At the moment the police contract out for towing away. In small
police areas, something like 3,000 vehicles are towed away—that
does not have anything to do with the changes that we are bringing
in—and in bigger metropolitan areas, just under 30,000 vehicles
are towed away. They are contracted out and charged
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000069">&#160;</a>

saying that if a car receives a ticket, there may possibly be an
additional charge for calling the police to tow the vehicle away. Will
the Minister explain how, as a member of the public and a motorist, I
could understand to whom I was paying money and for what, and whether
there was an appeal procedure in that
process?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000070">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sure that we will come to such matters
in due course, but we are working with ACPO and the British Parking
Association to make it clear where the process will be delineated and
how members of the public will understand who was doing what to them.
Many examples of wheel-clamping will come to hand in a minute, but on
coming back to their car and finding it wheel-clamped, people have been
told to get the money or else. By the time they come back, a towing
charge has been added and they find their car gone, all action having
been done by the same clampers. The provision will not only clarify the
position, but it will be a much fairer and proportionate way of dealing
with matters. We must bear in mind at all times the disproportionate
effect of immobilising a vehicle by wheel-clamping—the
intimidation. Ticketing is a much more proportionate response to a
parking
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked why such activity should not be made an imprisonable
offence, and why the punishment should simply be a fine in a
magistrates court. Even if someone clamped and towed a vehicle
illegally, I would argue that an imprisonable offence for such a
process was disproportionate. Towing and clamping is not worth the
punishment of putting someone in prison. If the wheel clampers were
using intimidation, menace or threat, they would be subject to
indictment and conviction in a court, which might carry a two-year
penalty for menaces—things that are additional to the offence of
clamping and
towing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000072">&#160;</a>

The Cator estate is near a transport junction. Estates that have been
used to wheel-clamping will have to make an adjustment when changing to
either barriers or tickets. While barriers cost money, they are not the
most expensive thing in the world. Let us consider a small business,
for example, with two spaces on a busy high street. Estate agents need
cars near them as they are always showing people houses. However,
perhaps they have had clamping notices until now. At a cost of
£50 each, two collapsible poles that can be raised or lowered
would not be an enormous adjustment for a business. It might take two
seconds longer to raise or lower the barrier, but people must

                           </div>make such judgments themselves. It is not for the Government to
prescribe how landowners should protect their property, but it is for
them to say that they are removing the menace of clamping and its
disproportionate effect on people who are inhibited in going about
their daily business.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
simplest bollards cost less than £50, while the cost of more
robust, removable bollards starts at about £100. The cost of
automatic bollards starts at about £1,400, and the cost of
barriers that can be raised and lowered starts at about £1,000.
Simple outdoor signs start at a cost of about £10. We must add
the cost of the fittings to those appliances, but Edmund King of the
Automobile Association

                           </strong> Indeed. The hon. Gentleman described an
estate with many roads that is near to a transport hub and where there
are some barriers, with a woman or man working part-time who lowers and
raises them, and it has some community amenities. Perhaps that is an
instance where, as is the case with hospitals or universities that
might have not dissimilar issues, a local authority might be interested
to take over the management and running of parking on that estate, if
that could be agreed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A local
authority cannot simply take over, for example, the right to clamp and
tow just because they are lawful authorities. They would have to take
on the entire management of an estate to be able to do that, using the
powers in section 35 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, which
already enables a local authority to take a controlling interest and
run parking on private land by agreement with the landowner.
Furthermore, sections 43 and 44 of that Act enable local authorities to
require all car park operators on the relevant roads or in all parts of
their area to comply with the terms of their licence. Although those
arrangements are not particularly common, they have been used
successfully by local authorities with a good reputation for parking
enforcement. Of course, that would bring such an estate into the system
that people usually experience.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The issue of
clamping by local authorities has arisen, but I wanted to say something
about it anyway. There is a problem with clamping per se. If we look at
clamping in London by local authorities, there are only seven boroughs
in London that now clamp, out of the 32 or so London boroughs. There
were just over 10,000 clampings in 2009-10, which was down from more
than 97,000 clampings in 2005. That is a huge reduction. I venture to
suggest that clamping has brought with it a range of problems even when
it is being done lawfully by local authorities. Most local authorities
use ticketing rather than clamping as a proportionate
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said before, I was on an estate in Islington and the woman I was
calling on was crying—not because I was calling on her.

                           </div>the reason she was crying. The family had not been able to have people
to the funeral and they had “clamp the hearse”-type
stories. I think that that is one of the reasons why local authorities
have decided that clamping is a disproportionate response, even when it
is done with all the rules and all the regulations in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000080">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clamping that is done lawfully is
acceptable. What I hope I am illustrating is that those who are
lawfully authorised to clamp vehicles are finding that clamping is not
an appropriate response and they themselves are choosing not to
wheel-clamp even though they could. That is a very important
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
said that not all wheel-clampers are “rogues” and she
asked why, if we are tackling rogue wheel-clampers, those good,
well-behaved clampers should come into that vernacular. One reason is
the reason I have just given. Secondly, we need to be quite clear about
trying to stop the menace of rogue wheel-clampers. I am sure that that
is why the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux said that a
straightforward ban was absolutely the right way to give people the
legal tools to combat wheel-clamping and to stop the menace of rogue
wheel-clampers, so that there is no doubt that clamping is not
allowed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Then we
discussed the issues relating to people with disabilities. Obviously,
they are important. I am the Minister for Equalities, which I think the
hon. Lady was trying to point out in some way. It is unlikely that even
in the current circumstances clampers will clamp in disabled bays, but
it does and has happened—a point raised by Government
Members.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000084">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> When I looked at the equality column in the
impact assessment document that the officials have produced, I was
struck that there seemed to be no indication that there was an equality
issue here at all. That concerns me, and I am sure that the hon. Lady,
as Minister, is also
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed. My understanding is that, at the
moment, in all those places where they do not have wheel-clamping,
people with disabled bays are nevertheless protected in the same way,
under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. I understand that there
is, therefore, no equalities impact caused by removing wheel-clamping,
because it comes from another piece of legislation, but I will go away
and double-check
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000086">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Can the Minister help me? I am struggling a
little with this. If on an estate there is a disabled bay that is
marked as such because someone with a disability living in a flat there
needs their car nearby, and someone comes along and parks in that bay,
under the Bill the only option is to ticket that vehicle, but that does
not help the disabled person who is potentially trapped in their home
because they cannot get their car close enough to the building. Is that
not an equality impact? I do not suggest that wheel-clamping is the
solution, but that person is left without any
redress.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000087">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is another issue altogether, because we
are removing the power to wheel-clamp a vehicle. If a vehicle that was
parked in that disabled bay

			Column number: 441<a class="bkMark" name="Column441">&#160;</a>
                           </div>was clamped, how would that work? I am simply saying that there is no
impact created by the removal of the clamping ban and that is why, in
the impact assessment, there is no impact of that
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Persistent
offenders was the next item on the hon. Lady’s list. Under
current law, the courts take account of previous convictions when
sentencing, and although it is a matter for the courts one would expect
persistent offenders to be subject to a higher fine. I should think
that a £5,000 fine would make someone think twice about getting
a parking ticket. A Crown court can impose unlimited fines on
conviction on
indictment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Next
on the list was the definition of motor vehicles, and what is done
about caravans. The definition of motor vehicles in subsection (6)
includes trailers and other non-motor vehicles that are towed, and such
vehicles are also included in the ban and are covered by the extension
of police powers to remove vehicles. In addition, they are classed as
vehicles, and can therefore be treated as abandoned vehicles for the
purposes of such legislation. On the issue of how landowners can deal
with caravans or trailers left on their land, if the vehicle is used on
the road the towing vehicle should have a number plate, which enables
the keeper to be traced through the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency. If the vehicle does not have a number plate, it is best if it
is reported to the police, because it is possibly
abandoned.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
Members have made reference to Scotland and, to clarify the position, I
shall do the same. Clamping and towing on private land was effectively
banned by a decision in the Scottish High Court of Justice in 1992.
That was, if you like, a pilot study for what we are doing in England.
I asked officials to look into what had happened in Scotland since the
ban in 1992, since when landowners have had to turn to the other
parking control methods of ticketing and barriers, which we think will
work equally well in England and Wales. The Scottish Government have no
evidence that the ban on clamping and towing in Scotland has caused any
serious problems. For example, they have received only one letter from
the public on the subject in the past 10 years. ACPO Scotland informed
the Home Office that it was unable to find any major issues arising
from the ban on clamping in Scotland. In terms of pilot studies, that
is fairly convincing. I appreciate all the what ifs, and I think it is
right to consider such things, but that is an effective
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about consultation. The previous Government consulted
on the issue. The consultation received 561 responses, and although a
ban was not mentioned as a possibility, more than 100 people
nevertheless asked for one in their response. A YouGov survey in August
2010, after the ban was announced, found that 87% of nearly 800
respondents supported it. In July, the Government also invited the
public, through the website Your Freedom, to suggest ideas for
restoring lost liberties and repealing unnecessary laws—hence
the Bill—and banning wheel-clamping was an issue often
highlighted.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000092">&#160;</a>

not saying to landowners that they cannot protect their land by
barriers, ticketing or any methods used anywhere in the country where
private land is not protected by wheel-clamping. Therefore, although we
understand that the coming in of the change is raising concerns about
how landowners will protect their land, the assurance is that it has

respond to this stand part debate, clause 54 will make it an offence to

the driver or
owner.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000107">&#160;</a>

I have already said, a complete ban on clamping without lawful

causes. The industry has been regulated through the licensing of
individual wheel-clampers by the Security Industry Authority since

licensing would not have addressed the fundamental problem of all
clamping and towing issues, which is that motorists are deprived of the

tackling the fundamental problem that immobilising people in the middle
of their business is disproportionate to a parking offence. We must
tackle that along with the specific abuses, about which we hear much
more—television is delighted to make programmes about them.
Having carefully considered the matter and the previous
Government’s suggestions, we concluded that wheel-clamping and
the towing away of vehicles by private individuals or businesses,
without lawful authority, in order to force payment of a charge is
unacceptable and should be
prohibited.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000118">&#160;</a>

the concerns of some landowners and managers of residential
estates—we have discussed that to try to thrash out how far such

no reason to prevent good car park operators from running their
businesses in that way. An aspect that no hon. Member has raised is the
fact that owners and drivers will be permitted to clamp their own
vehicles to prevent theft, but only on their own land.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000123">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Eltham, for those estates that are rare and exceptional
in their size or proximity or are of a configuration that cannot be
ticketed, that might be an option. It is not a requirement, however; it

Although I heard the what ifs from the hon. Member for Eltham, it began
to sound as though he was in favour of retaining the menace of
wheel-clamping on private land. Licensing has been tried, and failed to
address the abuses. The time has come to take far more decisive action.
The prohibition on clamping has been widely welcomed and will come as a
relief to motorists; I therefore have no hesitation in commending the
clause to the

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Caton. I apologise for my
confusion; I was obviously getting carried away thinking about the
amendments that we have been discussing. I welcome everyone back after
the lunch break—you in particular, because this is the first
time that I have spoken while you have been in the Chair.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 55
will amend section 99 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984,
extending the police’s right to move a vehicle from a highway
and giving them the power to remove vehicles from any piece of land.
According to the explanatory notes, the clause will also enable local
authorities to remove vehicles from any land, again under section 99 of
the 1984 Act. That section also gives the power to remove vehicles to
other bodies, such as the DVLA and other enforcement
agencies.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The important
thing for the Committee to understand is that we are talking about a
power, not a duty. Therefore, whether the police or local authority
wish to remove a vehicle is at their discretion. Again I had a look at
what the Minister said on her website—it is always an
interesting source of information regarding her and the coalition
Government’s thinking. On 17 August, she referred to the police
and their role in dealing with illegal parking on her website. She made
it clear that the police would be involved only in exceptional
circumstances. It is important to recognise that the idea held by
organisations, groups, businesses and residents who might be concerned 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 446<a class="bkMark" name="Column446">&#160;</a>
                           </div>about what will happen if they find that there are vehicles on their
premises or in their driveway—that the police will come down the
road to move the car—is not going to become reality.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What is the
Minister’s view on the pressure that might be put on the police
or on local authorities to deal with particularly persistent rogue
parkers? They are people who park and block driveways or park in spaces
that are connected to flats or are on the estate in the constituency of
my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham, which we have been discussing at
length. What pressure does the Minister think will be put on the police
and local
authorities?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also minded that we spent quite a lot of time on the role of the
police commissioner in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility
Bill. What does the Minister think about that? The issue of parking, as
I am sure all hon. Members will know, can generate a huge amount of
interest and comment from constituents and the public. If we hold a
public meeting about parking, one can guarantee to fill the room,
whereas we probably cannot do that for most public meetings. There is
an issue about whether the police will come under enormous pressure to
use their resources to deal with such problems. Of course, that is
against the backdrop of the cuts to the police service. We know that
they will have to deal with 20% cuts over the next few
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is also a question about the local authorities’ role in the
matter. We all know, from our own local authorities, the financial
pressures that they are under. I am not sure that they will want to get
involved in expensive removals of vehicles from private land. Will the
Minister comment on what evidence she has, perhaps from the Local
Government Association or any other local authority group, about their
feeling and how they think it will work in
practice?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
there is persistent parking in a small car park adjacent to a GP
surgery, will that be given a higher priority because it is a GP
practice rather than, say, a sheltered housing block where rogue
parkers have parked in disabled bays? I am just trying to get a sense
from the Minister of how she thinks the clause will work in practice
and what priority will be given to different
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">During
an evidence session in the beginning of the Bill’s proceedings,
I asked the ACPO representative, Mr Sims, about the costs of
removing a vehicle. Unfortunately, he was not able to answer me and I
have not heard from him since about the cost. I am interested to know
the Minister’s view about the cost that is likely to be levied
on the individual vehicle owner for the removal of a vehicle by the
police or the local authority. In one of our earlier debates, we
discussed what would happen if there was genuinely a sense that
removing a vehicle was inappropriate or wrong. Is there any right of
appeal? Is there any mechanism that the individual motorist can use to
challenge the fact that the police or local authority were called to
remove their vehicle? That is one
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000140">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also interested in what the RAC has produced on this issue. It
posted an article on the <em>Which?</em> website about the
Government’s proposals. The comments in response to that posting
showed that the general public 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 447<a class="bkMark" name="Column447">&#160;</a>
                           </div>felt that the police would not be in a position to be interested in
being called out to deal with what is basically nuisance parking. So
the general public take the view that this measure will give them very
little protection as private
landowners.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
also want to ask about the issue of double ticketing. Patrick Troy and
Edmund King discussed it in our evidence sessions. If the police remove
a vehicle, they will charge the owner £150 to get the vehicle
back. In the first instance, the vehicle may also have been issued with
a ticket by the landowner. So there a double liability kicks in there.
I have already raised with the Minister the issue of appealing the cost
of removing a vehicle, but can she go into a little more detail about
how there will be clarity for the motorist about how all these things
will fit together? I know she said there would be a public education
programme prior to the enactment of these provisions, but what exactly
does that mean?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think the
Minister is genuinely in some difficulty, because it is really quite
complicated for the public to understand the difference between public
and private land. Often, people understand that with the public highway
there are rights of appeal and other things that they can do to
challenge decisions if they feel that a ticket was not issued properly.
But as I understand it from reading the provisions in later clauses,
under this scheme there will be no right of appeal, so I think people
will be very confused. It would be helpful to learn from the Minister
how she intends to carry out a public education campaign. What
resources will be allocated to it? How does she envisage that the whole
thing will pan
out?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000143">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To respond to the hon. Lady’s main
concern about the cost of removing vehicles by the police or local
authorities, parking is ultimately a civil and not a criminal matter. I
am absolutely sure that both the police and local authorities are quite
capable of resisting any pressure put on them to use the new power in
clause 55 inappropriately. The new power relates only to vehicles that
have been parked illegally, obstructively or dangerously.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Moreover, it
is not for the Government to set police priorities. That is for local
communities and the new police and crime commissioners. The issue that
the hon. Lady raises is appropriate, but it will be up to the local
police and crime commissioner in an area to deal with it. In a debate
on an earlier clause, we discussed how seriously the police will take
these matters. There will be a police and crime commissioner and, as
the hon. Lady said, parking is something that gets people stirred up.
Certainly every time that parking controls are raised as an issue in my
area of Haringey, we get great attendance at council meetings compared
with discussions of other issues that might be viewed as more serious.
That issue will come into play, but there will be pressure to execute
the law. The law is clear: the powers are extended to the police for
use in emergencies at their discretion. That it is not a duty but an
operational matter is crucial and is welcomed by ACPO. It will be for
the police to decide what the circumstances are. In my mind, they are
exactly the circumstances that were raised by Opposition Members, such
as when a vehicle is blocking an emergency exit and an emergency
vehicle cannot get through. It is not a local, friendly, tow-away
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000145">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I appreciate what the Minister is saying and I am
listening carefully. What would her expectation be in the particular
instance I outlined? If someone has a disabled parking bay outside
their property, a rogue parker parks in it, and ticketing has been
tried and does not work, would the police take that as an exceptional
circumstance where they would get
involved?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000146">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The hon. Lady raises a good point, which has
been recognised. ACPO will produce guidance for the police, which will
help police forces decide in which circumstances it is appropriate to
use the extended power. It is not for the Government to second-guess
what the police might come up with as their list of priorities, but it
is certainly something the hon. Lady could write to ACPO about. As we
have discussed with the police, it is important that the guidance is
clear to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have recognised that some landowners will have concerns. I have
referred to the pilot in Scotland, where people were used to having
wheel-clamping as the deterrent, and these issues have been tried and
tested. Landowners feel that a ban on clamping and towing will make it
more difficult for them to effectively enforce parking control. They
fear what might happen without that deterrent. We understand and
acknowledge their fears that the provisions will reduce the options
available to them to protect their land, but we point them to the pilot
in Scotland. To help meet their concerns, I expect the police to use
the powers in limited circumstances, where they believe that there is
an operational imperative, such as an emergency, or where a vehicle is
dangerously parked or obstructing something
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have said, we have consulted ACPO about the plan. It welcomed the
intention that the extended powers are expected to be exercised with
discretion, not as a duty. It indicated that it would expect police
forces to respond in the light of the circumstances of each incident
and available resources, but that it was likely that police forces
would attend when they thought there was risk of harm. For example, the
police may decide to tow away a vehicle blocking a hospital accident
and emergency entrance, or an office’s fire exit. The guidance
produced by ACPO for the police will lay out those
priorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We do not
expect these provisions to place a large burden on the police. Any
increase in the work of the police through pursuing cases against
illegal immobilisers should be offset, as we discussed earlier, first,
by the repeal of the existing offences in the Private Security Industry
Act 2001 relating to unlicensed clampers and, secondly, by removing the
burden arising from the investigation of cases involving clamping and
towing incidents. In addition, landowners and their parking agents and
managers will be legally able to move a vehicle parked on their private
land, as long as their intention is not to prevent the vehicle owner
from removing it, which should help keep down the number of
requests.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions will be a useful addition to the armoury of tools available
to deal with inconsiderate drivers who park their vehicles without
consideration for others. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe
says, it would be a wonderful world if everyone was polite and did not
park where they should not, but, sadly, it is not the world that we
live in. I am always a bit of an optimist, however. I do not want to
give the impression

                           </div>that the police will use these powers routinely to remove obstructively
or dangerously parked vehicles. Only in cases of real need will they be
able to act. The clause will give them the means to do

Again, I looked at what the Minister was saying on her website, on 27
August this time, when  she commented that ticketing was highly
regulated and 
<div class="columnNumber">

as a good deterrent.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
clearly some confusion. I think the Minister was referring to the
appeals procedure for parking tickets issued on the public highway.
That is right; people can take forward any appeal they feel is
legitimate when they have been issued with a parking ticket. I think
all hon. Members would feel that to be able to appeal in that way is
fair and sensible and complies with natural justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000163">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
105 and 106 would introduce a clause that was in the Crime and Security
Act 2010, about which we have heard a lot. We know that the previous
Government, rather than banning wheel-clamping, were intending to
introduce a whole series of regulations about what could happen when a
vehicle was clamped. One of the specific regulations to be introduced
was a right of appeal, which was devised after significant consultation
with stakeholders. The right of appeal was supported in the written
evidence the British Parking Association submitted to the Committee and
also by the AA in its written submission.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Home
Office impact assessment looked at the estimate for the introduction of
an appeal procedure. The Minister has already said that the cost of
setting it up would be £2 million. I seek clarification from
her, but as I understand it the £2 million would include the
licensing provisions within the Crime and Security Act, as well as the
appeals process. I am informed by some of the key stakeholders that
setting up a stand-alone appeals process—leaving aside the
regulation on licensing that was in the Crime and Security Act and just
dealing with an appeals process—could be self-funding from the
organisations that would be involved in the ticketing process that the
Bill would promote and introduce.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000165">&#160;</a>

is perceived to be a fair system. That certainly is something that we
would support.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,

                        <p class="tabbed">We
tabled amendments 105 and 106 to give the Government the opportunity to
look at the implementation of an independent appeals procedure. I know
that the Minister is keen on fairness and being seen to be fair. There
might be all sorts of reasons why people dispute tickets being put on
their vehicles, but it would not strike ordinary members of the public
as fair if they were unable to appeal against such action. The hon.
Lady also referred to action that is proportionate, but how
proportionate is it just to be landed with a
ticket?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have failed to regulate the amount of the penalty that the
ticket company can charge the vehicle owner. For example, there is
nothing to stop a ticket company putting a penalty notice of
£500 on a car. The hon. Lady will probably talk about
enforcement and the BPA, and the fact that only businesses that are
members of an accredited trade association can go to

                           </div>the DVLA, but she will also be aware of the statistics and the number of
people who pay up front without arguing. They might well feel
intimidated and consider that they have no choice but to
pay.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Home Office’s impact assessment states that, at present, when
there is no regulator or keeper liability, 75% of wheel-clamping
tickets are paid. Most people just pay up and, with a ticketing regime,
that percentage will probably remain about the same. The British
Parking Association estimates that 40% of tickets are paid on the spot
and that people may well think they have to pay at that stage. As I
have said, Edmund King referred in his evidence to the fact that, under
a wheel-clamping system, a ticketing business could have four burly
people who demand £500 with menaces, which might intimidate
people into paying the fee that they are asked to
meet.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Home Office impact assessment estimates that 90% of tickets will be
paid under the new ticketing scheme. Even more people will therefore be
paying straightaway, so is it not a problem that there is no right of
appeal as well as no figure for what the ticketing company can charge?
The RAC and the Ipsos MORI poll that it conducted last year found that
77% of the general public were in favour of an appeal system for
penalty tickets issued on private land. On that basis, amendments 105
and 106 need to be considered by the Government, given their support
for fairness and doing the right thing for motorists and
landowners.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 13 would increase the regulation of ticketers. I make no apology
for it because most people think it sensible for there to be some limit
on what a parking ticketing company can charge. The new clause would
make it a criminal offence if excessive charges were issued by
ticketing companies. To protect themselves, ticketing companies would
need to be members of an accredited trade organisation such as the
British Parking Association, and there would have to be a right of
appeal to an independent appeals procedure. The appeals process also
needs to be set out clearly on the ticket when
issued.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause allows the Secretary of State to issue a regulation giving a
maximum fee under which parking charges would not be illegal, giving
companies protection to carry out their business. Thus, the Secretary
of State could say that charges of less than £20 are fine, for
example, but anyone wanting to extract a greater fee must comply with
the regulations on being a member of an accredited trade association
and having an independent appeals procedure. The regulations could be
quite detailed and could also set out exemptions where appropriate, for
example with regard to long stays or for larger
vehicles.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
would also argue that the penalties should be the same as they are for
the provisions on wheel-clamping and immobilisation in clause 54. That
would protect motorists, in particular vulnerable drivers who might be
subject to intimidating tactics from ticketers. It would stop rogue
clampers from migrating to become rogue ticketers, which I think most
people accept could be a problem. It would place restrictions on
ticketing aimed at generating income rather than solely protecting
property and preventing nuisance parking. Edmund King said in his
evidence that there was a lot of money to be generated by setting
oneself up as a ticketing company and offering 10% of the ticketing fee
to the landowner. The new clause would place a strong incentive on
landowners to 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>minimise car-parking costs and ticket fees. It would be a simple system,
with the onus on the ticketer to become accredited. It would offer
protection to motorists and ensure that they are treated fairly by any
ticketing company. I would like to test the Committee’s opinion
on amendment 106 and new clause
13.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000174">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich East has set out some clear
protections for motorists in new clauses 7 to 9, which are also in the
group, regarding parking signage, an appeals process and what is on the

keeper—a topic that we will come on to in schedule 4. The

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have tabled a series of amendments and new clauses that I hope the
Minister will take as helpful. My main problem with the clause and
schedule 4 is that I understand them to be trying to put contractually
based car parking on private land on a parity with parking on a road by
making the registered keeper liable, except that all the protections
that a driver has when they park on a road are not introduced. For
example, all local authorities provide a free and independent appeals
process for motorists, and it happens to be that 87% of those appeals
are upheld. There is a fear—this is a concern of Members on both
sides of the Committee—that rogue clampers will just become
rogue ticketers once clamping is banned. Therefore we need a
comprehensive system of free and independent appeals. It is vital that
the sector aims to tackle rogue parking companies, whatever way they
choose to subvert the rules.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The intention
of the new clauses is to create some straightforward rules. People need
basic information. Drivers need to know what is going on, and parking
companies need to supply that information so that both parties have a
clear understanding of the contract they are making. There is no
regulator for the sector, so it is important to include that element in
the Bill. The level of detail in the new clauses offers clear guidance
and matches the level of information that the Bill currently
acknowledges is necessary for parking notices under clause 56 and
schedule
4.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, to deliver the Government’s objective to deal with
unscrupulous parking businesses, the Bill must make it clear what
drivers will be required to pay. As that is a contractual matter, and
not a fine—as would be the case on a public
highway—charges should not be used as a punishment. The Bill
must ensure that the fee for breaking parking rules on private land is
not a random sum chosen by the parking business that bears no relation
to the losses
suffered.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
tabled new clauses 7 and 8 because there is a significant risk that
once clamping and towing have been banned, clampers will move to
ticketing, which 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 455<a class="bkMark" name="Column455">&#160;</a>
                           </div>makes it vital that sufficient protections are put in place for
motorists. That is not only my view, as other Members have said. In his
oral evidence to the Committee, Mr Troy, chief executive of
the British Parking Association,
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
big risk with the legislation as it is phrased is that rogue clampers
will simply become rogue ticketers if we do not address that wider
issue at the same time.”—[<em>Official Report, Protection
of Freedoms Public Bill Committee, </em>24 March 2011; c. 144,

                        <p>Citizens
Advice, Consumer Focus and the Trading Standards Institute have similar
concerns. Since the ban on clamping and towing was announced, citizens
advice bureaux have already reported that they are seeing an increase
in clients seeking advice after receiving demands for large sums for
parking
breaches.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Charges
for even minor infringements of parking conditions, such as staying a
few minutes over the allotted time or making a mistake, are
often disproportionately high and do not relate to the actual loss
suffered by the car park operator. Signage is poor and the legal basis
on which some of the charges are claimed is unclear. Hon. Members on
both sides of the Committee have said that inappropriate or poor
signage comes up at their advice surgeries. Large sums are claimed
where parking charges and so-called penalty notices are sent to vehicle
keepers. Those charges can mirror charges levied when vehicles have
been clamped or
towed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, parking operators must be able to enforce the legitimate terms
and conditions of the service they offer, but parking charges issued by
private car-parking operators often do not represent the actual loss
suffered by the operator when a motorist overstays or otherwise
breaches the terms of a contract. As such, the charges are
disproportionately high and unreasonable and have not been subject to a
court decision as to their validity. There is a danger that once the
ban on clamping comes into force, rogue parking operators will simply
fail to provide sufficient information on signage and continue to
impose disproportionate
charges.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
proposed new clause 7 would place a legal obligation on parking
operators to provide clear information to the parking public about the
terms of the contract that they are entering into, and provide drivers
with information about how much they will be charged and any costs they
might face if they overstep the terms of the contract. I also propose
that signage must include full name and contact details, including a
geographical address for the business offering the contract to park, so
that if drivers want to dispute a decision they have a way of
contacting the company that issued the
fine.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Private
parking companies should make parking work well for the landowner and
their customers, but all too often they just stand by and watch people
make mistakes, and ramp up fees and make themselves scarce when a
driver needs to speak to them or query a notice. For example, CAB in
Oxfordshire recently reported seeing a client who parked his car for
five minutes while he collected a letter. He returned to his car and
found it clamped, and the operator demanded a payment of £320 to
release
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
currently drafted, the clause does not contain any regulation of
signage or proportionate claims for breaches of parking contract rules,
and that should be addressed. My suggested new clause 8 is intended to
ensure that any driver who receives a fine for a breach of contract
knows exactly what it is for. Too often, the first thing drivers know
of any problem is when they receive a debt 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 456<a class="bkMark" name="Column456">&#160;</a>
                           </div>collection notice through the post, for a significant sum of money. In
my own region of the west midlands, the CAB was advised that a man
received a debt collection letter claiming £197 for an alleged
parking infringement two months earlier. The car park was owned by a
firm that also owned the building where the client worked. He had a
permit to park there, which he had displayed. He assured the bureau
that had he received earlier communication, he would have sorted it out
at
once.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000188">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am simply suggesting that if a parking company wants to levy a charge
on a driver who has broken the terms of a car park’s contract,
it must issue the person with a notice, explaining what the charge is
for, in order to show that it is proportionate, and how to pay it. In
schedule 4, which we will debate later, the Government have already
stipulated that any company seeking to claim unpaid parking charges
from the registered keeper of a vehicle must meet those conditions. All
I am suggesting is that those same protections be extended to the
driver to whom the company is issuing the charge in the first instance.
In the Bill as drafted, registered vehicle keepers will have extra
protections that drivers do not, when a parking company is pursuing
them for unpaid
charges.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 9 would ensure that there is an independent complaints process
for consumers who believe that a charge has been applied unfairly. If
people receive a parking ticket from their local authority they have
access to an independent appeals process. It is not unreasonable that
they have access to a similar appeals process if they park in a private
car park.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The BPA code
of practice requires its members to have an in-house appeals process,
but as I have mentioned, there is nothing to compel parking operators
to join the BPA and the code does not require BPA approval of a
member’s internal processes for disputes and appeals. The
alternative dispute resolution process I have in mind need not be
hugely expensive to set up, but should, as is the norm in other sectors
such as utilities and financial services, be paid for by the businesses
of that sector. It must be independent, must be available to anybody
from whom a parking charge is claimed and must meet a set of criteria.
That framework of criteria is normally put in place in other markets
where ADR is available and is already in place, such as the estate
agency sector, where the Office of Fair Trading drew up the criteria.
In this sector, the Secretary of State may find the Department for
Transport to be the most relevant
body.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Along
with criteria, the costs for setting up an ADR process and ongoing
costs would need to be considered. While that would be a matter for the
Secretary of State, I want to give an example of how it might be
structured, so that hon. Members can be alert to at least one option of
how ADR might be paid for.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The DVLA is
the access point used by parking businesses to obtain a name and
address for the parking charge claim, where that is sent in the post.
The driver should remain the only party against whom a valid claim can
be legally made. We will return to that point later. The DVLA is the
only point of access to a name and address relating to the vehicle that
has parked. As such, it is already pivotal to claims made for parking
charges. The DVLA currently claims a fee for releasing vehicle keeper 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 457<a class="bkMark" name="Column457">&#160;</a>
                           </div>details to a parking business, which covers its costs. An additional fee
could be levied at the same time to pay for setting up the ADR scheme.
In that way, all businesses using the DVLA would contribute.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, a fee could be charged for each case so that the business
involved pays. That is common practice. For example, the Financial
Ombudsman Service uses it. The DVLA would then be informed when its own
rules for access to keeper details are being abused. That issue was
recently raised in an episode of BBC’s “Watchdog”,
which featured several cases of unfair treatment of drivers. The
reputation of the DVLA and businesses in this sector would be restored.
For the businesses, ADR would be a cheaper option than taking each of
their cases to court. Drivers would be able to rely on fair treatment,
as they currently can for parking appeals relating to the public
highway.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All drivers
for whom a parking charge is claimed need access to an alternative
dispute resolution system if they contend that they have not breached
the parking conditions or believe that they have been asked to pay an
unreasonable amount. The parking business might not make use of
registered keeper information purchased from the DVLA, because only BPA
members can access such information, and as we know, not all parking
operators are members. Nevertheless, such operators should contribute
to the cost of providing the ADR system, and case charges would need to
reflect that. That option could represent a solution to the need to
have an ADR system that does not place further burden on the public
purse.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000195">&#160;</a>

North and for West Bromwich East have said, the amendments and new
clauses seek to provide further regulation of ticketing as a method of
parking enforcement. They are predicated on a fear that rogue clampers
will turn into rogue ticketers, and that the measure will encourage
disreputable elements in the parking industry to switch from clamping
to ticketing, adopting the same strong-arm tactics.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000196">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
return to that point because the amendments and new clauses are about
ticketing regulation and not simply about the removal of the menace.
The proposals to make a better world for the regulation of ticketing,
rights of appeal, fairness to drivers and so on are all part of the
desire to ensure that redress can be gained. The hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull North began 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 458<a class="bkMark" name="Column458">&#160;</a>
                           </div>by saying that there was nowhere to go with an appeal ticket, but it is
not true that nothing can be done. If a driver does not pay, a
landowner can go to court under consumer protection legislation.
Opposition Members have spoken as though the situation does not already
exist—as though contractors who are not members of the BPA do
not already ticket, but they do. The current consumer protection law
protects pieces of land. If landowners wish to operate parking controls
and charge for parking, they must comply with consumer protection law
and put up clear signs.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People
are concerned about the amount that could be charged in such
circumstances. The charge will be limited to what is on the sign and
limited by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. It
is therefore simply not true that there will be no protection—as
currently—for consumers on privately owned land when landowners
have contracted out the rights to ticket or clamp to a parking company.
There will be protection, because if there is signage, the companies
are liable. A contract has been entered into if a car is parked on that
land and accepts the terms and conditions that are posted. If the signs
are not visible, are not there or do not state what they should state,
the companies will be found against under the consumer protection
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000201">&#160;</a>

constituency of Hull there are signs stating that people will be
wheel-clamped in a certain car park for which the release fee is
£250, and if the car is towed away, the amount to pay is
£400. I understand that such action is completely legal. Is the
Minister saying that, under a new ticketing regime, the same sign could
be shown? Obviously, the company cannot wheel-clamp, but it could say
that if car owners do not comply with the parking conditions on a
certain site, they will have to pay a penalty of £250. Is the
hon. Lady arguing that that could
happen?<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000202">&#160;</a>

clampers into ticketers about whom the Minister has left comments on

                           </strong> Not at this point. I am considering
important matters. I am not denigrating the idea but—to answer
the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North—I
am saying that, under current consumer law, there is protection. People
cannot charge anything they like. The question for the Government and
the Committee in considering the amendments is whether the current law
as it applies to parking and ticketing is insufficient or sufficient to
deal with the worries that have arisen about inadequate signage and
excessive charges. That is what we are currently
debating.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
we also have to weigh up whether the abuses are such that they justify
putting in place the raft of Opposition proposals. The amendments and
new clauses, which refer to the earlier Administration’s
uncommenced legislation, are typical of the last Government’s
approach, which was all about regulation and legislation. While the
hon. Member for West Bromwich East may say that it is unreasonable to
say that the Opposition had 13 years to put things in place, if the

question why that was not done. This Government are absolutely
determined to reduce regulatory burdens. Where regulation is needed, we
will make it, and where it would be excessive, we will not go forward

                           </strong> I should be grateful if the Minister could
explain the following point, so that I can tell my constituents in
Hull. If someone parks on a highway and gets a parking ticket, they
have the right to go through an independent appeals process. However,
if they park 10 yards down the road on private land and get a ticket
under the Bill’s provisions, that is it; they have no right of
redress through an appeals process. My constituents would genuinely
feel that if they had a grievance and a point to appeal on, they should
be allowed to pursue it, irrespective of whether the parking was on a
public highway or a private piece of
land.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000217">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Moving on to
the substance of the matter, rather than unnecessary arguments, we need
to monitor carefully the impact of the ban on wheel-clamping. However,
in the absence of evidence that the ban will lead to a new breed of
rogue ticketers who intimidate vulnerable motorists, I cannot commend
the amendments and new clauses to the Committee. We need to see the
effects of the ban. We have looked at the pilot in Scotland, and
frankly there has not been evidence that revealed the sort of problems
that Opposition Members are saying will
arise.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is not to say that I do not have some sympathy with certain elements of
the amendments. Indeed, we should be flattered, because in some
respects they borrow from the provisions in schedule 4. We recognise
that in relation to the enforcement of parking on private land, the
keeper liability provisions in the schedule represent a new departure,
which the hon. Member for West Bromwich East mentioned earlier, when he
asked why a keeper should have liability with local authorities when a
driver has the right of appeal, as is the case now. It is a hybrid
situation, which we will discuss when we come to the stand part debate
for schedule 4. It is right to have safeguards for vehicle keepers, if
we are bringing them into the
frame.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
order for the vehicle keeper to be held liable for unpaid parking
charges, certain conditions will have to be met. Some of those
conditions touch on the issues covered in the amendments. For example,
I draw the Committee’s attention to the second condition
detailed in paragraph 6 of schedule 4. It requires that a notice must
be given to the driver of a vehicle who is deemed by the parking
provider to be in breach of contract and therefore liable for unpaid
parking charges. That notice must, among other things, describe the
circumstances in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 461<a class="bkMark" name="Column461">&#160;</a>
                           </div>which the contract was formed. To do that, the parking provider will
need to be able to point to signs in the parking area that give details
of the contractual terms and conditions. If such signage is inadequate,
the parking provider may not be able to establish, on the balance of
probability, that a contract has been entered into by the driver. The
notice also has to inform them of any arrangements for the resolution
of disputes or complaints available to the driver; in effect, an
appeals
mechanism.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000223">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments highlight the importance of the existence of such an appeals
process when a motorist or registered keeper of a vehicle feels that
the parking charge is unwarranted. That is the issue that has been
raised: “It’s not fair. Who can I go to?” I fully
understand hon. Members’ concerns, but I offer my reassurance
that the Government share the desire to see an effective system for
resolving disputes, and paragraph 6(2)(e) of schedule 4 is key to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000226">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North raised the issue of trade
associations. The Government are working with the British Parking
Association, which is currently the only accredited trade association
in the field, to ensure that a robust and independent mechanism for
handling disputes will be established. We are working closely with the
BPA on how that system will be established and funded, and I offer this
assurance: we will not commence schedule 4 unless and until a
satisfactory disputes resolution procedure is in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000227">&#160;</a>

believe that working closely with the trade association in the
establishment of the process will be better, because it will ensure the
development of a fair system and will not impose the heavy weight of
additional governmental regulation on the industry or cost on the

suggested by Opposition

                           </strong> This is a very interesting point. Keeper
liability kicks in only if a ticket is not paid, when the parking
company, if it is part of an accredited trade association, can go to
the DVLA and get information about the keeper. The Minister is failing
to address the problem that, as I understand it from the statistics in
the Home Office impact assessment, if people drive on to private land
and are given a ticket, either 75% or 90% of them will pay. It does not
matter who the keeper is; the ticket is given to the driver, and it
will be paid without the need for enforcement action. My point is why
should a company bother to join an accredited trade association if it
will get the bulk of its money from Joe Public? People will not have to
give their keeper information; they will just pay the company, because
it intimidates them or charges them huge fines, and they are
worried.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000235">&#160;</a>

those rogue elements to become part of an accredited trade association,
so that they can get the extra percentage. The rest will be governed by
consumer law, and they may not receive anything because if someone

                        <p class="tabbed">To
return to what I was saying before the last round of interventions, we
believe that working closely with the trade association will set up a
fair system. As I said, the Government believe that business is the
driver of economic growth and innovation. We need to cut red tape, not
to introduce the huge swathes of regulation proposed by Opposition
Members. We accept the need for some additional safeguards in the
circumstances provided for in schedule 4. That is because it is a
hybrid. We are cutting across the usual contractual relationship
between the driver and the parking provider. In transferring liability
for unpaid parking charges to the keeper when the driver is unknown, we
need to ensure that proper protections are afforded to vehicle keepers.
As I have said, beyond that change, the Government remain to be
persuaded that the ban on wheel-clamping in itself justifies moving
away from the normal operation of contract law in this area. We will
keep the position under review and are ready to consider hard evidence
of serious abuses, so as to justify statutory regulation. For now,
however, I invite the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North to
withdraw the amendment, although I understand that the hon. Lady wishes
to press one amendment in the group to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000242">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to test the opinion of the Committee on
amendment 106. Amendment 105 is a small amendment, but amendment 106 is
where the meat is. At the appropriate time, I also want to press new
clause 13 to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am extremely disappointed by the Minister’s response. It is
important to recognise that the issues we are discussing
today—on signage and the level of penalty that can be
imposed—are the very things that the rogue wheel-clampers did
not do properly either. The signage that wheel-clampers put up is often
small and does not have all the information that a driver would need to
know exactly what they were letting themselves in for. Those are the
very points that people wanted to contribute to the consultation that
brought forward regulation under the Crime and Security Act 2010. The
Minister is making a big mistake by not identifying at this stage that
some of the tactics used by the rogue wheel-clamping companies will
transfer to rogue ticketing
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Rather
than waiting, we have an opportunity to deal with the issue at the
outset, to ensure that there is proper signage, that the penalty fees
proposed by the companies are not excessive and are regulated and that
consumers are treated fairly and properly. When the Bill becomes law, I
am sure we will all see rogue wheel-clamping companies turn themselves
into ticketing companies. It is naive not to expect that those
companies will work on the basis that they get the bulk of their income
from the general public being intimidated, feeling that they have to
pay a fee up front, because they do not have a proper appeal process.
That is the big problem. We are not learning the lessons of what
happened with wheel-clamping. This is an opportunity to accept
amendments that have the support of the general public; they want a
clear appeals procedure, which is open to them if they want to pursue a
claim. Consumer law has not protected the motorist on wheel-clamping
and the provisions on signage and fee level, so I doubt it will offer
the protection that the Minister thinks it
will.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000245">&#160;</a>

that there will be problems. If they are not addressed in the Bill,
coalition Government Ministers will have to deal with them in the

such work day in, day out—as well as home owners, flat owners

about removing the menace of rogue wheel-clampers. I asked the
Committee at the beginning to concentrate on that. No one is saying
that there will be no issues with ticketing, but the Bill will remove
what has been an unacceptable and threatening scar on the business of
parking. It is not that there will not be problems with ticketing, and
we are listening and addressing those issues. What I am saying about

                           </strong> I shall be brief, because we have exhausted the
issues that arise from clause 56 and subsequently from schedule 4.
However, I again wish to raise with the Minister concerns about keeper
liability, given that there is no proper mechanism for that keeper to
have recourse to an appeal procedure. That is the fundamental problem
with schedule 4.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
discussed at length what happens on the public highway and the formal
appeals that are available in that context to vehicle keepers in terms
of their liability. It is just unfortunate that the Minister is
creating this anomaly, whereby the keeper of a vehicle that is parked
on private land has no formal recourse if enforcement action is taken.
There are all sorts of issues about contractual obligations that are
entered into by drivers and private landowners, and how they affect the
keeper of a vehicle. I am sure that they will be open to

                           </div>legal challenge and will keep many of our legal friends very busy for
some time. I ask the Minister to consider carefully the effect of
schedule 4 in terms of the lack of natural justice of giving a
responsibility to the vehicle keeper without giving them any rights to
deal with ticketing that may have been used inappropriately, and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000281">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
refer to Edmund King again. He talked about the example of a car that
had entered a McDonald’s car park and then exited, but somehow
it had been registered on the CCTV system that the car had never
exited. Consequently the owner of the car—the vehicle
keeper—was sent a ticket for the 41 days that the car had
apparently been parked in the car park. Under the system set out in the
Bill, there would be no right of appeal for that vehicle keeper and I
want the Minister to respond to that particular case, because it seems
a graphic example of how there would be unfairness in the system. How

companies and what happens if the vehicle that is ticketed is being
hired at the time, the same provisions apply to a vehicle hire company
as to any keeper. A vehicle hire company is in a good position to
obtain payment from the hirer via the credit card details that the
hirer provided when hiring the vehicle. So the person hiring the
vehicle will be caught by that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000284">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A landowner
has the right to protect his or her land from uninvited
parking—that is, trespass—or, if they choose, to make
that land available to the public for parking on whatever terms and
conditions he or she considers appropriate, given that it is private
land, as long as those conditions comply with the law. As we discussed
earlier, a £250 charge might well be considered disproportionate
under consumer protection law. As long as there is no lawful authority
to do so, once the provisions in clause 54 are in effect the landowner
will not be able to immobilise or remove a vehicle if it has not been
left in accordance with terms that are clearly signed on the
land.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000288">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As for the
keeper liability point, the Government have listened to the concerns of
landowners that the removal of the ban on clamping and towing away will
leave them more vulnerable to abuse by motorists. While the situation
to date has been that private land is in that position, we have
listened to the concerns expressed following the announcement of the
intention to ban clamping and towing, and we agree that the landowner
does need to be able to protect his land from trespass and to enforce
the terms and conditions on which the land is made available for
parking, either to the general public, or to a section of the public,
such as customers or people with special requirements such as people
with blue badges, to whom the hon. Lady referred, or to people who have
paid a fee—whatever the condition
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have therefore decided that a landowner or their agent
should have the right to hold the keeper of the vehicle responsible, so
that there is an ultimate backstop to a non-paying driver who just
drives off; and it is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that
that person is the registered keeper and will be liable for any unpaid
charges for which the driver would have been liable, if they are unable
or unwilling to identify the driver. The keeper may, of course, have
been the driver, but currently in many circumstances it is not possible
for the landowner to trace the driver, and if keepers deny that they
were the driver at the time, whether they were or were not, and refuse
to say who was driving at the time, the landowner has no means of
recourse.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
it is important to note that the keeper will be liable only in certain
circumstances. Those circumstances are important and they are clearly
set out in the schedule. As for how the keeper would know, we would
expect adequate information to be provided to the keeper. Where the
parking provider seeks to pursue the keeper for unpaid parking charges,
that would be part of what has to be provided to the keeper when
explaining the reason for the charge. After we have finished our
proceedings in Committee, we shall reflect on whether we need to say
more about such matters in the
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000291">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
wish to set out the circumstances set out in the schedule. Under
paragraph 1, the driver of the vehicle would have been required to pay
the parking-related charges because of a contract, whether implicit or
explicit. That means that the provisions can only apply to two types of
case. The first kind of case is where there is a contract that permits
the parking, whether or not for a charge, and which sets out the terms,
including any charge for overstaying. An example would be,
“Parking beyond 2 hours attracts a £100 charge”.
The second kind of case in schedule 4 is intended to cover
circumstances where parking is not permitted at all and there is a
clear sign to that effect, which also states what the charge will be
for unauthorised parking or trespass, such as “No parking is
allowed—fee £100 for unauthorised parking”. The
provisions of the schedule cannot be used where there is no sign at
all. That remains a matter for the law of
tort.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000292">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraphs
2 and 3 define the terms used in the schedule. The
circumstances are set out further in paragraph 3(3), because
existing provisions, such as those in the Traffic Management Act 2004
and the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, already impose a liability
for parking, and under those provisions, a vehicle keeper is liable
for

would be unnecessary where the circumstances are already covered by
other legislation. Paragraph 3(3) sets out where the schedule will not
apply because circumstances are already covered by current

keeper to show that that was the case. Sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) state
how the keeper may prove that a vehicle is stolen. Paragraph 4 also
provides that landowner may recover only the amount set out in the
notice to the driver, so they cannot up the ante by the time they get
to the driver. Paragraph 4 states that the rights of the landowner, or
his or her agent, as set out in schedule 4, do not affect any other
remedy that the landowner or the agent has to recover the amount due,
but the landowner may recover the amount only
once.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000296">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are aware
that one of the concerns about the schedule, which has also been raised
today, is that it does not provide for an independent body to which
motorists may turn for redress if they are unhappy about the way in
which the landowner, or his agent, has dealt with the matter. The
Government share that concern but are not convinced that such a body
should be statutory, and consider that it is not right for them to
establish such a body at the expense of the
taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is pretty common, throughout the commercial sector, to have a
sector-wide body, which all responsible members of the sector support
financially, as Opposition Members have said, and whose decisions they
abide by. That is exactly what is happening in the parking sector; such
a body is being established as we speak. We will provide, therefore,
that the notice must also specify any arrangements for the resolution
of challenges to tickets that are available by the independent body as
well as the organisation itself. I know that the Committee has genuine
concerns about the matter, but I assure hon. Members that the
provisions in the schedule for keeper liability will not be brought
into force until that body is established and is operating across the
country. This is the sort of light-touch regulation that the Government
do wish to promote.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000301">&#160;</a>

liable. Whether the driver is

am confused. From what the Minister has said, I understand that if
someone drives on to land that they should not be driving on to, there
will be a sign saying either, “You can’t park
here”, or “You can park here for 2 hours and after that
there is a £100 fine.” Where is that stated in the
schedule? I am struggling to find it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000303">&#160;</a>

membership of the accredited trade association, organisations must
abide by the association’s code of practice, which is strictly

is the mandatory code of practice that goes with membership of the BPA
that provides the essential self-regulation that makes unnecessary the
fully regulated system proposed by the Opposition and that some
commentators have called for. The provisions of the schedule are a way
of making the industry self-regulatory.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000312">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions of schedule 4 apply to those Crown vehicles that must be
registered at the DVLA, and to public servants who are the keepers of
such vehicles, but they do not apply to vehicles of the armed forces or
of visiting forces.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000313">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
schedule contains powers under which regulations or orders may be made
to amend the definition in the schedule of a “traffic
authority” and to change the circumstances under which keeper
liability applies. The power to make secondary legislation therefore
enables the Government to adjust the provisions if that should prove
necessary in the light of experience. I hope that the Committee will
agree to the schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="11042883000314">&#160;</a>
